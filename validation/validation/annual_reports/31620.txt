Chairman’s statement
Sanderson Group plc (‘Sanderson’ or 
‘the Group’), is a software and IT services 
business specialising in digital retail 
technology and enterprise software for 
businesses operating in the manufacturing, 
wholesale distribution and logistics sectors.
Financial results
The Group’s trading results for the year 
ended 30 September 2017 show revenue 
of £21.56 million (2016: £21.32 million) 
and operating profit of £3.90 million 
(2016: £3.69 million) after adjusting for 
the amortisation of acquisition-related 
intangibles, ‘one-off’ non-recurring items and 
share-based payment charges. The ‘one-off’ 
non-recurring items, totalling £0.49 million, 
include costs relating to potential acquisitions 
during the year, the consolidation of office 
premises with internal reorganisation, as 
well as the costs incurred in changing the 
Group Finance Director. Mitigating and 
offsetting these costs, was the receipt in full, 
of a licence fee from a former customer who 
had been disputing payment relating to their 
access of the Group’s software.
Overall, gross margin remains high at 82% 
(2016: 84%) and though slightly lower than 
the prior year, the continuing high gross 
margin reflects the continued emphasis 
and focus upon the supply of Sanderson 
proprietary software and services. Recurring 
revenue, which is revenue derived from pre-
contracted software licence fees and ongoing 
support services, increased to £11.18 million 
(2016: £10.75 million) representing 52% 
of total revenue in the period (2016: 
50%). Sales order intake grew by 12% to 
£13.69 million (2016: £12.26 million). The 
Group order book at 30 September 2017 
was £5.79 million (2016: £3.02 million) 
and includes a significant new order from 
an existing customer which is scheduled to 
be delivered over the course of the next two 
financial years.
Sanderson has a strong, cash-generative 
business model which has resulted in a 
cash balance at 30 September 2017 of 
£6.18 million (2016: £4.34 million), well 
ahead of market expectations. This balance 
is stated after the increased payment of 
£1.38 million (2016: £1.21 million) in 
dividends to shareholders during the year.
Dividend
The Group’s continuing strong cash 
generation enables the Board to maintain a 
progressive dividend policy whilst continuing 
to invest in the further development of the 
Group’s businesses. Subject to the approval 
of shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting, scheduled to be held at 11am on 
Thursday 15 February 2018, the Board is 
proposing an increase of 11% in the final 
dividend to 1.55 pence per ordinary share 
(2016: 1.4 pence). This makes the total 
dividend paid in the year of 2.65 pence per 
ordinary share and represents an increase of 
10% over the prior year (2016: 2.4 pence). 
The final dividend, if approved, will be 
paid on 16 March 2018, to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on 
2 March 2018.
Post period end event – 
Acquisition
On Friday 24 November, the Group 
announced the acquisition of Anisa 
Consolidated Holdings Limited for an 
enterprise value of £12 million.
Anisa specialises in the delivery of world-
class integrated supply chain and enterprise 
resource planning solutions and has around 
250 customers who are provided with 
twenty-four hour support on a worldwide 
basis throughout the year. Anisa employs 
over 90 staff and operates from office 
locations in London, Runcorn, Liverpool 
and Solihull within the UK and from smaller 
support operations in Singapore and 
Australia. Anisa complements the Enterprise 
Division of Sanderson and the enlarged, 
merged business is expected to provide and 
develop incremental and synergistic market 
opportunities. The managed services, hosting 
services and cloud delivery services which 
have been developed by Anisa represent 
an exciting and enhanced service delivery 
option for existing Sanderson customers.
Commenting on the acquisition, Group Chief 
Executive, Ian Newcombe, said:
“We are delighted to welcome the Anisa 
team, led by Ross Telford, David Renshaw 
and Lionel Moore, together with their Anisa 
colleagues to Sanderson and we are excited 
by the prospect of combining our two 
strong, well-positioned businesses and by 
the opportunities that will arise from working 
closely together in the future.”
The Group's continuing 
strong cash generation 
enables the Board to 
maintain a progressive 
dividend policy whilst 
continuing to invest in the 
further development of 
the Group's business.

Chairman’s statement  
continued
The acquisition of supply chain & ERP solutions specialist, Anisa, provides incremental opportunities
Anisa and Sanderson have known each other 
for many years and though this transaction 
is a Sanderson acquisition, it feels more like 
a merger. Whilst Anisa and Sanderson have 
rarely competed in their respective target 
markets, they are very complementary in 
terms of their ethos and business model - 
providing cost-effective solutions, supported 
by providing quality service to customers, 
thereby building and developing long-term 
relationships. The strategy of the combined 
business is to continue to develop the 
existing range of products and services 
delivered to existing customers; to further 
invest and develop the Anisa relationships 
with strategic partners and to provide 
additional investment in order to accelerate 
growth opportunities by attracting even more 
new customers. 
Our enlarged Group provides a great 
opportunity to further build shareholder 
returns and shareholder value and we value 
and appreciate the confidence shown by 
the Anisa team, in agreeing to hold their 
new Sanderson shares for at least a period 
of three years. We believe that our enlarged 
Group provides a great opportunity to further 
increase returns and value for Sanderson 
shareholders. 
Strategy
The strategy of the Board is to achieve 
sustained growth by continuing to build and 
to develop the Sanderson business. Whilst 
investment is planned across all of the 
Group’s businesses, particular emphasis will 
again be placed on enhancing the range of 
mobile and ecommerce solutions in Digital 
Retail, where digital transformation is an 
active market opportunity. Mobile-enabled 
solutions continue to be developed to 
address all of the Group’s target markets. 
The Group will further strengthen its 
proposition to customers in the Enterprise 
Division, especially in providing solutions 
for food and drink processing, as well as 
investing in the further development of 
products covering the logistics, fulfilment 
and supply chain areas. Sanderson has 
enjoyed considerable success, building a 
strong reputation over a number of years 
within the wholesale distribution market and 
further investment is planned, developing a 
new suite of digital based solutions.
In order to augment organic growth, selective 
complementary acquisitions are under 
continuous consideration. We are pleased 
that Anisa is now part of the Group and 
a number of potential opportunities have 
been and are being considered. Sanderson 
management endeavours to adopt a careful 
and measured approach to acquisition 
opportunities and cautiously considers any 
risks which might be involved. The Board 
remains focused upon further increasing 
shareholder value by continuing to deliver 
both organic and acquisitive growth, 
achieving ‘on target’ results, increasing 
earnings, thereby achieving strong cash 
generation and maintaining a robust balance 
sheet. This enables the Board to maintain 
progressive dividend returns to shareholders.
Management and staff
At 30 September 2017, Sanderson employed 
almost 230 staff, who have a high level of 
experience and specialist expertise in the 
market sectors in which the Group operates. 
Following the acquisition of Anisa, the 
Group now has over 300 employees. The 
commitment of staff is crucial to achieving 
further progress and on behalf of the Board, 
I would again like to express our appreciation 
and thank everyone for their hard work, 
support, dedication and contribution to the 
ongoing development of the Group.
Adrian Frost, who had served as Group 
Finance Director since 2005, left Sanderson 
in September and we wish Adrian every 
success with his new employer. Richard 
Mogg joined Sanderson as Group Finance 
Director in October from Capita, where 
latterly, he worked in the Capita Education 
Software Services business. Richard’s 
considerable commercial, financial and 
business experience will further enhance the 
management team and we are very much 
looking forward to working together over the 
years to come.

Group Chief Executive’s business review
More rapid growth 
available via Digital 
Retail and renewed 
impetus for growth from 
the Enterprise business 
is expected to enable 
the Group to meet its 
strategic targets.
Ian Newcombe
Group Chief Executive
The target market for Sanderson products 
and services primarily comprises of ‘SMEs’ 
(‘small and medium-sized enterprises’). The 
Group’s well-developed business model is 
to foster long-term customer relationships 
which result in a high proportion of sales 
arising from pre-contracted recurring 
revenue, complemented by incremental 
sales to its strong, well-established and 
growing customer base. This robust business 
stream usually accounts for around 50% 
of Group revenues. Sanderson proprietary 
software is developed in anticipation of 
technological developments and often in 
conjunction, collaboration and partnership 
with its large customer base. Sanderson 
proprietary software is marketed and sold 
under a ‘right to use’ licence with all sales, 
marketing, delivery, support and services 
being carried out by the Group’s own  
expert staff.
Group business solutions are developed 
and marketed in order to provide customers 
with ‘value for money’ IT systems, designed 
to offer cost effective, timely and tangible 
business benefits. These solutions 
typically enable customers to increase 
revenue whilst also achieving additional 
efficiencies by making and maintaining cost 
savings, both often within twelve months 
of implementation. Such robust and agile 
systems will be key to help customers remain 
competitive in challenging market times.
The Group continues to invest in the 
development of its software products and 
services, as well as in increasing its sales and 
marketing capacity and capability. Particular 
emphasis has been placed on the Group 
businesses specialising in the UK food and 
drink processing and wholesale distribution 
sectors, and especially, in the market for 
digital retail solutions with the continued 
development of mobile and ecommerce 
solutions. These solutions enable retailers 
to capitalise on the significant growth 
opportunities arising from the widespread 
adoption of smartphones and tablets and 
to exploit ‘mobile’ as a sales channel that 
is becoming fully integrated with existing 
business systems.
At the core of the Group’s well-developed 
business model is Sanderson proprietary 
software with both on-premise, as well as, 
cloud-based solutions being offered to 
customers on an ongoing annual contractual 
basis, together with the accompanying 
consultancy, support and maintenance 
services. In the year ended 30 September 
2017, these pre-contracted recurring 
revenues amounted to £11.18 million 
(2016: £10.75 million) representing 52% 
of total revenues (2016: 50%). The gross 
margin from recurring revenues covered 
67% of total Group overheads in the financial 
year (2016: 63%). 
Reflecting both prior and continuing 
investment in the Group’s sales and 
marketing function, Sanderson continued 
to achieve a significantly improved level 
of order intake during the year, up 12% to 
£13.69 million compared with £12.26 million 
in the prior year. During the year, thirteen 
new customers contributed orders to the 
value of £1.60 million (2016: 22 new 
customers generated orders to the value of 
£3.83 million). The financial year ending 
30 September 2016 had been exceptional 
in terms of new sales orders from new 
customers. New customer orders for the 
financial year ending 30 September 2017 
are ‘in line’ with the longer term, four-year 
average. The development of opportunities 
from new customers and prospects remains 
a key focus for the business.
Review of Digital Retail
Sanderson provides comprehensive IT 
solutions to businesses operating in the 
ecommerce, mobile commerce and retail 
sectors of the UK. Mobile solutions, in-store 
technology and the ‘digital experience’ 
continue to be key business drivers in this 
very active and rapidly developing market.
The Digital Retail Division, which works 
with leading retailers such as JD Sports 
and Superdry, continued to make good 
progress, achieving double digit revenue 
growth of 13.8% to £7.28 million (2016: 
£6.40 million). Operating profits grew 
by a third to £1.18 million (adjusted 
for amortisation of acquisition-related 
intangibles, share-based payment charges 
and one-off non-recurring items) (2016: 
£0.89 million). The Group continues to 
invest in product innovation and delivery 
capacity in order to address this rapidly 
expanding market. The leadership team was 
further strengthened during the year and 
the business undertook a consolidation to a 
single location in order to generate additional 
efficiencies going forward.
We previously reported that a large new retail 
customer had been gained towards the end 
of the financial year ended 30 September 
2016. This was the very highly rated home 
entertainment retailer, Richer Sounds, 
confirmed by the ‘Which?’ organisation as 
the ‘Best High Street Shop 2017’. With 
a high level of effort and teamwork, both 
from the excellent Richer Sounds team,

Group Chief Executive’s business review  
continued
Digital Retail is continuing to experience increased levels of sales activity
as well as from our own support team, 
the Sanderson solution was successfully 
installed and implemented, ‘on time’ and 
‘on budget’, during the financial year ending 
30 September 2017. Large orders from 
existing customers included Axminster Tool 
Centre Limited, The Savile Row Company 
and QUIZ plc.
Digital Retail is continuing to experience 
increased levels of sales activity. A significant 
order was received from an existing 
customer which is scheduled to be delivered 
over the course of the next two financial 
years. In addition, following receipt of an 
initial order worth over £200,000 from a 
leading global fashion brand, a large pilot 
scheme is now underway with this  
new customer.
The year-end order book was £3.99 million 
(2016: £0.92 million) and included the 
large order, to be delivered over the next two 
years, which is mentioned above. With a 
number of developing sales prospects, active 
pilot projects and strengthening partnerships 
with existing customers, the Digital Retail 
business is well-positioned to take advantage 
of the growth in this market.
Review of Enterprise 
The Enterprise Division of Sanderson 
comprises two market-focused businesses 
which operate in the manufacturing and 
in the wholesale, distribution and logistics 
sectors. The Enterprise Division has 
achieved a solid trading performance. 
Sales prospects are good but sales cycles 
have been protracted with the timing of the 
receipt of sales orders, as ever, being critical 
to business performance. We have not yet 
perceived any market effect which might 
be caused by any uncertainty relating to 
Brexit. A restructure and strengthening of 
management took place across the Division 
and this should improve the prospects for the 
Group’s Enterprise businesses in the future. 
Divisional revenue was £14.28 million (2016: 
£14.92 million) following an exceptional 
performance in the prior financial year. 
Operating profit (adjusted for amortisation 
of acquisition-related intangibles, share-
based payment charges and one-off non-
recurring items) was £2.71 million (2016: 
£2.80 million). The Group continues to invest 
in product development and in its sales and 
marketing capability. The Enterprise Division 
optimised delivery during the year, reflected 
in the order book which, at the financial 
year-end, was valued at £1.81 million (2016: 
£2.10 million). 
Enterprise – Manufacturing
Businesses in the engineering, plastics, 
aerospace, electronics, print (‘general 
manufacturing’) and food and drink 
processing sectors, represent the main 
areas of specialisation for Sanderson in 
manufacturing markets. The Group’s 
manufacturing business is very much driven 
by activity in the food and drink industry, 
with the Sanderson business addressing 
this sector, outperforming market growth. 
Traceability of ingredients through the 
supply chain and compliance with the latest 
regulatory standards are key requirements 
for food and drink businesses and are strong 
features of the Group’s solution. Overall, 
the manufacturing business gained six new 
customers during the year (2016: seven), 
including Tomlinson’s Dairies and Ragus 
Sugars Limited, with large orders from 
existing customers including The Burger 
Manufacturing Company Limited.

Enterprise – Wholesale 
Distribution and Logistics
Sanderson activities in wholesale distribution 
and logistics are now extended into the 
specialist warehousing, logistics and 
supply chain markets which augment the 
solutions provided to the wholesale, cash 
and carry and fulfilment sectors. Six new 
customers were gained during the year, at 
an average initial order value of £89,000 
(2016: £160,000) and this compares with 
thirteen new customers in the prior year. 
Across the Division, sales prospects are 
strong and ahead of this time last year. A 
large order gained in the prior financial 
year, was successfully delivered during 
the period to DPD, one of the UK’s leading 
delivery and distribution businesses. 
Major sales orders were gained from a 
number of existing customers including 
Tottenham Hotspur Football Club and the 
Kitwave Wholesale Group. During the year, 
the Group has invested in some post-
acquisition restructuring and has built a 
new management team in the specialist 
warehousing and logistics business. 
Improved levels of growth and profit are  
now anticipated. 
Following the theme of increased digital 
transformation in the retail market, the 
Sanderson business operating in the 
wholesale distribution and cash and carry 
sector, has further invested in software 
development, recently launching a new suite 
of digital solutions which further capitalise 
on the growing use of mobile devices. 
Product innovation, together with the Group’s 
track record in the wholesale industry, 
positions the business well for further 
growth in the coming financial year ending 
30 September 2018.
Outlook
The Board has an ongoing business plan 
which is to accelerate the Group’s growth 
and development both organically as well 
as by making selective acquisitions in 
order to further increase profitability and 
dividends, thereby enhancing shareholder 
value. The acquisition of Anisa is the result 
of considerable work from both the Anisa 
and Sanderson management teams and 
provides the Group with an enlarged and 
stronger platform from which to operate. 
Further acquisitions are being considered 
and developed.
The Board will continue to invest in its 
digital retail solutions and in its enterprise 
software businesses in order to ensure that 
product offerings continue to both attract 
new customers, as well as to maximise and 
to encourage additional investment in system 
enhancements and new technological 
developments from existing customers. The 
combination of more rapid growth available 
via the Digital Retail Division and renewed 
impetus for growth from the Enterprise 
business, is expected to enable the Group to 
meet its strategic targets over the course of 
the coming years. 
Whilst the Group has not yet detected any 
major loss of confidence from either existing 
or prospective customers, the Board and 
senior management continue to carefully 
monitor market conditions, customer 
confidence, as well as the development of 
sales prospects and the progression of these 
sales prospects into customers.
Sanderson has maintained a strong balance 
sheet, resulting from a robust business 
model which is built upon long-term 
customer relationships, thereby generating 
strong recurring revenues. The Board 
believes that the Group, which now includes 
the Anisa business, is well positioned in its 
target markets. A healthy order book and 
good sales prospects provide the Board 
with a good level of confidence that, at this 
relatively early stage of the new financial 
year, the Group will make further progress 
and deliver trading results which are, at 
least, in line with market expectations for the 
year ending 30 September 2018.

Creating seamless shopping
The Internet and mobile technology have 
changed the way people shop. Keeping 
the customer happy used to be relatively 
straightforward but today’s new tech-savvy 
shopper has high expectations.
Digital retail is the application of new and

shopping experience and give customers 
what they want, when and where they want it.
Online shopping is easy and convenient. 
Open 24/7, the customer can shop 
anywhere, anytime. Internet retailers can 
offer great discounts, flash sales, and use 
the data they hold to market to customers, 
personalise communication and meet needs 
at the right time. But there remains a place 
for the High Street; consumers still love to 
browse and the majority of retail sales are 
still store-based. What’s key for retailers is to 
bridge the gap between online and in-store 
and offer the seamless, joined-up shopping 
experience their customers now demand.
Retailers who fail to provide their customers 
with a fully connected shopping journey 
risk missing out on huge sales opportunities 
and the chance to create a retail experience 
where shoppers want to spend time and 
money. Those who do bridge the gap 
and utilise in-store technology, such as 
transactional kiosks and assisted-selling 
iPads, can sell beyond what is simply ‘on the 
shelf’. They can showcase their entire range, 
upsell, avoid lost sales by allowing customers 
to order out-of-stock items for next day 
delivery, or use home delivery so customers 
don’t have to carry heavy bags around.
Similarly, online retailers can provide 
‘joined-up’ shopping. For example, offering 
click & collect, giving shoppers the option 
to complete a transaction started online 
in-store, or returning an item to a convenient 
location.

market. Technology is having a major

Enterprise - Manufacturing
Burger Manufacturing 
Company have invested 
in Sanderson food ERP 
technology to power their 
new £4 million factory. 
The cloud-based software 
will improve productivity 
across the company's 
operations.
ERP solutions boosting 
efficiency and profit
Sanderson has been helping UK 
manufacturers succeed with IT for over 30 
years, delivering proven software and long-
term value. Our latest business systems, ERP 
(Enterprise Resource Planning) software 
and cloud-based solutions, support many 
sectors and types of manufacturing and are 
specifically developed for the markets they 
address - discrete manufacturing, food and 
drink processing, print and distribution.
Designed for modern manufacturing, our 
software helps manufacturers improve 
processes, manage the supply chain and 
provide excellent customer service. Whilst 
our range of Green IT and Factory and 
Warehouse Automation solutions improve 
efficiency in manufacturing and bring many 
cost saving benefits to customers.
Specialist software for food 
and drink processing
Our specialist ERP software is the software 
of  choice for the UK’s fast-growing food and 
beverage processors.
Most other ERP suppliers try to serve 
multiple industries, leaving food and drink 
manufacturers with gaps they have to fill 
with add-on systems. Not so Sanderson 
with its purpose-designed solution which 
allows processors to manage their recipes, 
production, supply chain and new product 
development along with sales, finance, 
regulatory compliance, traceability and 
reporting. Just some of the reasons why 
well-known food and drink manufacturers 
nationwide choose Sanderson.
Strong position in the UK's largest manufacturing sector
Fuelled by growing food sales and new 
product development as consumer 
tastes and shopping habits change, food 
and drink processors are investing in 
technology to run their businesses more 
efficiently and manage the complexities 
of their tightly regulated industry.
Whilst some manufacturing sectors 
are more volatile and susceptible to 
economic uncertainty, the UK food 
sector has remained relatively recession 
proof. Although the industry is facing 
enormous cost pressures, particularly 
after the EU referendum, there are 
efficiency gains and cost savings to be 
had from implementing new systems and 
Sanderson is well positioned to deliver 
them.

Digital solutions providing 
growth for wholesalers 
The wholesale distribution sector is a vital 
sector, linking manufacturers with all types of 
food and non-food retailers and foodservice 
businesses.
As the retail arena has developed 
sophisticated methods to attract sales, 
offer more shopping channels and retain 
customers with higher levels of service 
and increased convenience, so the use of 
technology and data is picking up pace in 
the wholesale industry. 
Wholesale businesses are reappraising the 
way their customers want to buy from them, 
and the use of technology is instrumental in 
achieving success in this area. It’s paying off; 
with double digit growth being reported for 
wholesalers adopting technology according 
to IGD, the global food and grocery experts.
In light of this move to embrace new 
technology, Sanderson has invested in 
product development and is first to launch, 
in the wholesale market, an innovative suite 
of digital solutions to drive wholesalers' future 
growth and prosperity.
Industry-specific software for 
wholesale distribution
Sanderson has been supplying wholesale-
specific solutions to the market for more than 
20 years and our innovative software is a 
key element of the continued success being 
achieved by over 120 wholesale businesses 
across the UK and Republic of Ireland.
We combine extensive knowledge of the 
industry with innovative IT solutions to 
increase sales, profitability and control for 
our wholesale customers. Our solutions 
support wholesalers’ financial and 
operational needs, delivering significant cost 
savings, improved efficiency, a fast return on 
investment, and business growth.
Increased IT in logistics
The logistics and fulfilment sector employs 
one in twelve people in the UK and 
contributes £1 trillion to the economy. 
Fuelled by an increase in delivery options, 
together with a rise in orders due to 
mobile and online ordering, logistics is 
fast becoming 'the new retail'. Technology 
is driving competitive advantage as retail 
activity shifts from shop to warehouse, with 
growth in fulfilment centres rather than 
stores. 75% of operators in the sector expect 
increased capex in IT to drive efficiency and 
productivity according to the UK Logistics 
Confidence Index. 
Intelligent fulfilment and 
warehouse management
For any fulfilment or logistics business, it 
is important to develop a service to satisfy 
customers’ delivery expectations, plan 
appropriate flexibility to meet seasonal 
peaks, and ensure sophisticated returns 
management. Sanderson fulfilment and 
logistics solutions enable all of this and more.
Sanderson is a proven supplier of fulfilment, 
logistics and warehouse management 
systems which cover the entire supply 
chain. From procurement to warehouse 
management, and from forecasting to 
logistics, our solutions automate operations 
and manage the smooth and fast fulfilment 
of omni-channel sales orders.
We nurture long-term partnerships with 
businesses that seek to continually improve 
their performance through the intelligent use 
of technology, people and processes. During 
the year, we successfully implemented a 
major new system at DPD, one of the UK's 
leading delivery and distribution businesses. 
The post period-end acquisition of integrated 
supply chain and ERP solutions provider, 
Anisa, will enlarge and complement the 
Group. The merged business is expected to 
provide additional, synergistic opportunities.

Strategic report
Richard Mogg
Finance Director
Following further invest-
ment in management 
and a year of excellent 
cash generation, the 
Group is well positioned 
to deliver future growth, 
both organic and 
acquisitive.
Trading results
The Group’s strategy is to achieve growth 
by continuing to build upon and to further 
develop the Group’s businesses operating 
within the digital retail and enterprise 
software markets. Organic growth will 
be augmented by earnings-enhancing 
acquisitions that can be identified as 
complementing the Group’s existing 
operations, whilst retaining a strong balance 
sheet.
Revenue increased by 1% to £21.56 million 
(2016: £21.32 million) following an 
exceptional sales year in 2016, compared 
with prior years. Whilst the Group continues 
to operate in competitive markets, the 
Board remains confident of future growth in 
our chosen markets, particularly in Digital 
Retail, having seen 13.8% revenue growth 
in 2017. As such, the Group continues 
to invest to ensure solutions offered to 
customers are modern and functionally 
rich, whilst also ensuring the Sanderson 
profile remains prominent in the Group’s 
chosen markets. Operating profit (stated 
before the amortisation of acquisition-
related intangibles, share-based payment 
charges and one-off non-recurring items) 
increased by 5.7% to £3.90 million (2016: 
£3.69 million) in a year where the Group has 
made senior management changes in two 
businesses to better position them for future 
growth, whilst also investing considerable 
time and expense in the year to progress the 
acquisition of Anisa Consolidated Holdings 
Limited (which has subsequently completed 
in November 2017). The Group also incurred 
costs associated with replacing the Group 
Finance Director. Consequently, reflecting 
the additional cost incurred in relation to 
these items, unadjusted profit from operating 
activities is £2.88 million (2016: £3.03 
million). A more detailed review of the 
financial year is provided in the Chairman’s 
statement and Group Chief Executive’s 
business review.
Statement of financial position
The Sanderson Board remains committed 
to pursuing a growth strategy based 
upon a conservative financing policy, the 
cornerstone of which is a strong balance 
sheet. The Group has an established history 
of converting substantially all of its profit 
to cash. At 30 September 2017, after the 
payment of £83,000 deferred consideration 
in respect of acquired businesses, the Group 
has no debt and a net cash balance of 
£6.18 million (2016: £4.34 million).
The Group continues to invest in product 
development to ensure the solutions 
marketed by Sanderson remain modern and 
competitive, whilst at the same time adopting 
a conservative accounting policy in respect 
of the treatment of such development 
expenditure that ensures a significant 
proportion of the annual development 
spend is expensed in line with revenues 
generated. During the year expenditure 
totalling £3.21 million (2016: £2.99 million) 
was incurred, of which £2.21 million 
(2016: £2.11 million) was expensed against 
operating profit.
Treasury
The Group manages its treasury function as 
part of the central finance department. Whilst 
substantially all of the Group’s operations 
are UK-based, approximately £900,000 of 
revenue was denominated in euros rather 
than sterling and an equivalent balancing 
value of purchases were denominated in US 
dollars. Consequently, these trading flows 
have successfully acted as a natural hedge 
against adverse exchange movements during 
the year ended 30 September 2017. Whilst 
currency markets are expected to remain 
volatile for the foreseeable future, the Group 
will continue to review its strategy in this 
area. At 30 September 2017, cash balances 
were £6.18 million, of which approximately 
£270,000 was held in euros, £200,000 in 
USD and £100,000 in ZAR. The Board has 
reviewed the Group’s medium-term strategy 
and believes that key strategic developments 
are achievable whilst retaining a strong 
balance sheet.

Key performance indicators (‘KPIs’)
The following KPIs are some of the tools used by management to monitor the performance 
of the operating businesses within the Group, in addition to the more traditional income 
statement, statement of financial position and cash flow analysis reviewed at regular Board 
meetings.
Indicator 2017 2016
Revenue per employee £95,000 £92,000
Operating profit as a percentage of revenue 13.4% 14.2%
Operating profit* as a percentage of revenue 18.1% 17.3%
Order intake £13.69m £12.26m
Debtors more than 30 days overdue as percentage of total debtors 6.2% 10.5%
Dividend cover 2.38 2.29
* stated before amortisation of acquisition-related intangibles, share-based payment charges and one-off non-re-
curring costs
Revenue per employee is used as a broad 
measure of efficiency. The Group has set a 
target of £100,000 for revenue per employee 
and has continued to make good progress 
towards this target during the year.
Operating profit (stated before the 
amortisation of acquisition-related 
intangibles, share-based payment charges 
and one-off non-recurring items) as a 
percentage of revenue has predominantly 
increased due to lower sales costs and 
greater efficiency arising from internal 
restructuring during the year. Whereas, as 
a result of the additional costs incurred in 
delivering some of the one-off non-recurring 
initiatives, operating profit as a percentage 
of revenue has decreased. Revenue 
and operating profit have increased by 
approximately 1% and 6% respectively. 
This indicator, together with the revenue per 
employee measure, are useful in assessing 
efficiency levels within the business. The 
Board, however, remains conscious of 
the need to invest in technical, sales and 
marketing and management in order to 
protect and enhance the longer term 
prospects for the business.
The regular monitoring of order intake 
is an important indicator of likely trading 
performance in the short-term as well as 
providing an indication as to confidence 
levels within the customer community. Whilst 
the figures presented above show annual 
order intake, management monitors this 
measure on a monthly basis. The measure 
is monitored in conjunction with the value 
of the order book as a strong order book 
enables the Group to continue to trade 
profitably when a temporary downturn 
in order intake is experienced. Order 
intake increased by 12% in the year to 30 
September 2017, including a larger order 
in the Digital Retail Division to be delivered 
during the next two years. With over 12% of 
the order intake derived from new customers 
contracting with Sanderson for the first time, 
the Board believes this demonstrates that the 
Group continues to be well positioned in its 
target markets.
Following the progress made in 2016, there 
has been a further marked improvement 
in overdue debt levels during the course of 
2017, resulting in what is now considered 
to be a far more satisfactory profile of aged 
debt for the Group. These improvements 
have largely arisen from maintaining a stable 
and strong credit control function through 
the year with high levels of accountability for 
debt levels in each division. 
Dividend cover compares adjusted diluted 
earnings per share to the dividend per share 
declared for the financial year, which is 
subject to approval at the Annual General 
Meeting due to be held on 15 February 
2018. The Board intends to pursue a 
progressive dividend policy as trading 
results continue to improve. The dividend 
cover measure provides an indication as to 
the proportion of overall earnings paid as 
dividends.
Principal risks and 
uncertainties
Risk management is an important part of the 
management process throughout the Group. 
Regular reviews are undertaken to assess 
the nature of risks faced, the magnitude of 
the risk presented to business performance 
and the manner in which the risk may be 
mitigated. Where controls are in place, their 
adequacy is regularly monitored.
The Group continues to invest in 
product development to ensure its 
solutions remain competitive

The risks considered to be particularly important at the current time are set out below:
Risk category Potential impact Mitigation 
Economic As a supplier to the digital retail and enterprise software 
markets, a downturn in the economic climate affecting 
these sectors may lead to a reduced spend on IT systems 
and services by customers and prospective customers. 
In addition, the uncertainty surrounding Brexit may lead 
to further slow down in customer decision-making and 
increased costs.
The Group strives to offer solutions that provide a demonstrable 
return on investment for both existing as well as new customers, 
as a strategy to capture more of our customers’ budgeted IT 
spend. Forward-looking indicators such as order intake are 
regularly reviewed to identify potential deterioration in market 
conditions.
Product 
development
The Group operates in dynamic markets and must ensure 
the solutions it offers remain competitive. Failure to do 
so may lead to a loss of business with customers and 
prospective customers obtaining more relevant solutions 
from elsewhere. 
Sanderson regularly discusses business requirements with 
customers and prospective customers. Approximately 75% of 
product development is in response to specific requirements, 
ensuring new product offerings accurately reflect the needs of 
the markets served. 
People An experienced and knowledgeable workforce is required 
to develop technically complex products and to deliver 
the services required to enable customers to deploy 
Sanderson solutions in their businesses. The market for 
skilled staff remains competitive and a failure to recruit 
and retain experienced staff could impact on the Group’s 
ability to develop and deliver solutions.
Providing existing staff with relevant training and career 
progression opportunities is a key priority for the business. 
Recruiting and developing new employees, when required, is 
undertaken by experienced staff to ensure the correct calibre 
of individual is identified. The Group also offers share options 
to senior members of staff, to mitigate the risk of key personnel 
leaving.
Project delivery Significant revenue is generated from projects that require 
the delivery of software and services over extended 
timescales. Project failure could result in contracts being 
cancelled, impacting on profitability and cash collection.
Established procedures are used in the delivery and 
management of projects. 
Financial Inaccurate financial information may result in sub-
optimal decisions being taken by management and staff. 
Inadequate internal controls may fail to prevent the Group 
suffering a financial loss.
The systems of internal control deployed within the Group are 
designed to prevent financial loss. Controls are strongest in 
areas where management considers the potential exposure to 
the Group of material loss to be at its greatest, such as contract 
management and credit control. The adequacy and effectiveness 
of internal controls are reviewed by management.
Acquisition risk The Group will consider complementary and earnings-
enhancing acquisitions as part of its overall growth 
strategy. Acquisitions may not always realise the benefits 
expected at the time of completion.
A failure to successfully integrate acquisitions may impact 
on Group profitability.
Due diligence appropriate to the size and nature of the 
acquisition will be undertaken, and warranties and indemnities 
will be sought from vendors wherever possible. 
An integration plan will be formulated as part of the due diligence 
process and executed as rapidly as is appropriate to the nature of 
the business acquired.
Reputational The quality of references obtained from existing users of 
Sanderson software is an important part of the decision-
making process for a potential customer seeking to 
appoint Sanderson as a new supplier. Similarly, existing 
customers are more likely to extend the use of current 
solutions and purchase new products when they are 
confident solutions will be delivered on time and to 
budget. Poor performance or the provision of sub-
standard products may therefore result in customer 
disputes as well as a negative impact on solution sales.
Sanderson strives to maintain its reputation as a supplier of 
highly functional, value for money solutions. Quality control 
is an important part of the product development process and 
senior staff are involved in managing project delivery to ensure, 
wherever possible, solutions are delivered on time and to budget.

The Digital Retail Division 
achieved double-digit 
growth and the Group 
continues to invest in 
product innovation and

to address this rapidly 
expanding market. 
Investing in people
Our employees are one of our most 
significant assets. They have detailed 
knowledge not only of the IT industry but 
also of the markets in which we operate. This 
means they can develop, implement and 
support solutions which add real value to our 
customers’ businesses.
We continually invest in the technology 
skills and business know-how of our staff. 
Because we develop our own software, we 
offer outstanding opportunities to define 
the technology roadmap for our solutions. 
Our people are passionate about digital 
and emerging technologies in ecommerce 
and mobile, working at the cutting edge of

along with driving profitability and efficiency. 
Engaging with our community
The Sanderson marketing team re-engaged 
with local charity, Tiny Tim’s Children’s 
Centre, to deliver additional support to 
them in their 20th birthday year. Tiny 
Tim’s provides free treatments to children 
and young people with disabilities, health 
problems and special needs. They offer 
treatments either not available or limited on 
the NHS, or not affordable to families via the 
private sector. Care is the highest priority for 
staff at the Centre, so marketing often slips 
to the bottom of the pile, despite being so 
important for reaching eligible children as 
well as attracting donations.
Our marketing team spent time putting 
their skills to good use. They worked on 
social media marketing and promotional 
ideas to increase visitor numbers to the soft 
play area that raises valuable funds for the 
Centre, as well as a customer survey and PR 
to generate much needed publicity for the 
charity's work.

Governance statement
As the Company’s shares are traded on AIM, the Company has chosen not to fully comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the 
Code’) nor is it required to. However, the Company is committed to high standards of corporate governance and draws upon best practice 
available, including those aspects of the Code considered appropriate.
Board of directors
The Board is broadly balanced with three executive and two non-executive directors. All executive directors are subject to election by 
shareholders at the first opportunity after their appointment and to re-election at regular intervals thereafter.
The Board meets on a monthly basis and retains full and effective control of the Group. Additional meetings are arranged as appropriate 
to consider Group strategy, acquisition and disposal strategies, internal controls and risk analysis, and the annual budget. Day-to-day 
management of the Group is delegated to the executive directors and senior management team. 
Board committees
The Board has established three committees, each consisting of, as a minimum, the two non-executive directors. Each committee has defined 
terms of reference.
The Audit Committee is chaired by David Gutteridge, and meets at least twice a year with the executive directors and representatives of 
the external auditor in attendance. The Committee’s duties include the review of interim and preliminary announcements, compliance with 
accounting standards, consideration of the Annual Report and Accounts prior to submission to the Board for approval, the appointment and 
remuneration of the external auditor together with their scope of work and consideration of their findings, and the review of internal controls.
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by John Paterson, and is referred to below.
The Nominations Committee comprises the non-executive directors and Christopher Winn, and is responsible for making recommendations 
on the appointment of additional directors and for reviewing the composition of the Board and the Board committees. It is chaired by 
Christopher Winn.
Shareholder communication
The directors seek to visit institutional shareholders at least twice a year. In addition, all shareholders are welcome to attend the Annual 
General Meeting, where there is an opportunity to question the directors as part of the agenda, or more informally after the meeting. 
Communication with shareholders is seen as an important part of the Board’s responsibilities and care is taken to ensure that all price 
sensitive information is made available to all shareholders at the same time.
Funding 
At the financial year-end the Group reported cash balances of £6.18 million. The Group’s medium-term strategy is to maintain a strong 
balance sheet with positive cash balances. The Board believes strategic objectives regarding the development of existing businesses and 
complementary acquisitions are achievable whilst retaining a positive cash balance. The Group remains profitable and cash generative. 
Accordingly, the directors have prepared the accounts on a going concern basis.
Directors’ remuneration
The Company adheres to the principles of good governance when deciding remuneration strategy and has delegated responsibility for the 
remuneration policy to the Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Committee meets at least once a year and its broad responsibility 
is to ensure the remuneration packages of the executive directors and senior management are competitive and designed to attract, retain 
and motivate individuals of high quality. The Remuneration Committee is made up of the two non-executive directors and is chaired by John 
Paterson.
The policy of the Group on directors’ remuneration is to provide competitive packages that reward Group and individual performance. 
Remuneration packages comprise a basic salary, an annual performance-related bonus measured against targets set each year by the 
Remuneration Committee, pension contributions and other benefits. Where appropriate, participation in share incentive plans is also offered.

Internal control
The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining the Group’s system of internal controls. Control systems are designed to meet the 
particular needs of the Group and to address the risks to which the Group is exposed. By their nature, internal control systems are designed 
to manage rather than eliminate risk, and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The 
Board has adopted a policy of continuous improvement by regular review for assessing the adequacy of internal controls.

Research and development
The Group undertakes a continuous programme of development expenditure, both as part of a long-term development programme and in 
response to specific customer or market requirements. Development expenditure is capitalised only when the end product is technically and 
commercially feasible and when sufficient resource is available to complete the development. All other development expenditure, including 
projects on which revenue of an amount equal to or greater than the cost of development has been generated in the same period as that in 
which the cost is incurred, is recognised in the income statement as an expense.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the Directors’ report and the financial 
statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic report, Directors’ report, Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to 
prepare Group and parent company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (‘IFRS’). Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Company and the Group for the period. 
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRS have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; 
and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors confirm that:
• so far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is not aware; and
• the directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken as directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
Auditor
Grant Thornton UK LLP is willing to continue in office. In accordance with s489(4) of the Companies Act 2006 a resolution for their 
reappointment will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Independent auditor’s report to the  
members of Sanderson Group plc
Opinion
Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified.
We have audited the financial statements of Sanderson Group plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) for the year 
ended 30 September 2017 which comprise the Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the 
Consolidated and Company statements of financial position, the Consolidated and Company statements of changes in equity, the Consolidated 
and Company cash flow statements and Notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The 
financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied 
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 September 
2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.
Who we are reporting to
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:
• the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or
• the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about 
the Group’s or the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve 
months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Overview of our audit approach
• Overall materiality: £186,000 which represents 4.75% of Group’s profit before tax excluding net 
interest on defined benefit pension scheme deficit, share-based payment charge, amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets and one-off non-recurring costs.
• Key audit matters were identified as revenue recognition, impairment of intangible assets (goodwill) 
and valuation of defined benefit pension scheme for the Group.
• We performed full-scope procedures on United Kingdom based operations. We performed 
analytical procedures over Sanderson Australia pty.

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of 
the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. 
These matters included those that had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing 
the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in 
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key Audit Matter How the matter was addressed in the audit - Group
Risk 1- Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that economic 
benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can 
be reliably measured.
Revenue is a key driver of the business and judgement 
is involved in determining when contractual obligations 
have been performed and to the extent that the right to 
consideration has been earned. In cases where a single 
contractual arrangement involves the sale of licences, 
support, maintenance and services, judgement is 
also involved in allocating the consideration received 
to the components of the arrangements on a relative 
fair value basis. Therefore we identified revenue 
recognition (focusing on occurrence) as a significant 
risk, which was one of the most significant assessed 
risks of material misstatement. 
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
• walkthroughs of each significant class of revenue transactions and 
assessing the design effectiveness of key controls;
• testing a sample of recurring contracted revenue, which comprises the 
fair value of support and maintenance contracts, by agreeing revenue to 
contracted amounts;
• testing the related deferred income for selected recurring contracts, to 
confirm it is correctly stated at the balance sheet date;
• confirming, for a sample of non-recurring revenue items, including sale of 
licences, implementation of services and hardware, ensuring that the sale 
was made to a bona fide customer by agreeing the occurrence of the sale 
to proof of service;
• determining that a service has been provided or a sale has occurred in 
the financial year for revenue recorded through journal entries.
The Group’s accounting policy on revenue recognition is shown in note 3 and related 
disclosures are included in note 4. 
Key observations
Based on our audit work, we did not identify any evidence of material misstatement in 
the revenue recognised in the year to 30 September 2017.

Key Audit Matter How the matter was addressed in the audit - Group
Risk 2- Impairment of intangible 
assets 
The process for assessing whether an impairment 
exists under International Accounting Standard 
(IAS) 36 Impairment of assets is complex. Directors’ 
assessment of the value in use of the Group’s Cash 
Generating Units (CGUs) involves judgement about the 
future performance of the CGU and the discount rates 
applied to future cash flow forecasts.
Therefore, we identified impairment of intangible 
assets as a significant risk, which was one of the most 
significant assessed risks of material misstatement.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
• walkthroughs of management's process for assessing the impairment of 
intangible assets and assessing the design effectiveness of key controls;
• testing the methodology applied in the value in use calculation complies 
with the requirements of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets;
• testing the mathematical accuracy of management’s model;
• testing the key underlying assumptions for the financial year 2018 budget 
(FY18);
• challenging management on its cash flow forecast and the implied growth 
rates for FY18 and beyond, considering evidence available to support 
these assumptions;
• assessing the discount rates and long-term growth rates used in the 
forecast including comparison to economic and industry forecasts where 
appropriate;
• testing the sensitivity analysis performed by management in respect of the 
key assumptions such as discount and growth rates to ensure there was 
sufficient headroom in their calculation.
The Group’s accounting policy on intangibles is shown in note 3 and related disclosures 
are included in note 16. 
Key observations
Based on our audit work, we found that the assumptions made and estimates used 
in management’s assessment of goodwill impairment were balanced. Note 16 also 
appropriately discloses the assumptions used in arriving at the estimate. We found no 
errors in the calculations.
Risk 3- Valuation of defined benefit 
pension scheme
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme 
that provides benefits to a number of current and 
former employees. At 30 September 2017 the defined 
benefit pension schemes' net liability was £6.1 
million. The gross value of pension scheme assets and 
liabilities which form the net liability amount to £9.5 
million and £15.6 million respectively. 
The valuation of the pension liabilities and assets in 
accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits involves 
significant judgement and is subject to complex 
actuarial assumptions. Small variations in those 
actuarial assumptions can lead to a materially different 
defined benefit pension scheme asset or liability being 
recognised within the Group financial statements. 
Therefore, we identified the valuation of the defined 
benefit pension schemes as a significant risk, which 
was one of the most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
• walkthroughs of management's process for valuing the defined benefit 
pension scheme and assessing the design effectiveness of key controls;
• using an actuarial specialist to review the assumptions used, including 
discount rates, growth rates, mortality rates and the calculation methods 
employed in the calculation of the pension liability;
• testing the accuracy of underlying membership data used by the Group’s 
actuaries for the purpose of calculating the scheme liabilities by selecting 
a sample of employees and agreeing pertinent data such as date of birth, 
gender, date of membership to underlying records and testing a sample 
of net movements in that data since it was last formally prepared on 
1 April 2014;
• directly confirming the existence of pension scheme assets with external 
asset managers.
The Group’s accounting policy on the defined benefit pension scheme is shown in note 3 
and related disclosures are included in note 29.
Key observations
Based on our audit work, we found the valuation methodologies including the inherent 
actuarial assumptions to be balanced and consistent with the expectation of our actuarial 
specialists. We consider that the Group’s disclosures in note 29 appropriately describe 
the significant degree of inherent precision in the assumptions and estimates and the 
potential impact on future periods of revisions to these estimates. We found no errors in 
calculations.

Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality in determining the nature, timing and extent of our 
audit work and in evaluating the results of that work. 
Materiality was determined as follows:
Materiality Measure Group Parent
Financial statements  
as a whole
£186,000, which is 4.75% of Group profit 
before tax excluding net interest on defined 
benefit pension scheme deficit, share-based 
payment charge, amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets and one-off non-recurring 
costs. This benchmark is considered the 
most appropriate because this is a key 
performance measure used by the Board 
of directors to report to investors on the 
financial performance of the Group. Adjusted 
profit before tax is also a consistent basis for 
determining materiality compared with the 
previous years.
Materiality for the current year is higher than 
the level that we determined for the year 
ended 30 September 2016 as a result of the 
increased adjusted profit before tax in the 
current year. 
£122,000, which is 0.5% of parent company 
total assets. This benchmark is considered 
the most appropriate because this is a key 
performance measure used by the Board of 
directors to report to investors on the financial 
performance of the Company whose principal 
activity is that of an investment holding 
company.
Materiality for the current year is consistent 
with the level that we determined for the year 
ended 30 September 2016. 
Performance materiality  
used to drive the extent  
of our testing
Based on our risk assessment, including 
the Group’s overall control environment, we 
determined a performance materiality of 75% 
of the financial statement materiality. This is 
consistent with performance materiality in the 
previous year.

An overview of the scope of our audit
Our audit approach was a risk-based approach founded on a thorough understanding of the Group’s business, its environment and risk profile 
and in particular included:
The components of the Group were evaluated by the audit team based on a measure of materiality considering each as a percentage of total 
Group assets, liabilities, revenues and profit before taxes, to assess the significance of the component and to determine the planned audit 
response. In order to address the audit risks described above as identified during our planning procedures, we performed a full-scope audit 
of the financial statements of the parent company, Sanderson Group plc and of the Group’s operations throughout the United Kingdom. The 
operations that were subject to full-scope audit procedures made up 97.8 per cent of consolidated revenues and 97.1 per cent of total profit 
before tax. The remaining operations of the Group were subjected to analytical procedures over the balance sheet and income statements of 
the related entities with a focus on applicable risks identified above and the significance to the Group’s balances. 
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report set  
out on pages 3 to 20, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does 
not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required 
to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement in the other information.  
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement in this other information, we are required  
to report that fact. 
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report under the Companies Act 2006
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic report or the Directors’ report.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our 
opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Responsibilities of directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on pages 19 and 20, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud  
or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
forming part of the financial statements
1. Reporting entity
Sanderson Group plc is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of the Company’s registered office is Sanderson 
House, Manor Road, Coventry, CV1 2GF. The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2017 comprise the 
results of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings (together referred to as 'the Group'). The Group is primarily involved in the 
development and supply of IT software and services. The Company’s shares are traded on the Alternative Investment Market of the 
London Stock Exchange.
2. Basis of preparation
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union, and the Companies Act 2006 that applies to companies reporting under IFRS and 
IFRIC interpretations.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European 
Union. These parent company financial statements appear after the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Going concern
The Group financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account 
of the post balance sheet acquisition as set out in note 30 and reasonably possible changes in trading performance that may arise 
as a result of current economic conditions and other risks faced by the Group, show that the Group should remain profitable and 
cash generative. At the financial year-end the Group reported cash balances of £6.18 million. The Group’s medium-term strategy is 
to maintain a strong balance sheet with positive cash balances. The Board believes strategic objectives regarding the development of 
existing businesses and complementary acquisitions are achievable whilst retaining a strong balance sheet. 
Basis of measurement
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of certain items which are 
measured at fair value as disclosed in the accounting policies below.
Functional and presentation currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the functional currency of the Group.
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised. Information about significant areas of estimation and critical judgements that 
have the most significant impact on the financial statements are described in the following notes:

Estimates
Note 16:  Measurement of intangible assets: In testing for impairment of intangible assets, management has made certain 
assumptions concerning the future development of the business that are consistent with the annual budget and business 
plan. Should these assumptions regarding the growth in profitability be unfounded then it is possible that intangible assets 
included in the statement of financial position could be impaired. Management is confident that this will not be the case. 
The Group has a history of retaining customers, with the average length of customer relationships in excess of ten years. 
The time and resources required by organisations to change enterprise systems is significant and therefore discourages 
change. Management therefore believes the existing business will continue to generate revenues, profits and positive cash 
flows for many years. Accordingly, when assessing the recoverable value attributable to goodwill and other intangible assets, 
management has estimated cash flows attributable to existing businesses and extrapolated forward budgets for the financial 
year ending 30 September 2018 in line with the average length of customer relationships. The calculations involve the 
use of a discount rate when measuring the present value of future cash flows. The discount rate is a further estimate. The 
results of this review are disclosed in note 16.
Note 18: Measurement of intangible assets relating to acquisitions: In attributing value to intangible assets arising on acquisition, 
management has made certain assumptions in terms of cash flows attributable to intellectual property and customer 
relationships. The key assumptions relate to the trading performance of the acquired business and discount rates applied 
to calculate the present value of future cash flows. The directors consider the resulting valuations to be reasonable 
approximations as to the value of the intangibles acquired.
Note 20: Measurement of trade receivables: Management assesses the likely recoverability of amounts invoiced to customers on 
the basis of the creditworthiness of customers and the age of debts at the period end. The directors consider the carrying 
amount of trade receivables approximates to their fair value. 
Note 29: Measurement of defined benefit pension obligations: The Group’s interests in a defined benefit pension scheme have 
been accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits. The main area of judgement is the valuation of pension 
scheme liabilities, which represent the net present value of future pension obligations. These calculations are performed by 
the scheme actuary, with whom the directors have agreed the underlying assumptions to be applied. The key assumptions 
are rates of increases in pension benefits, mortality rates, inflation and the discount rate applied to produce the net present 
value. The discount rate is derived from market rates on AA corporate bonds at the year-end date. 
Judgements
Note 9: One-off non-recurring items: Management use judgement in its assessment and classification of certain costs as one-off 
non-recurring items, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to better assess trends in financial performance.
Note 16: Intangible assets: Development expenditure is recognised on the statement of financial position when certain criteria 
are met, as described more fully in the accounting policy on the treatment of research and development expenditure. 
Management uses its judgement in assessing development projects against the criteria.
Note 19: Deferred tax: The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognised is based on an assessment of the probability of the 
Group’s future taxable income against which the deferred tax assets can be utilised. In addition, significant judgement is 
required in assessing the impact of any legal or economic limits or uncertainties.

3. Accounting policies
New and revised accounting standards applied for the first time in the current year
The Group has adopted the following new standards, or new provisions of amended standards:
• Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions (Amendments to IAS 19) 
• Annual Improvements to IFRS 2010-2012 Cycle
There has been no material impact on either amounts reported or disclosure in the financial statements arising from first time adoption.
Adopted IFRS not yet applied
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards 
have been published by the IASB but are not yet effective and have not been applied early by the Group. Management anticipates that 
the following pronouncements relevant to the Group’s operations will be adopted in the Group’s accounting policies for the first period 
beginning after the effective date of the pronouncement, once adopted by the EU:
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (not yet adopted by the EU, effective 1 January 2018) 
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective 1 January 2018)
• IFRS 16 Leases (not yet adopted by the EU, effective 1 January 2019)
• Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses (Amendments to IAS 12) (not yet adopted by the EU)
• Classification and Measurement of Share-Based Payment Transactions (Amendments to IFRS 2) (not yet adopted by the EU)
• Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to IAS 7 (not yet adopted by the EU)
Other than in respect of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16, the directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future 
periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group. With regard to IFRS 15 and IFRS 16, the Group has 
commenced an assessment of the impact likely from adopting the standard, but is not yet in a position to state whether the impact will 
be material to the Group’s reported results or financial position. 
Certain other new standards and interpretations have been issued but are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s 
financial statements. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial information comprises a consolidation of the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings at the 
statement of financial position date. The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the financial year are included from the date 
of acquisition. Control is achieved where the Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee 
and has the ability to affect those returns through its powers over the investee. 
All intra-group balances and transactions including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated fully on 
consolidation.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is held at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment less the estimated residual value on a straight-line basis 
over the expected useful economic life of the assets concerned. Estimated residual values are revised annually.
The annual rates used are:
• leasehold improvements - over life of the property leases, which vary between 3 and 50 years
• plant and equipment - 20%-33

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, demand deposits and bank overdrafts where they form an integral part of the 
Group’s cash management. Cash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments rather than for 
investment or other purposes.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. The only equity instrument 
applicable to the Group is its issued share capital.
Share premium includes any premium received on the issue of share capital. Transaction costs associated with the issuing of shares are 
deducted from share premium, net of any related tax benefits. Retained earnings includes all current and prior period retained profits 
and losses.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year-end date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. 
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are 
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates 
ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
Investments
Trade investments are measured at cost less provision for impairment as the directors consider that fair value cannot be reliably 
measured for the reasons set out in note 17.
In the Group’s financial statements, all assets, liabilities and transactions of Group entities with a functional currency other than sterling 
are translated into sterling upon consolidation. Assets and liabilities (including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition) 
are translated into sterling at the closing rate. Income and expenditure is translated at an average rate. Exchange differences are 
charged or credited to other comprehensive income and recognised in the currency translation reserve in equity. 
Accounting for financial assets
The Group has financial assets in the following categories:
• loans and receivables
• available for sale financial assets
Financial assets are assigned to the different categories on initial recognition, depending on the characteristics of the instrument and 
its purpose. A financial instrument’s category is relevant for the way it is measured and whether any resulting income and expense is 
recognised in the income statement or statement of other comprehensive income. All financial assets are recognised when the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets other than those categorised as at fair value through 
profit or loss are recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Financial assets categorised as at fair value through profit or loss are 
recognised initially at fair value with transaction costs expensed through the income statement.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
After initial recognition these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Any 
change in their value is recognised in profit or loss. Sanderson Group plc’s trade and other receivables fall into this category of financial 
instruments. 
Significant receivables are considered for impairment on a case-by-case basis when they are past due at the year-end date or when 
objective evidence is received that a specific counterparty will default. All other receivables are reviewed for impairment in groups, 
which are determined by reference to the industry and region of a counterparty and other available features of shared credit risk 
characteristics, if any. The percentage of the write-down is then based on recent historical counterparty default rates for each identified 
group.
Available for sale (‘AFS’) financial assets
AFS financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that do not qualify for inclusion in any of the other categories of financial assets. 
The Group’s AFS financial assets comprise listed securities and are measured at fair value. Gains and losses are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and reported within the AFS reserve within equity, except dividend income which is recognised in profit or loss.

The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables which, subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, are measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Conditional deferred consideration (contingent consideration) is classified as 
fair value through profit and loss. Movements subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are recognised in the Consolidated income 
statement.
Pension benefits
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes and a subsidiary company is the principal employer to a closed defined 
benefit scheme. The Group’s net obligation in respect of the defined benefit scheme is calculated by estimating the amount of future 
benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value 
and the fair value of any scheme assets is deducted. The liability is calculated using the projected unit method. The discount rate is 
based on the annualised yield on AA credit-related corporate bonds. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary.
Net interest expense on the net defined benefit liability is included in finance costs. Gains or losses resulting from remeasurement of the 
net defined benefit liability are included in other comprehensive income. 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated income 
statement as incurred.
Revenue
Revenue comprises the fair value of sales of licences, support and maintenance contracts, training, consulting and implementation 
services and hardware. Value added tax and transactions between Group companies are excluded.
Revenues are recognised on the basis of the performance of contractual obligations and to the extent that the right to consideration has 
been earned. In cases where a single contractual arrangement involves the sale of licences, support, maintenance and services, the 
consideration received is allocated to the components of the arrangement on a relative fair value basis.
Initial licence fees are recognised upon the provision of software to the customer, providing that payment terms are contractually 
binding, collection is reasonably certain and there are no material contract conditions or warranties. If any conditionality exists, licence 
fees are recognised when the conditions have been met. Revenue from the provision of professional services including support, 
maintenance, training and consultancy services is recognised as the services are performed. Hardware sales are recognised on delivery. 
Annual licence, maintenance and support revenues are recognised evenly over the period to which they relate. When amounts are 
invoiced in advance, the unearned element remains in deferred income until recognition is appropriate. 
Segmental reporting
IFRS 8 requires the identification of operating segments on the basis of internal reports that are regularly reviewed by the Group’s chief 
operating decision maker (‘CODM’). The CODM has been determined to be the executive directors.
The Group has two main operating divisions: Digital Retail and Enterprise. These two divisions represent the Group’s reportable 
segments under IFRS 8. Each segment has a manager who is directly accountable to the CODM.
Each segment is managed separately as the characteristics of the markets served differ. All inter-segment transfers take place on an 
arm’s-length basis. Accounting policies used for reporting the results of segments are the same as those adopted in preparing the 
financial statements of the Group. The activities of, and products and services offered by, the segments are described in the Group Chief 
Executive’s business review.
The Group operates a number of bank accounts including certain accounts specific to shared operations. Whilst information contained 
in the income statement can be allocated between divisions, certain items in the statement of financial position, such as cash balances, 
cannot be so allocated. For this reason, the cash and cash equivalents figure shown in note 4 to the financial statements does not 
correspond with the cash and cash equivalents figure of the Group disclosed in the Consolidated statement of financial position. Bank 
balances in respect of shared operations are included in unallocated assets and liabilities.
Dividends
Dividends are recorded in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which they are approved or paid.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses is capitalised as an asset and represents the excess of the fair value 
of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Identifiable net assets are those which are 
capable of being sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those legal rights are separable. Where contingent 
consideration arises on acquisition as a result of performance targets it is recognised at fair value, being the weighted average probability 
of potential outcomes. At each year-end the fair value is recalculated and gains or losses arising are recognised in the Consolidated 
income statement. The carrying value of goodwill relating to subsidiaries disposed of is deducted from sale proceeds in arriving at 
reported profit or loss on disposal. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.

Research and development expenditure
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s development activity is recognised in the Consolidated statement of 
financial position if all of the following conditions are met:
• an asset is created that can be identified (such as software and new processes);
• the Group intends to complete the development of the asset and has the ability to do so;
• the Group has the technical and financial resources to complete the asset and exploit the economic benefits arising from it; 
• it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and
• the development cost of the asset can be reliably measured.
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic life, typically between three and five years. Where no 
internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it 
is incurred.
Leases
Assets financed by leasing arrangements, which give rights approximating to ownership, are treated as if they had been purchased 
outright and are capitalised and depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the assets and the period of the leases. The 
capital element of future rentals is treated as a liability and the interest element is charged against profits in proportion to the balances 
outstanding. All other leases are operating leases and rental costs are charged against profits on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets separately purchased, such as intellectual property rights, are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis 
over their useful economic life. Intangible assets acquired through a business combination are measured at fair value and amortised 
over their useful economic lives. 
The following periods are used when assessing useful economic lives for purposes of calculating amortisation charges:
Intellectual property rights 3-10 years
Customer relationships  3-10 years
Impairment
The carrying amount of the Group’s assets, other than inventories, deferred tax assets and available for sale financial assets (see 
accounting policies above), is reviewed at each year-end date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such 
indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated income statement. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased 
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for 
the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately. Impairment 
losses in respect of goodwill cannot be reversed.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to cash-generating units (group of units) and then, to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets of the unit (group of 
units) on a pro rata basis. 
Share-based payments
The equity-settled share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the ultimate parent company; these awards are 
granted by the ultimate parent. The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in 
equity. The fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes model at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees 
become unconditionally entitled to the options. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of share options 
expected to vest. Deferred taxation is recognised over the vesting period. Payments made to employees on cancellation of an equity-
settled award are accounted for as a repurchase of an equity interest and deducted from equity. Any excess of the payment over the 
fair value of the award calculated at the date of cancellation is treated as an expense. On exercise, shares are issued and the nominal 
value of each share is credited to share capital. The difference between the exercise price paid and the nominal value of each share is 
credited to share premium. The exercise of options issued pursuant to the Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan gives rise to a charge 
against reserves equal to the market price per share at the date of exercise.

3. Accounting policies continued
Taxation
Tax expense recognised in profit or loss comprises the sum of deferred tax and current tax not recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity. Current income tax assets and liabilities comprise those obligations to, or claims from, fiscal authorities 
relating to the current or prior reporting periods that remain unpaid at the reporting date. Current tax is payable on taxable profit, which 
differs from profit or loss in the financial statements. Calculation of current tax is based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities and their tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill or on the initial recognition of an 
asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting profit. Deferred tax on temporary 
differences associated with investments in subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by 
the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated, 
without discounting, at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided those rates are enacted or 
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the underlying tax loss or deductible temporary difference will be 
able to be utilised against future taxable income. This is assessed based on the Group’s forecast of future operating results, adjusted for 
significant non-taxable income and expenses and specific limits on the use of any unused tax loss or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are 
always provided for in full, deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when the Group has a right and intention to set off current tax 
assets and liabilities from the same taxation authority. Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax 
income or expense in profit or loss, except where they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity, in which case the related deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or equity, respectively. Deferred tax is 
calculated on the basis of rates and laws enacted or substantially enacted.
One-off non-recurring items
The Group discloses non-recurring items in a separate note (note 9) being those material items of income and expense which, because 
of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to better 
understand the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to better assess 
trends in financial performance.
4. Segmental reporting
The Group is managed as two separate divisions, providing IT solutions and associated services to the digital retail and enterprise 
software sectors. The information provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’) is analysed between the divisions as follows:

The CODM uses both gross profit and operating profit measures in assessing the performance of the Group’s divisions. The largest 
customer of the Digital Retail Division accounted for 46% (2016: 41%) of divisional revenue. No other customer accounts for 10% or 
more of the revenue of either division.
Revenue amounting to £874,000 (2016: £705,000) was derived from customers domiciled in Eire. Substantially all other revenue is 
generated within the UK.

5. Related parties
The Group’s related parties are its key management personnel and the Sanderson Group Retirement Benefit Scheme (the ‘Scheme’), a 
legacy defined benefit pension scheme that closed to new members in 1995 and to future accrual in 2004.
The defined benefit plan does not hold shares in Sanderson Group plc. The Group provides payroll services to facilitate the payment of 
pensions to retired members of the Scheme and accounting services to the Scheme trustee for the preparation of the Scheme accounts. 
Certain of the Group’s employees act as directors of the corporate trustee of the Scheme. No charge is made for these services. The 
Group’s only transactions with the Scheme relate to contributions paid to the plan as set out in note 29 and administrative expenses 
incurred by the Scheme that are charged to the employer and expensed by the Group as incurred. 
Key management personnel of the Group comprises the executive directors, members of the senior management team and the non-
executive directors, a total of 11 individuals. Remuneration paid to key management personnel during the year is set out in note 8.

Fair value assumptions of share-based payments
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted. 
The estimate of fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes model. Details of the fair value of share options granted in the period, 
together with the assumptions used in determining the fair value, are summarised below: 
2017 2016
Weighted average share price at date of grant (pence) 72.0 70.5
Weighted average exercise price (pence) 72.0 70.5
Weighted average contractual life (years) 3 10
Weighted average expected volatility 6.0% 6.0%
Weighted average expected dividend yield 2.6% 3.0%
Weighted average risk free interest rate 2.3% 2.3%
Weighted average fair value of options granted (pence) 2.0 2.0
The volatility assumption, measured at the standard deviation of expected share price movements, is based on a statistical analysis of 
historic movements over a three-year period ending on the date of grant.

dividend payment will amount to £853,595. The directors will receive a proportion of this dividend by virtue of their shareholdings in the 
Company, details of which are disclosed in the Directors’ report.

14. Earnings per share
Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the result after tax for the year by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares at the end of the year and the diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares at the end of the year respectively. In 
order to better demonstrate the performance of the Group, an adjusted earnings per share calculation has been presented below which 
adds back items typically adjusted for by users of the accounts. During the year a third party specialist firm has been engaged to review 
the Group’s qualifying expenditure with regard to R&D tax credits. As a result of this engagement, the Group has benefitted from a prior 
year's tax charge adjustment in respect of these R&D claims and basic earnings per share is therefore higher.
The calculations for earnings and the number of shares relevant to all of the measures of earnings per share described in the foregoing 
are set out below:

Amortisation and impairment
Intangible assets other than goodwill are amortised over their useful economic lives. In the case of intellectual property and customer 
relationships, the useful economic life is assessed by reference to the anticipated minimum period over which the asset is expected 
to remain separately identifiable and cash generative. This is typically between five and ten years. Intellectual property and customer 
relationship assets have between two and nine years’ unamortised economic life. In the case of development costs, amortisation is 
charged over the period during which the development is expected to generate revenue.

Goodwill, analysed by reference to cash-generating units, is set out below:
2017

£000
Digital Retail 3,330 3,330
Enterprise Software 22,574 22,574
Goodwill 25,904 25,904
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if an event occurs to warrant a review. The recoverable amounts 
attributed to each CGU are based on value in use calculations. The key assumptions made in undertaking the value in use calculations 
involve estimating operating profit growth rates and are set out below. Budgeted profit and cash flow forecasts for the financial year 
ending 30 September 2018 have been extrapolated for periods of between ten and twelve years (based on the average length of 
customer relationship) and used as the basis of the calculations.
Digital Retail CGU: 3-8% operating profit growth from operating in a market exhibiting growth rates in excess of this figure. Based on 
independent estimates of industry-specific growth rates where available and previous experience where not. Independent estimates 
suggest the retail software economy is likely to grow by more than 10% per annum in the short to medium term.
Enterprise Software CGU: 2-3% operating profit growth based on management estimates of achievable growth through greater market 
share. The recent introduction of new products specifically developed by the Group for the target markets in which Sanderson operates 
is expected to enable the growth assumptions to be met. 
Discount rate assumptions are based on management estimates of the internal cost of capital likely to apply over the expected useful 
economic life of the goodwill and management’s view of the risk associated with each CGU. A discount rate of 8% has been applied to 
the Enterprise Software CGU, whereas 10% has been applied to the Digital Retail CGU.
The directors have formulated profit and cash flow forecasts for the financial year ending 30 September 2018 on the basis of the growth 
rates set out above. The value in use of the goodwill of the Digital Retail CGU exceeds the carrying value by £10.88 million. The value in 
use of the goodwill of the Enterprise Software CGU exceeds the carrying value by £9.02 million. In the event that economic conditions 
worsen and growth in revenue and gross margin is not achievable, the directors are of the view that judicious management of the 
Group’s cost base will enable the profit growth targets to be achieved. The directors have sensitised the profit and cash flow forecast 
relating to both CGUs. The Digital Retail CGU profit forecast would need to fall by 70% to trigger an impairment charge. In the case of 
the Enterprise Software CGU, a profit reduction of 30% would be required.

Investment 150 –
150 –
This investment represents a 2% interest in the ordinary share capital of a start-up business in a similar industry. The investment is 
stated at cost as the shares do not have a quoted market price on an active market and the directors consider that a fair value cannot be 
reliably measured.
18. Acquisitions 
Current year 
The Group did not complete any acquisitions during the year ended 30 September 2017. However, the Group did complete the 
acquisition of Anisa Consolidated Holdings Limited on 23 November 2017 and more information is disclosed in note 30. The Board 
remains keen to enhance the strength of the Group by selective complementary acquisitions. Management will continue to adopt a 
careful and measured approach to acquisitions with the priority being very much focused on continuing to deliver shareholder value. 
Costs incurred in respect of the due diligence process have been shown in the Consolidated income statement as acquisition-related 
costs.

A deferred tax asset of £360,000 (2016: £557,000) in respect of tax losses has not been recognised, as its future economic benefit 
is uncertain. The gross value of losses in respect of which the unrecognised deferred tax asset relates is £2.12 million (2016: 
£3.09 million).
The rate of UK corporation tax changed during the financial year ending 30 September 2017 resulting in a change to the rate at which 
deferred tax assets could be utilised. This reduced the charge to the income statement by £66,000 (2016: £52,000).

Trade receivables 3,831 5,197
Prepayments and accrued income 1,308 1,835

All trade and other receivables are short term. The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade receivables approximates to their 
fair value. All trade and other receivables have been reviewed for indications of impairment.
The Group invoices all pre-contracted recurring revenues up to six weeks before the renewal date. Payment terms require the invoices to 
be paid by the renewal date. Such invoices are only shown as overdue when the invoice remains outstanding after the renewal date has 
passed. Unless specific agreement has been reached with individual customers, all other invoices are due 30 days after the date of the 
invoice. The Group’s terms and conditions of sale permit the Group to charge interest, at 4% above bank base rates, on all invoices that 
remain unpaid 30 days after their due date. 
Due to the nature of the Group’s trade, certain customers may delay payment until project-related milestones have been met. Payment 
terms are not contingent on milestones being met, but an assessment as to the remaining work required to be done and the potential 
loss of customer goodwill arising from enforcement of contractual payment terms may take place when considering actions to be taken 
to secure payment. The Group has a good record in respect of invoiced amounts proving difficult to recover and does not ordinarily write 
off amounts due. 
Of the total trade receivables shown above, £459,000 (2016: £1,163,000) are past due but not impaired. An analysis of these trade 
receivables is set out below:

Reconciliation of movements in capital and reserves
Movements in capital and reserves are set out in the Consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The accumulated amount of current and deferred tax relating to items that are charged or credited directly to equity is a credit of 
£864,000 (2016: a credit of £1,277,000).
The following capital and reserves accounts are maintained by the Company: 
Called up share capital: Represents the nominal value of shares that have been issued.
Share premium: Includes any premiums received on issue of share capital. Any transaction costs associated with the issuing of shares 
are deducted from share premium.
Profit and loss account: Includes all current and prior period retained profits and losses.
Foreign exchange reserve: Comprises all current and prior period foreign exchange gains and losses recognised on consolidation of a 
foreign subsidiary.
Available for sale reserve: Represents all current and prior period fair value gains and losses on the revaluation of available for sale 
assets recognised.
26. Financial instruments disclosure
Capital risk management 
Capital management objectives are to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide a return to shareholders 
by adopting a progressive dividend policy.
The capital structure of the Group currently consists of cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, 
comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Consolidated statement of changes in equity. The Group’s 
Audit Committee reviews the capital structure as part of its risk analysis. As part of this review, the Committee considers the cost of 
capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. 
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements, other than the minimum capital requirements and duties regarding 
serious reduction of capital, as imposed by the Companies Act 2006 on all public limited companies.
Categories of financial assets and financial liabilities
The Group held the following categories of financial instruments:
2017
£000
2016
£000
Financial assets
Cash and cash equivalents 6,176 4,344
Loans and receivables (including trade and other receivables) at amortised cost 3,831 5,197

Financial liabilities at amortised cost
Trade payables, accruals and customer deposits 2,219 2,912
Unconditional deferred consideration 13 85
2,232 2,997
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss
Conditional deferred consideration 11 185
The fair value of the financial instruments set out above is not materially different to the book value.
Market risk management
The Group is exposed to price risk in respect of its investment in the listed equity securities of an unrelated company whose shares are 
traded on the London Stock Exchange. For the listed equity securities, an average volatility of 9% has been observed since the year end 
to November 2017. The volatility figure is considered to be a suitable basis for estimating how profit or loss and equity would have been 
affected by changes in market risk that were reasonably possible at the reporting date. If the quoted stock price for these securities 
increased or decreased by that amount, other comprehensive income and equity would have changed by £17,550. The listed securities 
are classified as available for sale (‘AFS’) assets; therefore, no effect on profit or loss would have occurred.

The investments in listed equity securities are considered strategic investments. In accordance with the Group’s policies, no specific 
hedging activities are undertaken in relation to these investments. The investments are continuously monitored and voting rights arising 
from these equity instruments are utilised in the Group’s favour.
Liquidity risk management
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and by continuously monitoring both forecast as well as actual 
cash flows to enable matching of the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Sufficient cash is retained to service short-term 
financing needs.
The following is an analysis of the contractual undiscounted cash flows payable under financial liabilities. The table includes principal 
only cash flows in respect of trade and other payables and gross amounts payable as deferred consideration.

Interest rate sensitivity analysis
At the year-end date there was no material exposure to movements in interest rates as the Group reported a cash balance in excess of 
£6.18 million. 
Other financial assets and liabilities
The financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of financial position are measured in accordance with the 
fair value hierarchy. This hierarchy groups financial assets and liabilities into three levels based on the significance of inputs used in 
measuring the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The level within which the financial asset or liability is classified is determined based on the lowest level of significant input to the 
fair value measurement. The financial assets measured at fair value in the statement of financial position at 30 September 2017 are 
available for sale financial assets which are in Level 1 and valued as set out in note 21. 
The financial liability measured at fair value in the statement of financial position at 30 September 2017 is deferred consideration which 
is in Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of deferred consideration relates to the acquisitions completed in prior years and is 
estimated using a present value technique. Fair value is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows at 8%. The cash flows 
of consideration payable before discounting are £0.02 million and reflect management’s estimates of consideration that will become 
payable in the future. The discount rate is based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. The effects on the fair value of risk and 
uncertainty in the future cash flows are dealt with by adjusting the estimated cash flows rather than adjusting the discount rate. Should 
any of the acquired businesses not achieve its performance targets then the estimated future cash flows may be reduced.

Foreign currency risk management
The Group has minimal exposure to currency risk. At 30 September 2017, cash balances were £6.18 million, of which approximately 
£270,000 was held in euros, £200,000 in USD and £100,000 in ZAR. 
Credit risk management
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. Credit risk is managed by monitoring the aggregate amount and 
duration of exposure to any one customer depending upon their credit rating. The amounts presented in the statement of financial 
position are net of allowances for doubtful debts, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience and their assessment 
of the current economic environment. The Group has an excellent history in terms of the level of trade receivables written off as 
irrecoverable.
The credit risk on liquid funds is minimised because the counterparties are UK banks with high credit ratings assigned by international 
credit-rating agencies.
Management of other risks
The Group’s policies on interest rate and liquidity risk are described above. 
27. Contingent liabilities
Each company within the Group has guaranteed the bank facilities of its fellow subsidiary companies. Bank facilities available to each 
subsidiary are secured by fixed and floating charges over the whole of the Group’s property, assets and undertakings. At 30 September 
2017 the Group held net cash balances of £6.18 million. 
28. Commitments
Capital commitments, approved by the Board and existing at 30 September 2017, amounted to £nil (2016: £nil).

29. Pension schemes
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The pension cost charge for the year relating to this scheme was £709,000 
(2016: £696,000). 
A wholly owned subsidiary undertaking, Sanderson Limited, contributes to one defined benefit pension scheme. The scheme is now 
funded solely by employer contributions as it is closed to future accrual and as a result has no contributing members. Benefits are paid 
to members by reference to their length of service and final pensionable salary on the date the scheme closed to future accrual. The 
latest actuarial valuation of the scheme, as at 1 April 2014, showed the scheme to have a deficit of £3.70 million. The valuation was 
performed by the scheme actuary, who is independent of the Group. The valuation is based on the projected unit method. 
The scheme falls within the statutory funding framework under the requirements of which the scheme must meet the statutory funding 
objective to have sufficient and appropriate assets to cover its technical provisions. Technical provisions are an estimate based on 
actuarial principles, of the assets needed to cover the scheme liabilities. Liabilities include pensions in payment, benefits payable to the 
spouses or dependants of deceased members and benefits accrued by members yet to reach their prescribed retirement age, which will 
be payable in the future. Technical provisions are calculated using an accrued benefits funding method and assumptions chosen by the 
trustees, after taking the actuary’s advice and obtaining the employer’s agreement. 
The defined benefit pension scheme is a separate legal entity from the Sanderson Group and is independently responsible for managing 
the assets and liabilities of the scheme. The scheme trustee is required by the scheme’s trust deed to act in the best interests of the 
members of the scheme. Certain of the Group’s employees act as directors of the corporate trustee of the scheme. The scheme exposes 
the Group to actuarial risks such as:
Projection risk: IAS 19 does not require a full actuarial valuation each period end. The results of the 1 April 2014 actuarial valuation have 
therefore been projected forward to 30 September 2017. By its nature such a projection involves a degree of estimation. 
Investment mismatch risk: The discount rate used to calculate the defined benefit obligation under IAS 19 should reflect the yield 
available on a high quality corporate bond. The actual investment strategy adopted by the trustee is not to be fully invested in corporate 
bonds, which means movements in the scheme’s assets may not correspond to movements in the value of liabilities as measured under 
IAS 19.
Longevity risk: If pensions are not bought out and members live longer than expected, the benefits will be payable for longer than 
allowed for in the calculation of the liabilities leading to an experience loss on the plan liabilities. Conversely, should members not live as 
long as expected, an experience gain may arise.
Benefit risk: In calculating the liabilities the Company must make a number of assumptions about the way the scheme’s benefits will 
increase over time, such as the impact of inflation. If the increase in benefits does not follow the assumptions made, there is a risk that 
an experience gain or loss may arise. 
Equalisation risk: The Department for Work and Pensions has taken legal advice on GMP equalisation and is currently considering 
options for implementation. There is a risk that additional benefits payable to members may arise as a result of implementation. 
Solvency risk: The IAS 19 liabilities are calculated on an ongoing basis, which assumes the sponsoring employer remains solvent and 
the scheme remains in existence. Should the sponsoring employer no longer be in a position to support the scheme, the scheme would 
commence winding up and benefits may have to be bought out with an insurance company. The cost of this action is likely to exceed 
the value of liabilities as calculated under IAS 19. 
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the IAS 19 valuation were as follows:
2017 2016
Inflation – RPI 3.3% 3.1%
Inflation – CPI 2.5% 2.3%
Pension revaluation in deferment 3.3% 3.1%
Pension escalation in payment* 0.0-5.0% 0.0-5.0%
Discount rate 2.9% 2.3%
* Different categories of member within the scheme are entitled to different rates of escalation. 
Mortality tables PMA08 and PFA08 have been used in arriving at the 2017 valuation. The valuation applies the CMI 2016 projection 
model with a long-term improvement of at least 1% for both males and females. The 2016 valuation used the same mortality tables 
and applied the CMI 2014 projection model with long cohort improvements of at least 1% for both males and females. A male member 
retiring at 30 September 2017 is assumed to have a life expectancy of 22.8 years (2016: 22.8 years), a female member 25.2 years 
(2016: 25.2 years). A male member retiring in 20 years is assumed to have a life expectancy from their retirement date of 24.1 years 
(2016: 24.1 years) and a female member 26.6 years (2016: 26.6 years).

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 30 September 2017 was 20 years. 
Total committed contributions to the defined benefit scheme for the financial year ending 30 September 2018 amount to £360,000 in 
respect of agreed monthly contributions.
The results of the IAS 19 valuation at 30 September 2017 are sensitive to the assumptions adopted. The sensitivities regarding the 
principal assumptions used to measure the scheme liabilities are set out below:
Assumption Change in assumption Change in liabilities
Discount rate Decrease by 0.5% Increase by 10.4% 
Rate of inflation Increase by 0.5% Increase by 10.0%
Life expectancy Increase by 1.0% Increase by 0.01%
The above analysis is based on a change in an assumption whilst holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to 
occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial 
assumptions has been estimated, based on the average age and the normal retirement age of members and the duration of the liabilities 
of the scheme.

30. Post balance sheet event
On 23 November 2017 the Group acquired control of Anisa Consolidated Holdings Limited by purchasing the entire issued ordinary 
share capital (and thereby 100% of the voting rights), for an enterprise value of £12.0 million. The purchase consideration for the 
acquisition comprises an initial £3.39 million, made up of approximately £2.06 million in cash which is being financed from existing 
Sanderson cash resources and by the issue of 1,894,217 new Sanderson 10p ordinary shares valued at 70p, which are subject to a 
lock-in period of three years. Further consideration of £1.82 million is payable to Anisa share option holders to be satisfied by cash or 
new Sanderson shares (also subject to a lock-in period of three years) at a price of 70p by 31 December 2017, dependent on the choice 
of the option holder. Sanderson is also taking over Anisa’s utilised five-year repayable term debt facility (final quarterly repayment being 
due in 2020) of £4.12 million as well as a current account positive cash balance of just over £1 million. Furthermore, loan notes with 
a coupon of 5% to the value of £1.05 million will be repaid by October 2018. Deferred consideration, totalling £1.63 million is payable 
in three tranches. The first payment of £563,000 is payable in April 2018 and the second payment for the same amount, payable in 
October 2018; both tranches are unconditional. A third and final deferred payment of up to £500,000 is scheduled for April 2019, 
dependent upon some pre-agreed trading performance criteria. 
The business specialises in the delivery of world-class integrated supply chain and enterprise resource planning solutions and has 
around 250 customers who are provided with twenty-four hour support on a worldwide basis throughout the year. Anisa employs over 90 
staff and operates from office locations in London, Runcorn, Liverpool and Solihull within the UK and from smaller support operations 
in Singapore and Australia. Anisa complements the Enterprise Division of Sanderson and the enlarged, merged business is expected 
to provide and develop incremental and synergistic market opportunities. The managed services, hosting services and cloud delivery 
services which have been developed by Anisa represent an exciting and enhanced service delivery option for existing Sanderson 
customers.
The initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete due to the close proximity of the acquisition date to the date of signing 
these accounts. Certain disclosure requirements including the following therefore cannot be made at this stage:
• Fair value of assets and liabilities acquired at acquisition date
• Goodwill to be recognised on acquisition
• Acquisition-related costs
• The revenue and profit of the combined entity for the current reporting period as though the acquisition date had been as of the 
beginning of the annual reporting period.

Notes to the Company financial statements
31. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
As used in the financial statements and related notes, the term 'Company' refers to Sanderson Group plc. The separate financial 
statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements of the Company have been 
prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Reporting Financial Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the 
European Union. For the purposes of the financial statements of the Company, the date of transition to IFRS was 1 October 2010.
A separate income statement dealing with the results of the Company only has not been presented, as permitted by Section 408 of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Basis of measurement
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of certain items which are 
measured at fair value as disclosed in the accounting policies below.
Functional and presentation currency
The financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company.
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised. Information about significant areas of estimation and critical judgements that 
have the most significant impact on the financial statements are described in the following notes:
Estimates
Note 38: Measurement of intercompany receivables: Management assesses the likely recoverability of intercompany receivables 
based on the performance of the Group companies that the balance is held with. 
Judgements
Note 37: Deferred tax: The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognised is based on an assessment of the probability of the 
Group’s future taxable income against which the deferred tax assets can be utilised. In addition, significant judgement is 
required in assessing the impact of any legal or economic limits or uncertainties. 
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provision for impairment where necessary to reduce book value to 
recoverable amount. Investment income is recognised on a receivable basis.
Share-based payments
The equity-based share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company. 
The fair value of options to purchase shares in the Company that have been issued to employees of subsidiary companies is recognised 
as an additional cost of investment by the parent company. An equal amount is credited to a share-based payments reserve. 
Taxation
The current tax charge is based on the profit for the year and is measured at the amounts expected to be paid based on the tax rates 
and laws substantively enacted by the year-end date. Current and deferred tax is recognised in the profit and loss account for the year 
except to the extent that it is attributable to a gain or loss that is or has been recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive 
income.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the year-end date where 
transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or receive more, 
tax. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider it is more likely than not that there will be suitable 
taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences can be deducted. Deferred tax is measured on an 
undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which temporary differences reverse.

Personnel expenses
The Company employed two non-executive directors during the course of the year (2016: three non-executives). John Paterson and 
David Gutteridge served throughout 2017. Philip Kelly resigned on 8 June 2016. Fees paid in respect of these appointments amounted 
to £70,000 (2016: £96,000). Details of the remuneration of executive directors, paid by subsidiary companies, is given in note 8 to the 
accounts. 
The Company employed the executive directors Christopher Winn and Ian Newcombe throughout the year. Adrian Frost resigned as 
Group Finance Director on 1 September 2017. Note 8 to the financial statements provides details of remuneration paid. 
Accounting for financial liabilities
The Company’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables which are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method.
Financial liabilities recorded at fair value through the income statement are initially recognised, net of issue costs, when the Company 
becomes a party to the contractual agreements of the instrument. All interest-related charges and, if applicable, changes in an 
instrument’s fair value that are reported in profit or loss are included in the income statement line ‘movement in fair value of derivative 
financial instrument’. 
Accounting for financial assets
The Company has financial assets in the following categories:
• loans and receivables
• available for sale (‘AFS’) financial assets
Financial assets are assigned to the different categories on initial recognition, depending on the characteristics of the instrument and 
its purpose. A financial instrument’s category is relevant for the way it is measured and whether any resulting income and expense is 
recognised in the income statement or statement of other comprehensive income. All financial assets are recognised when the Company 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets other than those categorised as at fair value through 
profit or loss are recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Financial assets categorised as at fair value through profit or loss are 
recognised initially at fair value with transaction costs expensed through the income statement.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
After initial recognition these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Any 
change in their value is recognised in profit or loss. Sanderson Group plc’s trade and most other receivables fall into this category of 
financial instruments. 
Significant receivables are considered for impairment on a case-by-case basis when they are past due at the year-end date or when 
objective evidence is received that a specific counterparty will default. All other receivables are reviewed for impairment in groups, 
which are determined by reference to the industry and region of a counterparty and other available features of shared credit risk 
characteristics, if any. The percentage of the write-down is then based on recent historical counterparty default rates for each identified 
group.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and bank overdrafts where they form an integral part of the 
Company’s cash management. Cash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments rather than for 
investment or other purposes.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. The only equity instrument 
applicable to the Company is its issued share capital.
Share premium includes any premium received on the issue of share capital. Transaction costs associated with the issuing of shares are 
deducted from share premium, net of any related tax benefits. Retained earnings includes all current and prior period retained profits 
and losses.

41. Financial instruments disclosure
Capital risk management 
Capital management objectives are to ensure the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide a return to 
shareholders.
The capital structure of the Company currently consists of cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders, 
comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Company statement of changes in equity. The Group’s 
Audit Committee reviews the capital structure as part of its risk analysis. As part of this review, the Committee considers the cost of 
capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. 
The Company is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements, other than the minimum capital requirements and duties 
regarding serious reduction of capital, as imposed by the Companies Act 2006 on all public limited companies. 
Categories of financial assets and financial liabilities
The Company held the following categories of financial instruments:
2017
£000
2016
£000
Financial assets
Cash and cash equivalents 602 720
Loans and receivables (including trade and other receivables) at amortised cost 4,848 5,093
Available for sale assets 187 209
Financial liabilities at amortised cost
Trade payables and accruals 5,787 3,752
The fair value of the financial instruments set out above is not materially different to the book value.
Market risk management
The Company is exposed to price risk in respect of its investment in the listed equity securities of an unrelated company whose shares 
are traded on the London Stock Exchange. For the listed equity securities, an average volatility of 9% has been observed since the year 
end to November 2017. The volatility figure is considered to be a suitable basis for estimating how profit or loss and equity would have 
been affected by changes in market risk that were reasonably possible at the reporting date. If the quoted stock price for these securities 
increased or decreased by that amount, other comprehensive income and equity would have changed by £17,550. The listed securities 
are classified as available for sale (‘AFS’) assets; therefore, no effect on profit or loss would have occurred.
The investments in listed equity securities are considered long-term, strategic investments. In accordance with the Company’s policies, 
no specific hedging activities are undertaken in relation to these investments. The investments are continuously monitored and voting 
rights arising from these equity instruments are utilised in the Company’s favour.
Liquidity risk management
The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and by continuously monitoring both forecast as well as 
actual cash flows to enable matching of the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Sufficient cash is retained to service short-
term financing needs.

Interest rate sensitivity analysis
At the year-end date there was no material exposure to movements in interest rates as the Company reported a cash balance of 
£0.60 million (2016: £0.72 million). 
Other financial assets and liabilities
The financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the statement of financial position in accordance with the fair value 
hierarchy. This hierarchy groups financial assets and liabilities into three levels based on the significance of inputs used in measuring 
the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The level within which the financial asset or liability is classified is determined based on the lowest level of significant input to the fair 
value measurement.
The financial assets measured at fair value in the statement of financial position at 30 September 2017 are available for sale financial 
assets which are in Level 1 and valued as set out in note 21. 
Foreign currency risk management
The Company has no material currency exposure. The Company’s financial instruments are denominated in sterling.
Credit risk management
The Company has no material credit risk exposure.
Management of other risks
The Company’s policies on interest rate and liquidity risk are described above.
