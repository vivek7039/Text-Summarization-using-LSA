Solid platform  
for the future
Overview 
I am pleased to report that the actions 
undertaken by management have 
enabled us to report substantially 
improved results; revenue and profits 
have increased, the hire fleet has been 
reduced, utilisation rates increased, and 
net debt
1
 has fallen significantly. The 
business has been stabilised and we have 
created a solid platform for the future.
Having previously identified the 
underlying issues that had affected 
the Group’s performance last year, 
management has improved engineering 
efficiency, addressed equipment 
availability, structured the sales force  
to ensure that we address large and SME 
customers alike, embedded ownership 
and accountability at a regional level, 
and invested in upgrades to our IT and 
management information systems; all 
of which have led to improved business 
performance.
Customer focussed initiatives were 
launched to improve responsiveness 
and service levels, including customer 
surveys, and these have also made 
a major contribution to our strong 
performance.
 “ 
I am pleased to report that the 
actions undertaken by management 
have enabled us to report 
substantially improved results.”

Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 05
Results overview
Revenue increased to £369.4m (2016: 
£329.1m), following actions to better 
address the SME market and improve  
non-hire revenues. Overhead costs have 
been tightly controlled with further 
savings realised during the year, partially 
offset by bonuses payable due to the 
good results. 
The hire fleet reduced by 11.4% to 
£194.8m as a result of targeted disposals 
and improved asset utilisation, whilst  
net debt
1
 fell significantly to £71.4m 
(2016: £102.6m). Return on capital 
employed
2
, a key measure, increased  
by 140.6% to 7.7%; excluding disposals 
ROCE
2
 was 8.4% (2016: 3.0%). The 
Group has a strong balance sheet, and 
substantial headroom with which to  
grow organically or through targeted 
value enhancing acquisitions in order  
to strengthen our market position.
Acquisition
On 19 December 2016 we announced 
the acquisition of the brand, business 
and assets of Lloyds British Testing 
Limited (‘Lloyds British’) from the 
Administrator, PwC. Lloyds British is a 
specialist business, which carries out 
testing, certification, and inspection 
of lifting equipment, and training from 
locations across the United Kingdom. 
The acquisition cost of £3.8m was paid in 
cash in full on completion; the business 
is now fully integrated and is enhancing 
Speedy’s overall offering in the specialist 
lifting market.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 0.67 pence per share, an 
increase of 67.5%. If approved at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting  
the total dividend for the year would be 
1.00 pence per share (2016: 0.70 pence). 
The dividend will be paid on 11 August 
2017 to shareholders on the register  
at close of business on 7 July 2017.
Board 
David Shearer joined the Board as a  
Non-Executive Director on 9 September 
2016 and was subsequently appointed  
to the Audit and Nomination Committees. 
On 31 March 2017 David was appointed 
to the Remuneration Committee. I 
reverted to Non-Executive Chairman on 
30 September 2016, and in accordance 
with best practice stepped down from 
both the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees on 31 March 2017. We have 
a strong Board, combining a wealth of 
industry and operational expertise with 
which to take the business forward.

The business has responded well to the 
actions undertaken, and I am pleased 
that the hard work by all our colleagues 
throughout the year has been reflected  
in these results.

CHIEF ExECut IvE’S REvIEW
Overview
I am pleased to report that our financial 
and operational performance has 
improved significantly this year. 
These results reflect the benefits 
which have been realised following 
implementation of the recovery plan that 
was put in place last financial year. The 
recovery plan is now complete and with 
the business stabilised, revenue growing, 
a lower cost and asset base, improved 
systems and management information, 
we have a strong platform for future 
profitable growth.
Results
Revenue increased by 12.2% to 
£369.4m (2016: £329.1m). During the 
year we have improved the customer 
experience, increased asset availability 
and restructured our sales activities. On 
a constant currency basis, and excluding 
the impact of planned disposals, revenue 
increased by 6.7%. In the second half of 
the year core hire revenue was stronger 
despite the disposal of hire assets and 
the consequent transfer of revenues to 
partnered services. Secondary revenues, 
including training and consumable sales, 
increased strongly.
Gross margins declined primarily as a 
result of the revenue mix, which included 
an increase in lower margin partnered 
services and disposal revenues as we 
optimised our hire fleet. Overhead 
costs were tightly controlled during the 
year, with the UK regional operations 
restructured into two divisions in order 
to increase efficiency and reduce costs. 
Adjusted profit before tax
 1
 increased 
by 224.0% to £16.2m (2016: £5.0m) 
benefitting from lower interest costs 
due to the lower net debt
 2
, and an 
improved performance from joint venture 
operations. Profit before tax was £14.4m 
(2016: loss £57.6m). The prior year result 
was affected by the write off of goodwill 
and exceptional costs. Adjusted earnings 
per share
 3
 increased to 2.44 pence  
(2016: 0.79 pence). 
We continue to focus 
on our customers’ 
experience
 “
t he recovery plan is now complete 
and with the business stabilised, 
revenue growing, a lower cost  
and asset base, improved systems  
and management information,  
we have a strong platform for future 
profitable growth.”

Strategy
Speedy provide safe and reliable hire 
equipment and services to enable the 
successful delivery of customer projects. 
Approximately 60% of our revenues 
are derived from products we own and 
hire out to customers. The remainder of 
our revenues come from our partnered 
services division, where we re-hire 
equipment from other providers in 
order to meet customer demand, and 
secondary revenues such as transport, 
consumables, fuel, inspection and 
training. Our customers range from large 
multinational corporations, with whom 
we have framework contracts, to local 
builders; during the year we traded with 
over 50,000 customers. 
We operate in a highly competitive and 
fragmented marketplace with a number  
of national, regional and local competitors. 
Our strategy is designed to differentiate 
us from the competition in the different 
customer segments in which we operate, 
principally through adopting a customer 
focussed approach designed to address 
our varying customers’ needs.
Our approach is to:
 > Provide first class customer experience, 
so that everything we do is focussed  
on the customer 
 > Put innovation at the heart of 
everything we do
 > Cultivate strong client relationships, 
that build loyalty for long term 
sustainable profitable growth
We have mapped out our customer 
journey in detail this year and are 
implementing action plans to improve our 
performance at all stages. In late 2016 we 
launched customer satisfaction surveys, 
by text and email, in order to obtain 
feedback on our performance directly 
from our customers. The results have 
provided us with valuable feedback on 
areas to improve. 
ROCE
 4
 has improved significantly this 
year to 7.7% (2016: 3.2%); excluding 
disposals ROCE
 4
 was 8.4% (2016: 3.0%). 
We will continue to drive this measure 
through optimising our hire fleet by 
only purchasing assets which provide 
the right return, and disposing of lower 
utilised assets or procuring these 
through our partnered services offering. 
We will invest in growing our non-hire 
revenues which are less capital intensive, 
including training, consumable sales 
and inspection, in order to fully utilise 
our existing fixed depot overhead. All 
overhead costs will continue to be tightly 
controlled.
We will review both organic and 
acquisitive opportunities in value 
enhancing areas in order to realise our 
strategic objectives. 
Capital allocation
The Board is committed to ensuring  
the efficient allocation of capital. 
We have significantly reduced our 
net debt
 2
 this year to £71.4m (2016: 
£102.6m), which includes the proceeds 
from the sale of heavy plant of £14.4m, 
and is after the acquisition of specialist 
lifting business Lloyds British for £3.8m. 
Net debt
 2
 to EBITDA
 1
 has reduced to 
1.13x (2016: 1.93x). This reduction 
is a result of improved controls over 
capital expenditure, disposals of under-
utilised assets and good working capital 
management. 
The Group has a strong balance sheet and 
substantial headroom under its banking 
facilities, which expire in September 
2019. With a clear strategy for sustainable 
profitable growth, the Board will regularly 
review organic growth opportunities, 
value enhancing acquisitions, and 
shareholder returns to ensure it operates 
with an efficient capital structure.

CHIEF ExECut IvE’S REvIEW CONTINUED
We have fully integrated the acquisition 
of Lloyds British into the business and 
have rationalised the number of Lloyds 
British depots, re-locating some into 
our existing network. We have already 
realised a number of further revenue 
and cost synergies. Lloyds British 
complements Speedy’s existing lifting, 
testing and training businesses and is 
enhancing Speedy’s overall offering to  
its customers. 
During the year we launched our vision 
of becoming the best company to do 
business with in our sector and the best 
to work for, and have further developed 
our strategy to help us achieve these 
aims.
We have improved the customer 
experience in a number of ways 
including through embedding new 
customer feedback technology that 
enables customers to review our service 
in real time and at a local level. This 
feedback gives us the opportunity to 
respond immediately to any issues that 
may arise. We have also launched an 
internal initiative made up of four key 
programmes that ensure our people 
understand, and can contribute to our 
strategic vision: promoting our brand 
proposition; improving customer 
satisfaction; enhancing internal advocacy 
and engagement; and delivering better 
systems, processes and management 
information. These programmes are 
monitored and reported on monthly at 
the Executive Board and are improving 
business performance.
Our focus on strong customer 
relationships has enabled us to win and 
renew a number of contracts with our 
larger customers, including a contract 
renewal, and scope extension with 
Carillion Plc, which in total could be 
worth up to £45m over three years, and 
renewals with Babcock and Morgan 
Sindall Plc. Whilst there is some market 
uncertainty in the lead up to Brexit and 
the general election we are now well 
placed to deliver sustainable profitable 
growth. 
Operational review
uK and ireland 
The UK and Ireland business contributed 
92.8% of Group revenues. Revenue 
increased by 11.1% to £342.9m (2016: 
£308.7m). Partnered services revenue 
increased 15.0% to £52.2m (2016: 
£45.4m), reflecting revenue from the 
heavy plant disposal which transferred to 
partnered services, and an improvement 
in revenue from larger customers. Total 
revenues, excluding asset disposals, 
increased 6.4%.
Gross margins on core hire revenue 
declined slightly over the period 
reflecting the competitive market 
environment, offset by improvements 
in asset utilisation, the lower hire fleet 
and consequently lower depreciation 
charges. Overhead costs fell by £1.6m, 
after absorbing £4.3m of bonus costs 
(2016: £1.0m) and the costs of Lloyds 
British. The regional operating divisions 
were restructured into two during the 
year to improve efficiency and enhance 
accountability and empowerment; this 
has resulted in cost savings and an 
improved operational performance.
EBITA
1
 increased to £22.0m (2016: 
£14.5m) before central costs of £4.8m 
(2016: £5.1m). 
We have introduced a more stringent 
governance process for capital 
expenditure decisions, and improved our 
asset utilisation by c.7% to an average 
for the year of 51.5%. As a result, the 
hire fleet has been reduced by 11.4% to 
£186.8m (2016: £210.8m) including the 
sale of the Group’s heavy plant for a total 
consideration of £14.4m in September 
2016. The fleet was sold to Ardent with 
whom we entered into a five-year re-hire 
agreement, with an option to extend for a 
further two years. Our hire fleet remains 
the largest of its type in the UK and 
Ireland, and combined with our partnered 
services offering we are proud to offer our 
customers the ability to hire a full range 
of products.
 “
Whilst we have made  
a solid start to the year, 
the market remains 
competitive. With the 
business now stabilised 
and a strong balance 
sheet, we are well 
positioned to take 
advantage of market 
opportunities and 
continue to deliver 
sustainable profitable 
growth.” Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information

In the Middle East our business is 
primarily with national government 
clients in the Oil and Gas market in 
Abu Dhabi. In spite of low oil prices the 
business has grown this year as projects 
have fully mobilised and new work has 
been secured. Revenue grew 29.9% 
(12.7% on a constant currency basis) 
to £26.5m (2016: £20.4m) of which 
approximately 50% is partnered services. 
Gross margins have increased slightly 
and overheads have reduced. As a result, 
EBITA
1
 has increased to £2.1m (2016: 
£0.6m). Of this improvement £0.2m 
related to favourable exchange rate 
movements. 
The Group operates a joint venture in 
Kazakhstan which has performed well this 
year following cyclical shutdown activity. 
Profit from JV operations increased to 
£1.7m (2016: £0.7m).
Safety and sustainability
We have an industry leading approach to 
safety and sustainability and continue  
to promote safety related topics with our 
customers through our ‘Intelligent Safety’ 
campaign. We consistently report the 
lowest accident and injury rates in our 
sector and have recently implemented 
an ‘app’ to facilitate reporting of all 
health and safety related matters and 
recommendations. During the year we 
were pleased to be awarded our third 
RoSPA Gold Medal, were accredited to 
Achilles Building Confidence with a 5-star 
rating for the fourth year running, and 
have maintained our 5-star Achilles RISQS 
accreditation for the second year running. 
Our vehicle fleet is accredited to FORS 
Gold standard nationally. 
We were the first company in our sector 
to achieve the ISO 50001 accreditation 
for energy saving. We work with suppliers 
to minimise waste coming into the 
business through reducing packaging 
where possible, and have identified waste 
streams that enable us to break down 
and re-cycle end of life assets at the 
point of disposal. Our customers demand 
lower carbon emitting products, and our 
purchasing policy is to opt for greener 
assets to satisfy this need.
People
The Group’s headcount at 31 March 2017 
was 3,745 (2016: 3,644) including  
176 employees following the acquisition 
of Lloyds British. Employee numbers in  
the UK and Ireland business reduced 
by 116 following the operational 
restructuring and efficiency programmes, 
whilst in the Middle East numbers increased 
by 41 as a result of increasing revenue. 
We undertook a full employee 
engagement survey during September 
with a commitment to running this 
on an annual basis. The survey was 
well received and scored highly in its 
management and engagement indices, 
whilst identifying a number of areas for 
improvement. We have implemented a 
Group action plan as well as local action 
plans to help us achieve our vision of 
becoming the best company to work for  
in our sector. 
The significantly improved results we are 
reporting this year would not have been 
possible without the continued passion 
and hard work of all of our people. I would 
like to take this opportunity to thank 
all my colleagues for their support and 
dedication during the year.

Enhancing 
customer 
experience
During FY2017 we have undertaken a 
number of customer excellence initiatives.
Our three-part customer strategy launched in FY2016 
remains firmly in place. During FY2017 we have 
undertaken a number of customer excellence initiatives 
to build upon it, broken down into four key themes:
 Brand proposition – vision, mission and values
 Customer satisfaction
 Internal advocacy and engagement 
 Systems, processes and management information
Brand proposition – vision, mission  
and values
Our people and customers have a clear understanding of what 
we do, and the behaviours that will enable us to realise our 
strategic aims. During the year we launched a simple vision  
and mission, whilst retaining the Speedy values that are as 
important now as they have ever been. 
We have re-enforced the importance of providing customer 
excellence to our employees through a comprehensive employee 
communications and training programme.
Customer satisfaction
To help us improve customer satisfaction 
we launched our ‘voice of the customer’ 
programme.
This programme uses technology to allow customers to rate their 
satisfaction in real time and at a local level. This is improving the 
customer experience by allowing local managers to address any 
concerns raised by customers as quickly as possible. The system 
data enables us to quantifiably measure our levels of service and 
identify overall areas for improvement. 
Internal advocacy and engagement
During FY2017 we re-launched our employee survey  
‘People Matters’, last conducted in 2012, with a commitment 
to running this on an annual basis. An overriding positive 
theme resulting from the survey was the level of loyalty and 
commitment employees had to the business. Inevitably there 
were areas where we need to improve, and we have put action 
plans in place at a Group and local levels to address these.  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information
Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 13
Systems, processes and management 
information
During the year we reviewed our systems and processes  
with the aim of improving product availability, utilisation and 
customer satisfaction, to ensure we are able to deliver the  
right equipment when and where it is needed to our customers.
The improvements we have made in management information  
are enabling us to better monitor performance against KPIs  
in relation to asset utilisation, engineering and logistics.  
It has also led to a reduction in invoice queries and improved 
cash collections. 
In December 2016 Speedy acquired 
the brand, business and assets of 
l loyds British t esting l td (‘l loyds 
British’) from the Administrator, 
PwC. l loyds British is a specialist 
business, which carries out testing, 
certification, and inspection of 
lifting equipment, and training

the existing network of 12 Lloyds British 
offices.
The acquisition of Lloyds British has 
complemented the existing lifting, 
testing and training businesses and 
enhanced Speedy’s overall offering  
to its customers. 
Lloyds British contains a talented and 
knowledgeable specialist workforce, and 
positions Speedy as the market leader in 
test, repair, inspection and certification, 
as well as the design and manufacture  
of specialist lifting equipment and sales. 
It enables Speedy to deliver a unique 
full life cycle service to new and existing 
Speedy and Lloyds British blue chip 
customers in the regulated industries of 
energy, renewables and utilities. Health 
and safety legislation demands strict 
compliance and robust solutions in these 
sectors, and this acquisition has enabled 
Speedy to become a more integral part 
of the supply chain for those sector 
customers.
The integration of Lloyds British into the 
Speedy business has been efficient and 
successful and our objective is now to 
improve the combined business’ level 
of performance and provide market-
leading customer service in this  
valuable sector.
“t he acquisition of l loyds 
British gives us the ability 
to improve revenues in our 
services ofering by providing 
enhanced training, testing 
and lifting services to our 
customers whilst realising 
synergies with our existing 
business and ultimately

way we service customers to make it easier for them 
to do business with us. During FY2017 we completed 
the roll out of new mobile Smart Devices for frontline 
colleagues who deliver and collect our assets from 
site. We have also introduced In-Depot Tablets for 
customers who are collecting in-store. This technology

reducing customer queries and making our service  
to customers simpler, quicker and more seamless.
l eading the industry in BIm technology
We are at the forefront of Business Information Modelling (BIM) 
technology within the hire sector. BIM allows the total energy 
footprint of our equipment to be detailed for use in public 
sector tendering. It enables our customers to access detailed 
information about our assets in a digital format required for 
working in a BIM environment, assisting with access to BIM 
information on site during design, planning and building phases. 
We work closely with a number of our large customers and BIM 
experts to develop the range and services offered through this 
innovative technology.

Cultivating 
relationships
We consistently develop integrated 
relationships at all levels throughout  
our business.
We have developed long-term relationships with our 
customers. This investment in relationship building runs 
throughout the whole organisation, from the Executive 
Board to our employees on the frontline and in the 
back office. By meeting regularly at all levels with our 
customers we have created an open dialogue, helping 
to ensure we understand their business and current and 
future requirements. 
Contract wins
By forging strong customer relationships we have won and renewed 
a number of contracts with our larger customers. These include  
a contract renewal, and scope extension with Carillion Plc, worth 
up to £45m over three years, and renewals with Babcock and 
Morgan Sindall Plc.
Customer Innovation Days
We have continued to run our Customer Innovation Day programme. 
This programme enables us to demonstrate innovative solutions 
and new products. Working with our suppliers, we are able  
to  raise awareness about how our products deliver enhanced 
safety, operational efficiency, cost reduction and environmental 
benefits. Feedback from our customers continues to be positive 
from an engagement, as well as a product awareness perspective.
t radePoint Partnership
We are establishing new customer relationships through our 
agreement with TradePoint as their preferred partner for hire 
services. This partnership is providing a valuable channel for us 
to promote a selected range of hire tools and small equipment 
direct to TradePoint’s extensive customer base. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information
Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 17
In addition to the hire of tools and 
small plant, the PSTA extends the scope 
of supply to include the hire of rail 
equipment to create a single trading 
process across all Carillion business 
units. Award of the new agreement was 
subject to a robust competitive tender 
process and involved a full assessment 
of Carillion’s spend against a number of 
additional criteria. These included health 
and safety, environment, sustainability 
as well as the key areas of operational 
delivery and the commercial offering. 
Speedy meeting Carillion’s requirements 
when combined with existing 
relationships, market experience and  
a clear mutual desire to develop growth 
and opportunity, created a compelling 
argument to continue the trading 
arrangements for a further period.
“We are delighted that our strong 
relationships with c arillion have 
resulted in this contract being renewed 
with an increase in scope. t his renewal 
is testament to the levels of service 
and innovation that Speedy has 
provided to c arillion since 2003 and 
we look forward to further increasing 
our collaborative working with c arillion 
over the coming years to bring further 
innovation to their projects.”

We are working to develop a culture where employees 
enjoy coming to work, feel empowered in their roles, 
are trained, developed, and are rewarded for great 
performance.
People matters employee survey
In order to achieve our vision, it’s important that we understand 
how engaged people are and what’s important to them about 
working for Speedy.
During FY2017 we re-launched our employee survey ‘People 
Matters’. The survey achieved a 69% response rate which is an 
excellent result when we benchmark it against similar companies. 
We measured how engaged people were with the business,  
how committed they are to helping Speedy succeed, and how 
people feel about their line manager. The survey provided 
valuable information on the commitment and dedication of 
all our people and their desire to ensure that the company 
continues to be successful.
Whilst the results were good, we have developed a five 
point Group improvement action plan as well as localised 
improvement plans.
Empowered

We are creating a culture in which 
all staff are empowered to make

t raining and development 
We are committed to developing our people’s skills and our 
training academy delivers a comprehensive schedule of online, 
classroom and practical training courses. Every new employee 
attends a corporate induction as well as receiving further 
training depending on the nature of their job role. 
During FY2017 we recruited apprentices into our Multi-Service 
Centre network to develop them through the Plant Maintenance 
apprenticeship, and they are working towards achieving an nVQ 
level 3 qualification. This scheme will act as a benchmark as we 
expand our apprenticeships offering. All new permanent drivers 
are eligible to participate in the nVQ level 2 qualification in 
Commercial Driving.
As part of our strategy to improve our customer 
service, we have rolled out a Customer Excellence 
training programme, which more than  
1,000 employees have attended to date.
Rewards and benefits 
During FY2017 we reviewed employee rewards and benefits  
with the aim of enhancing remuneration in a cost effective 
manner. We increased our lowest pay rates above the National 
Living Wage to ensure we remain competitive in the market, 
whist implementing a new performance related bonus structure 
for all employees. We have reviewed our benefits packages and 
aim to offer flexible solutions to attract and retain talented staff. 
Performance and recognition 
During FY2017 we launched a new standardised Personal 
Development Review process (PDR) to measure people’s 
performance and to identify areas for training and development. 
We also introduced a Group-wide performance related bonus 
scheme that links directly to Group performance and the  
PDR process.
Our managers are empowered to recognise employees for 
excellent performance within their roles. This is delivered 
through a spot reward scheme ‘Celebrating Excellence’. Over  
700 employees received an award during FY2017. We also 
celebrate loyalty through a scheme that recognises long service 
including those who have 10, 20 and 25 years’ service with the 
Company. 160 employees have reached these milestones  
during this financial year.
We empower our people to nominate their colleagues through 
our annual Excellence Awards initiative. The awards publicly 
recognise outstanding teams and individuals and in FY2017 
more than 200 of our employees nominated their colleagues  
to win an award.

Our approach 
We are pleased that based on publicly available 
information on RIDDOR accident frequency rates we 
continue to be the safest company in our industry. 
Our aim is to ensure all our employees, visitors and 
contractors are safe. We adopt an ‘Intelligent Safety’ 
mind set; a way in which the psychology of safety is 
broken down into simple decision making processes. 
Our policies and procedures will continue to focus  
on risk reduction and risk minimisation.
We are pleased to have maintained a very low RIDDOR  
accident frequency rate; at 0.14 our RIDDOR frequency rate per 
100,000 hours worked is at an industry leading level and on  
a par with some of our major customers. It’s particularly pleasing 
that during this period we collected our third ROSPA Gold award 
for health and safety. Our specified injury frequency rate has 
risen slightly to 0.04 FY2017 from 0.01 FY2016. 
Educating the industry through Intelligent Safety
Intelligent Safety reflects the joined up approach we take to 
safety. The approach encompasses risk awareness, the right 
protocols and the right training. It includes taking personal 
responsibility and an interest in everything that may appear 
unsafe in the workplace, our customers’ workplaces and  
even in the home. 
There are some major issues challenging the construction 
industry and in particular construction workers. Some of these 
issues are occurring on a daily basis but can affect workers 
health for their whole life. With issues such as dust, hand arm 
vibration and musculoskeletal disorders, we believe it’s our 
duty to help reduce risks in the construction arena by offering 
solutions, not just tools to reduce these hazards. We understand 
that the challenges to completely remove the risk to health from 
using equipment in the construction industry may test the best 
solutions on the market, but our ethos is to work closely with  
our suppliers and partners to truly make a difference on some  
of these known health issues. 
Through our Dust Control initiative, Speedy has supported  
the national Breathe Freely campaign run by BOHS,  
The Chartered Society for Worker Health Protection,  
and we have four dedicated dust centres in and 
around London to support and assist customers  
in selecting dust reducing solutions. 
Safety and 
sustainability
We are industry leaders in safety  
and sustainability. We are proud that we have 
the best health and safety 
performance in the industry, 
as well as leading in the field 
of sustainability in our sector.

Awards and accreditations
Speedy is proud to be an active 
member of the major industry 
accreditation schemes, and is 
committed to working with them  
to drive forward the standards  
of best practice. 
During FY2017 we were proud to be 
the first company in our sector to 
achieve the ISO 50001 accreditation 
for energy management, and over the 
past year progress has continued in the 
monitoring of our energy usage, and 
we have implemented initiatives to 
reduce our consumption. Other current 
accreditations include:
 > ISO 9001 for Quality Management
 > ISO 14001 for Environmental 
Management
 > OHSAS 18001 for Health & Safety 
Management through Intertek 
Certification Ltd 
We have maintained a 5-star rating for 
our Achilles RISQS accreditation for 
the third year running, demonstrating 
that we have not received any non-
conformances for four years through 
this scheme. Speedy is also accredited 
to Archilles Building Confidence 
Achilles UVDB, Achilles F-Pal, SAFed, 
SafeHire, Constructionline and CHAS,  
to name a few.
During FY2017 we won a RoSPA 
Gold award for health and safety 
for the third year running, providing 
further demonstrable evidence of our 
commitment to keeping our people  
and customers safe. 22 Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Intelligent Workplace
We are shifting the culture within the business so that 
performance management and recognition and reward reflect  
our vision to be the best company to do business with in our 
sector and the best to work for. During FY2017 we have  
re-assessed our performance review process and launched  
a standardised Personal Development Review programme. 
This learning and development programme will aim to ensure  
our people have the skills and expertise to provide first class 
service to our customers, and develop and enhance their own 
careers and personal development.
Intelligent Community
Under the guidance of our Charities Committee, we contribute to 
the wellbeing of both the construction community and the local 
communities in which we operate. Our chosen charity partners 
are the Lighthouse Club and WellChild. 
The Lighthouse Club work to support families that have suffered 
injury or loss in the construction industry. We support the 
production of their newsletter, and promote membership at  
the Speedy Expo.
WellChild help sick children and their families across the 
UK. During FY2017 we have supported their Helping Hands 
programme which renovates the homes and gardens of sick 
children by providing tools and equipment as well as volunteers. 
We were delighted to be awarded the WellChild Volunteer of the 
Year award during the year for our long-standing commitment 
to this initiative. We have also supported them by training their 
Programme Head and Project Manager on the IOSH Managing 
Safely course at our National Training Centre.
In addition to our two charity partners, we also run a prison 
workshop at HMP Garth in Lancashire. We provide real work 
training to nVQ level 2 in electrical engineering for up to  
60 inmates at any given time, providing the skills which will  
make finding work easier upon release. 
We also support employees with their own fundraising activities, 
and our employees are proactive in running fundraising events 
that support both local charities, and nationally recognised 
fundraising days.
Putting social and environmental impact  
at the forefront of our activity
During FY2017 we have reviewed our Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) Roadmap to ensure our Key Performance 
Indicators remain integral to our business objectives  
and strategy.
Our CSR Working Group operates within a framework which links 
directly to our KPI Roadmap, targeting performance improvement 
in areas that make a real difference to people, customers and 
communities. Our approach is categorised into four key areas 
that we call Intelligent Marketplace, Environment, 
Workplace and Community.
Intelligent marketplace
Understanding our customers’ challenges and 
the wider industry context they work in sits at the 
centre of our approach. Championing innovation is the driving 
force in shaping our approach to an intelligent marketplace. 
Collaborating with our customers enables Speedy to tailor 
sustainable solutions that offer benefits to all parties. Led by 
our Supply Chain Team, we have over 100 Green Option (GO) 
products that deliver sustainable solutions to our customers. 
Intelligent Environment
We have measured our carbon footprint for ten years. We have 
demonstrated to our customers, our people and our wider 
communities that we are serious about playing our part in 
reducing the carbon impact of the construction industry. We 
have reduced our carbon footprint from above ten tonnes per 
capita per annum when we started to less than seven today.

Gross profit was £191.7m (2016:  £184.2m),  
an increase of 4.1%. The gross profit 
percentage was 51.9% (2016: 56.0%) and 
reflected the increase in disposals and a 
higher proportion of partnered services 
income.

Including the heavy plant sale, revenue 
improved by 11.1% to £342.9m (2016: 
£308.7m), with an increase across 
all key revenue streams. During the 
year we have improved the customer 
experience, increased asset availability 
and restructured our sales activities. 
Partnered services revenue increased 
15.0% to £52.2m (2016: £45.4m). Future 
revenue has been secured through a 
number of contract wins and renewals, 
including an agreement with Carillion Plc, 
which in total could be worth up to £45m 
over three years. Revenue for the final 
quarter benefitted from the acquisition  
of Lloyds British. 
Gross margins decreased from 58.1% 
to 54.2% as a result of the planned 
fleet disposals and revenue mix. 
Administration expenses and distribution 
costs fell by £1.6m, after absorbing 
£4.3m of bonus costs. This reflected 
management action to reduce headcount 
and vehicle numbers, which fell by 116 
and 99 respectively, when excluding 
Lloyds British. Overheads were tightly 
controlled, with the UK regional operating 
divisions restructured into two in order 
to increase efficiency and reduce costs. 
Following the implementation of strict 
processes to manage capital expenditure,

The International division has performed 
well with revenue up by £6.1m. Of this

mobilisation of new equipment, in spite 
of low oil prices. As a result of increased 
revenue, EBITA

 increased to £2.1m (2016: 
£0.6m). A slight increase in gross margin 
and savings in administration costs 
contributed to the increased EBITA

, along 
with an exchange rate benefit of £0.2m. 
One off cyclical shutdown activity in 
Kazakhstan helped increase our share 
of profit from the joint venture to £1.7m 
(2016: £0.7m).
Exceptional items
Net exceptional items totalled £0.0m 
before taxation (2016: £59.9m). 
Exceptional costs of £2.2m were incurred 
relating to a restructuring of the UK and 
Ireland business, September’s General 
Meeting, the accelerated amortisation 
of contract costs following a customer 
insolvency, and acquisition expenses 
associated with Lloyds British.
Offsetting the above exceptional costs 
was a £1.6m credit due to the revision of 
the International receivables provision, 
following the receipt of cash in the year, 
and a release of a provision, following the 
renegotiation of contingent consideration 
of £0.6m in relation to the prior year 
acquisition of OHP Limited.
Interest and hedging
As a consequence of the reduction 
in net debt
3
 in the year, net financial 
expense declined to £4.8m (2016: 
£5.7m). Borrowings under the Group’s 
bank facility are priced on the basis of 
LIBOR plus a variable margin, while any 
unutilised commitment is charged at 40% 
of the applicable margin. During the year, 
the margin payable on the outstanding 
debt fluctuated between 1.80% and 
2.75% dependent on the Group’s 
performance in relation to leverage and 
the weighting of borrowings between 
receivables and plant and machinery.  
The effective average margin in the 
year was 2.35%. The current applicable 
margins are 1.80% on receivables and 
2.30% on plant and machinery.
The Group utilises interest rate hedges 
to manage fluctuations in LIBOR. The fair 
value of these hedges was a liability of 
£0.4m at year end and they have varying 
maturity dates to September 2019. The 
incremental interest cost arising from 
these hedges amounted to £0.4m during 
the year (2016: £0.3m).
taxation
The Group’s income statement shows  
a tax charge for the year of £2.9m (2016: 
credit £4.9m), and an effective tax rate of 
20.1% (2016: 8.5%). The effective rate of 
tax on adjusted profit amounts to 21.6% 
(2016: 16.8%). 
The Group has benefitted from a deferred 
tax credit of £0.3m which arises from 
restating the net deferred tax liability at 
an enacted future tax rate of 17%, down 
from 18%. 
Tax paid in the year ended 31 March 2017 
amounted to £1.9m (2016: £0.6m).

Shares, earnings per share  
and dividends
At 31 March 2017, 523,566,491 shares 
were outstanding, of which 4,129,653 
were held in the Employee Benefits Trust.
Adjusted earnings per share

 was 
2.44 pence (2016: 0.79 pence). After 
amortisation and exceptional items, basic 
earnings per share was 2.22 pence (2016: 
loss per share 10.19 pence). 
The Board remains committed to the 
payment of dividends, with a policy of 
between 2x and 3x adjusted earnings per 
share

 cover. The Board has recommended 
a final dividend of 0.67 pence per share 
(2016: 0.40 pence), which represents  
a cash cost of approximately £3.5m.  
If approved by shareholders, this gives a 
total dividend for the year of 1.00 pence 
per share (2016: 0.70 pence), an increase 
of 42.9% with cover of 2.44x adjusted 
earnings per share. It is proposed that the 
dividend will be paid on 11 August 2017 to 
shareholders on the register at 7 July 2017.
Capital expenditure and disposals
Total capital expenditure during the year 
amounted to £44.8m (2016: £69.0m), 
of which £40.5m (2016: £57.8m) related 
to equipment for hire and £4.3m other 
property, plant and equipment (2016: 
£11.2m). 
The hire fleet is continually reviewed to 
optimise asset holdings for the target 
market. As a result of better management 
information informing decisions on 
returns and asset utilisation, along 
with tight governance introduced via 
the investment committee, capital 
expenditure requirements reduced in  
the year. Disposal proceeds of £29.4m 
(2016: £17.6m) increased during the year 
as a result of the sale of heavy plant.  
At 31 March 2017, the average age of  
the UK and Ireland fleet was 4.2 years 
(2016: 3.9 years). This increase resulted 
in part from the disposal of heavy plant, 
which had an average life of less than  
18 months.
Cash flow and net debt
net cash flow generated from operating 
activities increased to £42.7m in the year 
(2016: £20.4m). Free cash flow (before 
dividends and financing activities) was an 
inflow of £35.0m (2016: £8.6m), and was 
supported by proceeds of £14.4m from 
the heavy plant sale.

management of the asset fleet and 
working capital.
Net assets at 31 March 2017 totalled 
£189.6m (2016: £178.4m), equivalent to 
36.2 pence per share, and tangible fixed 
assets 44.8 pence per share. Net property, 
plant and equipment was £234.7m at

equipment for hire, £8.0m related to  
the International business (2016: £9.1m).
Gross trade receivables totalled £90.2m 
at 31 March 2017 (2016: £85.8m) with the 
increase reflecting the revenue growth. 
Bad debt and credit note provisions 
reduced to £6.9m at 31 March 2017 
(2016: £10.9m), equivalent to 7.6% of 
gross trade receivables (2016: 12.7%), 
demonstrating an improved ageing 
profile. Debtor days were 63.7 days  
(2016: 62.9 days).
Trade payables were £39.2m (2016: 
£41.2m), with reduced creditor days  
of 94.7 days (2016: 111.5 days).
Capital structure and treasury
Speedy’s long-term funding is provided 
through a combination of shareholders’ 
funds and bank debt.
The Group’s £180m asset-based revolving 
credit facility expires in September 2019. 
At 31 March 2017 the gross amount 
utilised under the facility was £85.0m 
(2016: £114.3m). The undrawn available 
amount, based on eligible receivables 
and plant and machinery, amounted to 
£75.8m (2016: £54.8m). The average 
gross borrowings under the facility 
during the year ended 31 March 2017 was 
£108.8m (2016: £132.9m). The current 
facility includes quarterly leverage and 
fixed charge cover covenant tests which 
are only applied if headroom in the 
facility falls below £18m. The Group had 
significant headroom against these tests 
throughout the year. 
The Group will continue to closely 
monitor cash generation, whilst balancing 
the need to invest in the quality of its  
UK hire fleet and depot network.

PRInCIPAl RISKS AnD un CERt AInt IES
Efective management of risks
Direct ownership of risk management 
within the Group lies with the senior 
management teams. Each individual 
is responsible for maintaining a risk 
register for their area of the business and 
is required to update this on a regular 
basis. The key items are consolidated 
into a Group risk register which has been 
used by the Board to carry out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks.
The principal risks and mitigating controls 
in place are summarised below.
The Board has delegated to the Audit 
Committee responsibility for reviewing 
the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal controls, including the systems 
established to identify, assess, manage 
and monitor risks. These systems, which 
ensure that risk is managed at the 
appropriate level within the business, can 
only mitigate risk rather than eliminate  
it completely.
The business strategy in place and 
the nature of the industry in which we 
operate expose the Group to a number 
of risks. As part of the risk management 
framework in place, the Board considers 
on an ongoing basis the nature, likelihood 
and potential impact of each of the 
significant risks it is willing to accept  
in achieving its strategic objectives.
Risk Potential impact Strategy for mitigation
Safety, health  
and environment
Serious injury or death
Speedy operates, transports and provides for rental 
a wide range of machinery. Without rigorous safety 
regimes in place there is a risk of injury or death to 
employees, customers or members of the public.
environmental hazard
The provision of such machinery includes handling, 
transport and dispensing of substances, including fuel, 
that are hazardous to the environment in the event  
of spillage.
The Group is recognised for its industry-leading 
position in promoting enhanced health and safety 
compliance, together with a commitment to product 
innovation. The Group’s systems, health and safety, and 
environment teams measure and promote employee 
understanding of, and compliance with, procedures 
that affect safety and protection of the environment. 
Customer account managers are responsible for 
addressing service and safety issues.
Service
provision of equipment
Speedy is required to provide well maintained 
equipment to its customers on a consistent and 
dependable basis.
Back office services
It is important that Speedy is able to provide 
timely and accurate management information to its 
customers, along with accurate invoices and supporting 
documentation.
In both cases, a failure to provide such service could 
lead to a failure to attract or retain customers, or 
to diminish the level of business such customers 
undertake with Speedy.
The Group has invested substantially in its operational 
and back office processes, to continue to improve its 
service offering. new personal digital assistants (PDAs) 
have been successfully rolled out during FY2017, 
improving the on-site customer experience whilst the 
Group continues to invest heavily in its IT infrastructure 
to support its business. 
Speedy also liaises with its customer base and takes 
into account feedback where particular issues are 
noted, to ensure that work on resolving those issues is 
prioritised accordingly. We have introduced an online 
based customer feedback system which significantly 
enhances our ability to understand the customer 
experience and improve service levels.
Revenue 
and trading 
performance
c ompetitive pressure
The hire market is fragmented and highly competitive. 
Whilst we are developing strategic relationships with 
larger customers, we are also working hard to grow our 
Local and Regional accounts.
Reliance on high value customers
As revenue from our larger customers grows, there is a 
higher risk to future revenues should preferred supplier 
status be lost when such agreements may individually 
represent a material element of our revenues.
The Group monitors its competitive position closely, 
to ensure that it is able to offer customers the best 
solution. The Group provides a wide breadth of 
offerings, supplemented by its partnered services 
division for specialist equipment. The Group monitors 
the performance of its major accounts against 
forecasts, strength of client future order books and 
individual expectations with a view to ensuring 
that the opportunities for the Group are maximised. 
Market share is measured and competitors’ activities 
are reported on and reacted to where appropriate. 
The Group’s integrated services offering further 
mitigates against this risk as it demonstrates value to 
our customers, setting us apart from purely asset hire 
companies.
No single customer currently accounts for more than 
10% of revenue or receivables.  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information

People
employee excellence
In order to achieve our strategic objectives, it is 
imperative that we are able to recruit, retain and motivate 
employees who possess the right skills for the Group. 
Skill and resource requirements for meeting the Group’s 
objectives are actively monitored and action is taken 
to address identified gaps. Succession planning aims 
to identify talent within the Group and is formally 
reviewed on an annual basis by the Nomination 
Committee, focussing on both short and long-term 
successors for the key roles within the Group.
Programmes are in place for employee induction, 
retention and career development, which are tailored 
to the requirements of the various business units within 
the Group. 
The Group regularly reviews remuneration packages 
and aims to offer competitive reward and benefit 
packages, including appropriate short and long-term 
incentive schemes.
Partner and 
supplier service 
levels 
Supply chain
Speedy procures assets and services from a wide range 
of sources, both UK and internationally based. Within 
the supply chain there are risks of non-fulfilment.
partner reputation
A significant amount of our revenues come from our 
partnered services offering, where the delivery or 
performance is effected through a third party partner.
Speedy’s ability to supply assets with the expected 
customer service is therefore reliant on the 
performance of others with the risk that if this is not 
effectively managed, the reputation of Speedy and 
hence future revenues may be adversely impacted.
A dedicated and experienced supply chain function  
is in place to negotiate all contracts and maximise the 
Group’s commercial position. Supplier accreditations 
are recorded and tracked centrally through a supplier 
portal where relevant and set service related KPIs 
are included within standard contract terms. Regular 
reviews take place with all supply chain partners.
Operating costs
f ixed cost base
Speedy has a fixed cost base including people, 
transport and property. When revenues fluctuate this 
can have a disproportionate effect on the Group’s 
financial results.
The Group has a purchasing policy in place to negotiate 
supply contracts that, wherever possible, determine 
fixed prices for a period of time. In most cases, multiple 
sources exist for each supply, decreasing the risk 
of supplier dependency and creating a competitive 
supply-side environment. All significant purchase 
decisions are overseen by a dedicated supply chain 
team with structured supplier selection procedures 
in place. Property costs are managed by an in-house 
team of specialists who undertake routine maintenance 
works and manage the estate in terms of rental costs. 
We operate a dedicated fleet of commercial vehicles 
that are maintained to support our brand image. Fuel 
is purchased through agreements controlled by our 
supply chain processes. 32 Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Information 
technology and 
data integrity
it system availability
Speedy is increasingly reliant on IT systems to support 
our business activities. Interruption in availability  
or a failure to innovate will reduce current and future 
trading opportunities respectively.
d ata accuracy
The quality of data held has a direct impact on how  
both strategic and operational decisions are made.  
If decisions are made based on erroneous data  
there could be a direct impact on the performance  
of the Group.
d ata security
Speedy, as with any organisation, holds data that is 
commercially sensitive and in some cases personal  
in nature. There is a risk that disclosure or loss of  
such data is detrimental to the business, either as  
a reduction in competitive advantage or as a breach  
of law or  regulation.
Annual and more medium-term planning processes  
are in place; these create future visibility as to the level 
and type of IT infrastructure and services required 
to support the business strategy. Business cases are 
prepared for any new/upgraded systems, and require 
formal approval.
The introduction of improved reporting with dedicated 
analysts within the business provides improved 
business information and better data quality and 
consistency.
Mitigations for IT data recovery are described below 
under business continuity as these risks are linked.
Speedy’s IT systems are protected against external 
unauthorised access. All mobile devices have access 
restrictions and, where appropriate, data encryption  
is applied.
Funding 
Sufficient capital
Should the Group not be able to obtain sufficient capital 
in the future, it might not be able to take advantage of 
strategic opportunities or it might be required to reduce 
or delay expenditure, resulting in the ageing of the fleet 
and/or non-availability. This could disadvantage the 
Group relative to its competitors and might adversely 
impact on its ability to command acceptable levels  
of pricing.
The Board has established a treasury policy regarding 
the nature, amount and maturity of committed funding 
facilities that should be in place to support the Group’s 
activities. 
In line with the treasury policy, the Group’s capital 
requirements, forecast and actual financial performance 
and potential sources of finance are reviewed at Board 
level on a regular basis in order that its requirements 
can be managed with appropriate levels of spare 
capacity. Close relationships are maintained with the 
Group’s bankers with a view to ensuring that the Group 
enjoys a broad degree of support. The Group’s current 
£180m asset based revolving credit facility is not due  
to expire until September 2019.
Economic 
vulnerability 
economy
Any changes in construction/industrial market 
conditions could affect activity levels and consequently 
the prices that the Group can charge for its services. 
Any reduction in Government expenditure which is 
not offset by an increase in private sector expenditure 
could adversely affect the Group. In common with many 
UK businesses, Speedy faces uncertainty as to the 
possible impact of leaving the European Union. There 
are risks to the overall level of economic activity, in 
addition to more direct risks relating to increased costs 
as a result of the falling value of sterling. 
The Group assesses changes in both Government and 
private sector spending as part of its wider market 
analysis. The impact on the Group of any such change 
is assessed as part of the ongoing financial and 
operational budgeting and forecasting process. Our 
strategy is to develop a differentiated proposition in 
our chosen markets and to ensure that we are well 
positioned with clients and contractors who are likely 
to benefit from those areas in which increased activity 
is forecast. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information

Corporate culture
o perational empowerment and culture
We operate an internal structure that is aligned around 
separate specialisms to better serve our customer base. 
Each division is challenged to operate with a degree  
of empowerment within overriding Group policies. 
All Speedy employees are expected to abide by 
our Code of Conduct, which forms a condition of 
employment. Training is provided, via a combination 
of online and face-to-face means, to all management 
grades in areas such as compliance with the Bribery 
Act 2010 and relevant competition laws. Group 
policies are in place that both support and oversee 
key aspects of our operation in particular the areas of 
treasury, purchasing, asset management, accounting 
and debt management. Review and exception reporting 
activities are in place, which are designed to ensure that 
individuals cannot override risk mitigation procedures 
which have been put in place by the Group. 
All of the above are supported by a well-publicised  
and robust whistleblowing policy with rigorous follow 
up of all concerns raised.
Business continuity
business interruption
Any significant interruption to Speedy’s operational 
capability, whether IT systems, physical restrictions or 
personnel based, could adversely impact current and 
future trading as customers could readily migrate to 
competitors.
This could range from short-term impact in processing 
of invoices that would affect cash flows to the loss of  
a major site.
Preventative controls, back-up and recovery procedures 
are in place for key IT systems. Changes to Group 
systems are considered as part of wider change 
management programmes and implemented in phases 
wherever possible. The Group has critical incident 
plans in place for all its central UK and International 
sites. Insurance cover is reviewed at regular intervals to 
ensure appropriate coverage in the event of a business 
continuity issue.
Asset holding  
and integrity
a sset range and availability
Speedy’s business model relies on providing assets for 
hire to customers, when they want to hire them. In order 
to maximise profitability and ROCE, demand is balanced 
with the requirement to hold a range of assets that is 
optimally utilised.
A better understanding of customer expectation of 
the relative timescales for delivery across our range of 
assets allows us to reduce holdings of less time-critical 
assets by centralising the storage locations, whilst at 
the same time increasing the breadth of holding across 
our customer trading locations of those assets most 
likely to be required on a short notice basis. 
We constantly review our range of assets and introduce 
innovative solutions to our customers as new products 
come to market, under our Green Option programme.
In coming to this conclusion, it has been 
assumed that a successful renewal 
of the Group’s £180m asset-backed 
finance facility will be concluded before 
September 2019, on broadly similar terms 
to the existing facility. This conclusion is 
based on improved financial performance 
and continuing constructive relationships 
with all the bank syndicate members.
Based on this assessment, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the period to March 2020.
The projections for the first three years of 
the strategic plan are based on detailed 
action plans developed by the Group with 
specific initiatives and accountabilities. 
There is inherently less certainty in the 
projections for years four and five and 
the Directors have determined that three 
years is an appropriate period over which 
to assess the Viability Statement.
In making this statement the Directors 
have considered the resilience of the 
Group, its current position, the principal 
risks facing the business in distressed 
but reasonable scenarios, and the 
effectiveness of any mitigating actions.

Chairman’s letter 
to shareholders
As reported last year, Chris Morgan was appointed to the 
Board as Group Finance Director with effect from 1 April 2016, 
having served in an interim capacity since December 2015, 
and Rob Barclay was appointed as a Non-Executive Director 
and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and a member 
of the Audit and nomination Committees with effect from 
1 April 2016. In addition, David Shearer was elected to the 
Board as a Non-Executive Director at the General Meeting in 
September 2016. David brings significant board experience 
and has since been appointed to each of the Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees of the Board. 
As reported in last year’s Annual Report, I took on the role 
of Executive Chairman from 1 July 2015 to assist Russell 
Down in his new role as Chief Executive, and to support the 
Executive team in their efforts to improve and accelerate 
operating performance. This was an important time to support 
the Company and I am personally very happy with the 
outcome that the team has achieved. I officially reverted back 
to non-executive status on 30 September 2016 having not 
undertaken any executive duties during the previous quarter. 
notwithstanding my reverting back to non-executive status,  
in accordance with best practice I stepped down from both  
the Audit and Remuneration Committees with effect from  
31 March 2017. 
The provisions of the Code relating to annual election of all 
the directors for FTSE 350 companies do not apply to the 
Company. Notwithstanding this, the Board has voluntarily 
determined that all Directors will submit to annual election 
going forward. 
During the year an independent external evaluation of the 
Board and Board Committees was undertaken. In view of 
the considerable Board and Committee changes across the 
previous two years I was pleased that the overall findings were 
positive, supporting my personal assessment. The exercise has 
also enabled the Board to agree priorities to further improve 
our effectiveness. Further details of the evaluation are 
provided on page 45 of the Governance Report.
Jan Åstrand
Chairman
Jan Åstrand
Non-Executive Chairman
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present the Governance 
Report for FY2017. This section of the Annual Report highlights 
the Company’s governance processes, alongside the work of 
the Board and Board Committees.
During the year, a full review of governance practices was 
undertaken to ensure our governance structures remain in line 
with developing best practice and are suitable for a company 
of our size. We have also assessed our compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2014 (the ‘Code’) and disclosures 
in this year’s Annual Report describe how the Code’s main 
principles are applied. We consider that the Code’s principles 
are central to the effective management of the business, to 
maintaining the confidence of our investors and are in the best 
interests of all of our stakeholders. As noted on page 42, we 
have been in full compliance with the provisions of the Code 
throughout the year. I am pleased to summarise below the 
principal initiatives and changes in our corporate governance, 
which include those from the review.  36 Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Governance Strategic Report
The Chairman’s statement on pages 4 and 5, the Strategic  
Report on pages 2 to 33, the Corporate Governance review on 
pages 42 to 47 and the reports of the Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees on pages 48 to 49 are incorporated 
by reference into this report and are deemed to form part  
of this report.
The Strategic Report was approved by the Board and authorised 
for issue on 15 May 2017.
Results and dividends
The consolidated profit after taxation for the year was £11.5m 
(2016: loss £52.7m). This is after a taxation charge of £2.9m 
(2016: credit £4.9m) representing an effective rate of 20.1% 
(2016: 8.5%). An interim dividend of 0.33 pence per share was 
paid during the year. The Directors propose that a final dividend 
of 0.67 pence per share be paid, which, if approved, would  
make a total dividend distribution in respect of the year of  
1.00 pence per share (2016: 0.70 pence). The final dividend  
will be paid on 11 August 2017 to all shareholders on the  
register at 7 July 2017.
Related party transactions
Except for Directors’ service contracts, the Company did not have 
any material transactions or transactions of an unusual nature 
with, and did not make loans to, related parties in the periods  
in which any Director is or was materially interested.
Buy-back of shares
At the Annual General Meeting held on 13 July 2016, a special 
resolution was passed to authorise the Company to make 
purchases on the London Stock Exchange of up to 10% of its 
ordinary shares.
As at 15 May 2017, no shares had been purchased under this 
authority. Shareholders will be requested to renew this authority 
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting in July 2017.
Financial instruments
The Group holds and uses financial instruments to finance its 
operations and manage its interest rate and liquidity risks.  
Full details of the Group’s arrangements are contained  
in note 18 to the Financial Statements.
Going concern
The Directors consider that the Group has adequate financial 
resources and has access to sufficient borrowing facilities to 
continue operating for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, 
as detailed in note 1 to the Financial Statements (basis of 
preparation), the Directors continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.

Directors
The Directors who served during the year and the interests of 
Directors in the share capital of the Company are set out on  
page 68.
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, a third 
of the Board should retire by rotation at each Annual General 
Meeting and, if eligible and willing, seek re-election. However, in 
compliance with the principles of best corporate governance, the 
Board unanimously supports the annual re-election of Directors 
and therefore all Directors shall be submitted for annual  
re-election commencing from this year’s Annual General Meeting.
No Director had any interest, either during or at the end of 
the year, in any disclosable contracts or arrangements, other 
than a contract of service, with the Company or any subsidiary 
company. No Director had any interest in the shares of any 
subsidiary company during the year. 
Equal opportunities
The Group employs 3,252 people in the UK and Ireland, and 
493 people internationally. The Group has a clear policy that 
employees are recruited and promoted solely based on aptitude 
and ability. The Group does not discriminate in any way in 
respect of race, sex, marital status, age, religion, disability 
or any other characteristic of a similar nature. In the case of 
disability, all reasonable adjustments are considered to enable 
employment or continue employment as well as to ensure that 
any disabled employees receive equal treatment in matters such 
as career development, promotion and training. Managers at 
all levels are trained and developed to adhere to and promote 
this goal, including receiving training specifically on diversity 
matters. Further information on equal opportunities within the 
Group is set out on page 23 in the Strategic Report.

the success of the businesses in which they are employed.

It is the Group’s policy that employees should generally be 
eligible to participate in some form of incentive scheme as soon 
as practicable after joining the Group, following the conclusion 
of any relevant probationary period. Details of annual incentive 
arrangements for Executive Directors are summarised in the 
Remuneration Committee’s Report on pages 58 and 59. The 
payments made in FY2017 to departing Directors are set out in  
the Remuneration Committee’s Report on page 67.
The Group has a people strategy in place aimed at being an 
employer of choice, as can be seen on pages 18 and 19 of 
the Strategic Report. The Group actively makes a number of 
commitments to its employees including pay, engagement and 
development. The Board sees employee engagement as a key 
part of its success.
Disclosure of information to auditors
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this 
Directors’ Report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, 
there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s 
auditors are unaware and each Director has taken all the 
steps that he or she ought to have taken as a Director to make 
himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that 
information. This confirmation is given and should be interpreted 
in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the 
Companies Act 2006.

Company held on 13 July 2016 and its appointment expires at

Governance appointment and replacement of d irectors
The Company’s Articles of Association provide that all Directors 
must stand for election at the first Annual General Meeting after 
having been appointed by the Board. The Articles of Association 
also provide that each Director must also stand for re-election 
at the third Annual General Meeting following their last election 
or re-election by shareholders. If the number of Directors 
standing for re-election is less than one-third of the current 
Board (which excludes any Directors appointed by the Board 
who are standing for election for the first time) then additional 
Directors must also stand for re-election in order that one-
third of the Board is standing for re-election, save that where 
the number of Directors is not three or a multiple of three, the 
number of Directors which is nearest to but does not exceed 
one-third must stand for re-election.
However, the Board has determined that, whilst not a requirement 
of the Company’s Articles of Association or the UK Corporate 
Governance Code as it applies to the Company, to comply with 
the principles of best corporate governance all Directors should 
be submitted for re-election annually commencing from the 
Annual General Meeting to be held in July 2017.
articles of a ssociation
The Company’s Articles of Association may be amended by 
special resolution of the Company’s shareholders.

At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 12 July 2017, 
shareholders will be asked to renew the Directors’ power to allot 
shares and buy back shares in the Company and to renew the 
disapplication of pre-emption rights.
Change of control – significant agreements
There are no significant agreements to which the Company is  
a party that may take effect, alter or terminate upon a change  
of control following a takeover bid other than in relation to:  
(i) employee share schemes; and (ii) the Company’s borrowings, 
which would become repayable on a takeover being completed.
Shares in the Company are held in the Speedy Hire Employee 
Benefits Trust (‘Trust’) for the purpose of satisfying awards made 
under the Company’s Performance Share Plan. Unless otherwise 
directed by the Company, the Trustees of the Trust abstain from 
voting on any shares held in the Trust in respect of which the 
beneficial interest has not vested in any beneficiary. In relation 
to shares held in the Trust where the beneficial interest has 
vested in a beneficiary, the beneficiary can direct the Trustees 
how to vote. As at 15 May 2017 the Trust held 4,129,653 shares 
in the Company (0.8% of the issued share capital).
Compensation for loss of office
There are no agreements between the Company and its 
Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of 
office or employment (whether through resignation, purported 
redundancy or otherwise) that occurs in the event of a bid for  
the Company or takeover.
Directors’ indemnities
Throughout the financial year and at the date of approval of 
the Financial Statements, the Company has purchased and 
maintained Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance in respect 
of itself and its Directors. As permitted by the Companies Act 
2006, it is the Company’s policy to indemnify its Directors. 
Where qualifying deeds of indemnity are not currently in place 
for any of its Directors, these will be put in place during the 
coming year.
Political contributions
No political donations were made during the year (2016: nil).

Directors’ Report
continued Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information
Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 39
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent 
Company Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group Financial Statements 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union (‘EU’)  
and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Parent Company 
Financial Statements on the same basis. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the Financial 
Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company 
and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and Parent Company Financial Statements, the Directors 
are required to: 
 > select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
 > make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; 
 > state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and 
 > prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Parent Company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Parent Company and 
enable them to ensure that its Financial Statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
statement that comply with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements  
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect  
of the Annual Financial Report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 > the Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
 > the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face.
We consider the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole,  
is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy.

Governance progress
The Company undertook a full review of governance practices 
during the year and the Board agreed actions to ensure 
governance structures remain in line with developing best 
practice and are suitable for a company of its size. The agreed 
actions included addressing concerns noted by shareholders 
as well as helping to ensure the relevant skills and expertise 
are available to the key Board Committees. This culminated 
in the Board being comfortable that it was the right time for 
the Chairman, Jan Åstrand, to revert back to a non-executive 
position after stepping into an interim executive role in July 
2015. It should be noted that this was a supporting role to assist 
Russell Down in his new role as Chief Executive and was not 
remunerated as an executive position and additional fees were 
taken and not a salary. There were also no performance related 
elements to this interim post.
u K Corporate Governance Code compliance
The Board is committed to maintaining high standards of 
corporate governance. The Board first reported its compliance 
with the Combined Code in 2004. Since then, other than as 
explained in previous Annual Reports and Accounts, it has 
complied in full with the Combined Code (now the UK Corporate 
Governance Code) and continued to develop its approach to 
corporate governance and the effective management of risk in 
the context of an evolving business. The Company first reported 
fully against the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 in its  
2014 Annual Report and has since been reporting against the  
UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 (the ‘Code’). A copy of the 
2014 edition of the Code is available to view on the website of 
the Financial Reporting Council. As a new version of the Code was 
introduced during 2016 and the revised provisions will apply to 
accounting periods commencing on or after 17 June 2016, the 
Company will report formally against the 2016 edition of the 
Code in its 2018 Annual Report and Accounts. 
We explain in this section how the Company has applied the 
principles of good governance and the code of best practice  
set out in the Code.
Throughout the year ended 31 March 2017, the Company has 
been in full compliance with the provisions set out in the Code.
Directors
t he board
In the year ended 31 March 2017, the Board met eight times.  
The Board also meets as required on an ad hoc basis to deal with 
urgent business, including the consideration and approval of 
transactions. The table below lists the Directors’ attendance at 
the Board meetings and Committee meetings during the year 
ended 31 March 2017.
Chris Morgan was appointed as Interim Group Finance Director 
in December 2015 and appointed to the Board as Group Finance 
Director with effect from 1 April 2016. Jan Åstrand took on the 
role of Executive Chairman from 1 July 2015 to assist Russell 
Down in his new role as Chief Executive, and to support the 
Executive team in their efforts to improve and accelerate 
operating performance. This was always to be an interim 
appointment and following the stabilisation of the business and 
strengthening of the Board, Jan Åstrand reverted back to the role 
of Non-Executive Chairman on 30 September 2016. Rob Barclay 
was appointed to the Board on 1 April 2016 as Non-Executive 
Director, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and a 
member of the Audit and Nomination Committees. David Shearer 
was elected to the Board at the General Meeting on 9 September 
2016 and appointed a member of the Audit and Nomination 
Committees from 10 November 2016 and of the Remuneration 
Committee on 31 March 2017. Jan Åstrand stepped down from

The Board has approved a schedule of matters reserved for 
decision by it. This schedule (which forms part of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code Compliance Statement) was 
formally adopted by the Board on 30 March 2011 and most 
recently reviewed on 23 March 2017. It is available for inspection 
at the Company’s registered office and on the Company’s 
website. The matters reserved for decision by the Board  
can be subdivided into a number of key areas including, but  
not limited to:
 > financial reporting (including the approval of interim and  
final Financial Statements, interim management statements 
and dividends);
 > approving the form and content of the Group’s Annual 
Report and Financial Statements (following appropriate 
recommendations from the Audit Committee) to ensure that 
it is fair, balanced and understandable overall and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, business model  
and strategy;
 > the Group’s finance, banking and capital structure 
arrangements;
 > Group strategy and key transactions (including major 
acquisitions and disposals);
 > Stock Exchange/Listing Authority matters (including the  
issue of shares, the approval of circulars and communications 
to the market);
 > approval of the policies and framework in relation to 
remuneration across the Group (following appropriate 
recommendations from the Remuneration Committee);
 > oversight of the Group’s risk appetite, risk acceptance and 
programmes for risk mitigation;
 > approval of the Group’s risk management and internal control 
processes (following appropriate recommendations from  
the Audit Committee);
 > approving the Company’s annual Viability Statement;
 > the constitution of the Board itself, including its various 
Committees, and succession planning (following appropriate 
recommendations from the Nomination Committee); and
 > approving the Group’s policies in relation to, inter alia, the 
Group’s Code of Conduct and whistleblowing, the Bribery 
Act, the environment, health and safety and corporate 
responsibility.
Matters requiring Board or Committee approval are generally 
the subject of a proposal by the Executive Directors, which 
is formally submitted to the Board, together with supporting 
information, as part of the Board or Committee papers circulated 
prior to the relevant meeting. Where practicable, papers 
are generally circulated at least five days in advance of such 
meetings, to allow proper time for review and ensure the best 
use of the Directors’ time. The implementation of matters 
approved by the Board, particularly in relation to matters such 
as significant acquisitions or other material projects, sometimes 
includes the establishment of a sub-committee comprising  
at least one Non-Executive Director.
The posts of Chairman and Chief Executive are held by  
Jan  Åstrand and Russell Down, respectively. There were 
commercial reasons behind the Chairman stepping up to be an 
interim Executive Chairman for a time, the need for additional 
stability and guidance during a time of substantial Board 
changes and he worked closely with Russell Down to stabilise the 
business, undertake an essential restructuring of the Company 
and implement the remedial action programmes which have 
resulted in performance improvements. As always intended he 
reverted to a non-executive role, with effect from 30 September 
2016. During the entire time he continued to be remunerated in 
fees only, with no performance pay offered that would liken his 
pay package to that of the other Executive Directors.
The Board includes the Chairman, the two Executive Directors 
and three independent Non-Executive Directors: Bob Contreras, 
Rob Barclay and David Shearer. These three Non-Executive 
Directors bring a strong and independent non-executive element 
to the Board. The Senior Independent Director is Bob Contreras. 
The Board’s determination regarding their independence is 
detailed below. 
The Audit Committee is chaired by Bob Contreras. Its other 
members are Rob Barclay and David Shearer. In February 2015 
(when the number of Non-Executive Directors was reduced to 
two), Jan Åstrand joined the Committee and retained membership 
from that date until he stepped down on 31 March 2017. The Board 
considers that Jan Åstrand was independent on his appointment 
as Chairman, satisfying the requirement of paragraph C.3.1. of the 
Code, and for his membership of the Committee during the year 
under review.
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Rob Barclay. Its other  
members are Bob Contreras and David Shearer. In February 2015  
(when the number of Non-Executive Directors was reduced to 
two), Jan Åstrand joined the Committee and retained membership 
from that date until he stepped down on 31 March 2017. As noted 
above, the Company considers that Jan Åstrand was independent 
on his appointment as Chairman, satisfying the requirement 
of paragraph D.2.1. of the Code, and for his membership of the 
Committee during the year under review.
The Nomination Committee is chaired by Jan Åstrand. Its other 
members are Bob Contreras, Rob Barclay and David Shearer.  
The Committee therefore satisfies the requirement of paragraph 
B.2.1. of the Code that a majority of its members are to be 
independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors generally meet 
at least twice a year without the Executive Directors present. In 
addition, the Chairman regularly briefs the other Non-Executive 
Directors on relevant developments regarding the Company and 
Group as necessary. The Senior Independent Director and the 
other Non-Executive Directors will usually meet at least annually 
without the Chairman present to appraise the Chairman’s 
performance as part of the Board annual appraisal process. 44 Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Governance Corporate Governance
continued
The minutes of all meetings of the Board and each Committee 
are taken by the Company Secretary or Assistant Company 
Secretary. In addition to constituting a record of decisions taken, 
the minutes reflect questions raised by the Directors relating to 
the Company’s businesses and, in particular, issues raised from 
the reports included in the Board or Committee papers circulated 
prior to the relevant meeting. Any unresolved concerns are 
recorded in the minutes.
On resignation, written concerns (if any) provided by an outgoing 
Non-Executive Director are circulated by the Chairman to the 
remaining members of the Board.
Appropriate Directors’ and Officers’ insurance cover is arranged 
and maintained via the Company’s insurance brokers, JLT Specialty 
Limited, and is reviewed annually. 
The Companies Act 2006 allows directors of public companies to 
authorise conflicts, and potential conflicts of interest of directors, 
where the Articles of Association contain a provision to that 
effect. The Company’s Articles of Association give the Board 
authority to authorise matters which may otherwise result in 
the Directors breaching their duty to avoid a conflict of interest. 
Directors who have an interest in matters under discussion at 
a Board meeting must declare that interest and abstain from 
voting. Only Directors who have no interest in the matter being 
considered are able to approve a conflict of interest and, in taking 
that decision, the Directors must act in a way they consider, in 
good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the 
Company. The Directors are able to impose limits or conditions 
when giving authorisation if they feel this is appropriate. Any 
conflicts considered by the Board and any authorisations given 
are recorded in the Board minutes and in the register of conflicts 
which is reviewed annually by the Board. The Board considers 
that its procedures to approve conflicts of interest and potential 
conflicts of interest are operating effectively.
c hairman and c hief executive
A statement as to the division of the responsibilities between the 
Chairman and Chief Executive is included in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code Compliance Statement. The Board considered 
that the Chairman, on his appointment, met the independence 
criteria set out in paragraph B.1.1. of the Code. The Board has an 
established policy that the Chief Executive should not go on to 
become Chairman. As reported above, Jan Åstrand ceased his 
role as Executive Chairman on 30 September 2016. 
board balance and independence
The Board comprises the Chairman, two Executive Directors and 
three independent Non-Executive Directors. The independent 
Non-Executive Directors and their respective experience, details 
of which are set out on pages 40 and 41, clearly indicates that 
they are of sufficient calibre and number for their views to carry 
appropriate weight in the Board’s decisions.
The Board considers that each of Bob Contreras, Rob Barclay 
and David Shearer are independent, on the basis of the criteria 
specified in paragraph B.1.1. of the Code and, generally, are free 
from any business or other relationship which could materially 
interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.  
Bob Contreras is considered to be independent notwithstanding 
that he had previously served with Jan Åstrand on the board 
of Northgate plc (whilst neither now serve on the board of that 
company). During his time with the Company, Bob Contreras 
has demonstrated that he exercises strong and independent 
judgement and the Board feels that his proven track record and 
success with northgate plc has added significant value to the 
Board. Following the General Meeting on 9 September 2016, 
at which David Shearer was elected to the Board pursuant to 
a resolution tabled by a large shareholder, the Nomination 
Committee considered his independence. This included David 
Shearer’s confirmation of the absence of any previous or current 
commercial relationship with the nominating shareholder. The 
Committee was satisfied to recommend to the Board that he 
be regarded as independent and be appointed as a member 
of the Audit and Nomination Committees and subsequently 
the Remuneration Committee. The Board is satisfied that since 
appointment he has demonstrated to the Board independence 
from the nominating shareholder both through his conduct and 
contributions.
The Board is both balanced and diverse in respect of its 
experience and skills, although the Board does not currently 
have any female representation. The Board remains committed 
to maintaining and building on its diversity, including appointing 
women at Board and senior management levels based on merit. 
The succession planning for the Board recognises this and 
during the current process for selecting an additional Non-
Executive Director it has been requested that there be diversity 
considerations, including of gender, where possible in the 
shortlisting of candidates.
appointments to the board
The Board has established a Nomination Committee. The terms 
of reference of the Nomination Committee are published on 
the Company’s website. The Committee meets formally as 
necessary, but at least twice a year. This is detailed in more depth 
in the Nomination Committee Report on pages 52 and 53. The 
principal functions of the Nomination Committee are to consider 
and review the structure and composition of the Board and 
membership of Board Committees. It also considers candidates 
for Board nomination including job description, re- election to  
the Board for those candidates retiring by rotation and succession 
planning generally. A specification for the role of  Chairman, 
including anticipated time commitment, is included as part of 
the written statement of division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman and Chief Executive. Details of the Chairman’s other 
material commitments are set out on page 40 and are disclosed 
to the Board in advance and included in a register of the same 
maintained by the Company Secretary. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information
Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 45
The terms and conditions of appointment of all the Non-
Executive Directors, and those of the Chairman, are available 
for inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal 
business hours. Each letter of appointment specifies the 
anticipated level of time commitment including, where relevant, 
additional responsibilities derived from involvement with the 
Audit, Remuneration or Nomination Committees. Details of other 
material commitments are disclosed to the Board and a register 
of the same is maintained by the Company Secretary.
No Director is a Non-Executive Director or Chairman of a  
FTSE 100 company.
d iversity
The Board recognises the value of diversity in the boardroom 
and the benefit to the Group’s overall performance that diversity 
across backgrounds, experience, knowledge, skills and gender 
can bring. In new appointments, the Nomination Committee 
seeks to select individuals who are best able to meet the 
recommended requirements of the role and improve overall 
diversity of the Board.
information and professional development
Before each scheduled Board meeting all Directors receive 
appropriate information regarding the Group, comprising a 
financial report and briefings from senior executives. The Chief 
Executive and Group Finance Director also brief Directors on 
results, key issues and strategy. During Board meetings, the 
non-Executive Directors regularly make further enquiries of 
the Executive Directors and seek further information which is 
provided either at the relevant meeting or subsequently.
The Board recognises the importance of tailored induction 
training on joining the Board and ongoing training and education, 
particularly regarding new laws and regulations which relate to or 
affect the Group. Such training and education is obtained by the 
Directors individually through the Company, including briefings 
from external advisers, through other companies of which they 
are Directors or through associated professional firms.
Procedures are in place to enable Directors to take independent 
professional advice, if necessary, at the Company’s expense, 
in the furtherance of their duties. The procedure to enable 
such advice to be obtained is included in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code Compliance Statement.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary, whose role is to ensure that information 
is received by the Board in a timely manner, all procedures are 
followed and applicable rules and regulations are complied  
with. The appointment or removal of the Company Secretary  
is a matter specifically reserved for decision by the Board.
performance evaluation
During the year ended 31 March 2017, the Company engaged 
Condign Board Consulting (‘Condign’) to carry out a detailed 
and independent review of the Board and Board Committee 
processes, procedures and effectiveness. Condign is a firm 
which specialises in board evaluations work and has no other 
connection with the Company. The process consisted of a 
structured interview with the Chairman, each Director and the 
then Company Secretary, with an outline of the topics to be 
covered provided in advance. The evaluation also included 
a review of relevant Board papers and attendance at Board 
meetings as an observer. By way of overview, the evaluation 
concluded that following a period of considerable business 
upheaval, personnel change and shareholder activism in 2015 
and 2016, the Board is now operating once more in an efficient 
and effective way to promote the long-term success of the 
Company and value for shareholders. 
Principal findings and recommendations of the independent 
evaluation that are endorsed by the Board for implementation:
1.  In general, the individual Directors bring relevant skills and 
experience to the Board, have a high regard and mutual 
respect for each other, are all considered independent of 
the other Directors, management and shareholders, and are 
providing sufficient time to the discharge of their duties;
2.  In keeping with best practice, the Chairman stepping down 
from the Audit and Remuneration Committees;
3.  Recruitment of an additional Non-Executive Director would 
provide additional depth to the Board and options around 
Board succession and staffing of Committees;
4.  Increased Board reporting against strategic objectives and 
regular deep dives in to different strategic topics across 
the year would help maintain the right balance between 
operational and strategic matters; and
5.  Board program to include additional opportunities for Non-
Executive Directors to have exposure to senior management 
and operational site visits to deepen their appreciation of 
senior management and understanding of the business.
As reported above, and in the Nomination Committee Report, 
item 2 was effected on 31 March and item 3 is in hand. Items  
4 and 5 will be incorporated in to the Board program. 
The Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent 
Director, conducted an evaluation of the Chairman during 
FY2017, and the Senior Independent Director discussed the 
results of that assessment with the Chairman. No actions were 
considered necessary as a result of the evaluation, and the Board 
is satisfied with the Chairman’s commitment and performance. 46 Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Re-election
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, all Directors are 
subject to election by shareholders at the first Annual General 
Meeting following appointment and all Directors are subject 
to retirement by rotation provisions requiring re-election at 
intervals of no more than three years. As set out in the Directors’ 
Report, the Board has determined that in the interests of good 
governance all Directors shall be submitted for re-election 
annually commencing at the 2017 Annual General Meeting.  
This will also satisfy the re-election provisions within the 
Articles of Association. Biographical details of all the Directors 
are included in this report in order to enable shareholders to take 
an informed decision on any re-election resolution. The letters 
of appointment of each of the Non-Executive Directors and the 
Chairman confirm that appointments are for specified terms and 
that reappointment is not automatic. 
d irectors’ remuneration
The performance related elements of the remuneration of 
the Executive Directors form a significant proportion of their 
potential total remuneration packages. The performance related 
elements of the schemes in which the Executive Directors 
are entitled to participate are set out in more detail in the 
Remuneration Report. The Remuneration Committee, with the 
advice of New Bridge Street (part of Aon Plc) (NBS), reviews the 
Company’s Remuneration Policy on a regular basis, including 
the design of performance related remuneration schemes. Such 
performance related elements have been designed with a view 
to aligning the interests of the Executive Directors with those of 
shareholders and to incentivise performance at the highest level.
The service contracts for Russell Down and Chris Morgan provide 
for termination by the Company on one year’s and nine months’ 
notice respectively. It is the Company’s current policy that notice 
periods on termination of Directors’ contracts should not exceed 
12 months.
The policy of the Board is that the remuneration of the Non-
Executive Directors should be consistent with the levels 
of remuneration paid by companies of a similar size. The 
levels of remuneration also reflect the time commitment and 
responsibilities of each role, including Chairmanship of Board 
Committees. It is the policy of the Board that remuneration for 
Non-Executive Directors should not include share options or  
any other share-based incentives. 
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is dealt with 
by a Committee of the Board specifically established for this 
purpose comprising normally the Chief Executive and the Group 
Finance Director without the presence of the Non-Executive 
Directors. It is the policy of the Board to review the remuneration 
of Non-Executive Directors periodically. The remuneration of 
Non-Executive Directors was reviewed at the end of FY2017 
and the conclusion was that no increase would be made for 
FY2018, however Bob Contreras would receive additional fees 
of £5,000 per annum to reflect the additional responsibilities in 
respect of his role as Senior Independent Director. Details of the 
remuneration of Non-Executive Directors are set out on page 65.
procedure
The Board has constituted a Remuneration Committee which 
met five times during the year. The terms of reference of the 
Remuneration Committee are published on the Company’s 
website and are fully compatible with the provisions of 
paragraph D.2.1. of the Code. The Remuneration Committee 
members are Rob Barclay, Bob Contreras and David Shearer,  
who are independent of management and free from any 
business or other relationship which could materially interfere 
with the exercise of their independent judgement. The Chief 
Executive attends by invitation but is not present for discussions 
relating to his own remuneration. The Remuneration Committee 
has appointed NBS to advise it in relation to the design of 
appropriate executive remuneration structures. NBS has no  
other connection with the Company.
The responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee include 
setting Remuneration Policy, ensuring that remuneration 
(including pension rights and compensation payments) and the 
terms of service of the Executive Directors are appropriate and 
that Executive Directors are fairly rewarded for the contribution 
which they make to the Group’s overall performance. It is 
also responsible for the allocation of shares under long-term 
incentive arrangements approved by shareholders and in 
accordance with agreed criteria. In addition, it monitors current 
best practice in remuneration and related issues.
The Board’s policy is that all new long-term incentive schemes  
(as defined in the Listing Rules) and significant changes to existing 
schemes should be specifically approved by shareholders, 
while recognising that the Remuneration Committee must 
have appropriate flexibility to alter the operation of these 
arrangements to reflect changing circumstances. The Company’s 
current long-term incentive scheme was approved by 
shareholders in 2014.
A more detailed summary of the work of the Remuneration 
Committee during the year and the Group’s proposed 
Remuneration Policy for the next three years is contained  
on pages 54 to 69. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information

Accountability and audit
f inancial reporting
The Directors’ Report and Independent Auditor’s Report appear 
on pages 36 to 38 and pages 70 to 74 respectively and comply 
with the provisions of paragraphs C.1.1. and C.1.3. of the Code.
audit committee and auditors
The Board has established an Audit Committee which met 
four times during the year. The terms of reference of the Audit 
Committee are published on the Company’s website. Such terms 
of reference are compatible with the provisions of paragraph 
C.3.2. of the Code. The Board is satisfied that the Chairman of 
the Audit Committee, Bob Contreras, has appropriate recent and 
relevant financial experience.
In addition to responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal 
control, the Committee is responsible for reviewing the integrity 
of the Company’s accounts, including the half and full-year 
results, and recommending their approval to the Board.
The Committee meets on a regular basis with the external 
auditors and internal audit function, without the Executive 
Directors being present, to review and discuss issues arising from 
internal and external audits and to agree the scope and planning 
of future work. The effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit 
function is one of the matters reviewed in conjunction with the 
external auditors.
The Audit Committee has primary responsibility for making 
a recommendation on the appointment, reappointment and 
removal of the external auditors. The policy of the Audit 
Committee is to ensure auditor objectivity and independence  
is safeguarded at all times. As further detailed on page 51,  
the Audit Committee considers that the Company’s auditors  
are independent.
A more detailed description of the work of the Audit Committee 
during the year is contained in the separate report of the 
Committee on pages 48 to 51.
internal control
The Board is responsible for the Company’s internal control 
procedures and processes and for reviewing the effectiveness  
of such systems.
The Board, via the Audit Committee, conducts a review, at least 
annually, of the Group’s systems of internal control. Such  
a review considers all material controls, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls and risk management 
systems, and accords with the recommendations contained in 
the FRC’s guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and 
Related Financial and Business Reporting (formerly the Turnbull 
Guidance). A formal report is prepared by the external auditors, 
KPMG LLP (KPMG), highlighting matters identified in the course 
of its statutory audit work, and is reviewed by the Audit 
Committee in the presence of KPMG and, by invitation, the  
Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director, the Group Financial 
Controller and the Head of Risk and Assurance. The Committee 
also considers formal reports prepared and presented by the 
internal audit function. The findings and recommendations  
of the Committee are then formally reported to the Board for 
detailed consideration. 
Relations with shareholders
d ialogue with institutional shareholders
The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director routinely attend 
brokers’ and analysts’ presentations in relation to the Company’s 
half and full-year results. The Chairman, Chief Executive and 
Group Finance Director, with assistance from the Company’s 
brokers, collate feedback from such presentations and report the 
findings to the next meeting of the Board. The Chairman is also 
available to discuss matters with major shareholders in relation 
to, inter alia, results, strategy and corporate governance issues. 
The Senior Independent Director, Bob Contreras, is available to 
attend meetings with major shareholders in order to understand 
their issues and concerns should the normal communication 
channels with the Chairman, Chief Executive or Group Finance 
Director be considered ineffective or inappropriate.
During the year major investors have been engaged with and 
the top 30 have been consulted on any concerns or issues they 
may have in the governance of the Company. Any concerns have 
been shared with the Board and considered in the governance 
framework for the Company.
constructive use of the a nnual g eneral meeting
The Company’s Annual General Meeting procedures include, 
as a matter of course, specifying the level of proxies lodged on 
each resolution and the balance for and against each resolution 
and votes withheld after each has been dealt with on a show 
of hands. It is also the Company’s policy to propose a separate 
resolution at the Annual General Meeting on each substantive 
separate issue, including in relation to the Annual Report and 
Accounts and the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
All Committee Chairmen are available for shareholders’ questions 
at the Annual General Meeting.
The Company’s standard procedure is to ensure that the Notice 
of AGM and related papers are sent to shareholders at least 20 
working days before the meeting, in compliance with paragraph 
E.2.4. of the Code.  48 Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Governance Composition of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises three Non-Executive Directors: 
Bob Contreras (Chairman), Rob Barclay and David Shearer (from 
November 2016). All members are considered by the Board to  
be independent. Biographies of each of the members of the 
Audit Committee are set out on page 41.
Jan Åstrand also served on the Audit Committee until  
31 March 2017. He had joined the Audit Committee due to the 
size of the Board in 2015. He was considered independent 
on appointment as Chairman, and his skills and experience 
enhanced the Audit Committee during the period in which he 
served. With the addition of Rob Barclay (April 2016) and David 
Shearer (November 2016) to the Audit Committee, and following 
a period of overlap to provide continuity, Jan Åstrand stepped 
down from the Audit Committee.
Bob Contreras is a chartered accountant with over 20 years’ 
experience as a board member at both listed and private 
companies. He recently stepped down from the position  
of Chief Executive Officer of northgate plc, the FTSE 250 leading 
light commercial vehicle hire business in both the UK and  
Spain. Previously, Bob was President of the Surgical Division  
of  Mölnlycke Health Care Group, a world-leading manufacturer 
of products and services for the professional healthcare sector. 
He was also previously Chief Executive and Finance Director of 
private equity backed Damovo Group S.A., and Group Finance 
Director of Azlan Group plc. The Board is satisfied that Bob 
Contreras has recent and relevant financial experience and that 
the Committee has an appropriate balance of skills, experience, 
qualifications and sector related knowledge.
Attendance
The Audit Committee’s agenda is linked to events in the Group’s

Audit Committee Report
Bob Contreras
Chairman of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee presents its report in relation to the 
financial year ended 31 March 2017.
Audit Committee objectives and terms of reference
The Audit Committee’s key objectives are the review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s financial reporting and internal 
controls, together with the procedures for identification, 
evaluation and reporting of key risks. The role of the Audit 
Committee in monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial 
affairs is important to shareholders and other stakeholders, 
both internal and external. Accordingly we work closely with 
management and our external and internal auditors to adopt 
best practice approaches to policies and controls. In addition, 
a key objective of the Audit Committee is to ensure all financial 
reporting is fair, balanced and understandable. The Audit 
Committee is satisfied that the Group’s internal and external 
processes are considered to be robust and appropriately aligned 
to delivering good financial reporting and governance. The 
Directors confirm that they have carried out a comprehensive 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including 
those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity.
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee, which include 
all matters referred to in the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
are reviewed annually by the Audit Committee and proposed 
changes made to the Board. The current terms of reference can 
be found at speedyservices.com/investors and are also available 
in hard copy from the Company Secretary. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information
Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 49
Operation and responsibilities of the Audit Committee
The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director, together with 
representatives from the external auditors, the Group Financial 
Controller and the Head of Risk and Assurance, are invited to 
attend meetings of the Audit Committee, although the Audit 
Committee reserves time for discussions without any invitees 
being present. The external auditors and the Head of Risk and 
Assurance meet privately with the Audit Committee, to advise 
the Audit Committee of any matters which they consider should 
be brought to their attention without the Executive Directors 
present. The external auditors and the Head of Risk and 
Assurance may also request a meeting with the Audit Committee 
if they consider it necessary. The Risk and Assurance department 
carries out the Group’s internal audit function. The Chairman of 
the Audit Committee also holds private meetings both with the 
Head of Risk and Assurance and the external auditors.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Audit Committee. 
The members of the Audit Committee can, where they judge it 
necessary to discharge their responsibilities, obtain independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense.
The Audit Committee undertakes its activities in line with an 
annual programme of business. The Audit Committee’s duties 
include, inter alia:
internal controls and risk
 > monitoring the effectiveness and appropriateness of internal 
controls;

As part of its annual programme of business the Audit Committee 
regularly receives updates from the external auditors as to 
developing accounting standards, and members are expected to 
participate personally in relevant briefing and training sessions 
during the year.
Significant areas considered by the Audit Committee 
during Fy2017 
During the year, the Audit Committee considered and discussed 
with the external auditors the following items:
 > the existence and valuation of hire equipment;
 > the valuation, and potential for impairment of, goodwill, other 
intangible assets and property, plant and equipment;
 > the going concern basis for the preparation of the Financial 
Statements; and
 > the disclosure of a material receivable in the International 
division previously provided for.
The role and response of the Audit Committee to these, along with 
any corresponding impact on the Group’s Financial Statements, 
are discussed in more detail in this report. 
existence and valuation of hire equipment
The hire fleet comprises several million individual assets, 
represents the largest asset on the balance sheet, and underpins 
the Group’s key revenue streams.
The control environment surrounding the management of 
the hire fleet is critical to maintaining an up-to-date record of 
the assets and ensuring that they are correctly valued within 
the Financial Statements. In order to gain assurance that the 
control environment is operating in a satisfactory manner, the 
Audit Committee requires internal audit to review the asset 
management processes. The findings of these reviews are 
considered by the Audit Committee at each meeting.
In addition to considering the appropriateness of the Group’s 
depreciation policies, the Audit Committee reviews the valuation 
of hire equipment taking into consideration a consistent track 
record of the Group in disposing of hire equipment at close to 
book value. This also incorporates a thorough review of useful 
economic lives and residual values.
As a result of the work performed, the Audit Committee is 
satisfied that hire equipment assets are fairly valued. 50 Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Governance Audit Committee Report
continued
the valuation, and potential for impairment of, goodwill,  
other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment 
The Audit Committee considers on an ongoing basis whether 
any impairment in the value of assets would be appropriate. 
In considering this position the Audit Committee considers 
the discounted value of future cash flows compared with the 
carrying value of the assets. In order to form a judgement over 
the reasonableness of the discount value of future cash flows, 
the Audit Committee challenge management’s view of the 
future cash flows, applying sensitivities where appropriate, and 
concludes on an appropriate discount rate to apply in order to 
discount the cash flows. In addition, and where appropriate to do 
so, the Audit Committee takes account of the external valuation 
reports prepared in connection with the Group’s financing 
arrangements.
Following the acquisitions in FY2016 and FY2017 of the OHP 
Group and of the assets and operations of Lloyds British 
respectively, the Audit Committee has considered, and 
challenged management on, the values included in respect of 
these transactions in the Financial Statements. Taking account 
of this, in conjunction with advice from the external auditor, the 
Audit Committee is satisfied with the amounts recorded and that 
these are consistent with accounting policies.
g oing concern basis for the preparation of the  
f inancial Statements
The Group has adopted a going concern basis for the preparation 
of the Financial Statements. Judgement over the future cash 
flows of the business (for a period of at least 12 months from 
signing the accounts) and their interaction with the available 
liquidity from the Group’s borrowing facilities must be applied 
in concluding whether to adopt a going concern basis of 
preparation. The Audit Committee has challenged forecast cash 
flows, the assumptions applied to derive the cash flows and 
availability of finance from existing facilities.
During the year, the Group has remained in compliance with 
its financial covenants under the Group’s banking facilities 
which were renewed during FY2016. Net debt has again fallen 
in the year, reflecting the focus on working capital and cost 
management. Based on the expectations of future cash flows  
and the continued availability of the banking facilities, the  
Audit Committee has concluded that the available borrowing 
facilities are adequate for both existing and future levels of 
business activity. The Audit Committee therefore considers that 
it is appropriate to continue to adopt a going concern basis in the 
preparation of the Financial Statements.
presentation and recoverability of international receivable
As noted by the Company in its half-year announcement on  
10 November 2016, the Group made an exceptional impairment 
which related to an asset sale agreement entered into during 
FY2015. Following this, the Group entered into a settlement 
agreement with the purchaser. Since 1 April 2016, payments 
totalling £1.6m have been received in accordance with this 
agreement (including amounts subsequent to the end of the 
financial year) and have been recognised as an exceptional item. 
The remaining receivable amounting to £1.2m is fully provided 
given the inherent uncertainty that all the outstanding debt will 
be recovered, the Audit Committee considers that the remaining 
provision is reasonable.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control and risk management and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
The detailed review of internal controls has been delegated by 
the Board to the Audit Committee.
The Risk and Assurance Department incorporates the Group’s 
internal audit function. The Head of Risk and Assurance reports 
to the Board and to the Audit Committee. The internal audit 
function is involved in the assessment of the quality of risk 
management and internal controls. It helps to promote and 
develop further effective risk management in all areas of the 
business, including the embedding of risk registers and risk 
management procedures within individual business areas.  
The Audit Committee receives detailed reports from the Risk  
and Assurance Department at each meeting.
The Audit Committee ensured that questionnaires were 
circulated to senior management requesting they notify internal 
audit of any significant irregularities in information provided for 
inclusion in the Financial Statements. None have been reported.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of internal 
controls and risk management during the year taking into 
consideration the framework and risk register maintenance 
by management, in addition to reports from both internal and 
external auditors. The Audit Committee has concluded that the 
internal controls have operated effectively during FY2017.
Review of internal audit
The Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal audit function. This review includes the audit plan and 
the level of resource devoted to internal audit, as well as the 
degree to which the function can operate free from management 
restrictions. The Audit Committee considered the results of the 
audits undertaken by the internal audit function and in particular 
considered the response of management to issues raised by 
internal audit, including the time taken to resolve matters 
reported. Although internal audit has raised recommendations 
for improvement in the normal course of business, the Audit 
Committee is satisfied that none of these constituted significant 
control failings during FY2017.
In accordance with Attribute Standard 1312 of the Global 
Institute of Internal Auditors (‘IIA’) International Professional 
Practices Framework, an external quality assessment of internal 
audit was undertaken during the year. The review concluded that 
the Group’s internal audit function ‘Generally Conforms’ to the 
IIA standards (the highest possible rating). Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information
Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 51
During this financial year, the Audit Committee reinstated 
the circulation of a questionnaire to Directors and senior 
management inviting comments on the Risk and Assurance 
function, as it also did in respect of the external auditors and  
the Audit Committee itself. The responses are considered by  
the Audit Committee and are used in conjunction with the  
other review processes described to determine whether internal 
audit is working effectively. 
Following the review, the Audit Committee concluded that  
the Group’s internal audit function remains effective.
The Internal Audit Charter was reviewed by the Audit Committee 
during the financial year and it was determined that this 
remained fit for purpose.
Review of the work, e fectiveness and independence  
of the external auditors
The Audit Committee reviews annually the relationship between 
the Group and the external auditors and has responsibility for 
monitoring the external auditors’ independence and objectivity. 
This work includes an assessment of their performance and 
cost-effectiveness, a review of the scope of their work, as well 
as their compliance with ethical, professional and regulatory 
requirements. The Audit Committee also reviews any major 
issues which arise during the course of the audit and their 
resolution, key accounting and audit judgements, and any 
recommendations made to the Board by the auditors and the 
Board’s response. The Audit Committee is responsible for 
ensuring that an appropriate relationship is maintained between 
the Group and the external auditors.
The policy for the use of the external auditors for non-audit 
related purposes was reviewed during the year and the Board 
agreed with the proposal from the Audit Committee that the 
policy be updated to reflect current market practice and be 
applied from April 2017. The policy is designed to control the 
provision of non-audit services by the external auditors in 
order to ensure that their objectivity and independence are 
safeguarded. The policy provides that preference should be 
given to retaining consultants other than from the external 
auditors unless strong reasons exist to the contrary, and that 
non-audit fees paid to the auditor should not exceed 100% 
of the audit related fees paid in that year, and the three-year 
average of non-audit fees paid to the auditor should not exceed 
50% of the annual audit fees. The policy further requires that 
the provision of any non-audit services by the external auditors 
is subject to prior approval by the Audit Committee. The Audit 
Committee closely monitors the amount the Company spends 
with the external auditors on non-audit services. The only 
non-audit services provided by the auditors in the year relate to 
the review of the Company’s half-year results which the Audit 
Committee accepts is work best undertaken by the external 
auditors. Details of the fees, split between audit and non-audit 
services, payable to the external auditors are given in note 4  
to the Financial Statements.
The Audit Committee considered the external auditors’ 
performance during the year and reviewed the level of fees 
charged, which are considered appropriate given the size  
of the Group. The fees are detailed in note 4 to the  
Financial Statements.
Appointment of auditors
Having considered the results of the Audit Committee’s work, the 
Board is recommending the reappointment of KPMG LLP as auditors 
of the Group for FY2018. PricewaterhouseCoopers will continue to 
perform the audit of the Group’s Middle Eastern operations. KPMG 
LLP has expressed its willingness to continue as external auditors 
of the Group. Separate resolutions proposing its reappointment 
and the determination of its remuneration will be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting to be held on 12 July 2017.
As noted previously, the Group’s external audit contract was  
last tendered in April 2001. The Audit Committee recognises the 
change made by the UK Financial Reporting Council regarding 
the retendering of audit services at least once every ten years 
for companies in the FTSE 350 and above. KPMG LLP’s own 
procedures require the rotation of the lead audit partner after 
five years, which took place as at the end of FY2016 with Chris 
Hearld appointed as lead partner. Whilst the Audit Committee 
will continue to keep this area under review, the Audit 
Committee has recommended that KPMG LLP should remain as 
auditors, on the basis that the new audit partner from KPMG LLP 
is a strong and independent partner who the Audit Committee is 
satisfied will robustly challenge management appropriately.
Code of Conduct
The Company remains committed to the highest standards 
of business conduct and expects its Directors, employees, 
consultants and other stakeholders to act accordingly. The 
Company has a well-established Code of Conduct which 
incorporates a whistleblowing policy. These policies are 
actively promoted within the Group. Code of Conduct training  
is covered in our induction programme for new employees  
and where appropriate, this is reinforced on an annual basis  
via an online training course for existing employees.
Communicating with shareholders
The Company places considerable importance on communication 
with its shareholders, including both institutions and private 
shareholders. The Group’s Chief Executive and Finance Director  
are closely involved with investor relations. The Group’s Chairman  
also regularly meets with investors. The views of the Company’s 
major shareholders are reported to the Board and are regularly 
discussed at meetings of the Board and at the various committees 
of the Board, including, where appropriate, the Audit Committee.
Approval of Annual Report and Financial Statements
Having reviewed the Annual Report and Financial Statements 
and verified its contents with key internal stakeholders, the 
Audit Committee advised the Board that in its opinion the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements was fair, balanced 
and understandable overall and provides all the information 
necessary to enable shareholders to assess the performance, 
business model and strategy of the Group.
This report was approved by the Board on 15 May 2017.

Operation of the nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee generally meets on two occasions 
during a year, although it can meet more regularly if required. 
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Nomination 
Committee. The members of the Nomination Committee can, 
where they judge it necessary to discharge their responsibilities, 
obtain independent professional advice at the Company’s 
expense.
The Nomination Committee’s duties include, inter alia:
 > ensuring that there is a formal and transparent procedure 
for the appointment of new Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors to the Board and making recommendations to the 
Board on such appointments;
 > reviewing the size and composition of the Board along with 
membership of Board committees;
 > evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and experience  
on the Board;
 > ensuring that succession planning is in place for the Board  
and senior management;
 > ensuring that Non-Executive Directors are able to devote 
sufficient time to discharge their duties; and
 > making recommendations to the Board in respect of Directors 
standing for re-election.
During the year the nomination Committee undertook all of the 
duties set out above and additionally reviewed the leadership 
needs of the organisation, both executive and non-executive, 
with a view to ensuring the continued ability of the Group to 
compete effectively.
The Nomination Committee leads the process for all Board 
appointments, carefully evaluating the skills available on the 
Board and how these may be best balanced and enhanced, 
agreeing the person specification, selecting external 
recruitment consultants, considering all candidates and making 
recommendations to the Board for appointment. In selecting 
candidates, the Nomination Committee gives due consideration 
to the benefits of diversity. All recommendations made are on 
merit against objective criteria.
In reviewing the structure, size, composition and diversity of the 
Board, it was recommended that an additional Non-Executive 
Director be appointed. The Nomination Committee has agreed 
the specification and appointed Lygon Partners (an external 
search consultancy which has no other connection with the 
Company) to undertake a search. The process detailed above is 
being followed for this new appointment.
During the year David Shearer was elected to the Board by the 
shareholders at the General Meeting on 9 September 2016. 
Whilst this did not follow the usual process detailed above 
for an appointment to the Board, the Nomination Committee 
subsequently reviewed his independence and was satisfied to 
recommend to the Board that he be regarded as independent 
and be appointed a member of the Audit and Nomination 
Committees in November 2016 and the Remuneration 
Committee in March 2017.
In addition to changes at Board level, the Nomination Committee 
reviewed succession planning for key individuals, including 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors, and talent management, 
including identification of the most talented individuals for key 
management roles across the Group.
The Nomination Committee has recommended the annual 
re- election of all Directors, as detailed in the Directors’ Report 
on page 36. 
This report was approved by the Board on 15 May 2017.

Annual Statement
The Remuneration Committee presents its report in relation  
to the financial year ended 31 March 2017. This year’s report  
has been split into three sections:
 > this Annual Statement summarising major decisions and  
any outstanding changes to remuneration;
 > the Remuneration Policy Report, which sets out the Group’s 
proposed policy on the remuneration of Executive and  
Non-Executive Directors for the next three years; and
 > the Annual Remuneration Report outlining how the Group’s 
existing Remuneration Policy was implemented in FY2017.
The Remuneration Policy Report will be subject to a binding  
vote and the Annual Remuneration Report will be subject to  
an advisory vote at the 2017 Annual General Meeting (AGM).
Performance and reward for Fy2017
As noted in the Strategic Report, stronger operational 
performance and customer service delivery has led to a 
significant improvement in performance during the year, 
with Group profit before tax increasing to £14.4m from a loss 
of £57.6m. Enhanced asset utilisation has led to increased 
efficiencies with improvements in core hire revenues at  
the same time as delivering a reduction in the net book value  
of fleet assets. 
The Executive Directors were eligible to receive a bonus 
opportunity of up to 100% of salary for performance in FY2017. 
As a result of the strong financial and operational performance 
during the year, the threshold performance targets were 
exceeded and bonuses paid out at 97.43% of salary.
Due to their comparatively recent appointments, there were no 
long-term incentive awards vesting to the Executive Directors  
in the year or based on performance to 31 March 2017.
Remuneration Policy for Fy2018-Fy2020
The current Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders 
in 2014. During the course of the year, the Remuneration 
Committee reviewed the Remuneration Policy to ensure that it 
continued to support the business strategy and complied with 
the latest guidance. The Remuneration Committee concluded 
that the current policy remained fit for purpose and therefore 
no substantive changes have been made to the policy being put 
to shareholders for approval at the AGM. Some minor changes 
have been made which include changes to the wording around 
the choice of performance measures to be used for the annual 
bonus and Performance Share Plan to ensure sufficient flexibility 
and alignment to the business strategy over the next three-year 
period. Details of how the policy will be applied in FY2018 are 
set out on page 55.  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information
Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 55
Application of the Remuneration Policy in Fy2018 
The Executive Directors’ salaries were increased by 1.5% per 
annum, with effect from 1 April 2017, in line with the average 
rate of increase across the Group.
The maximum bonus opportunity remains unchanged  
at 100% of salary. The performance measures for FY2018  
will be as follows: 
 > 70% will be based on Group earnings before interest, tax and 
amortisation targets (EBITA). EBITA replaces profit before tax as 
the primary measure of financial performance for the bonus, 
providing a more targeted measure of financial performance. 
 > 20% will be based on return on capital employed (ROCE). 
ROCE has been included as a specific bonus metric in FY2018 
(replacing asset optimisation). ROCE measures how well the 
Group delivers a return on the capital invested and is seen  
as a key performance indicator for the business. 
 > 10% will continue to be based on UK & Ireland core  
hire revenues. 
Outstanding performance will be required for the maximum 
bonus to become payable, with no bonus payable unless the 
minimum EBITA threshold is achieved. The forward looking 
targets are deemed to be commercially sensitive but further 
details will be disclosed on a retrospective basis in next year’s 
Annual Report and Accounts.
Performance share awards will continue to be granted over 
shares worth 100% of salary. Awards will be based on relative 
total shareholder return (TSR) (50% of the award) and earnings 
per share (EPS) growth targets (50% of the award) over three 
financial years. A two-year post vesting holding period applies. 
Details of the performance targets for the 2017 awards are set 
out in the Annual Remuneration Report. 
Employee engagement
When considering the remuneration policy for the Executive 
Directors, the Remuneration Committee takes into account 
pay and employment conditions across the Company. Every 
employee in Speedy participates in a bonus scheme relevant to 
their role, ensuring all employees are able to share in the success 
of the organisation. In addition, alongside the Company wide 
salary review process where the average increase was 1.5%, 
investment has also been made during the year to ensure that 
employee pay remains above the National Living Wage and 
further increases have been given to employees in key roles 
where recruitment and retention is a priority. 
Shareholder engagement
The Committee takes an active interest in shareholder views on 
the Company’s executive remuneration policy and is mindful of 
the concerns of shareholders and other stakeholders and we  
will continue to take into account the views of our shareholders 
as appropriate.
In conclusion, we firmly believe that the proposed Remuneration 
Policy is in the best interests of the Company and is appropriately 
aligned with the strategic goals of the Group in delivering 
shareholder value and supporting the long-term success of the 
Group and look forward to receiving your continued support for 
the resolutions relating to the proposed Remuneration Policy 
and Annual Remuneration Report.

Changes to the Remuneration Policy approved  
by shareholders at the 2014 AGm
The Remuneration Committee has undertaken a thorough review 
of the existing Remuneration Policy, taking full account of the 
Group’s strategic objectives and developments in the executive 
pay environment. The Remuneration Committee firmly believes 
that the current overarching Remuneration Policy continues to be 
effective and that no significant changes are required. However, 
some minor amendments have been proposed to ensure that the 
policy is sufficiently flexible to operate effectively over the next 
three-year period (e.g. the Remuneration Committee has built in 
some additional flexibility with regard to the specific measures 
which will be used for the bonus and PSP to ensure that any 
targets are fully aligned with the strategic imperatives prevailing 
at the time they are set).

Remuneration Policy Report
This part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out the 
Remuneration Policy for the Group. This revised Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy will be put to shareholders for approval  
in a binding vote at the AGM on 12 July 2017. The effective date 
of the revised policy will be 12 July 2017. The Remuneration 
Committee’s current intention is that the revised policy will 
operate for the three-year period to the AGM in 2020. 
Policy overview
The primary objective of the Remuneration Policy is to promote 
the long-term success of the Group. In working towards the 
fulfilment of this objective the Remuneration Committee takes 
into account a number of factors when setting the Remuneration 
Policy for the Executive Directors including the following:
 > the need to attract, retain and motivate high calibre Executive 
Directors and senior management;
 > internal pay and benefits levels and practice and employment 
conditions within the Group as a whole; 
 > the recommendations set out in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and the views of shareholders and their representative 
bodies; and
 > periodic external comparisons to examine current market 
trends and practices and equivalent roles in similar 
companies taking into account their size, business complexity, 
international scope and relative performance.
Our remuneration structure is intended to be simple and 
transparent, and to contribute to the building of a sustainable 
performance culture. The main elements of the remuneration 
package for Executive Directors are a base salary, benefits 
and pension provision and, subject to stretching performance 
conditions, an annual bonus plan and shares awarded under  
a Performance Share Plan (PSP).
The key principles of the policy are:
 > base salaries between lower quartile and median, but with 
the potential to earn above-market rewards for sustained 
exceptional performance provided that stretching and 
demanding performance conditions, designed to promote  
the long-term success of the Group, are met;
 > a reward structure that balances short-term and long-term 
performance; and
 > competitive incentive arrangements, ensuring a focus on 
business performance and alignment with the interests of 
shareholders.
As a result, the Remuneration Committee has determined 
that the remuneration of Executive Directors will provide an 
appropriate balance between fixed and performance related 
pay elements. The Remuneration Committee will continue to 
review the Remuneration Policy to ensure it takes due account 
of remuneration best practice and that it remains aligned with 
shareholders’ interests. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information

notes:
1   The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus scheme reflect the Remuneration Committee’s belief that any incentive compensation 
should be appropriately challenging and tied to both the delivery of key financial targets and individual and/or strategic performance measures intended 
to ensure that Executive Directors are incentivised to deliver across a range of objectives for which they are accountable. The Remuneration Committee has 
retained some flexibility on the specific measures which will be used to ensure that any measures are fully aligned with the strategic imperatives prevailing  
at the time they are set.
2   The performance conditions applicable to the PSP awards were selected by the Remuneration Committee on the basis that a combination of relative TSR and 
key financial objectives provides strong alignment with the delivery of long-term returns to shareholders and incentivises strong Group financial performance – 
consistent with the Company’s objective of delivering superior levels of long-term value to shareholders. The Remuneration Committee has retained flexibility 
on the measures which will be used for future award cycles to ensure that the measures are fully aligned with the strategy prevailing at the time the awards 
are granted. notwithstanding this, the Remuneration Committee would seek to consult with major shareholders in advance of any material change to the 
choice or weighting of the PSP performance measures.
3   The Remuneration Committee operates the annual bonus, PSP and all-employee share plans in accordance with the relevant plan rules and where 
appropriate, the Listing Rules and HMRC legislation. The Remuneration Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas 
relating to the operation and administration of the plans. These include, for example, the timing of awards and setting performance criteria each year, dealing 
with leavers, discretion to retrospectively amend performance targets in exceptional circumstances (providing the new targets are no less challenging than 
originally envisaged) and in respect of share awards, to adjust the number of shares subject to an award in the event of a variation in the share capital of the 
Company.
4   Consistent with HMRC legislation, the all-employee Sharesave scheme does not have performance conditions.
5   Directors are eligible to receive payment, and any existing award may vest, in accordance with the terms of any such award made prior to the approval  
of the Remuneration Policy detailed in this report, and in accordance with the provisions of the Remuneration Policy in force at the time such award or right  
to receive payment was made or granted. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information
Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 61
How employees’ pay is taken into account
The Remuneration Committee does not directly consult with 
employees regarding the remuneration of directors. However, 
the pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group are considered 
when designing the policy for Executive Directors and continue 
to be considered in relation to implementation of the policy. 
The Remuneration Committee regularly interacts with the HR 
function and senior operational executives and monitors pay 
trends across the workforce. Salary increases will ordinarily 
be (in percentage of salary terms) in line with those of the 
wider workforce. The requirement to consider wider pay and 
employment conditions elsewhere in the Group is considered 
by the Remuneration Committee to be a key objective and is 
embedded in the Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference.
How the Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
relates to the wider Group
The Remuneration Policy described above provides an overview 
of the structure that operates for the most senior executives 
in the Group. Employees below executive level have a lower 
proportion of their total remuneration made up of incentive-
based remuneration, with remuneration driven by market 
comparators and the impact of the role in question. Long-term 
incentives are reserved for those judged as having the greatest 
potential to influence the Group’s strategic direction, earnings 
growth and share price performance.
Consistent with the Group’s approach of recognising the 
contribution of its employees at all levels in the business, the 
Group operates a long-term service award scheme under which 
employees serving 10, 20 and 25 years receive a range of 
additional benefits, including additional days of annual holiday 
entitlement. These benefits are popular amongst employees 
and the Group believes that they fulfil a business need by 
encouraging and rewarding the loyalty and motivation of long-
serving employees and by rewarding those employees with 
higher levels of experience.
How shareholders’ views are taken into account
The Remuneration Committee takes an active interest in 
shareholder views on our executive remuneration policy and is 
mindful of the concerns of shareholders and other stakeholders. 
The Remuneration Committee seeks to engage with its major 
shareholders when any significant changes to the Remuneration 
Policy are proposed. The Remuneration Committee also 
considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report each year and this, plus any 
additional feedback received from time to time, is considered 
as part of the Remuneration Committee’s annual review of 
Remuneration Policy. The Remuneration Committee also closely 
monitors developments in institutional investors’ best practice 
expectations.
Approach to recruitment and promotions
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would 
be set in accordance with the terms of the prevailing approved 
Remuneration Policy at the time of appointment and take into 
account the skills and experience of the individual, the market 
rate for a candidate of that experience and the importance of 
securing the relevant individual.
Salary would be provided at such a level as required to attract 
the most appropriate candidate and may be set initially at a 
below mid-market level on the basis that it may progress towards 
the mid-market level once expertise and performance have been 
proven and sustained.
The maximum level of variable pay which may be awarded 
to new Executive Directors, excluding the value of any buy-
out arrangements, will be in line with the policy set above. In 
addition, the Remuneration Committee may offer additional cash 
and/or share-based elements to replace deferred or incentive 
pay forfeited by an executive leaving a previous employer. It will, 
where possible, ensure that these awards are consistent with 
awards forfeited in terms of vesting periods and expected value.
The Remuneration Committee may apply different performance 
measures, performance periods and/or vesting periods for 
initial awards made following appointment under the annual 
bonus and/or long-term incentive arrangements, subject to the 
rules of the plan, if it determines that the circumstances of the 
recruitment merit such alteration. A PSP award can be made 
shortly following an appointment (assuming the Company is not 
in a closed period).
For an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable pay 
element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to 
pay out according to its original terms.
For external and internal appointments, the Remuneration 
Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain 
relocation and/or incidental expenses as appropriate.
The fee structure and quantum for Non-Executive Director 
appointments will be based on the prevailing Non-Executive 
Director fee policy.
The Board evaluation and succession planning processes in place 
are designed to ensure there is the correct balance of skills, 
experience and knowledge on the Board. The activities of the 
Nomination Committee overseeing these matters are disclosed 
in the Nomination Committee Report. 62 Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Governance Remuneration Report
continued
In relation to a termination of employment, the Remuneration 
Committee may make payments in relation to any statutory 
entitlements or payments to settle compromise claims as 
necessary. The Remuneration Committee also retains the 
discretion to reimburse reasonable legal expenses incurred 
in relation to a termination of employment and to meet any 
transitional costs if deemed necessary. Payment may also be 
made in respect of accrued benefits, including untaken holiday 
entitlement.
There is no provision for additional compensation on a change 
of control. In the event of a change of control, the PSP awards 
will normally vest on (or shortly before) the change of control 
subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance 
conditions at that time and, unless the Remuneration Committee 
determines otherwise, reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion 
of the vesting period served. Outstanding awards under any 
all-employee share plans will vest in accordance with the 
relevant scheme plan. Bonuses may become payable, subject 
to performance and, unless the Remuneration Committee 
determines otherwise, a pro-rata reduction to reflect the 
curtailed performance period.
External appointments
The Board allows Executive Directors to accept appropriate 
outside commercial non-executive director appointments 
provided the aggregate commitment is compatible with their 
duties as Executive Directors. The Executive Directors concerned 
may retain fees paid for these services, which will be subject to 
approval by the Board. No Non-Executive Directorships in a listed 
company were held by the Executive Directors during the year.
non-Executive Directors
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not have contracts 
of service, but their terms are set out in letters of appointment. 
Appointments are subject to annual re-election by shareholders 
at the AGM and may be terminated by three months’ notice on 
either side. The letters of appointment of the Non-Executive 
Directors, copies of which are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office during normal business hours, 
specify an anticipated time commitment of 50 days per annum in 
relation to Jan Åstrand and 15 days in relation to Bob Contreras, 
Rob Barclay and David Shearer. Relevant appointment letter and 
term dates of the Non-Executive Directors are set out as follows:

Service contracts and approach to leavers
The Company’s policy is for Executive Directors to have service 
contracts which may be terminated with no more than 12 months’  
notice from either party. The Executive Directors’ service contracts 
are available for inspection by shareholders at the Company’s 
registered office.
The relevant dates of service contracts and notice periods for the 
current Executive Directors are set out as follows:
Executive Director Date of contract Notice period
Russell Down 8 January 2015 12 months
Chris Morgan 13 January 2016 9 months
no Executive Director has the benefit of provisions in his 
or her service contract for the payment of pre-determined 
compensation in the event of termination of employment. 
It is the Remuneration Committee’s policy that the service 
contracts of Executive Directors will provide for termination 
of employment by giving notice or by making a payment of 
an amount equal to the monthly basic salary and pension 
contributions in lieu of notice. It is the Remuneration 
Committee’s policy that no Executive Director should be entitled 
to a notice period or payment on termination of employment in 
excess of the levels set out in his or her service contract and in 
determining amounts payable on termination, the Remuneration 
Committee will take into consideration the Executive Director’s 
duty to mitigate his or her loss.
Annual bonus may be payable with respect to the period of 
the financial year served although it will be pro-rated for time 
and paid at the normal pay-out date. Different performance 
targets may be set for the remainder of this bonus period 
to reflect the Directors’ specific responsibilities. Any share-
based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under the 
Company’s share plans will be determined based on the relevant 
plan rules. In certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, ill 
health, disability or other circumstances at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee, ‘good leaver’ status may be applied. 
For good leavers, awards will normally vest at the normal vesting 
date, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance 
conditions at that time and reduced pro-rata to reflect the 
proportion of the vesting period actually served. However, under 
the plan rules, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to 
determine that awards vest at cessation of employment and/or  
to disapply the time pro-rating requirement if it considers  
it appropriate to do so. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information

At the invitation of the Remuneration Committee Chairman, 
other members of the Board and senior management may attend 
meetings of the Remuneration Committee, except when their 
own remuneration is under consideration. No Directors are 
involved in determining their own remuneration. The Company 
Secretary acts as the secretary to the Remuneration Committee. 
The members of the Remuneration Committee can, where they 
judge it necessary to discharge their responsibilities, obtain 
independent professional advice at the Group’s expense.
The Remuneration Committee’s duties include:
 > to make recommendations to the Board on the Group’s 
framework and policy for the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors, Company Secretary and senior executives;
 > to review and determine, on behalf of the Board, executive 
remuneration and incentive packages to ensure such packages 
are fair and reasonable;
 > to review Directors’ expenses;
 > to determine the basis on which the employment of executives 
is terminated;
 > to design the Group’s share incentive schemes and other 
performance related pay schemes, and to operate and 
administer such schemes;
 > to determine whether awards made under performance  
related and share incentive schemes should be made, the  
overall amount of the awards, the individual awards to  
executives and the performance targets to be used;
 > to ensure that no Director is involved in any decisions  
as to his/her own remuneration; and
 > to review regularly the ongoing appropriateness and 
effectiveness of all remuneration policies.
During FY2017, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the 
following matters at its meetings:
 > determination of FY2016 bonuses for the Executive Directors 
and senior managers;
 > determination of executive remuneration structure and policy 
for FY2018;
 > interim and final progress of employee share plan performance 
measures against targets and consequent approval of any 
vesting of awards;
 > grant of any awards to be made in FY2018 under the 
performance share plan;
 > progress of bonus achievement for FY2017 executive bonuses;
 > 25-year long service awards for eligible employees;
 > terms of reference for, and effectiveness of, the Remuneration 
Committee;
 > ongoing appropriateness and effectiveness of remuneration 
and benefits policies for Executive Directors and employees 
generally;
 > performance of external remuneration advisers;
 > use of equity for employee share plans in relation to dilution 
headroom limits; and
 > determining remuneration arrangements for senior 
management joiners and leavers.
The Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference are published 
on the Company’s website at speedyservices.com/investors and 
are also available in hard copy on application to the Company 
Secretary. 
Advisers
During the year, the Remuneration Committee received advice 
from New Bridge Street (part of Aon plc), an independent 
remuneration consultancy, in connection with remuneration 
matters including the provision of general guidance on market 
and best practice, the review of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy and the production of this report. New Bridge Street 
has no other connection or relationship with the Group, and 
provided no other services to the Group during FY2017.  
Fees paid to New Bridge Street for FY2017 totalled 
£37,155 (excluding VAT) in respect of advice provided to 
the Remuneration Committee and for related matters. The 
Remuneration Committee also sought advice from the Group’s 
legal advisers, Pinsent Masons LLP, in connection with the 
production of this report, the operation of the 2004 Performance 
Share Plan (now expired), the 2014 Performance Share Plan and 
the all-employee share scheme (SAYE). 64 Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

EBITA has replaced profit before tax as the primary measure  
of financial performance under the bonus plan for FY2018  
to provide a more targeted measure of financial performance. 
ROCE has been included as a specific bonus metric in FY2018 
(replacing asset optimisation). ROCE measures how well the 
Group delivers a return on capital invested and is seen as a key 
performance indicator for the business. UK & Ireland core hire 
revenue continues to account for 10% of the overall bonus, 
reflecting our priority to improve asset productivity. The forward 
looking targets are deemed to be commercially sensitive but full 
details will be disclosed on a retrospective basis in next year’s 
Annual Report and Accounts. 
Outstanding performance will be required for a maximum bonus 
to become payable, with no bonus payable unless the minimum 
EBITA threshold is achieved. A clawback provision will continue 
to operate for a 36-month period.
l ong-term incentive plans
The 2014 Performance Share Plan (PSP) will continue to operate 
as the Company’s primary long-term incentive arrangement, 
whereby awards over shares will normally vest three years 
from grant, subject to continued employment and performance 
conditions based on relative total shareholder return (TSR) and 
earnings per share (EPS) growth. It is intended that Executive 
Director award levels in FY2018 will be over shares worth no 
more than 100% of salary.
In respect of performance targets for awards to be granted in 
FY2018:
 > 50% of each award will be subject to an EPS condition. 25% of 
this part of an award vests for threshold EPS in FY2020 (before 
amortisation and exceptional costs) with full vesting of this 
part of an award for maximum EPS or better. A sliding scale 
operates between these points. The threshold and maximum 
EPS targets had not been finalised at the date this report was 
signed, with full disclosure of the target range to be provided 
in the RnS stock exchange announcement issued following  
the grant;
 > 50% of each award will be subject to a TSR condition based 
on the Group’s performance against FTSE 250 companies 
(excluding investment trusts) as at the date of grant. 25% of 
this part of an award vests if the Company’s TSR is at a median 
of the ranking of the TSRs of the comparator group increasing 
pro-rata to full vesting of this part of an award for upper 
quartile performance or better;
 > in addition to the above, no part of the award subject to the 
TSR condition will vest unless the Committee is also satisfied 
that the TSR performance of the Company is reflective of the 
Group’s underlying performance; and
 > clawback provisions and a two-year post vesting holding 
period will continue to be applied to Executive Directors.
Implementation of the Remuneration Policy 
for Fy2018
The sections of the Annual Remuneration Report that have been 
audited by KPMG LLP are page 65 from ‘Non-Executive Directors’ 
to page 68 up to and including ‘Directors’ interests in the share 
capital of the Company’, but excluding paragraphs concerning 
‘Details of long-term incentive plan awards outstanding’, 
‘Dilution’, ‘Percentage change in Chief Executive’s remuneration’ 
and ‘Shareholder voting at AGM’.
Base salary
Base salaries for each Executive Director are reviewed annually 
by the Remuneration Committee, taking account of the Director’s 
performance, experience and responsibilities with any changes 
effective from 1 April. When determining Executive Directors’ 
base salaries, the Remuneration Committee has regard to 
economic factors, remuneration trends and the general level 
of salary increases awarded throughout the Group. Executive 
Directors’ salaries were increased by 1.5% per annum which 
was in line with the average rate of increase across the Group. 
Current base salaries are as follows:
From 
1 April 2017
From 
1 April 2016
% increase 
in year
Russell Down £355,250 £350,000 1.5%
Chris Morgan £243,600 £240,000 1.5%
Until 30 September 2016 when the Chairman reverted to  
non-executive status, the Chairman was eligible to receive  
a daily rate in excess of his normal fee to the extent that his  
actual time commitment exceeded that agreed for his  
Non-Executive Chairman role. Additional fees of £13,125  
were paid during FY2017 (of which £10,625 were payable  
for services provided during FY2016 and £2,500 payable  
for services provided during FY2017).
Benefits in kind and pension
The Group operates a policy whereby Executive Directors 
and senior management are offered a car or cash alternative 
(as appropriate), health insurance, life cover and pension 
contributions, or cash in lieu of pension contributions (further 
details of which are set out on page 58).
The Group does not operate a defined benefit pension scheme 
and has no plans to introduce such a scheme.
Performance related annual bonus
The Remuneration Committee’s policy continues to be that 
Executive Directors in the Group should be included in some 
form of incentive scheme as soon as practicable after joining  
the Group.
For FY2018, the maximum bonus opportunity will continue to  
be limited to 100% of salary. The bonus opportunity will be  
split as follows:
 > 70% will be based on Group earnings before interest,  
tax and amortisation targets (‘EBITA’); and 
 > 30% will be based on strategic/financial targets (namely, 
return on capital employed (‘ROCE’) (20%) and hire revenue 
targets (10%)). Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information

Dilution
The Performance Share Plan and SAYE share option schemes provide that overall dilution through the issuance of new shares for 
employee share schemes should not exceed an amount equivalent to 10% of the Company’s issued share capital over a ten-year 
period. Within this 10% limit, dilution through the Performance Share Plan is limited to an amount equivalent to 5% of the Company’s 
issued share capital over a ten-year period. Both limits are in line with institutional shareholder guidelines.
The Committee monitors the position prior to making awards under these schemes to ensure that the Company remains within these 
limits. As at the date of this report, 2.12% of the 5% limit and 4.14% of the 10% limit have been used.
t ermination payments
no Director left in the year and no compensation for loss of office was paid. The principles governing compensation for loss of office 
payments are set out on page 62.
Payments to past Directors
The award granted to Steve Corcoran under the Company’s 2004 Performance Share Plan on 21 June 2013 (590,508 shares under 
award) lapsed in June 2016 as a result of the performance conditions not being met.
The award granted to Lynn Krige under the Company’s 2004 Performance Share Plan on 21 June 2013 (415,851 shares under award)

award) lapsed in June 2016 as a result of the performance conditions not being met. The award granted to him under the Company’s 
2014 Performance Share Plan on 24 November 2014 (112,951 shares under award) will lapse in November 2017 as a result of the 
performance conditions not being met. As disclosed last year, as part of his termination arrangements, Mark Rogerson was paid a total 
of £98,000 during FY2017 relating to payments in lieu of notice and the agreed monthly pension contributions. 68 Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

There have been no changes in the interests of any current Director in the share capital of Speedy Hire Plc between 1 April 2017 and 
the date of this report.
Share ownership guidelines
Executive Directors are expected to build and maintain a shareholding of 100% of salary. Russell Down joined the Board in April 2015 
and Chris Morgan joined in April 2016. Neither currently meets this level due to being relatively recent appointments. Directors are 
expected to retain a proportion of shares vesting under their share awards (after tax) until such time as the guidelines are met.

Opinions and conclusions 
arising from our audit
70  The risk Our response
Hire equipment
(£194.8 million; 2016 restated: 
£219.9m)
Refer to page 49 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 84 
(accounting policy) and page 99 
(financial disclosures).
Physical quantities 
The Group has more than four million 
items of equipment, and a high 
frequency of movement in individual 
assets, through asset purchases, 
physical hires and disposals. As such 
there is inherent difficulty in 
maintaining an accurate fixed assets 
register. 
Subjective estimate 
Judgement is applied by management 
in the estimation of useful
economic lives and residual values 
which are based on both historical 
experience and an assessment of the 
nature of the assets involved.
Our procedures included: 
— Control design and re-performance: 
Testing the design and operating 
effectiveness of key controls including the 
reconciliation of the fixed asset register to 
the accounting ledgers.
— Count design and attendance: Testing 
the design of controls operating over hire 
equipment counts. For a sample of hire 
equipment counts, performing test counts 
to ensure the accuracy of the counting. For 
the sample verifying that the records from 
the counts had been accurately reflected 
on the fixed asset register.
— Tests of details: Agreeing a statistical 
sample of assets acquired and disposed of 
during the year to third party evidence. 
Comparing the hire fleet register for the 
current year to prior year to determine any 
changes made to useful economic lives 
and residual values and reviewing any 
changes to ensure they are consistent with 
accounting policies. Reviewing profit or 
loss on disposal of hire equipment to 
support the reasonableness of the useful 
economic lives and residual values applied.
— Sector experience: Comparing the hire 
fleet register to hire revenue information to 
identify the net book value of assets not 
recently hired to customers. Identifying 
from this analysis those assets we 
consider to be at highest risk of 
obsolescence and challenging 
management to provide evidence over the 
existence, and valuation, of these assets. 
— Assessing transparency: assessing the
adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in 
respect of the judgements and estimates 
involved in arriving at the valuation of hire 
equipment.
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest
effect on our audit, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows:
 71 The risk Our response
Trade Receivables 
(£83.3 million; 2016: £74.9m)
Refer to page 50 (Audit 
Committee Report), page [ ] 
(accounting policy) and page [ ] 
(financial disclosures).
Subjective valuation
The Group’s customers operate in the 
construction market which may result 
in an increased risk of non-
recoverability of trade receivables.
The International business’s customer 
base in the Middle East increases the 
risk associated with the recoverability 
of trade receivables as longer payment 
terms are given in those jurisdictions, 
which could delay the identification of
irrecoverable trade receivables. 
Our procedures included: 
— Control design and re-performance: 
Identification and testing of the operating 
effectiveness of key controls including 
credit control procedures and sales ledger 
reconciliations.
— Historical Comparison: Assessing the 
methodology used to calculate the 
provision recorded against trade 
receivables, challenging the 
appropriateness of these provisions based 
on historical bad debt write offs.
— Sector experience: After analysing the 
level of cash receipts post year end 
identifying a risk based sample of 
receivables obtaining. For this sample 
obtaining a detailed understanding of the 
payment status of the receivable balance 
and the customer’s likelihood of payment 
including independently verifying the 
customer’s latest credit score.
— Assessing transparency: assessing the 
adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in 
relation to the degree of estimation 
involved in arriving at the carrying amount 
of the trade receivables balance.
We continue to perform procedures over the valuation of intangible assets. However, following the impairment of £45.9m of 
goodwill in 2016, it is considered that no reasonable change in assumptions would cause an impairment and as such we have 
not assessed this as one of the risks that had the greatest effect on our audit and, therefore, it is not separately identified in 
our report this year.

72  3. Our application of materiality and an
overview of the scope of our audit
Materiality for the Group Financial Statements as a 
whole was set at £0.675 million (2016: £0.5 million), 
determined with reference to a benchmark of Group 
profit before tax, normalised to exclude exceptional 
items (as disclosed in note 3 to the Financial 
Statements), of which it represents 4.7% (2016: 
4.5%). In 2016 the benchmark was averaged over a 
three-year period due to the volatility in the 2016 
reported level of profit before tax, normalised to 
exclude exceptional items. 
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected or 
uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding 
£33,500 (2016: £25,000),in addition to other 
identified misstatements that warranted
reporting on qualitative grounds.
The Group team performed procedures on the 
exceptional items excluded from normalised group 
profit before tax.
Of the Group’s eight reporting components, seven 
(2016: seven) were subjected to audit for Group 
reporting purposes and one (2016: one) was subject 
to specified risk-focussed audit procedures by the 
Group audit team. The work on the two 
International components was performed by 
component auditors. The work on the other six 
components was performed by the Group audit 
team. This scoping is consistent with the prior year.
The Group audit team instructed the component 
auditors as to the significant areas to be covered 
during their audit, including the relevant risks 
detailed above, and the information to be
reported to the Group auditor from the component. 
The Group audit team approved the component 
materialities to be applied, which ranged from 
£63,000 to £650,000 (2016: a range of £63,000 to 
£475,000) having regard to the mix of size and risk 
profile of the Group across the components.
The component for which we performed specified 
risk-focussed procedures was not individually 
financially significant enough to require an audit for 
Group reporting purposes, but did present specific 
individual risks that needed to be addressed. We 
subjected one (2016: one) component to specified 
risk-focussed audit procedures over revenue and 
profit for the period. 
The Group audit team held telephone conference 
meetings with the component auditors. At these 
meetings, the findings reported to the Group audit 
team were discussed in more detail, and any further 
work required by the Group audit team was then 
performed by the component auditors.

 73 4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the
Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
— the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006; and
— the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year is consistent 
with the Financial Statements.
Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the 
course of the audit of the Financial Statements and from 
reading the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report:
— we have not identified material misstatements in those 
reports; and 
— in our opinion, those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
5. We have nothing to report on the disclosures of
principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we
have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation
to:
— the Directors’ Viability Statement on page 33,
concerning the principal risks, their management, and, 
based on that, the Directors’ assessment and 
expectations of the Group’s continuing in operation 
over the three years to 31 March 2020; or
— the disclosures in note 1 of the Financial Statements 
concerning the use of the going concern basis of 
accounting.
6. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters
on which we are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to
you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our
audit, we have identified other information in the Annual
Report that contains a material inconsistency with either
that knowledge or the Financial Statements, a material
misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
— we have identified material inconsistencies between
the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the 
Directors’ statement that they consider that the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements taken as a whole is 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy; or
— the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit 
Committee. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
— adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
— the parent company Financial Statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are 
not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns; or
— certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or
— we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  
— the Directors’ statements, set out on pages 36 and 33, 
in relation to going concern and longer-term viability; 
and   
— the part of the Corporate Governance statement on 
page 42 relating to the Company’s compliance with the 
eleven provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above 
responsibilities.  
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 39 the Directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. A description of the 
scope of an audit of Financial Statements is provided on the 
Financial Reporting Council’s website at 
www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is made solely 
to the Company’s members as a body and is subject to 
important explanations and disclaimers regarding our 
responsibilities, published on our website at 
www.kpmg.com/uk/auditscopeukco2014a, which are 
incorporated into this report as if set out in full and should be 
read to provide an understanding of the purpose of this report, 
the work we have undertaken and the basis of our opinions.

Financial statements Notes to the Financial Statements
1 Accounting policies
Speedy Hire Plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The consolidated Financial Statements of the 
Company for the year ended 31 March 2017 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ’Group‘). 
The consolidated and Parent Company Financial Statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 15 May 2017.
Statement of compliance
Both the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (‘IFRS‘). 
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial instruments are held at fair value. 
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated Financial 
Statements.
Further information on the Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance 
and position, is set out in the Strategic Report. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the Financial Review. In addition, note 18 to the Financial Statements includes the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities and its exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
The Group signed a £180m asset-based revolving credit facility (‘the facility‘) in September 2014, which matures in September 2019 
and has no prior scheduled repayment requirements. 
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through operating cash flows, supplemented as necessary by 
borrowings. The Directors have presented a Viability Statement in the Strategic Report on page 33 which confirms that the Group 
is capable of continuing to operate within its existing loan facilities and can meet the covenant tests set out within the facility. The 
key assumptions on which the projections are based include an assessment of the impact of future market conditions on projected 
revenues and an assessment of the net capital investment required to support the expected level of revenues.
Whilst the Directors consider that there is a degree of subjectivity involved in their assumptions, on the basis of the above the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements.
Basis of consolidation
(a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to variable returns, and has the 
ability to use its power to alter its returns from its involvement with the entity. The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are included in 
the consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Intra-group balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are 
eliminated in preparing the consolidated Financial Statements. 
(b) Jointly controlled entities
A jointly controlled entity is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group undertakes economic activity that is subject to joint 
control with third parties. The Group’s interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method. Under this 
method, the Group’s share of the profit less losses of jointly controlled entities is included in the income statement and its interest in 
their net assets is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet. The Group’s interest in the entity is the carrying amount 
of the investment together with any long-term loan balances and interest that, in substance, form part of the net investment in the 
entity. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information

1 Not yet endorsed by the EU.
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ – The standard was endorsed on 22 November 2016 and applies to an entity’s first annual statements 
beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The revised standard replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement 
and introduces new guidance for classification and measurement, impairment of financial instruments, and hedge accounting. The 
cumulative impact on adoption of this standard is not expected to be significant.
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customer’ – The standard was endorsed on 22 September 2016 and applies to an entity’s first 
annual statements beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The standard will replace IAS 18 Revenue. The standard introduces a new 
revenue recognition model that recognises revenue either at a point in time or over time. The model features a contract-based five-
step analysis of transactions to determine whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. We are assessing the impact of IFRS 
15 and will conduct a systematic review to ensure that the impact of the new standard is fully understood in advance of the effective 
date. It is not currently practicable to quantify the impact of this standard.
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ – In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 and it is expected to apply to an entity’s first annual statements beginning 
on or after 1 January 2019. IFRS 16 changes fundamentally the accounting for leases by lessees. It eliminates the current IAS 17 dual 
accounting model, which distinguishes between on-balance sheet finance leases and off-balance sheet operating leases and, instead, 
introduces a single, on-balance sheet accounting model that is similar to current finance lease accounting. In preparation for the 
adoption of IFRS 16, in the Financial Statements for the year ending 31 March 2020, management are in the process of assessing the 
potential impact.  84 Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates.
Revenue is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the hire.
Revenue arising from planned disposals of hire fleet assets, fuel and consumables is recognised in the income statement when the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.
Revenue arising from services is recognised in the income statement when the service is performed.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes 
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and refurbishments to assets where the refurbishment extends 
the asset’s useful economic life. 
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is charged to the income statement so as to write off the cost of the assets over their 
estimated useful economic lives after taking account of estimated residual values. Residual values and estimated useful economic 
lives are reassessed at least annually. Land is not depreciated. Hire equipment assets are depreciated so as to write them down to 
their residual value over their normal working lives which range from three to fifteen years depending on the category of the asset. 
The principal rates and methods of depreciation used are as follows:
Hire equipment
 > Tools and general equipment – between three and seven years straight-line
 > Access equipment – five to fifteen years straight-line
 > Surveying equipment – five years straight-line
 > Power equipment – between five and ten years straight-line
Non-hire assets
 > Freehold buildings, and long leasehold improvements – over the shorter of the lease period and 50 years straight-line
 > Short leasehold property improvements – over the period of the lease
 > Fixtures and fittings and office equipment (excluding IT) – 25%-45% per annum straight-line
 > IT equipment and software –  between three and five years straight-line, or over the   
period of the software licence (if shorter)
 > Motor vehicles – 25% per annum straight-line
Planned disposals of hire equipment are transferred, at net book value, to inventory prior to sale.
Start-up expenses and lease incentives
Legal and start-up expenses incurred in respect of new hire depots are written off as incurred. 
Premiums paid or incentives received (including rent-free periods extending beyond a depot’s opening date) on the acquisition  
of trading locations are written off on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. 
Leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment that transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are 
classified as finance leases. The leased assets are measured initially at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present 
value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the assets are accounted for in accordance with  
the accounting policy applicable to that asset.
Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the 
outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate  
of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information
Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 85
1 Accounting policies continued
Financing income and costs
Financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings, and gains and losses on financial instruments that are recognised in the 
income statement.
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest rate.
Interest payable on borrowings includes a charge in respect of attributable transaction costs and non-utilisation fees, which are 
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis. The interest expense component 
of finance lease payments is recognised in the income statement using the lease’s implicit interest rate.
Income tax
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which 
case it is recognised in equity. Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable 
income for the year, using tax rates substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of 
previous years. 
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following 
temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities 
affecting neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will 
probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or 
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
IAS 12 – ‘Income Taxes’, does not require all temporary differences to be provided for. In particular, the Group does not provide 
for deferred tax on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the timing of the distribution and the 
temporary difference created is not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
Segment reporting
The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is provided internally to the Board, which  
is the Group’s ‘chief operating decision-maker’. 
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur 
expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any other member of the Group and for which discrete 
financial information is available. An operating segment’s operating results are reviewed regularly by the Board to make decisions 
about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance. 
Segment results that are reported to the Board include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated 
on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate assets (primarily the Company’s headquarters) and head office 
expenses.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire property, plant and equipment, and intangible 
assets other than goodwill.  86 Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Intangible assets
As part of its transition to IFRS, the Group elected to restate only those business combinations that occurred on or after 1 April 2004. 
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 April 2004, goodwill represents the amount recognised under the Group’s previous accounting 
framework, UK GAAP, less subsequent impairments.
 > Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. In respect of acquisitions since 1 April 2004 and 
before 1 April 2010, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. 
For acquisitions on or after 1 April 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
 > the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus 
 > the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus
 > the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less
 > the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified 
as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the 
contingent consideration are recognised in the income statement.
Goodwill is stated after any accumulated impairment losses, and is included as an intangible asset. It is allocated to cash-generating 
units and is tested annually for impairment and at each reporting date to the extent that there are any indicators of impairment. 
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
 > Other intangible assets
Intangible assets other than goodwill that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment 
losses (note 12). 
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
 > Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of identified 
intangible assets. Intangible assets excluding goodwill are amortised from the date that they are available for use. For a number of its 
acquisitions, the Group has identified intangible assets in respect of sole supply contracts, customer lists, brands and non-compete 
agreements. The values of these intangibles are recognised as part of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
acquired. The useful lives are estimated as follows:
 > Supply agreements – over the unexpired period of the contracts, up to five years
 > Customer lists – over the period of agreement, up to ten years
 > Brands – over the period of use in the business, up to ten years
 > Non-compete agreements – over the period of the agreement, up to five years
Impairments 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than deferred tax, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine 
whether there is any impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated, being the higher of 
net realisable value and value in use, and if there is an impairment loss then this loss is recognised such that the carrying amount is 
reduced accordingly.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (or group of units) on a pro-rata basis. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information

Own shares held by Employee Benefits Trust
Transactions of the Company-sponsored Employee Benefits Trust are treated as being those of the Company and are therefore 
reflected in the Company and Group Financial Statements. In particular, the Trust’s purchases of shares in the Company are charged 
directly to equity.
Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value, or, in the case of ex-hire equipment assets, at the lower of cost 
less accumulated depreciation and impairment at the date of transfer to inventory, or net realisable value. The cost of inventories is 
based on the first-in, first-out principle. In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate 
share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate risks arising from financing activities. In 
accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes; however 
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments and the movement in fair value is 
recognised in the income statement.
Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value; attributable transaction costs are recognised in the income statement when incurred. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instrument designated as a cash flow hedge are 
recognised directly in equity to the extent that the hedge is effective. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value 
are recognised in the income statement.
If the hedging instrument expires, no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, is sold, is terminated or is exercised, then hedge 
accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity remains there until the forecast 
transaction occurs. When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount recognised in equity is transferred to the carrying 
amount of the asset when it is recognised. In other cases the amount recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement in 
the same period that the hedged item affects the income statement. 
Intra-group financial instruments
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, 
the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect the Company treats the 
guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a 
payment under the guarantee.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and overnight deposits.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being 
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis. 88 Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Translation of foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rate of exchange prevailing at the transaction date. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange gains 
and losses arising on settlement or retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities are included in the income statement.
Assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The results of 
overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the average rates of exchange during the period. Exchange differences 
resulting from the translation of the results and balances of overseas subsidiary undertakings are charged or credited directly to the 
foreign currency translation reserve. 
Gains and losses on intercompany foreign currency loans which are long-term in nature, and which the Company does not intend to 
settle in the foreseeable future, are also recorded in the foreign currency translation reserve. 
Employee benefits
 > Pension schemes
The Group has automatically enrolled all UK employees in a defined contribution pension plan and makes contributions to personal 
pension schemes for these UK employees and certain other non-UK employees. Obligations for contributions to these defined 
contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred. In addition, a requirement exists in 
United Arab Emirates, where the Group operates, to pay terminal gratuities to employees based on their length of service when they 
leave the Group’s employment.
 > Share-based payment transactions
The Group operates a number of schemes which allow certain employees to acquire shares in the Company, including the Performance 
Plan, the Co-investment Plan, and the all-employee Sharesave Schemes. The fair value of options granted is recognised as an 
employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during 
which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured, using an 
appropriate option-pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount 
recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest, except where it is related to market based 
performance conditions. For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based 
payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no adjustment for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event, the obligation can be measured reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those material items which, by virtue of their size or incidence, are presented separately in the income 
statement to give a full understanding of the Group’s underlying financial performance. Transactions which may give rise to 
exceptional items include the restructuring of business activities and impairments within cash generating units. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information

Significant judgements and estimates 
The preparation of Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in applying the 
accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the 
results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The judgements, estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in 
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if 
the revision affects both current and future periods. The following accounting policies are limited to those items that would be most 
likely to produce materially different results were the underlying judgements, estimates and assumptions changed.
The following are judgements, apart from those involving estimations, that management has made in the process of applying the 
accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements. 
Property, plant and equipment 
In relation to the Group’s property, plant and equipment (note 14), useful economic lives and residual values of assets have been 
established using historical experience and an assessment of the nature of the assets involved. At 31 March 2017, the carrying value 
of hire equipment was £194.8m (2016 restated: £219.9m) representing 83.0% (2016 restated: 83.3%) of the total property, plant and 
equipment. The hire equipment depreciation charge for the year ended 31 March 2017 was £35.2m (2016: £35.2m), which represents 
9.7% (2016 restated: 9.5%) of the average original cost of hire equipment. Both useful economic lives and residual values are 
reviewed on a regular basis. 
Onerous lease provision
The Group has a number of properties which are leased but no longer occupied. The future cost of these ongoing lease obligations is 
provided for by way of an onerous property contract provision (see note 20), and at 31 March 2017 the amount provided was £1.5m 
(2016: £3.4m). In determining the level of provision required, the Group assesses the likelihood of mitigating future lease costs as a 
result of break clauses in leases, or the likelihood of sub-letting the property to third parties. In doing so, the Group obtains external 
professional advice where the amounts involved are material. The Group does not provide for dilapidations on occupied depots as 
they are in a significantly better state of repair, due to ongoing maintenance, compared to the properties currently included in the 
provision.
Bad debt provision
The Group monitors the risk profile of debtors regularly and makes a provision for amounts that may not be recoverable. When a trade 
receivable is not collectable it is written off against the bad debt provision. At 31 March 2017, the provision for bad debt was £4.8m 
(2016: £8.7m) against a total debtor book of £90.2m (2016: £85.8m).  90 Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

The amount of goodwill that is tax-deductible is £nil (2016: £nil).
All goodwill has arisen from business combinations. On transition to IFRS, the balance of goodwill as measured under UK GAAP was 
allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs). These are independent sources of income streams, and represent the lowest level within 
the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes. As explained in note 2, the Group’s reportable 
business segments comprise UK & Ireland Asset Services and International Asset Services. All intangible assets are held in the UK. 
Goodwill arising on business combinations after 1 April 2004 has been allocated to the CGU that is expected to benefit from those 
business combinations. The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill 
might be impaired. No impairment test has been performed in respect of the International Asset Services CGU as there are no 
intangible assets allocated to the CGU. 98 Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

The recoverable amounts of the assets allocated to the UK & Ireland CGU are determined by a value-in-use calculation. The value-
in-use calculation uses cash flow projections based on five-year financial forecasts approved by management. The key assumptions 
for these forecasts are those regarding revenue growth, net margin and the level of capital expenditure required to support trading, 
which management estimates based on past experience adjusted for current market trends and expectations of future changes 
in the market. To prepare the value-in-use calculation, the Group uses cash flow projections made up of the FY2018 budget and 
a subsequent four-year period using the Group’s business plan, together with a terminal value using long-term growth rates. The 
resulting forecast cash flows are discounted back to present value, using an estimate of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, 
adjusted for risk factors associated with the individual CGU and market-specific risks. 
The pre-tax discount rates and terminal growth rates applied are as follows:
 31 March 2017 31 March 2016
Pre-tax
discount rate
Terminal value
growth rate
Pre-tax
discount rate
Terminal value
growth rate
UK & Ireland Asset Services 11.4% 2.5% 12.6% 1.5%-2.5%
International Asset Services n/a n/a 13.6% 2.5%
Impairment calculations are sensitive to changes in key assumptions of revenue growth and discount rate. A change of 1% in the  
pre-tax discount rate, with all other assumptions held constant, would impact discounted cash flows by £24m. A decrease of 1% in  
the forecast revenue growth, with all the other assumptions held constant, would reduce discounted cash flows by £27m. In both 
cases, this would not result in an impairment charge.

On 11 November 2013, Speedy acquired 50% of the share capital of Turner and Hickman Limited, a joint venture company which 
controls the operations of Speedy Zholdas LLP. Speedy Zholdas LLP provides asset management and equipment rental services to the 
oil and gas sector in Kazakhstan. Total cash consideration for the purchase of shares in Turner and Hickman Limited was US$4.3m. 
In addition to the investment in share capital, Speedy provided a loan of US$2.5m to the joint venture with an equivalent amount 
provided by the joint venture partner. A repayment of £0.5m ($0.7m) was received during the year.

18 Financial instruments
The Group holds and uses financial instruments to finance its operations and to manage its interest rate and liquidity risks. The Group 
primarily finances its operations using share capital, retained profits and borrowings. The main risks arising from the Group’s financial 
instruments are credit, interest rate, foreign currency and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees the policies for managing each 
of these risks on an annual basis. A full description of the Group’s approach to managing these risks is set out below.
The Group does not engage in trading or speculative activities using derivative financial instruments. A Group offset arrangement 
exists in order to minimise the interest costs on outstanding debt.

Basis for determining fair values
The following summarises the principal methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of financial instruments reflected 
in the table above:
(a) Derivatives – Broker quotes are used for all interest rate swaps.
(b)   Interest-bearing loans and borrowings – Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash 
flows.
(c)   Trade and other receivables/payables – For receivables/payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount 
is deemed to reflect the fair value. All other receivables/payables are discounted to determine the fair value.
Interest rates used for determining fair value 
The interest rate used to discount estimated cash flows, where applicable, has been estimated at 11.4% (2016: 12.6%). 102 Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

18 Financial instruments continued
Fair value hierarchy
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are principally short-term in nature, and therefore their fair value is not materially different 
from their carrying value. The valuation method for the Group’s financial assets and liabilities can be defined as follows in accordance 
with IFRS 7:
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers.
The exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over  
a certain amount.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented 
by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet. No individual customer 
accounts for more than 10% of the Group’s sales transactions, and the Group’s exposure to outstanding indebtedness follows this 
profile. No collateral is held as security in respect of amounts outstanding; however, in a number of instances, deposits are held 
against the value of hire equipment provided. The extent of deposit taken is assessed on a case-by-case basis, and is not considered 
significant in comparison to the overall amounts receivable from customers. 
Transactions involving derivative financial instruments are undertaken with counterparties within the syndicate of banks which 
provide the Group’s asset-based revolving credit facility. Given their high credit ratings, management does not expect any 
counterparty to fail to meet its obligations. 
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that is based on historical experience of dealing with customers with the same 
risk profile. 
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to 
managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under 
both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
The Group uses both short and long-term cash forecasts to assist in monitoring cash flow requirements. Typically, the Group uses 
short-term forecasting to ensure that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet operational expenses and to service financing 
obligations for a period of 12 weeks. Longer-term forecasts are performed on a regular basis to assess compliance with bank 
covenants on existing facilities, ensuring that activities can be managed within reason to ensure covenant breaches are avoided. 
At 31 March 2017, the Group had a loan facility amounting to £180m (2016: £180m), as detailed in note 19. The undrawn availability 
on this facility as at 31 March 2017 was £75.8m (2016: £54.8m) based on the Group’s eligible hire equipment and trade receivables.  
In addition to the loan facility the Group owns several assets under finance lease agreements.
The Group monitors available facilities against forward requirements on a regular basis and, where necessary, obtains additional 
sources of financing to provide the Group with the appropriate level of headroom against the required borrowing. The Group has 
obtained bank and equity funding in recent years as the business has grown, and maintains close contact with its syndicate of banks. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information

Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s income or 
the value of its holdings of financial instruments. Generally, the Group seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to manage volatility 
in profit.
Foreign exchange risk
With over 5% of the Group’s revenue generated in currencies other than sterling, the Group’s Balance Sheet and Income Statement 
are affected by movements in exchange rates. The revenue and costs of overseas operations normally arise in the same currency and 
consequently the exposure to exchange differences is not normally significant and consequently not hedged. Overseas operations 
maintain local currency bank facilities, which provide partial mitigation against balance sheet risk. 
At 31 March 2017, if sterling had weakened or strengthened by 10% against the US dollar (to which key Middle Eastern currencies 
are linked) with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been £0.3m (2016: £0.2m) higher or lower 
respectively.
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to a risk of a change in cash flows due to changes in interest rates as a result of its use of variable rate 
borrowings. The Group’s policy is to review regularly the terms of its borrowing facilities, and to assess and manage the long-term 
borrowing commitment accordingly, and to put in place interest rate hedges to reduce the Group’s exposure to significant fluctuations 
in interest rates. The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that between 40% and 80% of its net borrowings are covered by hedging 
instruments.
The principal derivative financial instruments used by the Group are interest rate swaps. The notional contract amount and the related 
fair value of the Group’s derivative financial instruments can be analysed as follows:

Fair

Fixed interest rate swaps (0.4) 45.0 (0.7) 75.0
Future cash flows associated with the above instruments are dependent upon movements in LIBOR over the contractual period. 
Interest is paid or received under the instruments on a quarterly basis, depending on the individual instrument, referenced to the 
relevant prevailing UK LIBOR rates.
The weighted average interest rate on the fixed interest rate swaps is 1.197% (2016: 1.274%) and the instruments are for a weighted 
average period of 19 months (2016: 18 months). The maximum contractual period is 36 months (2016: 36 months). 104 Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Sensitivity analysis
In managing interest rate and currency risk, the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuation on the Group’s earnings. 
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated 
earnings.
At 31 March 2017 it is estimated that a general increase of 1% in interest rates would decrease the Group’s profit before tax by 
approximately £0.3m. Interest rate swaps have been included in this calculation.
Capital management
The Group requires capital for, amongst other things, purchasing hire equipment to replace the existing asset base that has reached 
the end of its useful life, and for growth, by establishing new rental locations, completing acquisitions and refinancing existing debts 
in the longer term. The Group defines gross capital as net debt (cash less borrowings) plus shareholders’ funds, and seeks to ensure  
an acceptable return on gross capital. The Board seeks to maintain a balance between debt and equity funding such that it maintains  
a sound capital position relevant for the prevailing economic environment.
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future 
development of the business. The Board of Directors monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders in order to ensure that 
the most attractive mix of capital growth and income return is made available to investors.
The Group encourages ownership of Speedy Hire Plc shares by employees at all levels within the Group, and has developed this 
objective through the introduction of long-term incentive plans and SAYE schemes.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year. Neither the Company nor any of its 
subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

The Group has a £180m asset based revolving credit facility which is sub divided into:
(i)   A secured overdraft facility, provided by Barclays Bank Plc which secures by cross guarantees and debentures the bank deposits 
and overdrafts of the Company and certain subsidiary companies up to a maximum of £5m. 
(ii)  An asset based revolving credit facility of up to £175m, based on the Group’s hire equipment and trade receivables balance. The 
undrawn availability of this facility as at 31 March 2017 was £75.8m (2016: £54.8m) based on the Group’s eligible hire equipment 
and trade receivables.
The facility is for £180m, but is reduced to the extent that any ancillary facilities are provided, and is repayable in September 2019, 
with no prior scheduled repayment requirements.
Interest on the facility is calculated by reference to the London Inter Bank Offered Rate applicable to the period drawn, plus a margin 
of 170 to 275 basis points, depending on leverage and on the components of the borrowing base. During the period, the effective 
margin was 2.35% (2016: 2.49%). Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information

24 Acquisition of subsidiary
In December 2016, the Group acquired the brand, business and assets of Lloyds British Testing Limited (‘Lloyds British’). Lloyds British 
is a specialist business, which carries out testing, certification, and inspection of lifting equipment, and training from locations across 
the United Kingdom and employs 176 employees. The acquisition is expected to increase the Group’s provision of training, testing and 
lifting services, as well as realising synergies within our existing lifting business.
The acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. A provisional assessment has been made of the 
fair value to the Group of the assets and liabilities acquired.
For the period to the end of 31 March 2017, Lloyds British contributed revenue of £2.9m and profit of £0.1m to the Speedy Group 
results. If the acquisition had been owned for the entire financial period, management estimates that consolidated revenue 
would have been £10m higher and consolidated profit before tax would have increased by £0.9m. In determining these amounts, 
management has assumed that the fair value adjustments, determined provisionally, that arose on the date of acquisition would have 
been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2016.
The fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired are as follows:
Book value at
 acquisition
£m
Fair value
adjustment
£m
Fair value
£m
Other property, plant and equipment 0.4 (0.1) 0.3

0.7 2.6 3.3
Goodwill capitalised 0.5
Total consideration 3.8
Satisfied by:
– cash consideration 3.8
3.8
The fair value adjustment is to revalue fixtures and fittings and inventory to their estimated market value at the time of acquisition.
The customer relationship intangible has been valued using the ‘excess earnings’ method, and is based on income forecast to be 
generated over the next ten years. The valuation assumes that the customer attrition rate will be 9.5% per annum. Capital asset 
charges have been applied using a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital in respect of fixed assets, working capital and the 
workforce. Other assumptions used in the valuation include an assumed growth in income from customers of 2.0% per annum, and a 
discount rate applied to the resulting income stream of 9.3% (post tax). The customer list intangible is being amortised over ten years, 
which is considered to be the period over which the majority of the benefits are expected to arise.
The brand intangible has been valued using the ‘relief-from-royalty’ method, using a royalty rate of 1% of income for a ten year 
period, discounted at a rate of 9.3%. The intangible is being amortised over a period of ten years, which is estimated to be the useful 
life within the business. 110 Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Prior year acquisition
The Group purchased the entire share capital of OHP Limited in the prior year. The fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities 
disclosed as provisional in the 2016 Financial Statements in respect of this acquisition have been finalised during the year. The 
opening balance sheet has been restated to account for a £0.5m reduction to the fair value of property, plant and equipment acquired. 
This has resulted in £0.5m additional goodwill being created.

Boiler room fraud
Share scams are often run from ‘boiler rooms’ where fraudsters 
cold-call investors offering them worthless, overpriced or even 
non-existent shares. While such scams promise high returns, 
those who invest usually end up losing their money.
If you are offered unsolicited investment advice, discounted 
shares, a premium price for shares you own, or free company or 
research reports, you should take these steps before handing 
over any money:
 > get the name of the person and organisation contacting you;
 > search the list of unauthorised firms to avoid at fca.org.uk/ 
consumers/scams to ensure they are authorised;
 > only use the details on the FCA Register to contact the firm; and
 > call the Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768 if you suspect 
the caller is fraudulent.
REMEMBER: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!
