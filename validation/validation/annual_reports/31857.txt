What is 
Immunotherapy?
Immunotherapy is the practice of 
administering gradually increasing  
doses of an allergen in order to address 
the causes of the symptoms of allergy. 
It was first carried out almost 100 years 
ago and is now in widespread use around 
the world. It is sometimes referred to as 
‘allergy vaccination’ or ‘desensitisation’ .
Immunotherapy may be given via 
different routes including subcutaneous 
injections or sublingually. allergytherapeutics.com 03

Who we are
We are a visionary immunology 
business with specialist experience 
in the research and development 
of allergy treatments. We have 
a well-established commercial 
presence in Europe and are focused 
on the US market opportunity. 
What we do 
We specialise in the diagnosis 
and treatment of allergy. Allergy 
vaccination is a successful 
treatment that deals with the 
underlying cause of allergies 
and not just the symptoms
1
. 
We mainly sell our products in 
European countries and our pipeline 
of products in clinical development 
includes vaccines for grass, tree 
and house dust mite, as well as 
a peanut allergy vaccine in pre-
clinical development. Adjuvant 
systems to boost performance 
of vaccines outside allergy 
are also under evaluation.
At a 
Glance
What makes  
us different
Our ultra-short course treatments 
consist of 4-6 injections over the 
course of 3-6 weeks compared 
to daily tablets or an average 
treatment in the market of a 
12-15 course of injections. Our 
approach offers the simplicity of 
4-6 injections, increased tolerability 
and demonstrated efficacy
2
. 
Our adjuvant technologies improve 
therapies by allowing them to 
increase efficacy. We are further 
developing this concept in our 
specialist business, Bencard Adjuvant 
Systems; improving health and 
evaluating vaccinations for infectious 
diseases and cancer treatments. 
Our values have created a culture 
based around vision, commitment 
and humanity. We take extraordinary 
ideas and bring them to market 
– enhancing treatments and 
transforming people’s lives.

Strategic Report
Overview
I am pleased to introduce the Group’s  
Annual Report & Accounts for the year 
ended 30 June 2017 . It has been another  
year of strong and consistent performance 
across all areas of the Group. The key  
areas for value creation remain profitable  
growth in European markets, pipeline 
advancements and paving the way to  
the significant US market. 
Chairman’s 
Statement
Peter Jensen
Chairman allergytherapeutics.com 07
Chairman’s Statement
“  Allergy Therapeutics’ 
strategy remains clear 
and focused and it is 
expected that the 
business will continue 
to grow and its 
portfolio of products 
expand in 2018  
and beyond.”
with our US commercial strategy. 
The Grass MATA MPL product 
completed the safety study relating 
to its higher dose and the Phase 
II Grass trial is due to commence 
before the end of 2017. 
Financially, the Group remains in a 
robust position with a strong cash 
balance due to strong sales growth, 
aided additionally by the weakening 
of sterling against the euro.
Board Changes
There were a number of changes 
to the Board during the year. In 
February, we welcomed US-based 
Jeff Barton who succeeded Jean-
Yves Pavée as Abbott Laboratories’ 
nominated director and, in June, 
Thomas Lander, our Board member 
with extensive R&D experience, 
retired from the Board and Tunde 
Otulana was appointed as a new 
independent Non-Executive Director. 
I thank Jean-Yves and Thomas for 
their significant contributions to 
the Board during their tenures. Jeff 
Barton, who is based at Abbott 
headquarters in Chicago and is VP 
Licensing and Acquisitions, brings 
extensive commercial experience, 
especially in the US, which will prove 
vital as the Group continues to 
execute its global strategy. Tunde 
is also based in the US and brings 
a wealth of global experience 
in clinical and regulatory work, 
particularly with the US Food & Drug 
Administration (FDA), with whom 
he worked for six years earlier in his 
career. I am delighted to welcome 
Jeff and Tunde to the Board.
Governance 
The Group endeavours to adopt 
best practice, above normal levels 
for a company of its size and sector 
across the business and it is overseen 
by an effective and knowledgeable 
Board. We are pleased that a 
regular and transparent dialogue 
is maintained with our key 
stakeholders throughout the year.
Looking ahead
Allergy Therapeutics’ strategy 
remains clear and focused and it 
is expected that the business will 
continue to grow and its portfolio 
of products expand in 2018 and 
beyond. The Group benefits from 
a committed, experienced and 
enthusiastic management team and 
the Board and I are confident that we 
shall continue our successful record 
of growth and deliver long-term 
value creation for shareholders.
On behalf of the Board, I would like 
to thank all Allergy Therapeutics’ 
employees for their commitment 
and hard work during the year.

Performance
In our European business, sales 
grew by 15%* in constant currency 
and we continued to achieve 
market share gains, with our 
market share in markets where we 
operate up to 13 % (2016: 12%). 
This shows an increasing adoption 
in the market for our convenient 
and patient-friendly treatments 
compared to other products.
In addition, there has been good 
progress in the R&D pipeline this 
year, facilitated by investment from 
our growing revenue stream. In 
March, we announced that we had 
recruited the first patient in our 
pivotal Phase III PQ Birch trial and, 
in May, the first patient was recruited 
for our Acarovac MPL (house dust 
mite) study. We announced exciting 
pre-clinical data from the Polyvac 
Peanut project in February and we 
are pleased that all of the products 
that the Group has submitted for 
the German Therapieallergen-
Verordung (TAV) process are 
continuing to progress well.
We are also making progress

Strategic Report
Manuel Llobet
CEO
Delivering on our strategy – three areas for growth 
Strong advances have been made this year 
across all three major strategic objectives. 
These are focused around three key pillars  
of growth: profitably expanding the existing 
European business; developing a strong 
product pipeline, and; preparing for product 
entry into the US market.

Chief Executive Officer’s Review
“  A key aim of the 
management team is 
to leverage its current 
infrastructure and this 
is demonstrated by 
the strong increases in 
revenue and pre-R&D 
operating profit this 
year in comparison  
with the prior year. ”
infrastructure, further strengthening 
its supply chain and regulatory 
functions in anticipation of an 
increasingly regulated framework 
for allergy treatment across the EU 
and the US. The changes in the 
regulatory environment and a drive 
towards evidence-based products 
will be to the Group’s advantage. 
Increasing market share 
During the period, the Group 
continued to increase its market 
share in the markets in which we 
operate, driving this to 13% (2016: 
12%) against a broadly flat market 
backdrop. In the product portfolio, 
Pollinex Quattro continues to 
grow well as patients and allergists 
increasingly seek the benefits of 
our ultra-short course treatment 
programmes. Venomil, driven by 
raw material supply issues in the 
market also grew strongly. Acarovac 
Plus and Probiotics continued 
to gain market share with the 
former being the fastest growing 
component of the Spanish portfolio. 
Scaling up the business
A key aim of the management team 
is to leverage its current infrastructure 
and this is demonstrated by the 
strong increases in revenue and 
pre-R&D operating profit this year 
in comparison with the prior year. 
Pipeline – Phase III trial 
underway with broad 
programmes running 
During the year, the scientific team 
has been actively managing and 
preparing for a number of significant 
clinical trial. The Pollinex Quattro 
Birch Phase III trial received Clinical 
Trial Application (CTA) approval and 
recruitment is now well under way, 
with treatment of patients ongoing 
and read out expected in H2 2018. 
The Grass MATA MPL development 
is discussed in more detail below.  
If the Grass trials are successful,  
they will form part of 
both the German and US 
regulatory submissions.
The products in the German TAV 
process continue to progress well 
with plans for the start of clinical 
trials on the oral products and the 
injectable house dust mite product in 
a staggered process starting during 
the 2018 financial year. The German 
TAV process has the potential 
to boost sales of these products 
through additional clinical data as 
well as reducing the number of 
competing products in the market.
The Acarovac MPL product for house 
dust mite allergy has started Phase 
I trials in Spain using the Pollinex 
Quattro platform technology. This 
product, if successful through the 
trial programme, could become a 
global best-in-class product with 
the first short course subcutaneous 
treatment in a global market 
worth an estimated $3-4bn
1
.
The Polyvac Peanut product 
completed a positive pre-clinical 
trial showing impressive protective 
immunity with a single vaccination 
and no anaphylaxis. This product 
uses the virus like particle (VLP) 
technology that the business 
acquired to create a subcutaneous 
product that could offer long lasting 
protective immunity for subjects 
with peanut allergy, rather than 
just increasing tolerability in the 
case of accidental exposure. 
Team – expanding the 
scientific excellence 
In order to facilitate continued 
success in the clinical development 
programme, the Group is 
strengthening the organisation 
with expansion of the clinical 
team led by Murray Skinner, Chief 
Scientific Officer at the Group’s 
UK headquarters in Worthing. 
European business – 
milestone CAGR of 10% 
reached over past 18 years
The Group reached a significant 
milestone this year with compound 
annual growth over the past 18 
years of 10%. This reflects continued 
delivery of our focused growth 
strategy, innovative products and a 
robust business model that is resilient 
to major economic downturns and 
significant regulatory changes. 
The business achieved net sales 
of £64.1m, up 15%* at constant 
currency on the 2016 performance 
and up 32% in actual terms. 
Following on from the 16% 
underlying constant rate growth last 
year, this illustrates the strength of 
the Group’s portfolio of convenient, 
patient-friendly, technically advanced 
products and the skilled sales and 
marketing teams in the business. 
Whilst operating in a highly 
fragmented European allergy market, 
Allergy Therapeutics continues to 
benefit from its innovative approach 
within this marketplace and will look 
to build value for shareholders via 
suitable corporate development 
opportunities. The Group has 
also continued to invest in its

Strategic Report | Chief Executive Officer’s Review
The Group has underlined its 
commitment to clinical excellence 
by appointing Pieter-Jan de Kam as 
Clinical Director in mid-September. 
Pieter-Jan de Kam joined the Group 
from HAL Allergy in the Netherlands 
where he was responsible for clinical 
development with recent successes 
including European and US studies 
for pollen and house dust mites.
In addition to the appointment 
of Pieter-Jan, the Group has 
recruited Simon Piggott as Head 
of Clinical Science. Simon will be 
responsible for the delivery of a 
robust clinical strategy bridging the 
gap between the Groups’ existing 
product development teams and 
clinical departments. Simon has 
significant experience in successful 
development programmes from 
time spent at Novartis, GSK and 
most recently at Quintiles. Tim 
Higenbottam has been appointed 
to the role of Senior Pharmaceutical 
Physician and will focus on 
the US regulatory process.
The Group is continuing to invest in 
the R&D function to drive the key 
pipeline trials. The overall headcount 
in the research and development 
function within the Group has 
doubled in the last two years.
Publication of data – 
validating the Bencard 
Adjuvant Systems division
During the year, two papers were 
published in peer-reviewed journals 
reporting on new pre-clinical 
studies from the Group’s Bencard 
Adjuvant Systems (BAS) division. 
The two papers report that the novel 
depot adjuvant behind the Pollinex 
platform, micro-crystalline tyrosine 
(MCT), both alone and in an adjuvant 
system, have broad applications and 
elicit high, sustained antibody levels 
demonstrating enhanced protective 
efficacy compared to conventional 
adjuvants including aluminium. MCT 
has now been granted manufacturing 
patents in the US, Europe and Japan.
US market – changing 
environment will drive 
market share towards 
Allergy Therapeutics 
The US market for allergic rhinitis, 
which is estimated to be worth 
$2bn
1
, continues to evolve. The 
regulatory pressures in the US 
that the Group acknowledged last 
year are becoming stronger as the 
FDA and the US Pharmacopeial 
Convention (USP) set strict guidelines 
for compounding and dispensing of 
allergy products. These guidelines, 
if fully implemented, will drive the 
market towards pharmaceutical 
grade, centrally manufactured 
products that should benefit 
businesses, like Allergy Therapeutics, 
with GMP , MHRA approved facilities. 
Given the widespread adoption 
of subcutaneous immunotherapy 
(SCIT) treatments in the US, the 
oral products that are currently 
in the US market have so far not 
achieved a significant share leaving 
the market open for new entrants, 
such as Allergy Therapeutics, with 
the right products, manufacturing 
capability and commercial approach. 
The Group continues to prepare its 
portfolio of products for capturing 
the significant US market opportunity. 
The Grass MATA MPL product, 
which is in development, has 
completed a safety study relating 
to a new higher dose and the 
Phase II trial is expected to start in 
the autumn. Following completion 
of this trial, meetings with the 
regulatory authorities in the US and 
Germany will be necessary before 
it progresses to a Phase III trial. 
Outlook – confidence  
across the business 
Allergy Therapeutics’ management 
team expects 2018 to be a pivotal 
year with significant results due 
across a number of key programmes. 
Revenue for 2018 is again set 
to show continued growth at 
constant currency, driven by further 
penetration of the market by the 
Group’s convenient ultra-short course 
treatment. Gross margins are likely 
to improve slightly as volumes grow. 
Overheads will rise less in 2018 than 
they did in 2017 as investment slows, 
based on constant currency rates. 
However, as previously disclosed, we 
anticipate research and development 
expenditure is likely to almost double 
as the Group commences the PQ 
Birch Phase III and Grass MATA MPL 
Phase II studies and continues to 
invest in new product development. 
The Group expects the results of 
both the PQ Birch Phase III trial, 
the first pivotal Phase III trial for a 
Pollinex Quattro product in Europe, 
and the results of the Grass MATA 
MPL Phase II trial in H2 2018.
The Board and the executive team 
remain confident about the Group’s 
future growth potential and remain 
focused on generating significant 
value for shareholders given its 
continued sales momentum, the 
robust research pipeline progress 
driven by the strengthened research 
and development team and the 
potential of the US product portfolio 
as we prepare the ground for the 
future.

Strategic Report
In markets where the Group 
does not have a direct presence, 
products are distributed through 
partners. The most important 
distributor markets for the Group 
are Canada, the Czech and Slovak 
Republics, South Korea and more 
recently, Greece and the Baltics.
Germany is the Group’s main market, 
generating approximately 59% 
of the Group’s revenue in the 12 
months ending 30 June 2017. The 
percentage of revenue derived from 
each country is detailed below:
Italy (9%)
The total Italian allergy 
immunotherapy market is 
shrinking because patients have 
been impacted by adverse 
economic conditions affecting 
their ability to pay for vaccines, 
compounded by the withdrawal of 
reimbursement in certain regions. 
The Italian immunotherapy market 
is dominated by sublingual 
products. However, despite these 
challenges, it is believed that there 
remains a significant opportunity 
to continue to grow our market 
share in this important market.
Current 
Market 
Overview
Austria (7%)
The Austrian market for allergen 
immunotherapy has grown slightly 
in the last 2 years. The German 
TAV registration process will 
continue to indirectly influence 
the Austrian market. Sales of 
modified allergen (allergoid) 
products are the driving segment, 
partly cannibalising the classical 
subcutaneous native allergens 
but also enlarging the market. 
Switzerland (3%)
The sensitivity of patients and 
authorities towards aluminium 
continues to grow. This factor, 
combined with the significant 
reduction in the product range 
of competitors and prolonged 
interruptions in supplies, arrives 
at a time when the Group have 
made available the full-range of 
products on a named-patient basis.
Spain (9%)
Market sales in Spain were largely 
flat over the last year but the 
allergoid immunotherapy segment 
has grown 15%. The advanced 
allergoid products at Allergy 
Therapeutics allow the Group to 
be in a strong position to achieve 
further growth in the coming years. 
The Group continues to maintain a strong 
presence in Europe with established 
operations in significant markets including 
Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria, Switzerland, 
Netherlands and the United Kingdom. allergytherapeutics.com 13
Market Overview
Spain continues to be a large 
valuable market, with approximately 
150,000 immunotherapy 
patients a year. Of the injectable 
immunotherapy products, modified 
allergens remain the treatment of 
choice for Spanish physicians. 
The Group completed the acquisition 
of Alerpharma S.A. in 2015, which is 
now fully merged as part of Allergy 
Therapeutics Ibérica. The combined 
Group has strengthened the 
company presence in Spain and has 
maintained a broad product range. 
United Kingdom (4%)
The UK is an important market due 
to its potential for future growth for 
the Group. Whilst currently, there 
is limited use of allergy vaccines 
in the UK, there is potential for 
this to change and the Group 
has focused on marketing to the 
medical community to promote 
greater awareness of more suitable 
treatment options. Pollinex is 
the only pollen SCIT product 
currently registered in the UK.
Germany (59%)
Germany is the single largest 
allergy immunotherapy market 
in Europe and is expected 
to remain flat for the next 2 
years. It will be increasingly 
influenced by the TAV which is 
an opportunity to demonstrate 
the high standard and efficacy 
of the Group’s products. 
Despite a flat German 
market, Allergy Therapeutics 
outperformed market trends. 
This confirms the quality 
of the products and the 
sales and marketing team. 
Germany remains a key 
focus for the Group with 
continued strengthening of 
sales and marketing which 
has been instrumental to an 
increase in market share.
The Netherlands (4%) 
After several years in decline, the 
allergen immunotherapy market in 
The Netherlands is in a stable state. 
The market is dominated by two 
companies, Allergy Therapeutics 
and ALK, with Allergy Therapeutics 
the only allergy company showing 
growth in the Dutch market with a 
year on year growth of 27% in local 
currency (source: IMS Health). 14
Strategic Report
Opportunities
Recent Developments  
in US Market
Four sublingual immunotherapy 
(SLIT) products have been granted 
licence approval in the USA. These 
sublingual medications require daily 
treatment for up to three years which 
poses a problem for adherence (the 
patients taking all the necessary 
doses to achieve a beneficial 
effect). Allergy Therapeutics’ 
subcutaneous immunotherapies 
that require weekly injections 
over as little as four weeks offer a 
simpler means to gain the benefits 
of immunotherapy. For this reason 
the research programme of clinical 
development of Pollinex Quattro 
has been extended to the USA.
Allergy affects 15-40% of the US 
population (i.e. between 50 and 
130 million), so the total market 
size for allergy vaccine products is 
potentially very large. About 2-3 
million Americans with moderate to 
severe allergy received some form of 
allergen immunotherapy. For the US 
market, Pollinex Quattro Grass has 
been developed with an extended 
range of doses for a dose selection 
study. The new highest dose was 
tested in the G104 study conducted 
in New Jersey and was completed in 
February 2017. It showed no increase 
in the number of adverse events 
seen with lower cumulative dose 
regimens and this new higher dose is 
to be included in the range of doses 
for the dose selection study G205. 
The G205 study follows the 
successful technique of allergen 
challenge used in the PQ Birch 204 
study of 2016. Our goal to be the 
first allergy immunotherapy company 
to launch a subcutaneous Grass 
product in the United States remains 
unchanged. To achieve this, the 
G205 dose range finding study will 
now be run before the planned 
Phase III study.

Strategic Report
Product Review
The Group sells a wide range of aluminium-
free allergy vaccines and diagnostics. 
The majority of revenue arises from sales 
of allergy vaccines. 
Our Products 
The Group sells both injectable 
and sublingual (oral) formats. The 
most commonly prescribed are 
those for the treatment of pollen-
related allergies, particularly for 
allergies to grasses, weeds and 
trees. Our vaccines trade under 
various brand names depending on 
the market, e.g. Pollinex Quattro, 
Polligoid and TA Gräser Top. Our 
extensive range of well-characterised 
diagnostics includes 82 diagnostics 
in Germany with marketing 
authorisations and specialised 
allergens for other markets.
According to the current opinion 
of expert immunologists, 
immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated 
allergies (type one allergies) 
are due to deregulation of the 
T helper lymphocyte (Th) cell. 
Whereas healthy people develop 
tolerance to allergens, allergy 
sufferers have a Th2-dominated 
immune response with increased 
IgE and corresponding clinical 
symptoms. This deregulation 
of the immune system can be 
counteracted efficiently using 
specific immunotherapy (SIT). 
By administering high doses of 
allergen in a controlled fashion, 
the balance between Th1 and Th2 
response to the allergen can be 
restored. Since SIT was first carried 
out successfully by Leonard Noon 
in 1911, it has become established 
as the only therapy addressing 
the cause of type one allergies.
Pollinex Quattro, launched in 
1999, heralded a transformation 
in immunotherapy by introducing 
allergy vaccination with only four 
injections per course. The short 
treatment period is due to the 
use of microcrystalline tyrosine 
(MCT) adsorbed allergoids, an 
improved extract allergen that has 
been modified in order to lower 
its allergenicity while maintaining 
most of its immunogenicity, 
and the innovative adjuvant 
monophosphoryl-lipid A (MPL). 
An adjuvant is a substance which 
improves the immune response 
to an antigen or allergen. allergytherapeutics.com 29

“  The adjuvant effect of MPL  
in SIT has been documented 
in numerous studies and is 
seen in its essential role of 
promoting the switch from  
a Th2-directed immune 
response (with IgE induction) 
to a Th1-directed immune 
response.”

Product Review
MPL is derived from a 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) which 
is obtained from the cell wall of 
Salmonella Minnesota R595 using 
a process of extraction, purification 
and detoxification. As a vaccine 
adjuvant, MPL has been used for 
many years. Vaccines containing 
MPL have been evaluated in various 
indications such as cervical cancer 
and malaria at GlaxoSmithKline 
(‘GSK’). Two vaccines with an 
adjuvant system containing MPL 
– Fendrix, a hepatitis B vaccine 
and Cervarix, a HPV vaccine to 
protect against cervical cancer 
– have received broad approval 
in Europe, the US, Japan and 
Canada. These modern, successful 
vaccines are already widely used.
The adjuvant effect of MPL in SIT 
has been documented in numerous 
studies and is seen in its essential 
role of promoting the switch from 
a Th2-directed immune response 
(with IgE induction) to a Th1-
directed immune response. 
Our sublingual product is Oralvac 
Compact with a dosing schedule 
which allows for a more rapid 
and simple escalation of dosage 
making treatment more convenient 
for patients and doctors. The 
treatment can be taken by the 
patient in their own homes 
and is raspberry flavoured for 
improved patient compliance.
Wasp and bee treatment is 
provided by our freeze dried 
Venomil product, which can be 
used via a ‘Rush’ dosing regimen.
Synbiotics
Synbiotics are special formulations of 
prebiotics and probiotics. Synbiotics 
act as bio-immunomodulators of 
the immunologic response. In June 
2012, the Group launched three new 
synbiotic products (Kallergen-Th, 
ATI-Prob and Pollagen) across Spain 
and Italy. Since then, Austria and 
Germany have also been added. In 
2013, the Group launched a further 
new synbiotic product, Syngut, 
specifically designed for food and 
lactose intolerance. The products 
contain specific combinations of 
Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria.
Between 2015 and 2016 two  
further products were launched in 
line with the WAO guidelines for 
atopic dermatitis prevention: our  
first synbiotic in drops, Kallergen 
Baby for the prevention of atopic 
dermatitis in children from 0 to  
3 years old and Kallergen Mamy for 
pregnant women with high risk of 
atopic disease. In 2016, the Group 
began its first NIS study for lactose 
intolerance with 50 patients at  
S. Martino Hospital, Genova, Italy.
Acarovac Plus
Acarovac Plus was launched in Spain 
in March 2013 and is a novel MCT-
adsorbed, modified-allergen product 
developed to address the cause of 
perennial mite allergy. The product 
has been standardised to meet a 
dose regime consistent with “one 
vial” convenience. Clinical evaluation 
has been completed demonstrating 
excellent patient tolerability and 
serological analyses consistent with 
a favourable shift in Th1/Th2 balance 
compared with an unmodified 
version of the product and we 
have recently published a one-year 
follow-up study with Dr. Albert 
Roger, Director of the Allergy Unit 
at Hospital Universitari Germans 
Trias i Pujol, Barcelona, Spain.

Penicillin Diagnostics
DAP is a product for exclusive 
use in the diagnosis of type I, or 
immediate hypersensitivity to benzyl 
penicillin and related antibiotics (beta 
lactams) by means of cutaneous 
tests (prick and intradermal). Allergic 
reactions to beta lactams are the 
most common cause of severe
adverse drug reactions and there 
is an increasing prevalence in the 
population. DAP is supplied to Italy, 
the UK and The Netherlands.

Scientific Developments
Clinical Developments in the 
United States of America 
The Group continues to progress 
with the Grass MATA MPL product 
in clinical trials in the US.
In November 2015, the Group 
initiated the G204 Phase II study 
using for the first time two mobile 
environmental exposure chambers 
(mEECs) to challenge grass allergic 
people with a constant high level of 
pollen, recording their symptoms 
on a hand held computer. Whilst 
no serious drug-related adverse 
events or severe systemic events 
occurred, no dose effect was seen 
with the primary outcome variable.
Following the results of the G204 
study, Grass MATA MPL has been 
further developed with an extended 
range of doses for a dose selection 
study. The new highest dose was 
tested in the G104 study, a Phase 
I clinical study evaluating safety 
and tolerability, conducted in 
New Jersey and was completed in 
February 2017. It showed no increase 
in the number of adverse events 
compared with lower cumulative 
dose regimens and this new dose is 
to be included in the range of doses 
for the G205 dose selection study.
The Group is taking advantage of 
the chance to carry out another dose 
selection study (G205) by using the 
successful conjunctival provocation 
test (CPT). Following discussions 
with the FDA’s Center for Biologics 
Evaluation and Research (CEBR), the 
G205 will be performed in Europe, 
starting in Autumn 2017 with a 
planned end of Phase II meeting 
with the FDA in 2018. Subject to 
approval and successful outcomes 
and following discussions with the 
regulatory authorities, results for 
these two studies are planned to 
be available to enable a Phase 
III study (G306). Discussions will 
take place with the FDA over the 
requirements and timing of a safety 
database for the Grass MATA MPL 
product at a suitable point.
The Group’s goal remains to be 
the first allergy immunotherapy 
company to launch an ultra short 
course subcutaneous Grass 
product in the United States.
European Clinical 
Development of 
Subcutaneous 
Immunotherapies (SCIT)
Clinical evaluation of Pollinex 
Quattro (PQ) products is being 
undertaken as part of the German 
TAV (Therapieallergene-Verordnung) 
regulatory framework. Following 
the successful dose selection 
study PQBirch 204 completed in 
April 2016, the Group has gained 
approval from the Paul Ehrlich 
Institut (PEI) to proceed to a Phase 
III field study – PQBirch 301.  allergytherapeutics.com 33
Research & Development
The PQ Birch 301 study targets 
enrolment of over 500 patients 
across Germany, Austria, Sweden & 
Poland. Enrolment for the study has 
already started, with the results of 
the pivotal Phase III study expected 
to be published H2 2018, enabling, 
subject to approvals and successful 
outcomes, submission of dossiers for 
regulatory assessment in Germany.
Acarovac Plus and Acarovac 
MPL – Next Generation 
Products for Dust Mite 
Immunotherapy
Following the success of short-
course house-dust mite SCIT 
product Acarovac Plus in Portugal 
& Austria, monophosphoryl lipid 
A (MPL) was added to Acarovac 
Plus to create Acarovac MPL with 
new dose regimens tested in the 
AM101 phase I study. The adjuvant 
MPL is used in the Company’s 
successful PQ product range. 
AM101 is a Phase I clinical study 
evaluating the safety and tolerability 
of Acarovac MPL in over 30 patients 
over two different posologies. The 
study is currently ongoing with 
interim results expected in H2 2018.
Polyvac
Preclinical data demonstrating 
protection against anaphylaxis  
when challenged with peanut, 
enabled the Group to progress 
towards defining a target product 
profile according to timelines.  
The Group’s innovative peanut 
vaccine is focused on a subcutaneous 
application of recombinant peanut 
allergen coupled with its state-of- 
the-art proprietary adjuvant system 
AdSys-VcT (VLP & MCT) and aiming 
to induce protective immunity.
Positive proof of concept data from 
the recombinant vaccine candidates 
has enabled the Group to progress 
with GMP development of a defined 
target product profile to support the 
phase I timeline. Allergens for use 
in formulation have been identified 
and small-scale production and VLP 
association studies are encouraging. 
Synbiotics
Last year, the Group launched  
two new synbiotic products, 
Kallergen-Th D and SynGut Baby. 
Research is continuing and  
exploring two of the current 
products, Kallergen-Th D
®
 and 
SynGut
™
. A double blind, parallel 
group, randomised study to 
determine the clinical efficacy 
and safety of Kallergen-Th D
®
 oral 
synbiotic compared with placebo 
in children with atopic dermatitis 
is planned to commence in Q4 
2017. Additionally, enrolment is 
complete for the observational 
study evaluating the efficacy and 
tolerability of SynGut
™
 oral synbiotic 
in patients with lactose intolerance. 
The study is expected to finish in 
January 2018 with final results by H2 
2018. The results of a retrospective 
controlled Italian multi-centre study 
investigating whether Pollagen 
prescribed as complementary 
therapy demonstrated that it 
was able to reduce symptoms 
severity, endoscopic features 
and nasal cytology in 93 
patients with inflammatory 
non allergic rhinitis (INAR). 
Analysis of Allergoids: 
The Group recently completed a 
detailed review of the structural 
and immunological characterisation 
of “group 1 allergen IgG binding 
epitopes” within the modified 
grass SCIT product range. The 
analysis unveiled the structural and 
immunological changes which take 
place following the grass allergen 
modification process and revealed 
distinct IgG immunological profiles.
The results from the study support 
the concept that modification 
not only enhances the safety 
profile of SCIT but allows shorter-
course therapy options as a result 
of providing an IgG epitope 
repertoire important for efficacy.

The work paves the way to help 
develop methods to better 
standardise allergoid platforms.
Analysis of Adjuvants
The Group is continuing to 
advance adjuvant systems such as 
MCT as a depot and to enhance 
immunogenicity of vaccines in areas 
outside of allergy. The Group have 
published studies run in conjunction 
with leading UK institutions such 
as The Jenner Institute at The 
University of Oxford and Public 
Health England to test these 
adjuvant systems in vaccines for 
diseases such as flu and malaria. 
Recent Group highlights include a 
comparative influenza vaccine study 
in a ferret model using MCT as an 
adjuvant that demonstrated that a 
single dose of antigen adjuvanted 
with MCT was effective in generating 
a sero-positive (protective) antibody 
level that is considered protective. 
A further highlight includes the 
assessment of the potential of MCT 
and Virus-Like Particle technology 
platform to serve as an adjuvant 
in the development of a vaccine 
against malaria. The combination 
of VLP with MCT appears to be 
an attractive biodegradable and 
safe formulation for development 
of novel prophylactic vaccines. 
Cross Reactivity Wheel
The Group is proud of their 
commitment to the education both 
of physicians and also patients 
and therefore to coincide with 
the annual European Academy 
of Allergy & Clinical Immunology 
(EAACI) congress, an educational 
tool highlighting the degree of 
cross-reactivity between allergens 
was researched and developed.

The tool comprises a list of allergens 
and an overview of any potential 
cross-reactivity. The piece also 
includes a wheel that can be 
turned to highlight cross reactivity 
between common allergens to 
enable physicians to better explain 
allergy to patients and allow them 
to feel involved in their condition 
and take an active role in avoiding 
cross-reactive allergens.
Following a successful launch 
at EAACI 2017 in Helsinki, the 
cross-reactivity tool is being 
made available to all the Groups’ 
markets to assist in the further 
education of patients and doctors.

Strategic Report
Principal Risks  
and Uncertainties
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s system of risk management. 
In common with many 
pharmaceutical companies the 
Group faces a number of risks and 
uncertainties. Internal controls are in 
place to help identify, manage and 
mitigate these risks. The main risks 
have been identified as follows:
Commercial successful 
products risk
Continued development of viable 
new products and their successful 
registration and marketing is key to 
the success of the Group and is a 
costly and lengthy process. Rationale 
for new product development 
may indicate potential; however, 
following significant investment 
there is no guarantee that a product 
will be commercially successful.
In order to mitigate this risk, 
the Group is developing and 
commercialising Pollinex Grass in 
the US, seeking the PEI market 
authorisation for Pollinex Quattro 
Grass in Germany and continuing 
to increase market share across 
Europe as well as developing 
new markets to spread risk. 
Production risk
A significant majority of the Group’s 
products are manufactured on the 
Worthing site which is shared with 
GSK. Any disruption to production 
caused by internal or external factors 
could materially affect the business. 
The site is also leased from GSK 
and therefore there is a mid-term 
risk that the lease is terminated. 
Further, any failure in production 
could lead to a product recall. In 
order to minimise these risks, regular 
maintenance and upgrade of the 
facility is undertaken. The Group has 
a recovery plan in place. In respect 
of the lease, the Group is currently 
negotiating a longer termination 
notice period and has a contingency 
plan in place. The Group also has 
an IT disaster recovery plan. 
Product liability risk
Despite extensive product testing 
prior to market launch, products 
may produce unanticipated adverse 
side effects that may hinder their 
marketability. The Group may 
be insufficiently covered for any 
potential litigation which in some  allergytherapeutics.com 37
Risk Management
cases can potentially be open-
ended. The Group’s manufacturing 
facilities and those of some of its 
suppliers are subject to regulatory 
requirements and there is a risk 
that such facilities may not comply 
with such requirements. The Group 
maintains product liability insurance 
and ensures systems and processes 
relating to the manufacture of its 
products are compliant and regularly 
reviewed. It has a pharmacovigilance 
team in place to monitor and 
address any safety issues arising.
Intellectual property risk
Group patents may be challenged 
at any time and any unsuccessful 
defence may cause the Group to 
lose protection for its products 
and subsequently affect further 
development and sales. The Group is 
reliant on some intellectual property 
owned by external stakeholders 
that, if lost, could hinder the 
commercialisation of some of its 
products. The Group has internal 
and external patent experts. Internal 
controls are in place to avoid 
disclosure of patentable material 
and to protect existing patents. 
Arrangements are also in place to 
notify the Group of any infringements 
of our intellectual property which 
it would defend robustly.
Economic risks
A high level of risk is attached to 
the research, development and 
commercialisation of innovative 
drugs. The Group ensures that 
business cases are scrutinised 
before Board approval and that 
any increases in costs are justified. 
Competitors may reduce prices or 
increase sales investment making 
maintaining market share less 
profitable. Key suppliers may be 
unable to execute contractual 
requirements that hamper product 
development and/or the route to 
markets, but the Group maintains 
appropriate measures to protect 
its supply chains. The Group may 
be unable to attract partners or 
licensees on favourable terms 
or recruit the right staff to help 
develop and market its products. 
Approximately 59% (2016: 59%) of 
Group sales are made in Germany 
and therefore Group results are 
particularly sensitive to German 
legislation and government policies 
and performance of the German 
market. To mitigate this risk, the 
Group continues to expand its 
revenue outside Germany. The 
Group also continues to develop 
new products and increase clinical 
data to protect its market position. 
Pharmaceutical products are 
subject to far greater controls on 
price in certain markets than other 
products in the marketplace. Some 
governments intervene directly in 
setting price levels and rebates paid 
into public sick funds, especially 
with an increasing aged population 
in developed countries. The Group 
cannot accurately predict when, 
where and how such controls and 
restrictions may be altered, either 
to its benefit or detriment, but 
it does conduct regular reviews 
of pricing and reimbursement 
levels and assessments of 
healthcare reforms on pricing.
European Union 
Referendum risks
The referendum in the UK to leave 
the EU could pose a significant risk 
for the Group. In the short term 
the referendum outcome has and 
may continue to impact exchange 
rates and investor confidence. The 
medium term risk impact is not clear 
given the uncertain nature of the 
future arrangements between the UK 
and the rest of the EU. Significant 
potential areas of risk are regulatory, 
fiscal and financial. The Group 
mitigation in relation to currencies 
is noted under Financial Risks. In 
relation to other aspects of this risk, 
the Group has considered at a high 
level the potential effects. The Group 
does have in place a high-level 
contingency plan but will only carry 
out detailed evaluation and planning 
once future arrangements between 
the UK and the EU become clearer. 
Financial risks
Adequate funding may not be 
available to the Group, either 
through reserves or external partners 
for the advancement of clinical 
trials, manufacturing and marketing. 
Failure to obtain further funding 
may lead to postponement or 
cancellation of programmes. The 
Board actively reviews the financial 
requirements of the Group on a 
regular basis in order to ensure that 
adequate funding is available. 
A majority of the Group’s sales 
are denominated in euros whilst 
nearly all the manufacturing and 
most corporate administration 
costs are in the UK and therefore 
the Group is exposed to volatility  38
Strategic Report | Risk Management
in exchange rate fluctuations. 
The Group monitors exchange 
rates regularly and implements 
hedges to mitigate such risks.
Note 24 in the Notes to the 
Financial Statements gives details 
of the Group’s objectives and 
policies for risk management 
of financial instruments.
Clinical and regulatory risk
The Group operates in a highly 
regulated environment for the 
testing, manufacture and supply 
of its products. Compliance with 
clinical and regulatory requirements 
within the EU affects not only the 
cost of product development and 
resource use, but also the time 
required to comply. Increased 
regulation may require products 
to be amended to comply with 
regulations and/or products have to 
be withdrawn, reducing revenues 
and/or increasing costs. Regulatory 
authorities such as the FDA and 
PEI are increasingly focussed on 
the benefit/risk of pharmaceutical 
products and safety data making it 
more onerous to obtain regulatory 
approval. Compliance systems 
are in place to ensure all clinical, 
manufacturing and marketing 
activities comply with regulations 
in the EU and other territories. 
Standard operating procedures are 
maintained to ensure compliance 
with good manufacturing practice. 
The Group strictly monitors new 
industry regulations and engages 
with key regulatory authorities 
to inform the Group’s strategic 
direction and identify factors likely 
to affect the future development, 
performance and position of the 
Group’s business. The Group 
maintains good relations with the 
small number of specialised suppliers 
for its raw materials for its products.
Internal controls
The internal control system is 
designed to manage rather 
than eliminate risk, but it can 
only provide reasonable and 
not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. 
Internal controls are designed for 
the safeguarding of assets, the 
maintenance of proper accounting 
records, the reliability of financial 
information, compliance with 
appropriate legislation, regulation 
and best practice and the 
identification and management 
of business risk. The Group 
has an internal audit function, 
reporting directly to the Audit 
Committee, which carries out 
periodic reviews of the Group’s 
subsidiaries. The Group also has a 
budgeting and reporting system 
in place, with results compared 
to annual budgets and half-yearly 
forecasts using variance analysis.
The Strategic Report, as set 
out on pages 1 to 41 has been 
approved by the Board.

Financial Review
Financial Review
The following section should be read in 
conjunction with the financial statements 
and related Notes on pages 59 to 1 14.
Overview
The results for the twelve months  
to 30 June 2017 demonstrate 
continuing growing profitability of 
the core business before R&D 
expense, with an operating profit 
excluding R&D of £7.4 million  
(2016: £4.3 million). Including  
R&D expense of £9.3 million (2016:  
£16.2 million), the Group reported  
an operating loss of £1.9 million 
(2016: loss £12.0 million). 
The operating loss includes a  
non-cash credit of £0.8 million  
(2016: charge of £2.0 million) in 
relation to the fair valuation of 
forward exchange contracts.  
The reduction in research and 
development activity was due to  
the timing of trials related to the US 
programme and the European Birch 
Dosing Study. The net loss after  
tax for the period was £2.5 million 
(2016: loss of £13.1 million).

Strategic Report | Financial Review
Revenue
Helped by a stronger weighted 
average euro exchange rate against 
sterling during the year compared 
to the prior year, revenue increased 
by 32% to £64.1 million (2016: 
£48.5 million). The weighted 
average euro exchange rate in the 
year was €1.16 to £1 compared 
to €1.36 in the previous year; the 
impact of the stronger euro on 
revenue was £8.6 million. Although 
the vaccine markets in Europe did 
not grow significantly, revenue 
at constant currency* was 14.5% 
higher at £55.545 million (2016: 
£48.509 million) as shown in the 
table on the previous page. 
Revenue from Germany was 59% 
(2016: 59%) of total reported revenue 
although the Group continues to 
develop new and existing markets 
to reduce reliance on the German 
market. The key flagship product 
Pollinex Quattro, which accounts 
for 44% of total sales (2016: 45%), 
grew strongly in the year at a 
double digit constant currency 
growth rate. In addition to the 
sale of allergy vaccines, the Group 
has continued to look to increase 
its revenue from other products, 
including synbiotics. Total sales 
from other products contributed 
£4.4 million for the year ended 
30 June 2017 (2016: £3.6 million).
Revenue in Germany grew 
well in the year with revenue 
at constant currency increasing 
to £32.3 million (2016: £28.5 
million); an increase of 13%. 
All the main European markets 
(except for Italy) exhibited double 
digit sales growth at constant 
currency with Spain showing 13%; 
The Netherlands 29%; Austria 
27% and Germany 13%.
Gross Profit
With the increased sales, cost 
of sales rose to £16.8 million 
(2016: £14.1 million). The gross 
margin was 74% (2016: 71%), 
leading to a gross profit of £47.4 
million (2016: £34.4 million). 
Operating Expenses
Total overheads are £3.5 million 
higher against the prior year at 
£50.0 million (2016: £46.5 million). 
Within this total is a reduction in 
R&D expenditure which fell by 
£6.9 million to £9.3 million (2016: 
£16.2 million) due to the reduced 
clinical study activity during the year.
Sales, marketing and distribution 
costs which were mainly continental 
European increased by £6.7 million 
to £26.9 million (2016: £20.2 million). 
About half of the increase was due 
to the strong euro against sterling 
while the Group also continued to 
invest in improving its marketing and 
sales infrastructure. Administration 
expenses increased by £3.7 million 
to £13.8 million (2016: £10.1 million) 
with the major driver behind this 
increase being foreign exchange. 
In the previous year the Group 
booked a non-cash gain of £2.4m 
on its US dollar cash deposits 
due to the weakening pound. In 
the current year, the Group held 
minimal US currency holdings. 
The remainder of the increase 
was mostly due to the weakening 
of sterling against the euro. 
Other income in the year of 
£0.7 million (2016: £0.1 million) 
was all due to R&D tax credits 
in the UK.
Tax 
The current year tax charge is 
predominately made up of provisions 
for tax in the Italian and German 
subsidiaries (as in the previous year).
 
Balance Sheet
Property, plant and equipment were 
in line with last year at £9.7 million 
with the depreciation charge for the 
period equalling new investment 
in new manufacturing plant and 
office refurbishment. Goodwill 
increased to £3.4 million due solely 
to the stronger euro exchange 
rate at the balance sheet date 
(2016: £3.3 million), whilst other 
intangible assets have not changed, 
with an increase due to foreign 
exchange changes offsetting the 
amortisation charge for the year.
Total current assets, excluding cash, 
have increased by £1.1 million to 
£15.3 million (2016: £14.2 million). 
Inventory deceased by £0.2 million 
as the Group carefully managed 
its production planning. Trade 
debtors have decreased (mainly in 
UK and Italy) reflecting the Group’s 
management of debtors despite 
increased sales. Cash and cash at 
hand decreased to £22.1 million 
from £23.4 million in 2016. 
The fair value of derivative financial 
instruments was a liability of £0.4m 
in 2017 (2016: £1.2 million).
Retirement benefit obligations, which 
relate solely to the German pension 
scheme, decreased to £9.6 million 
(2016: £10.2 million). The decrease 
in the liability was mainly driven by 
an increase in the discount rate.
* Percentage based on figures in thousands (2017: £55.545m, 2016: £48.509m) allergytherapeutics.com 41
Financial Review
The Group achieved a net cash 
surplus of £0.2 million in the year 
(2016: £11.8 million cash used) 
primarily due to the increased 
sales and reduction in spend in the 
year on the R&D programme.
Currency 
The Group uses forward exchange 
contracts to mitigate exposure 
to the effects of exchange rates. 
The current policy of the Group 
is to cover, on average, about 
70% of the net euro exposure 
for a year on a declining basis. 
Financing 
The Group’s debt on its balance 
sheet relates to activities in Spain 
and consists of the loans acquired 
as a result of the Alerpharma 
acquisition (£1.7 million) and further 
loans (£1.7 million) arranged to 
fund development of products in 
the Spanish market. The overdraft 
facility was unused at 30 June 
2017 but has been renewed for 
a further 12 months to cover 
seasonal funding requirements.
The Directors believe that the 
Group will have adequate facilities 
for the foreseeable future and 
accordingly they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the full year results.
Legal
On 23 February 2015, the Company 
received notification that The 
Federal Office for Economics 
and Export (“BAFA”) had made a 
decision to reverse their preliminary 
exemption to the increased 
manufacturers rebate in Germany 
for the period July to December 
2012. The Company was granted 
a preliminary exemption to the 
increased rebate for this period 
by BAFA in 2013. The Company 
recognised revenue of €1.4 million 
(£1.1 million at that time) against 
this exemption in the year ended 
30 June 2013. All other preliminary 
exemptions (granted for periods up 
to 30 June 2012) have previously 
been ratified as final by BAFA. After 
taking legal advice, the Company 
has lodged an appeal against this 
decision and is confident that the 
exemption will be re-instated. 
Therefore, as at 30 June 2017, no 
provision has been recognised for 
the repayment of the rebate refund 
of €1.4 million (£1.2 million). This 
position will be kept under review.
The Group is in discussion with one 
of its suppliers and their lawyers over 
potential cost overruns on one of 
its clinical trials which may lead to 
additional expense for the Group.

The Board Meetings
There were nine Board meetings held during the year. 
The annual calendar includes a budget meeting at which the Executive team from all areas of the business present 
their business unit updates and their proposed budget for the forthcoming financial year. The budget meetings are 
also an opportunity for the Board to spend some time with members of senior management in a less formal 
environment.
The Chairman maintains regular contact with the Non-Executive Directors and the CEO outside of meetings. 
Board Papers
Board papers are circulated by email at least three clear business days in advance of any meeting to ensure that 
Directors have sufficient time to read the papers and consider their content prior to the meeting. 
Matters Considered by the Board
At each meeting, the Board receives business updates from the CEO, financial performance updates from the 
Finance Director, the Committee Chairmen update the Board on any Committee matters and there is a Health & 
Safety update. 
R&D investment is regularly considered and clinical study budget variances are also brought to the attention of 
the Board. 
New business opportunities and any other key investment decisions are proposed by the CEO as they arise. Often, 
such matters are complex and evolve over a period of time. 
Other periodic matters considered by the Board include: Annual and half year results; Annual budget; Principal 
Risks; AGM resolutions; and LTIP awards. 
Market, broker updates and changes to the shareholder register are circulated to the Board outside of the meetings. 46

Unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee
The Committee’s key objectives are to ensure that Allergy Therapeutics’ executive team is appropriately motivated 
by remuneration arrangements that are aligned with the interests of long term shareholders. The Committee 
determines and agrees the overall Remuneration Policy, including appropriate salary levels for each Executive 
Director; the composition of remuneration packages, performance periods, measures and targets for variable 
remuneration components and any clawback arrangements. In addition, the Committee also agrees or recommends 
to the Board various compensation matters, including any share-related compensation, for executive management. 
During the financial year, the Remuneration Committee comprised Stephen Smith (Chairman) and Thomas Lander. 
The Terms of Reference of the Committee clearly sets out the Committee’s duties and responsibilities. The number 
of meetings held during the year and attendance at those meetings is set out in the table on page 44. 
The Committee is able to seek external advice when required. During the year, the Committee took advice from 
H2Glenfern Ltd on various matters including the 2013 Long Term Incentive arrangements. During the year, the 
Company was charged a total of £10,200 by H2GlenFern Ltd in respect of advice to the Committee. 
Remuneration policy
The Committee ensures that the remuneration policy is linked to the delivery of the Group’s business objectives and 
strategy; packages are designed to motivate and retain existing executives, recruit new high-quality executives and 
encourage executives to acquire and retain Allergy Therapeutics shareholdings. 
Elements of Remuneration:

Purpose & link to strategy Operation Performance Metric
Annual Bonus
To incentivise and reward 
performance. 
Performance measures and 
targets are set each year to 
reinforce the strategic business 
priorities for the year.
The annual bonus arrangements 
are reviewed annually and 
agreed by the Committee at the 
start of the financial year. 
The maximum bonus 
opportunity for Manuel Llobet is 
60% of annual salary and is 30% 
for Nick Wykeman.
Executive’s performance is 
measured relative to challenging 
one-year financial targets and 
other performance objectives.
Long Term Incentive Plan
To incentivise and reward long-
term outperformance, and 
help retain Executive Directors 
over the longer term.
Executive Directors are eligible 
to receive awards of shares 
under the 2013 Long Term 
Incentive Plan, at the discretion 
of the Committee. In assessing 
the outcome of the performance 
conditions, the Committee 
satisfies itself that the figures are 
a genuine reflection of financial 
performance. 
LTIPs awarded since 2016 are 
subject to malus and clawback 
provisions
2013 LTIP awards vest after 
a performance period of 
approximately three years. 
Since 2016, 50% of the Executive 
Directors award is subject to a 
three-year post vesting holding 
period. 
The vesting of the award is subject 
to continued employment and 
the Company’s performance over 
a three-year performance period 
based:
–  50% on compounded annual 
growth rate in profit before 
depreciation, amortisation  
and R&D spend
–  50% on compounded share 
price growth
The performance measures and 
weighting are reviewed by the 
Committee annually and the 
Committee has the discretion to 
make changes to the measures or 
weightings for future awards to 
ensure that they remain relevant 
to the Company strategy and are 
suitably stretching.

Nominations Committee Report
Nominations Committee Report
The Nomination Committee has 
responsibility for making recommendations 
on Board appointments and succession  
to the Board. 
The members of the Committee as at 30 June 2017, 
comprised Peter Jensen (Chairman), Jeff Barton and 
Stephen Smith. The Nomination Committee met twice 
during the year and attendance at these meetings is 
shown in the table on page 44. 
Board Composition and Succession Planning
During the year, the Committee considered Board 
composition and succession planning for both Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors and also the Executive 
Management Team. Following a review of Executive 
succession planning, the Group recruited two senior 
managers in Germany and, as noted in the CEO Report, 
has also strengthened the R&D function during the year. 
When considering Non-executive Director succession 
planning, the Committee ensures that the Board and its 
Committees continue to have the right mix of skills and 
experience to be able to deliver the Group’s strategy. 
Director Recruitment 
Following a review of the skills, experience and 
knowledge of Board members during the year, the 
Committee agreed to seek a new Non-executive Director 
with specific knowledge of the US Regulatory market, 
which would benefit the Board as the Company 
embarked on its planned US program. Separately, 
Thomas Lander indicated that he wished to retire from 
the Board which would have led to a skills gap in R&D 
and clinical knowledge. 
Executive search agency, Director Bank, was engaged to 
assist with a search to identify appropriate candidates 
who were US based and had relevant regulatory and 
clinical experience. To ensure that the list of candidates 
reflected diversity of both gender and skills, a broad 
brief was provided to Director Bank. Following an 
interview process led by the Chairman and Chief 
Executive, it was recommended to the Committee that 
Tunde Otulana be appointed as a Non-Executive 
Director of the Company. The Committee made a formal 
recommendation of the appointment to the Board.
Director Induction
An induction programme is provided for any new 
Director, which is tailored depending on the Director’s 
experience and expected role on the Board. Tunde’s 
induction program included individual meetings with the 
Chairman, Executive Directors, Company Secretary and 
members of senior management, a site visit to the 
Worthing site, and an introduction to the Company’s 
advisers and lawyers. Tunde was also provided with 
copies of past Board and Committee papers and 
minutes, and individual briefings were arranged on 
topics such as Directors’ duties and responsibilities and 
the R&D Pipeline.

Audit Committee Report
The Committee plays a key role for the 
Board, overseeing the financial reporting 
process, monitoring the effectiveness of 
internal control, internal audit and the 
external audit and also monitors the 
independence of the external auditors 
and the provision of non-audit services. 
As at 30 June 2017, the Committee comprises two 
independent Non-Executive Directors and is chaired by 
Stephen Smith who is considered to have significant, 
recent and relevant financial experience. 
The Committee’s meetings were also attended by 
invitation by the Company’s Finance Director, Company 
Secretary, Group Financial Controller and Financial 
Reporting Manager together with senior representatives 
of the external auditor. 
The Committee met twice during the year. Attendance at 
these meetings is shown in the table on page 44. The 
Committee also met privately during the year with the 
external auditors.
External Auditors
The Committee oversees the relationship with Grant 
Thornton LLP , the external auditors, and is responsible 
for developing and monitoring the Company’s policy on 
external audit and for monitoring the auditor’s 
independence.
The external auditors have direct access to the Audit 
Committee Chairman should they wish to raise any 
concerns outside of formal Committee meetings. 
The Committee monitored Grant Thornton’s 
effectiveness during the year and considered the views 
of management that Grant Thornton were providing a 
good-quality audit service. The Committee is satisfied 
that the external auditors remain independent and 
objective and that the Group is receiving a robust audit 
and has therefore recommended to the Board that Grant 
Thornton be reappointed in 2017. 
Non-Audit Services
Non-audit services are normally limited to assignments 
that are closely related to the annual audit or where the 
work is of such a nature that a detailed understanding of 
the Group is necessary. 
The Company has adopted a policy to ensure that the 
provision of non-audit services by the external auditor 
does not compromise its independence or objectivity. 
The policy requires the Audit Committee to pre-approve 
any non-audit work with a cost exceeding £10,000. 
Approval is only given following a thorough assessment 
of the case. 
The total fees charged by Grant Thornton in the year are 
shown on page 85.  allergytherapeutics.com 53
Audit Committee Report
Internal Audit
During the year, the internal audit plan included reviews 
of financial controls in Germany, Spain and Italy. Next 
year, it is expected that the audit plan will include UK, 
Germany, Italy and Spain. 
The Committee reviews the timetable and work of the 
internal audit programme, any matters identified as a 
result of internal audits and whether recommendations 
are addressed by management in a timely and 
appropriate way. 
Internal Controls
The Audit Committee monitors and reviews the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and reports 
to the Board on its work and conclusions. In reviewing 
the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls, the 
Committee considers reports from the internal audit 
team and the auditors as part of their auditing process. 
No significant failings or weaknesses have been 
identified in the review process during the year. 
Details of the Group’s internal controls are set out below:
 – Schedule of matters reserved for the Board 
 – Terms of Reference for Board Committees 
 – Schedule of Delegated Authorities 
 – Documentation of significant transactions 
 – Whistle blowing procedure under which staff may raise 
matters of concern confidentially. 
Controls relating to financial reporting:
 – Appropriately qualified management structure, with 
clear lines of responsibility
 – A comprehensive budget review and approval process 
 – Board and Audit Committee updates from the Finance 
Director which include forecasts and performance 
against budget
 – Regular internal audit of the financial control 
procedures

Governance | Report of the Directors 
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance  
and position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 
1 to 41. The financial position of the Group, its cash 
flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are also 
described in the Finance Director’s Financial Review on 
pages 39 to 41.
In addition, Note 24 to the financial statements includes 
the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for 
managing its capital, its financial risk management 
objectives, details of its financial instruments and its 
exposures to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and 
liquidity risk.
After making appropriate enquiries, which included a 
review of the annual budget, considering the cash flow 
requirements for the foreseeable future, noting the 
renewed overdraft facility, and the effects of sales and 
foreign exchange sensitivities on the Group’s funding 
plans, the Directors continue to believe that the Group 
will have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future and accordingly 
have applied the going concern principle in drawing up 
the financial statements. In reaching this view, the 
Directors have considered and prioritised the actions 
that could be taken to offset the impact of any shortfall 
in operating performance.
Strategic report
The strategic report on pages 1 to 41 contains 
information on future developments and post balance 
sheet events.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the  
Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable  
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
Directors have to prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and 
have elected to prepare the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable laws) 
including FRS101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs and profit 
or loss of the Company and Group for that period. In 
preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
 – make judgments and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
 – state whether applicable IFRSs and UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements;
 – prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position  
of the company and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and  
other irregularities. allergytherapeutics.com 57
Report of the Directors
The Directors confirm that in so far as each Director is 
aware:
 – there is no relevant audit information of which the 
Group’s auditors are unaware; and
 – the Directors have taken all the steps that they ought 
to have taken as Directors in order to make 
themselves aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the auditor are aware of that 
information.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Group’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Disclosure to auditors 
So far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Group’s auditors are 
unaware and each Director has taken all steps that he or 
she ought to have taken as a Director in order to make 
himself aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the auditors are aware of that information. 
Independent auditors 
The Group’s auditors, Grant Thornton LLP , have indicated 
their willingness to continue in office and a resolution 
seeking to re-appoint them will be proposed at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
Annual general meeting 
The 2017 Annual General Meeting of the Company will 
be held from 11:00 am on 22 November 2017 at the 
offices of Covington LLP in London. The Notice of the 
Meeting, together with an explanation of the business to 
be dealt with at the Meeting, is included as a separate 
document and is also available on our website.

Opinion
Our opinion on the financial statements  
is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Allergy 
Therapeutics Plc (the ‘parent company’) and its 
subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) for the year ended 30 June 
2017 which comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in 
Equity, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the 
Company Balance Sheet, and the Statement of 
Changes in Equity (Company), and Notes to the 
Financial Statements, including a summary of 
significant accounting policies. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the Group financial statements is 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in the preparation of the parent company 
financial statements is applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial 
Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosures 
Framework (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
In our opinion:
 – the financial statements give a true and fair view  
of the state of the Group’s and of the parent 
company’s affairs as at 30 June 2017 and of the 
Group’s loss for the year then ended;
 – the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union;
 – the parent company financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; 
and

accordance with the requirements of the

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International

law. Our responsibilities under those standards are 
further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the 
audit of the financial statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the parent 
company in accordance with the ethical requirements 
that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements 
in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as 
applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion.
Who we are reporting to
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as 
a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company 
and the company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to 
report to you where:
 – the directors’ use of the going concern basis of 
accounting in the preparation of the financial 
statements is not appropriate; or
 – the directors have not disclosed in the financial 
statements any identified material uncertainties that 
may cast significant doubt about the Group’s or the 
parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting for a period of at 
least twelve months from the date when the financial 
statements are authorised for issue.
Overview of our  
audit approach
 – Overall Group materiality: 
£640,000, which represents 1.0% 
of the Group’s revenues
 – Key audit matters were  
identified as revenue recognition, 
the defined benefit pension 
scheme and impairment of 
non-current assets 
 – We performed full scope 
procedures at the Group’s 
operating locations in the United 
Kingdom and Germany. We 
performed targeted procedures 
over component locations in  
Italy, Spain, Switzerland and  
the Netherlands

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement 
(whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those that had the greatest effect on: the 
overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key Audit Matter – Group How the matter was addressed in the  
audit – Group
Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of the Group’s goods is 
recognised once certain criteria are met. The most 
critical element of these criteria is that revenue is 
recognised only when the Group has transferred to the 
buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of 
the goods, which is generally when the customer has 
physically received those goods. 
While determining the date of delivery to the customer 
and therefore the timing of revenue recognition 
requires little significant management judgement or 
estimate, due to the volume of transactions that occur 
during the year, we identified revenue recognition as a 
significant risk, which was one of the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to:
 – considering the appropriateness of the Group’s 
revenue recognition policy in light of the 
requirements of International Accounting Standard 
(IAS) 18 ‘Revenue’ and ensuring its consistent 
application;
 – selecting a sample of revenue transactions from 
across the Group and ascertaining the occurrence of 
each item through verification to source 
documentation pertaining to the validity of the sale 
and the date at which the risks and rewards of 
ownership transfer to the customer;
 – identifying sales recorded in the last three days of 
the financial year across the Group’s key trading 
jurisdictions and considering whether delivery of the 
goods to the customer had occurred; and
 – selecting a sample of year end receivables and 
verifying their existence by tracing their payment 
after the balance sheet date.
The Group’s accounting policy on revenue recognition 
is set out in Note 2 “Accounting Policies” to the 
financial statements and related disclosures are shown 
in Notes 3 and 4. 
 
Key observations
Our procedures, as set out above, did not identify any 
material misstatement in respect of revenue recognised 
by the Group during the year.

Key Audit Matter – Group How the matter was addressed in the  
audit – Group
Defined benefit pension scheme
The Group has a defined benefit pension scheme that 
provides benefits to a number of current and former 
German employees. At 30 June 2017 the defined 
benefit pension net deficit was £9.6m. The gross value 
of pension scheme liabilities and assets which form the 
net deficit amount to £11.0m and £1.4m respectively.
The measurement of pension liabilities in accordance 
with IAS 19 “Employee Benefits” involves significant 
judgement and their valuation is subject to complex 
actuarial assumptions. Variations in those actuarial 
assumptions could lead to a materially different 
defined benefit pension scheme liability being 
recognised within the Group financial statements.
We therefore identified the defined benefit pension 
scheme, including its valuation, as a significant risk, 
which was one of the most significant assessed risks  
of material misstatement.
 
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to:
 – utilising the expertise of our actuarial specialists in 
order to review the assumptions used, such as 
discount rate, price inflation, pension increase and 
mortality rates for reasonableness and methods 
employed in calculation of the obligation;
 – assessing the accuracy of the underlying data utilised 
by the actuaries; and
 – confirming the existence of pension scheme assets 
with third parties.
The Group’s accounting policy on defined benefit 
pension schemes is shown within note 2 “Accounting 
Policies” to the financial statements and related 
disclosures are included in note 26. 
Key observations
Our procedures, as set out above, did not identify any 
material misstatements in respect of the valuation of 
the defined benefit pension scheme as included within 
the Consolidated balance sheet.
Impairment of non-current assets
The directors are required to make an annual 
assessment to determine whether the Group’s 
goodwill which stands at £3.4m is impaired. In 
addition, other intangible assets are tested for 
impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount  
may not be recoverable. Other intangible assets  
at 30 June 2017 amount to £2.1m.
The process for assessing whether impairment exists 
under IAS 36 “Impairment of assets” is complex.  
The process of determining the value in use, through 
forecasting cash flows related to cash generating units 
(CGUs) and the determination of the appropriate 
discount rate and other assumptions to be applied  
can be highly judgemental and can significantly impact 
the results of the impairment review.
We therefore identified the impairment of non-current 
assets, being goodwill and other intangible assets,  
as a significant risk, which was one of the most 
significant assessed risks of material misstatement. 
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to:
 – obtaining management’s assessment of the relevant 
CGUs used in the impairment calculation and 
comparing those to our understanding of the 
business units and operating structure of the Group; 
 – recalculating the arithmetical accuracy of those 
calculations and considering the sensitivity of the 
impairment calculation to changes in key 
assumptions;
 – testing the assumptions utilised in the impairment 
models, including growth rates, discount rates and 
terminal values; and 
 – testing the accuracy of management’s forecasting 
through a comparison of budget to actual data and 
historical variance trends and reviewing the cash 
flows for exceptional or usual items or assumptions.
The Group’s accounting policy on impairment of 
non-current assets is shown within note 2 “Accounting 
Policies” to the financial statements and related 
disclosures are included in notes 14 and 15.
Key observations
Our procedures, as set out above, did not identify any 
material misstatements in respect of the carrying value 
of goodwill or intangible assets included within the 
Group balance sheet. 62
Financial Statements
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the 
economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality in 
determining the nature, timing and extent of our audit work and in evaluating the results of that work. 
Materiality was determined as follows:
Materiality measure Group Parent
Financial statements as a whole £640,000 which is 1% of Group 
revenue. This benchmark is 
considered the most appropriate 
because it the primary statutory 
reporting measure used to assess 
the Group’s performance during  
the year.
Materiality for the current year is 
higher than the level that we 
determined for the year ended 
30 June 2016 reflecting the Group’s 
increased revenues for the year 
ended 30 June 2017.
£43,000 which is 2% of the 
company’s total assets. This 
benchmark is considered the most 
appropriate because the company 
balance sheet primarily consists of 
investments in subsidiaries and 
intragroup receivables.
Materiality for the current year  
is similar to the level that we 
determined for the year ended 
30 June 2016.
Performance materiality used to 
drive the extent of our testing
75% of financial statement 
materiality.

An overview of the scope of our audit
Our audit approach was a risk-based approach founded 
on a thorough understanding of the Group’s business, 
its environment and risk profile and in particular 
included:
 – evaluation by the Group audit team of identified 
components to assess the significance of that 
component and to determine the planned audit 
response based on a measure of materiality. For 
example, significance as a percentage of the Group’s 
total assets, revenues and profit before taxation or 
significance based on qualitative factors, such as 
concerns over specific components; 
 – in respect of the parent company, full scope audit 
procedures; 
 – undertaking a planning visit in June 2017 to evaluate 
the Group’s internal control environment, perform an 
evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls over 
key financial statement risk areas identified as part of 
our audit risk assessment and to select certain 
transaction items to test during our procedures at the 
final audit stage; 
 – we determined that full scope audit procedures were 
to be carried out in the UK and German locations and 
targeted procedures in Spain, Italy and the 
Netherlands based on their relative materiality to the 
Group and an assessment of their audit risk. Those 
targeted procedures addressed the key audit matters 
set out above. Those locations subjected to full scope 
audit and targeted procedures represent 67.3% and 
22.0% of external Group revenues respectively, 
however comprehensive and targeted testing 
performed at the component and Group levels 
addressed 100% of Group revenues; 
 – the Group locations subject to comprehensive and 
targeted testing were consistent with the prior year 
except we extended our targeted procedures in 2017 
to address material inventory and cash balances in 
the Netherlands and Switzerland respectively;
 – the remaining operations of the Group were subject 
to analytical procedures over the balance sheet and 
income statements of the related entities with a focus 
on applicable risks identified above and the 
significance to the Group balances; 
 – detailed audit instructions were issued to the  
auditors of the reporting components in Germany, 
Italy and the Netherlands where full scope and 
targeted audit approaches had been identified.  
The instructions detailed the key audit matters that 
were to be addressed through the audit procedures 
and indicated the information that we required to 
 be reported back to the Group Audit Team. The 
Group Audit Team performed a site visit to Spain  
to perform planned targeted procedures. Our work 
over the cash balances held in Switzerland was 
conducted remotely; and 
 – in addition, the Group Audit Team performed a  
site visit to Germany, which included a review of the 
work performed by the component auditors and 
conducted a review of working papers by the Italian 
component auditors remotely. The Group Audit  
Team communicated with all component auditors 
throughout the planning, fieldwork and concluding 
stages of the local audits.  64

by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the 
course of the audit:
 – the information given in the strategic report and 
the directors’ report for the financial year for which 
the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements; and
 – the strategic report and the directors’ report have

Group and the parent company and its environment 
obtained in the course of the audit, we have not 
identified material misstatements in the strategic report 
or the directors’ report. 
Matters on which we are required to  
report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 
requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by 
the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit 
have not been received from branches not visited by 
us; or
 – the parent company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; 
or
 – certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made; or
 – we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit. 
Responsibilities of directors for the  
financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on pages 56 to 57, the directors 
are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a  
true and fair view, and for such internal control as the 
directors determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are 
responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent 
company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to  
liquidate the Group or the parent company or to  
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but  
to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit  
of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of  
these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit 
of the financial statements is located on the Financial 
Reporting Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/

which have been measured at fair value. They were approved and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 
27 September 2017.
New standards adopted 
There are no IFRS or IAS interpretations that are effective for the first time in this financial period that have had a 
material impact on the Group. 
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not 
been early adopted by the Group in the 30 June 2017 financial statements
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to 
existing standards have been published but are not yet effective. Not all of these have yet been adopted by the EU. 
The Group has not adopted any of these pronouncements early. The new standards, amendments and 
interpretations that are expected to be relevant to the Group’s financial statements are as follows:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2018)
This IFRS replaces IAS 39 and addresses the usefulness for users of financial statements by simplifying the 
classification and measurement requirements for financial instruments. Management are currently assessing the 
detailed impact on the Group’s financial statements. 
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (issued in May 2014 and effective 1 January 2018)
IFRS 15 supersedes current revenue recognition guidance including IAS 18, Revenue, and specifies how and when 
entities recognise revenue as well as requiring such entities to provide users of financial statements with more 
informative, relevant disclosures. The standard provides a single, principles based five-step model to be applied to 
all contracts with customers. Management are currently assessing the detailed impact on the Group’s financial 
statements. 
IFRS 16 Leases (effective 1 January 2019)
IFRS 16 removes the current distinction between an operating and finance lease, introducing consistent 
requirements for all leases similar to the current finance lease accounting.
Management anticipate that the above pronouncements will be adopted in the Group’s financial statements in line 
with the effective dates stated above. Management are currently assessing their detailed impact on the Group’s 
financial statements. 
Other new standards and interpretations have been issued but are not expected to have a material impact on the 
Group’s financial statements. 72

1. Basis of preparation continued
Going concern
Operating loss in the period was £1.9 million (2016:£12.0 million loss); net cash inflow from operations was 
£1.5 million (2016: £11.5 million net cash outflow). The inflow was due to the strong trading offset by further R&D 
expenditure. Excluding the R&D expenditure, the Group would have reported an operating profit of £7.4 million 
(2016:£4.3 million). The Directors do not consider the current operating loss to be a cause for concern. 
Detailed budgets have been prepared, including cash flow projections for the periods ending 30 June 2018 and 
30 June 2019. These projections include assumptions on the trading performance of the operating business and the 
continued availability of the existing bank facilities. The Group had a cash balance of £22.1m at 30 June 2017 and 
the overdraft facility was renewed in April 2017. After making appropriate enquiries, which included a review of the 
annual budget and latest forecast, by considering the cash flow requirements for the foreseeable future and the 
effects of sales and other sensitivities on the Group’s funding plans, the Directors continue to believe that the Group 
will have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and accordingly have 
applied the going concern principle in preparing these financial statements. 
2. Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These 
policies have been consistently applied to all years presented unless otherwise stated.
Consolidation
The Group’s financial statements consolidate those of the parent company and all of its subsidiaries drawn up to 
30 June 2017. The parent controls a subsidiary if it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement 
with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are 
deconsolidated on the date control ceases.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies 
are eliminated except for unrealised losses if they show evidence of impairment.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring accounting policies used 
into line with those used in the Group.
The Group applies the acquisition method in accounting for business combinations. The consideration transferred 
by the Group to obtain control of a subsidiary is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of assets 
transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group, which includes the fair value of any 
liability arising from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
The Group recognises identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination regardless of 
whether they have been previously recognised in the acquiree’s financial statements prior to the acquisition. Assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at their acquisition-date fair values.
Goodwill is stated after separate recognition of identifiable intangible assets. It is calculated as the excess of the 
sum of a) fair value of consideration transferred, b) the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree and c) acquisition-date fair value of any existing equity interest in the acquiree, over the acquisition-date 
fair values of identifiable net assets. If the fair values of identifiable net assets exceed the sum calculated above, the 
excess amount (i.e. gain on a bargain purchase) is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising from business combinations is the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and 
the fair value of the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. It is initially recognised as an intangible 
asset at cost and is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate 
that the asset may have been impaired. Details of impairment testing are described in the accounting policies.

2. Accounting policies continued
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are identified and recognised separately from goodwill where 
they satisfy the definition of an asset and be identifiable. The cost of such intangible assets is their fair value at the 
acquisition date.
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets are amortised over their useful 
economic life as follows:
Trade names 15 years
Customer relationships 5 years
Know-how and patents 10 years
Distribution agreements 15 years/period of contract
Externally acquired intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic life as below and assessed for impairment whenever 
there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation 
method for intangible assets is reviewed at least at each financial year end. 
Computer software 7 years
Other intangibles 15 years
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied 
in the asset is accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as 
changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible asset in either 
administration costs or marketing and distribution costs.
Internally generated intangible assets
An internally generated intangible asset arising from development (or the development phase) of an internal project 
is recognised if, and only if, all of the following have been demonstrated:
 – the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale
 – the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it
 – the ability to use or sell the intangible asset
 – how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits
 – the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or 
sell the intangible asset
 – the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development
The amount initially recognised for internally generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred 
from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no internally 
generated intangible asset can be recognised, research and development expenditure is charged to the 
consolidated income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Subsequent to initial recognition, internally generated intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation shall begin when the asset is available for use, i.e. 
when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by 
management.  74
Financial Statements
2. Accounting policies continued
Amortisation of all intangible assets is calculated on a straight line basis over the useful economic life using the 
following annual rates: 
Manufacturing know-how 15 years
Non-competing know-how 4 years
Other intangibles 15 years
These periods were selected to reflect the assets’ useful economic lives to the Group.
The cost of amortising intangible assets is included within administration expenses in the consolidated income 
statement.
Segmental reporting 
The Group’s operating segments are market based and are reported in a manner consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) who has been identified as the 
Executive Directors. The CODM is responsible for allocating resources and assessing the performance of the 
operating segments.
In identifying its operating segments, management follow the Group’s revenue lines which represent the main 
geographical markets within which the Group operates. These operating segments are managed separately as each 
requires different local expertise, regulatory knowledge and a specialised marketing approach. Each market based 
operating segment is engaged in production, marketing and selling within a particular economic environment that is 
different from that in segments operating in other economic environments. All inter-segment transfers are carried 
out at arm’s length prices.
Foreign currency translation
Functional and presentational currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The Group’s presentational 
currency is Sterling, which is also the functional currency of the Group’s parent.
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the 
dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and 
from the translation, at reporting period end exchange rates, of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies, are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. Non-monetary items are carried at 
historical cost or translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction or a weighted average rate as an 
approximation where this is not materially different. 
Foreign operations
In the Group’s financial statements, all assets, liabilities and transactions of Group entities with a functional currency 
other than sterling are translated into sterling upon consolidation. The functional currency of the entities in the 
Group has remained unchanged during the reporting period.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities have been translated into sterling at the closing rate at the reporting date. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity have been treated as assets and 
liabilities of the foreign entity and translated into sterling at the closing rate. Income and expenses have been 
translated into sterling at the weighted average rate over the reporting period which approximates to actual rates. 
Exchange differences are charged or credited to other comprehensive income (OCI) and recognised in the currency 
translation reserve in equity. OCI includes those items which would be reclassified to profit or loss and those items 
which would not be reclassified to profit or loss.

Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured by reference to the fair value of consideration received or receivable by the Group for goods 
supplied and services provided, net of statutory rebates paid in Germany and excluding value added tax. Revenue 
is recognised upon the performance of services or transfer of risk to the customer. 
Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all the following conditions have been satisfied:
 – the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods, which is 
generally when the customer has physically received the goods.
 – the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor 
effective control over the goods sold which is again when the customer has physically received the goods.
 – the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
 – it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group, and 
 – the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Where the Group provides services to new distributors, which mainly include marketing and customer information, 
in exchange for an up-front lump sum fee, revenue is recognised in line with these services being delivered. Services 
are fair valued and pro-rated to agree to the total fee receivable. Where there is an on-going responsibility to 
provide services, the balance relating to those services is recognised in future periods as the service is performed.
Part of the Group’s overseas sales are made through distributors and agents.
Arrangements for sales through distributors
For all distributor arrangements, the distributor is invoiced at the time of delivery and title to the product passes 
upon full and final settlement of the invoice to which the delivery relates. The distributor has full discretion over the 
setting of the final selling price to the end customer and is responsible for all customer returns of product. 
It is considered that the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product are transferred to the distributor at 
the point of delivery and therefore revenue is recognised at this point in accordance with IAS 18. 
Where the Group sells to distributors at initially low margin and there is further consideration receivable by the 
Group, this deferred consideration forms part of the fair valuation of consideration receivable by the Group for 
goods supplied. In these instances, the deferred consideration is accrued at a discounted value at the point of 
delivery.
Arrangements for sales through agents
For all agreements with agents, the agent places orders with the Group and goods are then shipped to them. The 
Group however, holds title to these products until they are sold on to a third party. The selling price to the end user 
is set by the relevant Government body and the agent receives a fixed percentage of this selling price. The agent 
notifies the Group monthly on stock levels and this is reconciled to a statement which generates an invoice for 
payment by the agent. The Group is responsible for any customer returns of product.
It is considered that the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product are not transferred from the Group 
until the agent has sold the product to a third party and therefore revenue on these sales is recognised only at this 
point by the Group in accordance with IAS 18.16.
Statutory Rebates
In Germany, pharmaceutical companies are required to pay a manufacturer’s rebate to the government as a 
contribution to the cost of medicines paid for by the State and private health funds. This is similar to a sales tax and 
the rebate is therefore treated as a deduction from revenue in accordance with IAS18.8. 76
Financial Statements
2. Accounting policies continued
Rebates have been in the region of 6% (inclusive of VAT). However, in 2010 the German government increased the 
rate to 16%. In certain circumstances, companies could apply for an exemption from the rebate increase, for limited 
periods at a time. If the application for the exemption is successful, a preliminary exemption is normally granted to 
be converted to a final exemption at a later date when audited financial statements are available. 
Allergy Therapeutics plc has been successful in obtaining preliminary exemptions up to 30 June 2012, which have 
been subsequently confirmed as final.
Revenue is recognised initially net of the full rebate, as at that stage it is not considered probable that any refund of 
the rebate will be received. When the preliminary exemption is granted, it is considered probable, based on our 
past experience, that the rebate refund will be received. Therefore, as it is probable that the economic benefits will 
flow to Allergy Therapeutics Plc, in accordance with IAS 18.14(d), revenue is adjusted at that time.
As of April 2014, the current rebate in force has been set at 7%. The rebate is subject to a price moratorium and this 
applies to certain products in Germany. 
Expenditure recognition
Operating expenses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement upon utilisation of the service or at the 
date of their origin. 
Property, plant and equipment (PPE)
The Group policy is that all freehold properties will be subject to a full revaluation with sufficient regularity so that 
the carrying amount and the fair value are not materially different. 
Revaluations are performed by independent qualified and experienced valuers who have adequate local knowledge 
in the country in which the property is situated. In the intervening years between independent revaluations, the 
Directors review the carrying values of the freehold land and buildings and adjustments are made if the carrying 
values differ significantly from their respective fair values. Increases in the carrying value from revaluations are 
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under the heading of revaluation reserve 
unless this reverses a revaluation decrease on some asset previously recognised in the income statement, in which 
case it is first credited to the consolidated income statement to that extent. When an item of property, plant and 
equipment is revalued, any accumulated depreciation at the date of the revaluation is restated proportionately with 
the change in the gross carrying amount of the asset. The amount of the adjustment arising on the restatement or 
elimination of accumulated depreciation forms part of the increase or decrease in carrying amount. Decreases in the 
carrying values arising from revaluations are first offset against increases from earlier revaluations in respect of the 
same assets and are thereafter charged to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Other plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
losses. Provision for depreciation of all PPE assets of the Group (except land) is made over their estimated useful 
lives, on a straight line basis principally using the following annual rates:
Freehold buildings 33 years
Computer equipment 3 – 7 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Fixtures and fittings 5 – 15 years
Plant and machinery  5 – 15 years
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually and amended as necessary. Assets are reviewed for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the PPE may not be 
recoverable. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying 
amount exceeds the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell or value in use.
Depreciation charges are included in either administration expenses or cost of sales when arriving at operating profit 
in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Impairment
The Group’s goodwill, other intangible assets, freehold land and buildings and plant & equipment are subject to 
impairment testing.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately 
identifiable cash flows (cash generating units). Goodwill is allocated to those cash generating units that are expected 
to benefit from synergies of the related business combination and represent the lowest level within the Group at 
which management controls the related cash flows. 
Individual assets or cash generating units that include goodwill or intangible assets with an indefinite useful life or 
those not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually. All other individual assets or cash 
generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets or cash generating units carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less 
costs to sell and value in use, based on an internal discounted cash flow evaluation. Impairment losses recognised 
for cash generating units, to which goodwill has been allocated, are credited initially to the carrying amount of 
goodwill. Any remaining impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in the cash generating unit. With 
the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously 
recognised may no longer exist. 
Inventories
Inventory is carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value. The costs of raw materials, consumables, work in 
progress and finished goods are measured by means of weighted average cost using standard costing techniques. 
The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises direct production costs such as raw materials, 
consumables, utilities and labour, and production overheads such as employee costs, depreciation, maintenance 
and indirect factory costs. Standard costs are reviewed regularly in order to ensure relevant measures of utilisation, 
production lead time and appropriate levels of manufacturing expense are reflected in the standards.
Net realisable value is calculated based on the selling price in the normal course of business less any costs to sell.
Research & Development Investment Credits
Investment credits are directly related to the Group’s qualifying research and development expenditure and have a 
monetary value that is independent of the Group’s tax liability. Such investment credits are dealt with in other 
income in the consolidated income statement. 
Leases
A finance lease exists where the economic ownership of a leased asset is transferred to the lessee and the lessee 
bears substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset. All other leases are operating leases in 
the Group.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement over the term of the lease. There are no finance leases 
in the Group.
Financial assets
Financial assets consist of cash at bank and in hand, trade and other receivables and derivative financial instruments. 
Financial assets are assigned to their different categories by management on initial recognition, depending on the 
contractual arrangements.
Cash and trade and other receivables are denominated as loans and receivables and these are measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Discounting is omitted where the 
effect of discounting is immaterial. Financial derivatives are designated at FVTPL (fair value through profit and loss) 
upon initial recognition.  78
Financial Statements
2. Accounting policies continued
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and overdrafts, together with other short-term, 
highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from inception that are readily convertible into 
known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
All financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument 
and loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value, including transaction costs, with the exception of ‘fair 
value through profit and loss’ and subsequently at amortised cost, with any changes going through the consolidated 
income statement. Where securities are designated as ‘fair value through profit and loss’, gains and losses arising 
from changes in fair value are included in net profit or loss for the period. 
Derecognition of financial assets occurs when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments expire or are 
transferred and substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. An assessment for 
impairment is undertaken at least at each reporting period whether or not there is objective evidence that a financial 
asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities include borrowings, trade and other payables and derivative financial instruments. 
Financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual agreements of the 
instrument. All interest related charges are recognised as an expense in ‘Finance expense” in the consolidated 
income statement.
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method. Contingent consideration on business combinations is recognised initially at 
their fair value and subsequently measured at FVTPL.
Borrowings comprise secured bank borrowings, and are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration 
received net of issue costs associated with the borrowings. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and 
borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses euro forward contracts and euro exchange swaps to manage the exposure to changes in translation 
rates and these are classified as derivative financial instruments. All derivative financial instruments are initially 
measured at fair value on acquisition and are subsequently restated to fair value at each reporting date. Any change 
in the fair value of the instruments is recognised in either administration expenses (Foreign exchange contracts) or 
finance expenses (Note 9) in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Equity
Equity comprises the following:
 – “Issued capital” represents the nominal value of equity shares that have been issued.
 – “Share premium” represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity 
shares, net of expenses of the share issue.
 – “Merger reserve” represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity 
shares issued on acquisition of subsidiaries, net of expenses of the share issue. 
 – “Reserve – Shares held in EBT” represents the shares of the parent company acquired by a trust set up for the 
benefit of the Group’s employees. These shares are deducted from shareholders’ funds at the cost that the shares 
were acquired. The net proceeds received from the issue of these shares through the exercise of options are also 
recognised through this reserve. 
 – “Reserve – share based payments” represents equity-settled share-based employee remuneration until such share 
options are exercised.
Notes to the Financial Statements continued allergytherapeutics.com 79

2. Accounting policies continued
 – “Revaluation reserve” represents the revaluations of investment assets and land and buildings.
 – “Foreign exchange reserve” represents the foreign currency translation differences that have occurred since the 
transition date as per IFRS 21. Exchange differences prior to this date are included within retained earnings.
 – “Retained earnings” represents retained profits and losses.
Equity is any contract which evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all its liabilities. 
Income taxes
Current income tax assets and liabilities comprise those obligations to fiscal authorities in the countries in which the 
Group carries out its operations. They are calculated according to the tax rates and tax laws applicable to the fiscal 
period and the country to which they relate that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the 
reporting period. All changes to current tax liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the 
Consolidated Income Statement.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the asset/liability method on temporary differences. Deferred tax is 
generally provided on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. 
However, deferred tax is neither provided on the initial recognition of goodwill nor on the initial recognition of an 
asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting profit. Deferred 
tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these temporary 
differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. 
Tax losses available to be carried forward as well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for 
recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that the underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable 
income. Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at tax rates and laws that are expected to apply 
to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement, 
except where they relate to items that are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income (such as the 
revaluation of land and buildings) or equity, in which case the related deferred tax is also charged or credited 
directly to other comprehensive income or equity, respectively.
Defined contribution pension scheme
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense to the Consolidated Income Statement as 
they fall due in the expense category consistent with the function of the employee to which they relate. 
Defined benefit pension scheme
Plan assets are measured at fair values. Defined benefit obligations are measured on an actuarial basis using the 
projected unit credit method and are discounted at appropriate high quality corporate bond rates that have terms 
to maturity approximating to the terms of the related liability. Interest expense or income is calculated on the net 
defined benefit liability (asset) by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability (asset). Past service 
cost is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period when the plan is amended. 
Remeasurements are recognised in the balance sheet immediately with a charge or credit to other comprehensive 
income in the periods in which they occur. The related deferred tax is shown with other deferred tax balances. A 
surplus is recognised only to the extent that it is recoverable by the Group.
The current service cost, past service cost and costs from settlements and curtailments are charged against 
administrative expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement. Interest on the scheme liabilities and the expected 
return on scheme assets are included in other finance costs.  80

Other employee benefits
Short term
Short-term employee benefits, including holiday entitlement are included in current pension and other employee 
obligations, within trade and other payables, at the undiscounted amount that the Group expects to pay as a result 
of the unused entitlement.
Long term 
Under Italian law, alongside each monthly salary payment an amount is accrued into a reserve for each employee. 
When the employee leaves the company, the accrued amount is paid as a deferred salary payment. 
Investments
Investments relate to long-term insurance policies. In accordance with IAS19, these cannot be directly deducted 
from the German pension obligation and are recognised as a separate asset, rather than as a deduction in 
determining the defined benefit liability. Interest income is recognised through the Consolidated Income Statement. 
They are held at fair value with any gains or losses on remeasurement charged or credited to other comprehensive 
income.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the present obligations arising from legal or constructive obligations resulting from 
past events, will probably lead to an outflow of economic resources from the Group which can be estimated reliably.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the estimated expenditure required to settle the present obligation, 
based on the most reliable evidence available at the balance sheet date.
All provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.
Share based employee compensation
The Group operates equity-settled share based compensation plans for remuneration of its employees comprising 
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) schemes.
All employee services received in exchange for the grant of any share based compensation are measured at their 
fair values. These are indirectly determined by reference to the share option or shares awarded. Their value is 
appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (e.g. profitability or share 
price growth targets). The fair value of LTIP shares, which have market conditions attached, includes an adjustment 
based on the probability of the shares vesting at the end of the vesting period. 
Details of the LTIP schemes and the conditions applying to each scheme are disclosed in Note 28 (Share Based 
Payments) on page 104.
All share based compensation is ultimately recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Income Statement with  
a corresponding credit to the share based payments reserve. If vesting periods or other vesting conditions apply, 
the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best available estimate of the number of shares 
expected to vest. Non market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of shares that  
are expected to become issuable. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that the number of 
shares expected to vest differs from previous estimates. No adjustment to expense recognised in prior periods is 
made if fewer shares ultimately vest than estimated, however the expensed value of these lapsed shares is 
transferred from the share based payment reserve to retained earnings.

Employee Benefit Trust (EBT)
The financial statements include the assets and liabilities of a trust set up for the benefit of the Group’s employees. 
The EBT has acquired shares in the Company and these are deducted from total equity on the balance sheet at the 
cost of acquisition less proceeds on disposal.
The balance in the EBT reserve brought forward in the prior year relates to the historic purchase and disposal of 
Company shares. No transactions have passed through the EBT since 2009. There are no shares currently held by 
the EBT. The remaining balance on the reserve was transferred to retained earnings in the prior year.
Use of accounting estimates and judgements
Many of the amounts included in the financial statements involve the use of judgement and/or estimation. These 
judgements and estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, 
having regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial 
statements. Information about such judgements and estimation is contained in the accounting policies and/or the 
Notes to the Financial Statements and the key areas are summarised below:
Judgements in applying accounting policies
a) Capitalisation of development costs requires analysis of the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the 
project concerned. Capitalisation of the costs will be made only where there is evidence that an economic  
benefit will accrue to the Group. To date no development costs have been capitalised and all costs have been 
expensed in the income statement as research and development costs. Costs expensed in the year amounted to 
£9.3 million (2016: £16.2 million).
b) Where the Group sells to distributors at initially low margin and there is further consideration receivable by  
the Group, this deferred consideration forms part of the fair valuation of consideration receivable by the Group 
for goods supplied. In these instances, the deferred consideration is accrued at a discounted value at the point  
of delivery. 
 The Directors considered the following points in applying this accounting treatment:
 Although a significant portion of the sales price is received upon a further sale to an end customer, substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership are passed to the distributor when the goods are shipped, and the 
distributor is acting as principal (not merely as agent) when arranging to resell the goods. The Directors have 
reached this conclusion because; 
i. The Group does not have any continued managerial involvement in the distributor’s onward sale of goods; 
ii. The distributor does not have the right to return any goods.
 More information on the reasoning behind the treatment of sales to distributors can be found in the ‘Sale of 
goods’ accounting policy description.
c) Land and buildings are carried at valuation and are re-valued with sufficient regularity so that the carrying amount 
and the fair value are not materially different. The Italian freehold property was revalued in June 2016 by 
independent valuers (see Note 16). The Italian freehold property was revalued to fair value at that reporting date 
based on this valuation. The freehold property in Spain was revalued in June 2015 (see Note 16). The Directors 
do not consider an impairment provision to be required in respect of the freehold property in Spain.
d) The Group had been awarded a provisional exemption to the increased statutory rebate charge in Germany for 
the period July to December 2012 by BAFA. Revenue of £1.1 million (equivalent of €1.4 million) was recognised 
in the year ended 30 June 2013 in relation to this exemption and the refund from the German authorities was 
subsequently collected. In February 2015, the provisional exemption was withdrawn by BAFA. The Group has 
lodged an appeal and, following legal advice, believe that the exemption will be re-instated. While the Group is 
confident that the exemption will be confirmed, there is a possibility that this will not happen. If the exemption is 
not confirmed, then the Group will ultimately have to repay €1.4 million (£1.2 million) with a corresponding 
impact on net income and net assets. 82

2. Accounting policies continued
Sources of estimation uncertainty
a) Depreciation rates are based on estimates of the useful lives and residual values of the assets involved. There is 
inherent uncertainty in the useful lives of assets, which means that they are constantly reviewed by management 
(Accounting policies Note (page 76) and Note 16).
b) Estimates of future profitability are required for the decision whether or not to carry forward a deferred tax asset. 
(Note 12). 
c) Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating unit 
to which the goodwill has been allocated. This value in use calculation requires an estimation of the future cash 
flows expected to arise from the cash generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the 
present value.
d) Inventory standard costs are reviewed regularly in order to ensure relevant measures of utilisation, production 
lead time and appropriate levels of manufacturing expense are reflected in the standards. 
e) In relation to the accrued additional revenue due from distributors referred to in the Judgements section (point 
(b) above); there is some uncertainty that the additional revenue will crystallise as it is dependent on a further  
sale by the distributor. The Directors consider that the additional consideration can be measured reliably because 
it is based on a fixed list price and our past experience indicates that the distributor will sell the vaccines.  
The Directors have assessed that the accrued consideration of £0.1 million is recoverable and will crystallise in 
future periods and has been carried forward in prepayments and accrued income (2016: £0.1m).
f) The Group operates equity-settled share based compensation plans for remuneration of its employees 
comprising Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) schemes. As explained in Note 28, employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of any share based compensation are measured at their fair values and expensed over the 
vesting period. The fair value of this compensation is dependent on whether the provisional share awards will 
ultimately vest, which in turn is dependent on future events which are uncertain. The Directors use their judgment 
and experience of previous awards to estimate the probability that the awards will vest, which impacts the fair 
valuation of the compensation.
g) Where the Group is in negotiation with third party contractors around final account payments in relation to 
contracts, there is always an element of uncertainty as to the exact amount that will become payable. The Group 
accounts for its liabilities based on best estimates of the most likely outcome and gives extra disclosure where the 
range of likely outcomes could be materially different from the estimate accounted for.

4. Segmental reporting
The Group’s operating segments are reported based on the financial information provided to the Executive 
Directors, who are defined as the Chief Operating Decision-Maker (CODM), to enable them to allocate resources 
and make strategic decisions. 
The CODM reviews information based on geographical market sectors and assesses performance at an EBITDA 
(operating profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) and operating profit level. Management have 
identified that the reportable segments are Central Europe (which includes the following operating segments; 
Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands), Southern Europe (Italy, Spain and Portugal), the UK and Rest of 
World.

Revenues from external customers in all segments are derived principally from the sale of a range of pharmaceutical 
products designed for the immunological treatment of the allergic condition. 
Rest of World revenues include sales through distributors and agents in several markets including Czech and Slovak 
Republics, Canada and South Korea. These include rendering of services revenues (Note 3). Inter-segment revenues 
represent sales of product from the UK to the operating subsidiaries. The price is set on an arms-length basis which 
is eliminated on consolidation.
The CODM also reviews revenue by segment on a budgeted constant currency basis, to provide relevant year on 
year comparisons.
The following revenue table is based on a budget currency rate of €1.28: £1.00 which was the rate used in the

Deferred tax is provided under the balance sheet liability method using the local tax rate for the overseas difference. 
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so 
and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to tax levied by the same tax authority and where there is an 
intention to settle the balances on a net basis. Deferred tax assets, in respect of losses, are recognised up to the 
value of the fixed asset liability as the nature of the asset & liability is such that they unwind at the same time.
The deferred tax liability in respect of the Italian freehold property relates to the revaluation of this property.

losses. Substantially all the tax losses have no fixed expiry date.
The main UK corporation tax rate is to change from 19% to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020. The recognised and

2016

Germany 2,594 2,523
Spain 796 748
Total 3,390 3,271
Apart from the considerations described in determining the value in use of the CGU described below, the Group’s 
management is not currently aware of any reasonably possible changes that would necessitate changes in its key 
estimates. There are no reasonably possible changes in the assumptions that could lead to an impairment being 
recorded.
Germany
The recoverable amount for the Germany CGU above was determined based on a value-in-use calculation, covering 
a detailed three-year forecast of future cash flows using budgeted projections assuming a 17.4% discount rate 
(2016: 17.4%) which the Group has estimated to be the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risks specific 
to the CGU.
Management’s key assumptions include sales growth (at an average of 4% for the three-year period), which has been 
determined based on past experience in this market. The Group’s management believes that this is the best 
available input for forecasting this mature market.
Spain
The addition to goodwill arose on the acquisition of Alerpharma Group SA in June 2015. 
The recoverable amount for the Spain CGU above was determined based on a value-in-use calculation, covering  
a detailed ten-year forecast of future cash flows using budgeted projections assuming a 17% discount rate  
(2016: 17%) which the Group has estimated to be the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risks specific  
to the CGU.
Management’s key assumptions include sales growth (at an average of 4% for the ten-year period), which has been 
determined based on past experience in this market. The Group’s management believes that this is the best 
available input for forecasting this mature market.

AG on 1 July 2010.
These distribution agreements represent the present value of the future cash flows expected to arise from the 
agreements and are amortised over a period of fifteen years. 
Trade names, customer relationships, know-how and patent (Spain) assets were recognised at fair value upon the 
acquisition of Alerpharma S.A.

Note 22 provides details of the assets secured against the Group’s bank borrowings.
Freehold land and buildings relates to the Group’s office and warehouse building in Milan, Italy and the Group’s 
manufacturing and office facility in Madrid, Spain. The building in Italy was revalued in June 2016 by independent 
valuers based on an open market valuation. This property is carried at fair value and is classified as level 3 (that is 
not market nor observable valuation) in the IFRS fair value hierarchy.

16. Property, plant and equipment continued
The Madrid premises were acquired on the acquisition of Alerpharma in June 2015 with a fair valuation of 
£1,607,000. The valuation was carried out by independent valuers and the fair valuation is classified as level 3 in the 
fair value hierarchy. The valuation was performed using the depreciated cost replacement method (adjusted for 
reduction in value due to age). The age reduction applied related to a percentage discount to allow for the fact that 
the valuation reflected the current age of the building. The unobservable input relates to the percentage applied for 
this reduction in value. If the age reduction discount were to increase by 10% then the valuation of the building 
would reduce by £155,000. The net book value at acquisition was £937,000. 
The reconciliation of the carrying amounts of land and buildings non-financial assets classified within level 3 is as 
follows:
Spain 
£’000
Italy 
£’000
Total 
£’000
Balance at 1 July 2016 1,798 1,144 2,942
Loss recognised in income statement – depreciation of buildings (85) (53) (138)
Gain recognised in other comprehensive income – exchange differences on translating foreign operations 106 69 175
Balance at 30 June 2017 1,819 1,160 2,979
The Italian land and buildings were previously valued using the cost model and had a carrying value of £1.  
Fair values were estimated based on recent market transactions, which were then adjusted for specific conditions 
relating to the land and buildings. A valuation of the Italian land and buildings was carried out in June 2017 by 
independent valuers using the market method. The value of the property was calculated taking into account the  
sale prices achieved by other properties similar to the one in question as regards size, location, type, use quality, 
construction features etc. The valuers used an equivalent value of €1,600 (£1,406) per m
2
. This compares to a range 
of prices from €1,400 per m

 to €2,100 per m

 observed by the valuers. Management do not consider that the fair 
value as at 30 June 2017 for the Italy and Spain land and buildings is significantly different to the carrying value, 
based on the latest valuation, knowledge of the local market and enquiries of local experts.
If the cost basis was used, the carrying amounts of the Italian revalued land and buildings would be £1 (the carrying 
value of the asset at the point the subsidiary was first consolidated). The revalued amounts include a revaluation 
surplus of £1,298,000 before tax (of which £476,000 writes back the accumulated depreciation) which is not 
available for distribution to the shareholders of the Group.
17. Remeasurement of retirement benefit investments
The Group carries an insurance policy which is designed to contribute towards the obligation in respect of the 
German defined benefit pension scheme (see Note 26). The policy includes a right to reimbursement and  
therefore does not meet the definition of a qualifying insurance policy under IAS19.8. It is valued at fair value  
by the pension scheme administrators (SLPM) each year. SLPM value the insurance policies according to  
contractual arrangements (equivalent to cash surrender values). This is classified as level 2 in the fair  
value hierarchy.

The value of inventories measured at fair value less cost to sell was £305,000 (2016: £425,000).
The movement in the value of inventories measured at fair value less cost to sell during the year gave rise to a credit

There is an overdraft facility provided by The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc which has a variable limit during the year up 
to a maximum of £5 million. Interest on the overdraft is at the bank’s base rate plus a fixed margin of 2.50%. The 
facility is secured in favour of The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc by means of debentures granted by the Company and 
its principal subsidiaries and share pledge agreements relating to Bencard Allergie GmbH, Allergy Therapeutics 
Italia SRL and Allergy Therapeutics Iberica SL. The overdraft facility is due for renewal in May 2018. The overdraft 
was unused at 30 June 2017 (2016: Nil).
As part of the acquisition of Alerpharma SA, the Group acquired loans totalling €2,386,000 (£1,684,000). The loans 
are secured by way of a charge on land and buildings owned by Alerpharma Group SA.

During the year, Allergy Therapeutics Iberica SL took out a new loan with The Centre for the Development of 
Industrial Technology (CDTI) for €0.4m to fund research and development specifically for Acarovac MPL. The initial 
drawdown during the year was 25% of the loan amount. Further drawdowns are based on achieving milestones. The 
loan is provided on an interest free basis for a term of 10 years with a 4-year capital repayment delay. No warranty 
with regard to this new loan was provided by Allergy Therapeutics plc.
23. Provisions
The provision refers to a leaving indemnity reserve in Allergy Therapeutics Italia srl. Under Italian law, alongside each 
monthly salary payment an amount is accrued into this reserve for each employee. When the employee leaves the 
company the accrued amount is paid as a deferred salary payment.
The actuarial valuation, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 19 (IAS19) for employee benefits is 
based on assumptions determinate at the valuation date. The methodology used is the “Projected unit credit 
method”. This method sees each year of service give rise to an additional unit of leaving indemnity entitlement and 
values each unit separately to build up to a final total obligation.
The actuarial valuation in accordance with IAS19 was carried out by Managers & Partners actuarial services SpA at 
30 June 2017. The major assumptions used were as follows:-
2017

2016

Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the effects of exchange rate exposure through the use of 
forward exchange contracts.
The fair value of these instruments is calculated by reference to observable market rates (spot rate versus forward 
rates for matching maturity dates) and supported by counterparty confirmation. Within the fair value hierarchy, this 
financial derivative is classified as level 2.
Euro forward contracts (including euro exchange swaps)
The Group has euro forward contracts with its bank that are arranged for the net sale of €22,421,000 to purchase 
GBP at an average blended rate of 1.1567 for dates from July 2017 until May 2018.

the active subsidiaries in Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria and The Netherlands), sterling (which is the functional 
currency of the UK parent entity) and Swiss francs (which is the functional currency of the Swiss subsidiary). Some

Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through operating cashflow, equity fundraising and overdraft facilities. Interest is 
charged at a floating rate on the overdraft facility. The overdraft facility is tailored in a way to give flexibility to the 
Group. This flexibility provides the Group with a higher level of the facility in the low sales season and allows it to 
pay down the facility in the high sales season. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the net result for the 
year and equity to possible changes in interest rates of + 1% with effect from the beginning of the year on the 
remaining element of borrowings. Due to the current low interest rates it is not feasible to illustrate the results were 
the interest rates to fall by 1%. 
The sensitivities are considered to be reasonable given the current market conditions and the calculations are based 
on the financial instruments held at each balance sheet date, all other variables being held constant.

Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that the counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss 
to the Group. In order to minimise this risk, the Group endeavours only to deal with companies which are 
demonstrably creditworthy and this, together with the aggregate financial exposure, is regularly monitored. The 
maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of the debtor.
Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is considered to be small as the counterparties are all substantial banks with 
high credit ratings. The maximum exposure is the amount of the deposit. Credit risk on assets derived from Financial 
derivatives are also considered to be small as the counterparties are all substantial banks with high credit ratings. 
The maximum exposure is the asset recognised. 
The credit quality of financial assets that are not past due or impaired are regularly reviewed by Management.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s capital management objectives are to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, and to 
provide adequate funding for its day to day operations. Management has access to funding through a bank facility 
and continues to have the option to raise funds from the issue of equity shares to ensure the Group remains able to 
meet its commitments as they fall due. The Group’s bank facility (Note 22) is due for renewal in May 2018. As at

26. Retirement benefit obligations
Defined contribution scheme
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for certain employees in the UK. The assets of the 
scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund. The amount charged 
against the profits represents the contributions payable under the scheme in respect of the accounting period 
totalling £451,000 (2016: £341,000). 
Defined benefit scheme
The Group operates a partly funded non-contributory defined benefit pension scheme for certain employees in

Fair value of plan assets 1,346 1,248
Present value of scheme liabilities (10,965) (11,422)
Deficit in the scheme (9,619) (10,174)
The plan assets consist of long-term insurance policies held to cover the German pension obligation. The value of 
the plan assets is deducted from the value of the pension liability to give a net liability of £9.6m (2016: £10.2m). The 
basis used to determine the net interest cost is based on the net defined benefit asset or liability and the discount 
rate as determined by Swiss Life Pensions Management GmbH using the projected unit credit method. The actual 
gain on plan assets for the year is £50,000 (2016: £38,000). The pension charge generates an unrecognised deferred 
tax asset of £1,658,000 (2016: £2,021,000), however this is unrecognised in the Group accounts as there is 
uncertainty over the recoverability. The insurance contracts that form the plan assets are valued at fair value (market 
price) by the pension scheme administrators (SLPM) each year. SLPM value the insurance policies according to 
contractual arrangements (equivalent to cash surrender values). This is classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Long term insurance policies that do not qualify as plan assets are recognised as separate investment assets at fair 
value and represent a re-imbursement right as defined by IAS 19. See Note 17 for further details of these investment 
assets.

The significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit IAS 19.173(b) obligation are the 
discount rate, the salary growth rate and the average life expectancy. The calculation of the net defined benefit 
liability is sensitive to these assumptions. The following table summarises the effects of changes in these actuarial

development.
28. Share based payments
The Group has a Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) under which Executive Directors and senior employees may 
receive an annual provisional award of performance vesting shares.
The Group has two plans: the initial 2005 Plan and the 2013 Plan. The 2013 LTIP plan was adopted by the Board on 
20 March 2013, the Board having consulted major shareholders. Awards were made under the new 2013 plan 
during the year.
For the 2013 Plan, performance criteria for each award are set by the remuneration committee. An award shall vest 
at 100% if at the end of the plan cycle the share price has increased by 25% has been satisfied. If the share price 
increase is less than 10% then no shares will vest. If the share price increase is between 10% and 25%, share 
distributions will be on a straight line basis between 25% and 100% of the initial award. Each plan cycle will 
comprise a period of three years. An award will be forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the shares 
vest.
For awards under the 2013 Plan during the years ended 30 June 2014 and 2015, the performance criteria are based 
on a combination of share price performance and adjusted earnings growth.
Notes to the Financial Statements continued allergytherapeutics.com 105

28. Share based payments continued
Share options were granted to employees and Directors under earlier schemes. The vesting periods are usually from 
one to three years. The vesting of some options is dependent on the Group’s TSR performance as for the LTIP Plans 
detailed above. The options are settled in equity once exercised. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 
10 years from the date of the grant, the options expire. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group 
before the options vest. 
During the current year, LTIP grants were provisionally awarded in December 2016 under the 2013 plan subject to 
performance criteria being met.
The following table sets out share options outstanding which are unrelated to the LTIP awards and have been 
disclosed separately to avoid distorting the weighted average exercise price (WAEP):

The fair value of the Long Term Incentive Plan shares conditionally awarded in October 2014 has been arrived at 
using the share price at the date of grant and applying a vesting probability for the performance conditions.

Exercise price

The fair values of Long Term Incentive Plan shares conditionally awarded in December 2016 were determined using 
a Monte Carlo simulation (with 5,000 iterations) that takes into account factors specific to the share incentive plans.
A discount has been applied for lack of marketability to the portion of the awards that would have to be retained for 
three years after vesting.

The Group recognised total expenses of £703,000 (2016: £327,000) related to equity-settled share based payment 
transactions during the year. 
29. Contingent liabilities
Allergy Therapeutics (UK) Ltd, a subsidiary of Allergy Therapeutics plc, has given a guarantee in lieu of deposits for 
leases on cars and rented office space of Bencard Allergie GmbH. The amount as at 30 June 2017 was €107,426; 
£94,391 (2016: €107,426; £89,099).
A cross-guarantee exists between Allergy Therapeutics (Holdings) Ltd, Allergy Therapeutics (UK) Ltd, Bencard 
Allergie GmbH, Allergy Therapeutics Italia srl. and Allergy Therapeutics Iberica SL. in which the liabilities of each 
entity to the Royal Bank of Scotland Plc are guaranteed by all the others. 
On 23 February 2015, the Company received notification that The Federal Office for Economics and Export 
(“BAFA”) had made a decision to reverse their preliminary exemption to the increased manufacturers rebate in 
Germany for the period July to December 2012. The Company was granted a preliminary exemption to the 
increased rebate for this period by BAFA in 2013. The Company recognised revenue of €1.4m (£1.1m at that time, 
now £1.2m) against this exemption in the year ended 30 June 2013. All other preliminary exemptions (granted for 
periods up to 30 June 2012) have previously been ratified as final by BAFA. After taking legal advice, the Company 
has lodged an appeal against this decision and is confident that the exemption will be re-instated. Therefore, as at 
30 June 2017, no provision has been recognised for the repayment of the rebate refund. This position will be kept 
under review.

29. Contingent liabilities continued
The European Commission has concluded its investigation into whether the exemption of pharmaceutical 
manufacturers from the increase in rebates in Germany constitutes state aid. The European Commission has 
determined that the exemptions do not constitute state aid. Subsequent to this announcement, the Group has been 
advised that an appeal has been lodged at the EU Court against this decision. If successful, and the exemptions are 
determined to be illegal state aid, then the exemption refunds may have to be repaid. The maximum sum to be 
repaid would be approximately £5m (including the £1.2m referred to above); however, the Group considers this to 
be an unlikely outcome and consequently has not recognised any provision as a result.
30. Capital commitments
The Group’s capital commitments at the end of the financial period, for which no provision has been made, are as 
follows: 
30 June 2017 
£’000
30 June 2016 
£’000

Notes to Company Balance Sheet
1. Accounting policies 
Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting 
Standard 101, ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101) and the Companies Act 2006. FRS 101 sets out a reduced 
disclosure framework for a ‘qualifying entity’ as defined in the standard which addresses the financial reporting 
requirements and disclosure exemptions in the individual financial statements of qualifying entities that otherwise 
apply the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of EU-adopted IFRS.
As permitted by the Companies Act, the separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and under the historical cost convention. 
The prior year was the first financial statements of the Company prepared in accordance with FRS 101. The 
Company’s date of transition to FRS 101 is 30 June 2014. 
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that 
standard in relation to business combinations, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of 
comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet 
effective, impairment of assets and related party transactions. Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in 
the consolidated financial statements of Allergy Therapeutics plc.
In accordance with section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no separate income statement has been presented for 
the Company. The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of this financial information are set out 
below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the financial years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Going Concern
After making appropriate enquiries, which included a review of the annual budget, considering the cash flow 
requirements for the foreseeable future, noting the renewed overdraft facility, and the effects of sales and foreign 
exchange sensitivities on the Group and Company’s funding plans, the Directors continue to believe that the Group 
and Company will have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and 
accordingly have applied the going concern principle in drawing up the financial statements. In reaching this view, 
the Directors have considered and prioritised the actions that could be taken to offset the impact of any shortfall in 
operating performance.
Investments
Investments in shares in subsidiary undertakings are included at cost less any provision for impairment.
 
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using an average exchange rate for the period. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit or loss account.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance 
sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a 
right to pay less, tax.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is more likely than not that 
there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be 
deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates and laws that are expected to apply in the 
periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date. 112
Financial Statements
1. Accounting policies continued
Employee Benefit Trust (EBT)
In the prior year the financial statements included the assets and liabilities of a trust set up for the benefit of the 
Group’s employees. 
The balance in the EBT reserve related to the historic purchase and disposal of Company shares. No transactions 
had passed through the EBT since 2009. No shares were held by the EBT. The remaining balance on the EBT 
reserve was transferred to retained earnings in the prior year.
Share based payments
Share based payments made in respect of the Company’s shares to employees of its subsidiaries are reported as an 
increase in investment. 
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair 
values. Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are 
determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the instrument granted to the employee. This fair value is 
appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and 
sales growth targets). 
If vesting periods or non-market based vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, 
based on the best available estimate of share options expected to vest. Estimates are revised subsequently if there 
is any indication that the number of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative 
adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in the current period. 
If market based vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the relevant period, usually the period over 
which performance is measured. Vesting assumptions and resulting expenses are fixed at the date of grant, 
regardless of whether market conditions are actually met. Any adjustment for options which lapse prior to vesting is 
recognised in the current period. No adjustment to expense recognised in prior periods is made if fewer share 
options ultimately are vested than estimated, however the expensed value of these lapsed shares is transferred from 
the share based payment reserve to the profit and loss reserve.
Full details of the Group’s share based payments are set out in Note 28 of the consolidated financial statements.
2. Loss for the financial period
The Company has taken advantage of s.408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not included its own income 
statement in these financial statements. The Company’s loss for the period was £0.8 million (2016: £11.5 million
