III II I. Strategic Report
The Group’s business 
commenced trading in 
Sunderland as a family-
owned general home 
furnishings store.
By the 1980s, the business operated  
from eight stores in the North East of 
England under the ScS name, specialising 
in selling upholstered furniture. Following  
a management buyout in 1993, the 
business began to expand outside of the 
North East of England, and focused on 
establishing ScS as a major UK upholstered 
furniture retailer operating from large, 
modern stores.
The store expansion programme saw  
the store estate grow, and, by 2007,  
had increased to 95 stores supported  
by nine distribution centres. A number  
of operational initiatives were also 
undertaken, including upgrades to 
business processes, management 
information and information technology 
systems. David Knight was appointed  
Chief Executive Officer in 2002 and  
Chris Muir was appointed as Chief  
Financial Officer in April 2016.

The upholstered furniture market is worth 
an estimated £3.2bn sales per annum,  
in which ScS is one of the leading retailers 
with a share of 9.9% (2016: 9.8%). ScS is 
also becoming a major participant in the 
£2.0bn sales per annum floorcoverings 
market, which it only entered in 2012 and 
where it now has a 2.5% (2016: 2.4%) share. 
The overall market contracted significantly 
as a result of the global financial crisis and 
the prolonged recession that followed.  
The value of the upholstered furniture 
market fell from almost £4.0bn in 2007  
to an estimated £3.2bn in 2017. 
The signs are that the furniture and 
floorcoverings markets in 2018 will  
return to growth after a very challenging 
few years.
Looking ahead
GlobalData forecasts state that ScS core 
markets are now set to resume growth 
– with circa 10% growth anticipated 
between 2017 and 2022 in upholstered 
furniture and circa 6.8% in floorcoverings. 
Our business mix has continued to evolve  
in line with our strategy to broaden our 
appeal by offering a wider range of brands 
– including third party brands – as well  
as flooring and accessories. Flooring now 
represents 11.4% of total gross sales.

pursuit of our strategy for growth.
Our focus is to provide choice, value and 
quality for our customers and we appeal 
strongly to a broad demographic with our  
ScS stores appealing to aspiring homemakers, 
families and retired couples whereas our 
House of Fraser concessions attract a more 
affluent demographic.

key strengths
Why Invest in SCS
 # 1 
One of the largest retailers  
of sofas and flooring
A combination that gives scope to develop our current customer 
base, provide further ‘sell-on’ opportunities to our current 
customers and reach new customers through the development  
of our House of Fraser concessions.
#2 
Trained staff with a focus  
on customer service
 ScS places emphasis on the provision of high levels of service 
throughout the customer experience from the point of sale 
through to delivery and providing appropriate after sales 
service if required. Our sales staff are trained to operate  
to high standards, supported by in-house training, mystery 
shop exercises and Trustpilot feedback.
#3 
Store 
portfolio
 ScS currently operates from 100 stores in the UK, 98 of which  
are in out-of-town retail park locations. Investment in the store 
portfolio continues to ensure each store remains well presented, 
attractive and modern with a fashionable look and feel. A further 
20 potential locations have been identified.
#4 
Experienced  
management team
 Led by David Knight, ScS’s Chief Executive Officer,  
the senior management team has many years of combined 
experience both in their respective areas of expertise  
with ScS, and the markets in which we operate. 09

Diverse and focused  
product range
 ScS seeks to offer a diverse product and brands offering  
at a range of price points in order to appeal to a wide national 
customer base. This seeks to provide scope for growth as well  
as greater resilience in the event of an economic downturn.
The House of Fraser concessions also enable us to appeal  
to a different demographic.
#6  
Growing online  
capability
 Having grown online sales from £0.5m in 2009 to £11.3m in the 
year ended 29 July 2017 , the website currently generates more 
sales than ScS’s leading store. A new website was launched in 
July 2014, and we have continued to invest in online sales with  
a further £1.8m in 2017 . This platform is expected to underpin 
further online sales growth as well as act as a marketing and 
research tool to drive customer in-store visits.
#7 
 Negative working capital 
business model
 The Group operates a negative working capital business  
model, coupled with low ongoing capital expenditure 
requirements. The majority of product suppliers are paid  
at the end of the month following the month in which the 
furniture was delivered to the Group’s distribution centres.

Dividend
Consistent dividend growth, with full year dividend of 14.70p

Following the strong performance in the 
year ended 30 July 2016, I am very pleased 
to report further growth across the 
business for the year ended 29 July 2017, 
despite challenging economic conditions.
Financial and strategic objectives
The Group continues to pursue the 
following objectives:
• Deliver profitable and sustainable 
growth;
• Improve the quality of earnings; 
• Improve business resilience through  
the economic cycle; and
• Increase shareholder returns.
The business has continued to deliver 
against these objectives, growing revenue 
and gross profit, diligently controlling 
costs and maximising cash flow. I am 
particularly pleased with this result given 
the toughening trading environment  
since the turn of the year, and believe it 
demonstrates the increasingly resilient 
business we are building and the 
commitment of our Board and staff  
to achieving the objectives we set.
A clear strategy for 
growth, underpinned  
by strong cash flows and 
increasing resilience
Chairman’s Statement
Reaching the milestone of 100 ScS stores 
was a further highlight of this financial 
year, with our new stores in Aberdeen, 
Thanet, Edinburgh (Straiton) and Plymouth 
contributing towards the increase in 
revenue, gross profit and EBITDA. These 
stores will help the Group continue to 
target sustainable growth and improve  
the overall resilience of the business.
Result and dividend
I am pleased to report that the Group 
delivered a result slightly ahead of market 
expectations. The first half of the financial 
year saw the Group trade strongly and 
continue the momentum from the previous 
financial year. However, as we noted in  
our trading outlook in March, the second 
half of the year brought with it more 
challenging conditions across the market, 
with decreased footfall and reduced 
consumer confidence. Against this 
backdrop, and very strong prior year 
comparatives, I am proud of our two-year 
like-for-like order intake growth of 14.3%. 
We have also continued to identify and 
implement various business efficiencies, 
which have helped to increase our EBITDA 
margin and resulted in a 7.8% increase  
in earnings per share (EPS) from 21.8p  
to 23.5p.
The Group continues to hold no debt, had 
cash reserves of £40.1m at 29 July 2017 
and generated free cash flows in the year  
of £23.6m, benefiting from a £12.5m 
working capital movement. Underlying 
cash flows, together with continued 
expansion in our store network, show the 
Group’s ability to continue to grow and 
strengthen its balance sheet. The Group 
continues to maintain a £12.0m committed 
revolving credit facility. This provides 
further resilience, whilst also allowing  
the Group to maximise opportunities  
as they arise. 
Despite the continued uncertain economic 
environment, the improved operating 
results year-on-year, the strength of the 
Group’s balance sheet and the Board’s 
confidence in the outlook for the Group 
has resulted in the Board proposing  
a full-year dividend of 14.70p, a 1.4% 
increase on the full-year dividend for 2016. 
If approved, this would result in a final 
dividend of 9.80p. ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 11

Final thoughts
Finally, I would like to record the Board’s 
thanks to all of our 1,952 team members 
throughout the business. Particularly 
against more challenging trading 
conditions, it is their commitment, 
expertise and enthusiasm that allows the 
Group to continue to grow and improve 
each year, and deliver our mission to 
provide our customers with excellent 
service, value and quality.
The Group has a clear strategy for growth, 
underpinned by strong cash flows and the 
increasing resilience of the Group’s balance 
sheet. The Group is positioned to take 
advantage of future opportunities and 
whilst there remains a level of uncertainty 
in the wider economy, the Board remains 
positive about the long-term prospects  
for the business. 
Alan Smith
Chairman
2 October 2017 ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 12
Overview
The core ScS business has continued  
to focus on providing excellent choice, 
value and quality for our customers, and  
I am pleased to see this delivering record 
results in furniture and flooring sales. 
Furthermore, our targeted investment  
in key growth areas continue to prove 
successful, with an 8.3% increase in sales 
from our House of Fraser concessions and 
12.3% growth in our online business.
Results
The Group saw a £15.7m (4.9%) increase  
in revenue in the year to £333.0m  
(2016: £317.3m). Gross profit increased  
to £153.7m (2016: £149.1m), EBITDA 
increased 8.4% to £17.4m (2016: £16.0m) 
and profit before tax rose 9.9% to £12.0m  
(2016: £10.9m). 
Strategy for growth
The Group continues to focus on four  
key areas in its strategy for growth:
Area 1 – Increase sales densities
Sales density per square foot at our ScS 
stores for the last 12 months was £226. 
This represents an increase of £7 per 
square foot or 3.2% on the £219 achieved  
in the 12 months ended 30 July 2016.  
This increase was achieved by continued 
focus on the following:
• The ongoing targeting and 
maximisation of a branded range  
of products and the continued 
development of our flooring offering;
• Maximising our average order value, 
with furniture order values rising 1.1%  
in the year to £1,575, and flooring order 
values rising 3.5% in the year to £629;
• Continued investment in our online 
capability, resulting in both the benefit 
of direct sales through the website and 
the indirect benefit of improving the 
quality of footfall, with customers  
often entering our stores having already 
researched their choices. This has 
ensured that, despite decreases in 
footfall noted industry-wide, customers 
are more engaged and more likely  
to place an order; and
• Improving the customer journey, 
experience and confidence, evidenced 
by an improved Trustpilot satisfaction 
score. The Group has over 73,000 
reviews and is proud to have improved 
its overall score and maintained its 
maximum 5-star ‘Excellent’ rating.
Marketing spend increased to £24.7m  
in the year (2016: £23.1m) as the Group 
continued to operate in an increasingly 
competitive and challenging marketplace, 
and to drive sales conversion, namely the 
proportion of customers who purchased  
a product after entering a store, which 
further increased this year.
Area 2 – Maximise the opportunity  
with House of Fraser customers
The Group operates 27 House of Fraser 
concessions, targeting those customers 
who prefer to shop in department stores 
and town centres, and enabling the Group 
to access a wider demographic. Despite 
being integrated into the Group for over 
three years, gross sales continued to rise 
strongly in the year, increasing by 8.3%  
to £27.4m (2016: £25.3m).
Contribution to the Group’s EBITDA is  
a continued focus as these concessions 
become established, and following their 
first positive contribution in the prior year, 
the House of Fraser concession EBITDA 
continued to strengthen in 2017. As with 
the ScS store network, individual 
concession performance is regularly 
reviewed to ensure all locations make  
an appropriate level of return.
Both ScS and House of Fraser management 
teams continue to recognise the ongoing 
potential that the partnership offers and 
continually work together on how to 
improve sales and margins.
Area 3 – Optimise online presence
Whilst relatively large ticket home 
furnishings continue to be predominantly  
a store-based sale, we know that a high 
proportion of our customers continue to 
research our products online before they 
visit the store to make their final purchase 
decision. Continued website investment 
has therefore been a key part of the 
Group’s strategy for growth. In addition,  
as the Group continues to improve its online 
presence and provide a higher quality 
responsive web platform, an increasing 
number of customers are choosing to  
make their purchase directly online. This has 
been supported by continued investment  
in website development and maintenance  
of £1.8m (2016: £1.4m) and increased digital 
marketing spend, which has successfully 
driven improvements in our website visitor 
count and conversion.
Online gross sales increased 12.3% to 
£11.3m (2016: £10.0m).
Area 4 – Achieve strong financial returns 
from new store openings
During the first half of the financial year, the 
Group opened four new stores in Aberdeen 
(September 2016) and Thanet, Edinburgh 
(Straiton) and Plymouth (all on Boxing Day 
2016). All four stores have performed in line 
with the targets set within their initial 
investment analysis and have contributed 
positively to EBITDA in the year. 
We are delighted to be  
reporting continued sales 
growth across all areas of the 
Group for the third year in a row

retailers. A new store in Chelmsford is 
targeted to open on Boxing Day 2017.
We continue to hold a list of sites identified 
for potential new stores, and opportunities 
are consistently pursued and monitored, 
with plans for further expansion in the 
coming financial year.
Additionally, we continue to closely 
monitor the performance of our network 
and actively manage the portfolio.
Current trading and outlook
Since the start of the current financial  
year, trading performance has been in line 
with our expectations. Furthermore, we 
believe the Group’s increasing resilience 
will enable us to manage the continued 
economic uncertainty and take advantage 
of opportunities.
The continued successful self-financed 
expansion of the ScS network, ongoing 
growth in the concession agreement with 
House of Fraser and double-digit online 
growth, together with the Group’s strong

ability of the Group to maintain a strong 
financial position and continue to deliver

Sales per square foot in existing stores have grown by 3.2% during 
2017 to £226. This represents an increase of £7 per square foot  
on the £219 achieved in 2016. 
The key has been attracting more customers through a combination  
of broadening our offers, to include a wider range of both third party 
and ScS own label brands, the continued development of our flooring 
offer and increasing our marketing spend to £24.7m (2016: £23.1m).

Maximising the 
opportunity 
with House of Fraser.
Following a successful pilot the full roll out was completed in July  
2014. The Group currently operates from 27 House of Fraser stores, 
under the Made to Order, Sofas, Furniture and Flooring brand. The 
arrangement has delivered gross sales of £27 .4m, a 8.3% increase  
on 2016. Potential exists to further develop this opportunity; 
GlobalData estimates the market opportunity for upholstery  
and flooring sales, in department stores, to be £287 .0m.
Appropriate returns are a continued focus of those concessions as 
they become established. Both ScS and House of Fraser recognise  
the ongoing potential of the partnership.

month on average. Our Trustscore is 
also visible through search engines and  
is seen on average 58,000 times per 
month. In 2016 we set ourselves and 
achieved the ambitious target of 5-star

maintained this throughout 2017  
and indeed improved on our overall 
customer satisfaction score from  
8.9 in 2016 to 9.2 in 2017. 
Using Trustpilot’s actionable insight 
tools we identified that our customers 
really appreciated their in-store 
experience and also valued the level  
of service we provided when delivering 
their orders to their homes. Our 
customers commented that they  
felt we offered a friendly and helpful 
experience, and great service. It was 
identified that attention was needed  
on delivery lead times, and making it 
easier for customers to get updates  
on their order which we are focusing on. 
In net promoter terms 82% of our 
customers are promoters of the Group

much appreciate the insights gained, 
and in our most recent engagement

our maximum 5-stars ‘Excellent’ rating.
Listening to our customers is so important to us. We

Sales density per square foot at our  
ScS stores for the last twelve months 
was £226. This represents an increase 
of £7 per square foot or 3.2% on the 
£219 achieved in the 12 months ended 
30 July 2016. 
The group has continued to invest 
heavily in marketing, spending £24.7m 
in 2016 (2016: £23.1m), attracting new 
and returning customers to our website 
and stores, and improving our sales 
conversion, this being the proportion  
of customers who purchased a product 
after entering a store, which further 
increased this year. 
We have continued to focus on the 
maximisation of our branded range  
of products, developing both our  
third party and in-house brands in  
both furniture and flooring. We have 
improved our average order value  
in both furniture and flooring; with 
furniture order values rising 1.1% in  
the year to £1,575, and flooring order 
values rising 3.5% in the year to £629.
Having launched our transactional 
website in 2009, we have seen a steady 
growth in sales and profits. Continued 
investment into our online capability 
has resulted in the benefit of increased 
direct sales through our website and  
the indirect benefit of improving the 
quality of the footfall. Increasingly,  
we are finding that our customers enter 
our stores having already researched 
their choices. 
Despite an industry-wide noted 
decrease in footfall, our customers  
are more engaged and are more likely  
to place an order with us. We believe  
our customers are experiencing an 
improved journey, evidenced by an 
increasing Trustpilot satisfaction score. 
The group has showed continued improvement  
in sales densities per square foot, increasing from

III II I. Strategic Report
Gross sales and revenue
Gross sales increased by £14.8m (4.4%)  
to £349.5m (2016: £334.7m) and is 
attributable to:
• An increase in furniture sales in ScS 
stores of 3.7% to £270.9m;
• An increase in flooring sales in ScS 
stores of 5.0% to £39.9m;
• An increase in online sales of 12.3%  
to £11.3m; and
• An increase in sales from the House  
of Fraser concession of 8.3% to £27 .4m.
Gross sales in the year benefited from 
three main factors:
• The increased order intake seen at  
the end of the previous financial year 
(which was delivered in this period);
• The increased sales order intake seen  
in the first half of the current year; and
• Four new stores, with gross sales of £7 .4m.
Revenue, which represents gross sales  
less charges relating to interest-free  
credit sales (see note 3 – Segment 
information), increased by 4.9% to 
£333.0m (2016: £317.3m).
Gross profit
Gross margin (as a percentage of gross sales) 
in the year was 44.0% (2016: 44.6%). The 
margin decreased by 0.6% when compared 
to the previous year, largely due to a focus  
in the year to reduce stocks of older product, 
which improved store appearance and 
created a working capital inflow. Quality  
of earnings remains a key area of focus. 
The increased revenue resulted in an 
increase in gross profit of £4.6m, or 3.1%.
Operating profit 
Operating profit for the year increased  
by 8.8% to £12.0m (2016: £11.0m).
Distribution costs
Distribution costs comprise the total  
cost of the in-house distribution function 
and includes employment costs, the cost  
of leasing vehicles and related running 
costs and property costs (principally rent, 
rates and utilities) for the ten distribution 
centres, as well as costs of third party 
delivery services contracted to support 
peak delivery periods. Distribution costs 
expressed as a percentage of revenue  
for the year were 5.0%, 0.1% higher than  
the prior year. 
As part of the ongoing review of 
distribution efficiencies, the Group  
has taken the decision post year-end  
to close two warehouses in Thanet and  
West Thurrock and move to a single new 
warehouse in Basildon. The Group will  
see the cost benefit of this in the year  
to 28 July 2018. 
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses comprise:
• Store operating costs, principally 
employment costs and property related 
costs (rent and rates, utilities, store 
repairs and depreciation of capital 
investment) and costs associated  
with the concession agreement with 
House of Fraser;
• Marketing expenditure; and
• General administrative expenditure 
which includes the employment costs 
for the directors, senior management 
and all head office-based functions 
(customer call centre, finance, human 
resources, IT, merchandising, online 
sales support, flooring administration, 
administrative support for House of 
Fraser concession), company pension 
contributions, legal and professional 
costs, insurance, company car costs, IT 
systems support and telecommunications.
Administration costs for the year  
totalled £125.2m, compared to £122.6m  
in the prior year. Administrative costs  
as a percentage of revenue were 37.6%, 
compared to 38.6% in the prior year.
The year saw an increase in administrative 
costs of £2.6m, with the majority of the 
increase being driven by the following:
• £1.6m increase to £24.7m (including 
£0.2m in relation to launch of new 
stores) in marketing investment;
• £1.6m reduction in payroll costs 
resulting from:
• £4.5m decrease in performance 
related bonuses;
• £2.0m increase driven by an 
inflationary wage increase, 
resourcing to support growth, 
succession planning; and
• £0.9m from new stores;
• £1.3m rent and rates increase due  
to the new store openings;
• £0.4m increase in website development 
and maintenance costs; and
• £0.4m increase in depreciation  
and amortisation.

Taxation
The tax charge for the financial year  
is higher than if the standard rate of 
corporation tax had been applied, mainly 
due to charges not deductible for tax 
purposes, principally depreciation on 
capital expenditure that does not qualify  
for capital allowances.
Earnings per share (EPS)
EPS for the year ended 29 July 2017 was 
23.5p compared to earnings per share  
of 21.8p in the previous year. 
Cash and cash equivalents
A strong cash flow has been generated 
from operations reflecting the negative 
working capital business model whereby:
• For cash/card sales, customers pay 
deposits at the point of order and settle 
outstanding balances before delivery; 
• For consumer credit sales, the loan 
provider pays ScS approximately seven 
days after delivery; and 
• The majority of product suppliers are 
paid at the end of the month following 
the month of delivery into the 
distribution centres.

is shown below:

Free cash flow 23.6 7.6
Dividends (5.9) (6.3)
Net cash generated 17.7 1.3
Cash generated from operating activities 
in the year benefited by £10.6m from the 
timing of the July supplier payment run  
due to the slightly earlier year-end date.
Net capital expenditure in the year includes 
£3.1m on four new stores (2016: £0.7m on 
one new store).
Dividend
An interim dividend of 4.90p per ordinary 
share was paid in May 2017. The Group  
has continued to strengthen and deliver 
very positive results, with very strong  
cash generation and a balance sheet  
that is growing in resilience. Despite  
the continued uncertain economic 
environment, the Board is confident in  
the outlook for the Group and therefore 
proposes a full-year dividend of 14.70p,  
a 1.4% increase on the full-year dividend 
for 2016. If approved, this would result  
in a final dividend of 9.80p.

uncertainties that could affect the 
achievement of our strategy. These risks 
are accepted as part of doing business. 
The Board recognises that the nature and 
scope of these risks can change; regular 
reviews are undertaken of the risks and the 
systems and processes to mitigate them. 
The Board has overall responsibility for the leadership of risk 
management, sets strategic objectives and the risk appetite  
and monitors performance.
The Audit Committee has delegated responsibility from the  
Board to oversee risk management and internal controls. The 
Committee reviews the Group’s internal controls and sets the 
objectives and monitors the effectiveness of the Internal Audit 
team. The Committee also monitors the independence and 
expertise of the external auditors.
The Executive Directors are responsible for disseminating risk 
policies. They support and help the Operating Company Board to 
assess risk. The Executive Directors also oversee risk management 
throughout the Group and encourage open communication on  
risk matters. The Executive Directors assess the materiality of  
risks in the context of the whole Group.
Internal Audit is responsible for the monitoring of the Group’s  
risk management approach and provides a link between the 
Operational Managers and the Audit Committee. The Head of 
Internal Audit reports formally to the Audit Committee and has 
direct access to the Chair of the Audit Committee. The Internal 
Audit team takes a risk-based approach to planning audit work.
Operating Company Board are responsible for risk management 
roles at operational level. They are responsible for the continuous 
identification of risk assurance and self-assessment of  
mitigating controls.
Managing Risk
Risk management process  
& framework
The Board and Executive Management are 
collectively responsible for managing risk 
across the Group. On a departmental basis, 
risks are reviewed and reported through 
risk registers. 
The Audit Committee is presented with  
risk reports at every committee meeting. 
The Group takes the following ongoing 
approach to risk management. Risk

The Board has ultimate responsibility for 
risk management throughout the Group 
and determines the nature and extent  
of the risks the Group is willing to take  
to achieve its strategic objectives. The 
Group has a formal governance framework 
in place underpinning our approach to  
risk management.
The Board has carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks and 
uncertainties of the Group, including  
those that threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency and risk. ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 27
III II I. Strategic Report
Identification of risks
The Board and the Group’s management have a clearly 
defined responsibility for identifying the major business 
risks facing the Group and for developing systems to 
mitigate and manage those risks. The control of key  
risks is reviewed by the Board twice yearly and by the 
Group’s management at their monthly meetings. The 
Board can therefore confirm that there is an ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
significant risks faced by the Group, which has been  
in place for the year under review and up to the date  
of approval of this Annual Report. The Board has 
performed a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group.
Risk appetite
Risk is always high on the Board’s agenda and the  
focus on effective risk management cascades all  
the way through the organisation. The culture of the 
organisation ensures that all activities, from day-to-day 
operations to high-level strategic decisions, are 
performed in line with this approach. Management’s 
assessment of our principal risks is based on impact, 
likelihood, and any change from the prior year. The 
governance of risk is undertaken in the context of the 
Group’s overall risk appetite. The Group considers risk 
appetite to ensure adequate resources are allocated  
to the risks. The Board reviewed and approved a formal 
risk appetite statement as follows: 
Category of Risk Risk Parameters
Strategic Medium to  
high tolerance
During development of new propositions, and assessing new opportunities,  
we are prepared to accept medium to high risks that support our pursuit of growth. 
Operational Low to medium 
tolerance
When operating within our business, including the management of our suppliers, 
controlling stock and assets, and managing our people, we have a low to medium 
tolerance for risk. We will take a cautious approach to risk within our operations  
but consider that certain risks will be taken in order to achieve our strategic  
objectives and maintain our competitive position.
Financial Low tolerance We consider that robust financial controls are necessary to manage our business 
effectively. All our operating processes are based around policies and procedures  
that minimise the risk of a loss of financial control.
Compliance Extremely  
low tolerance
We have an extremely low tolerance when complying with laws and regulations that 
relate to bribery and corruption, product safety, employee safety, customer safety  
and consumer credit. We have controls in place that are designed to mitigate these 
types of risks. We have detailed and tested procedures in place for dealing with these 
types of scenarios when they arise.

Economic 
environment
   
A reduction in consumer confidence  
or activity levels in the housing market, 
resulting in a fall in consumer spending 
on discretionary high value items,  
such as furniture, could be damaging  
to the performance of and prospects 
for the Group.
• We offer a range of products and price points in our 
categories to ensure that customers can trade up or down.
• We maintain a lean business model allowing us to remain 
competitive in our markets and adapt to change quickly.
• A key strand of our strategy has been to broaden and 
thereby diversify our product offering into categories  
such as flooring and third party brands.
The Group faces economic uncertainty 
following the decision for the UK to 
leave the EU along with other factors 
such as income levels and the 
availability of credit. 
• We will continue to offer a quality product at a 
competitive price that remains attractive to our 
consumer base. Our entrance into the flooring market, 
concessions and brands, along with an improved dining 
and occasional range, has diversified our offering into  
a wider demographic consumer base. 
• We offer a range of interest-free options to our 
customers to allow more affordable payments. 
Further exchange rate fluctuations 
could lead to cost pressure.
• We work closely with our suppliers and will attempt  
to minimise any impact on our cost base and our retail 
pricing strategy. 
Competition
   
The Group operates in competitive  
and fragmented markets and against  
a wide variety of retailers and may  
face increased competition in its  
target markets. Failure to be aware  
of or respond to key changes in the 
competitive environment is a risk  
to our future success.
• We continue diversifying and developing our proposition  
for customers as part of our Group strategy. We continually 
respond to changing patterns in demand in our core market 
that broadens our appeal and sales base.
• We actively monitor sales performance, product and 
advertising performance and competitor activity. 
• We have carried out a comprehensive review of our 
advertising strategy to ensure that we are reaching  
our target audience effectively. 
Regulation  
and 
compliance
   
Many of the Group’s activities  
are facing increasing legislation  
and standards including trading, 
advertising, product quality, health  
& safety, the environment, data 
protection and the Bribery Act. Failure 
to comply with these may risk incurring 
financial or reputational damage.
Changes to the regulation of product 
warranties could affect future sales. 
• We actively monitor compliance with our existing 
obligations and we maintain internal policies and 
procedures. Colleagues are kept informed of  
these requirements via regular briefings and  
internal communications.
• All suppliers are subject to regular checks and 
independent product testing is regularly undertaken.
• We ensure that we comply with current guidelines  
on pricing and promotions through regular review  
and monitoring. 
• Annually, all employees are issued with a code  
of conduct.
• A confidential hotline is established for colleagues  
to raise any concerns in confidence.
The following principal risks and uncertainties are those that the Board has identified  
as having a potential detrimental impact on our corporate reputation, the operation  
of our business or on our ability to execute our strategy. The business takes a variety  
of steps to mitigate these risks and these are reviewed regularly as part of the oversight  
by the Audit Committee of the system of internal controls and reported on to the Board  
and the Executive Directors, who are collectively responsible for overall risk management.

Business 
systems and 
information 
infrastructure
   
The Group’s business involves a high 
number of operational and financial 
transactions across numerous sites 
that rely on the continuous operation 
of our IT systems.
• 24-hour system monitoring is in place for business 
critical systems.
• A disaster recovery site is available and a full  
disaster recovery plan is in place and is reviewed  
and updated annually. 
• The resilience against cyber-attack is regularly  
tested and monitored by the Group. 
Seasonality/
extreme 
weather
   
Furniture retailing is highly seasonal in 
nature. Prolonged extreme cold, warm 
or unseasonal weather conditions may 
reduce footfall in our stores, resulting 
in weak sales, leading to potentially 
adverse effects on profitability.
• The Group constantly monitors national,  
divisional, regional and branch results.
• This close monitoring and our ability to flex the 
marketing and advertising spend enables the Board  
to react quickly to changes in the marketplace.
Consumer 
finance
   
The Group’s ability to offer interest-
free credit to customers may be 
impaired as a result of high default 
levels, higher interest rates or the 
withdrawal or uncompetitive nature of 
consumer credit facilities provided by 
external finance companies – thereby 
reducing the competitiveness of a key 
part of the Group’s customer proposition.
• We maintain relationships with a number of credit providers 
to reduce the risk of the facility being withdrawn. 
• We regularly review default levels with the providers. 
• The Group has obtained the relevant permissions from the 
FCA to continue to provide interest-free credit to customers 
and continually monitors relevant compliance to obligations.
• Regular training is provided to retail staff and any 
complaints regarding regulated activity are reported to  
the Board.
Credit risk  
and liquidity
   
The availability of supplier credit and 
the ability of suppliers to obtain credit 
risk insurance could have material 
adverse effects on the Group’s cash 
position and overall financial condition.
• We have developed strong relationships and credibility 
with credit insurers though regular communication and 
information sharing.
• Robust forecasting facilities enable early discussion of 
possible issues increasing the chances of positive solutions.
• The committed bank revolving credit facility has been 
agreed and is in place until October 2018. 
• Suppliers provide regular updates on their credit 
insurance arrangements. 
• See the viability statement on page 31,  
for further information. 
Supply chain/
infrastructure
   
A large proportion of the Group’s 
products are supplied by a small 
number of key manufacturers.  
A supplier that ceases to trade  
could cause disruption to the  
supply of products to customers. 
Around one-third of the total products 
sold by the Group are manufactured  
in the Far East, which could present 
difficulties in ensuring supplier 
compliance and an ethical supply chain. 
• The Group has long-established and good working 
relationships with its key suppliers. 
• When sourcing products we ensure that at least two 
factories can produce each product providing resilience. 
• We independently monitor supplier financial stability  
to identify any early signs of failure. 
• We have updated our Service Level Agreements  
with all our suppliers to ensure that they meet our 
business requirements.
• Suppliers are expected to be members of Sedex (the 
supplier ethical data exchange) and agree to audits  
of manufacturing facilities.
Brand and 
reputation
   
The Group recognises the need to 
protect its brand and reputation – 
failure to do so effectively could result 
in a loss of confidence by customers 
and or colleagues.
• Key aspects of our business activities that have the 
potential to impact reputation are monitored closely.
• We regularly survey customer service levels (for example, 
through Trustpilot) and product quality, colleague 
engagement (through staff surveys). The integrity of  
our product sourcing is regularly monitored and reviewed. ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 30

Product 
   
Failure to deliver a safe, quality product 
in line with customer expectations risks 
the reputation of the Group, resulting 
in loss of customer confidence and 
declining sales volumes. 
• We have updated our Service Level Agreements  
with all our suppliers to ensure that they meet our 
business requirements. Suppliers are required to provide 
evidence that the product supplied is compliant with all 
current regulations. 
• Suppliers are expected to be members of Sedex that 
entails agreeing to independent audits of manufacturing 
facilities (including compliance to the Modern Slavery Act).
• The Group carries out regular independent testing  
on products supplied to ensure ongoing compliance  
to current regulations.
• Product performance is monitored via the customer 
service team and regular meetings are held with suppliers 
to help eliminate and reduce product issues. 
Our people
   
The business is reliant on the high 
quality, stability and experience in  
its senior management team.
• The key senior Executives and management are 
appropriately rewarded and incentivised through bonus 
and long-term incentive arrangements with a focus  
on retention as well as performance.
• The Board has adopted a succession plan which includes 
strategy and contingency measures should key individuals 
not be available.
Retaining trained and engaged 
colleagues is essential to the delivery  
of the high standard of customer service, 
which is a key part of our proposition. 
Our future success is at risk if we do not 
recruit and retain high-calibre people.
Recent changes to the minimum living 
wage could affect the Group’s cost 
base or affect ability to retain staff. 
• The Group ensures terms and conditions of employment 
are fair and competitive in the sector. 
• The Group works to maintain its brand presence and 
retain its reputation as an ‘employer of choice’.
• The Group has achieved and maintained Investors  
in People status.
• Retention rates are monitored and supported by an exit 
interview process.
Property 
– availability/
lease costs
   
The Group’s business requires that it 
leases substantial amounts of retail 
space. The availability and cost of 
suitable leasehold store property is  
a key element of the Group business 
model – permitting it to compete 
cost-effectively, alter the  
size and position of its stores when 
necessary and expand into new 
locations as part of its strategy for 
growth. The Group’s performance and 
prospects could be adversely affected 
if the availability and cost of suitable 
property were to move unfavourably.
• We work closely with agents and we regularly monitor  
for new opportunities.
• Ensuring we have up-to-date information from landlords  
on our current sites and are aware of the development  
of new retail sites.
• We work closely with our professional advisors to monitor 
progress and changes to rental evidence to predict future 
lease costs. 
• All proposed new stores are assessed for suitability and 
return on investment prior to being given the go-ahead 
by the Board.  ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 31
III II I. Strategic Report
Viability statement
As explained in the Strategic Report,  
our business model provides customers 
with high quality, competitively priced 
upholstered furniture, flooring and related 
products. The Directors have assessed the 
viability of the Group over the three-year 
period to 25 July 2020, taking into account 
the Group’s current position and the 
potential impact of the principal risks 
documented in the Strategic Report.
The three-year period was selected  
as this represents the normal budgeting 
period of the business and the payback 
requirements of any significant capital 
investment (new stores).
The strategy and associated principal risks 
underpin the Group’s three-year strategic 
planning process (‘the Strategic Plan’), 
which is updated annually. This process 
takes into account the current and 
prospective macro-economic conditions  
in the UK and the competitive tension that 
exists within the markets that we trade  
in. Changing economic conditions which 
impact consumer confidence could have  
an impact on demand for high ticket items.
The Strategic Plan also encompasses the 
projected cash flows and headroom against 
financial covenants under the Group’s 
existing facility. The Strategic Plan makes 
certain assumptions about the normal level 
of capital recycling likely to occur and 
therefore considers whether additional 
financing will be required. The Group 
continues to hold a significant cash  
balance and maintains an undrawn £12.0m 
committed revolving credit facility. The 
facility, which was extended in August 
2016, has a maturity date of October 2018. 
Discussions have begun to extend this 
facility, and therefore in preparing the 
viability statement the Directors have 
assumed that the current facility will be 
extended to cover the three-year period  
to 25 July 2020.
Based upon this assessment, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that  
the Company will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they  
fall due over the period to 25 July 2020.  
In making this statement, the Directors 
have considered the resilience of the 
Group, taking into account its current 
position and the principal risks facing the 
business. The Strategic Plan (which covers 
the same period as the viability statement  
to 25 July 2020) was stress tested for  
severe but reasonable scenarios and the 
effectiveness of any mitigating actions  
that would reasonably be taken. The 
Strategic Plan was specifically stress  
tested for downturns in revenue, gross 
margin (due to increased cost of sales)  
and the withdrawal of supplier credit 
insurance. The outcome of this testing 
satisfied the Directors with respect to  
the ongoing liquidity and solvency of  
the Group over the period under review.  ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 32
At ScS we see our core purpose as helping customers find perfect furniture and flooring  
for their home, suiting both our customer’s budget and personal style. At the same time,  
of course, we recognise that as a responsible business we have an obligation to operate  
in a manner that is both ethical and sustainable.
Sustainability, People and Community
This allows automatic computerised 
management of all energy usage, leading to 
maximising cost efficiencies and minimising 
downtime and wastage. Such systems 
include movement sensors to switch off 
equipment when it is not being used, light 
sensors to moderate lighting on signage  
and auto controls for heating and cooling.
Since 2014 ScS has installed new corporate 
signage at all sites incorporating the latest 
LED Illumination technology and all new 
sites opened since then include LED store 
lighting and energy-efficient heating and 
cooling systems. This, together with a 
progressive change to energy efficient 
systems in our existing stores, means  
that we are reducing our electricity usage. 
Since 2013 we have reduced our electrical 
energy consumption by 6.9%; the electrical 
reduction is against a backdrop of opening 
nine all electric stores in that period. Our gas 
usage has reduced 41.1%. The gas reduction 
has been assisted by the replacement 
of four gas air-conditioning systems  
with energy-efficient all electric units,  
and a further five are targeted in 2018. 
In 2017 we reduced our greenhouse  
gas emissions from 9,310.95 t/CO

to 8,439.47 t/CO

, a reduction of  
871.48 t/CO

SUSTAINABILITY
As a retailer we recognise that our 
operations will impact on the environment, 
and we have a duty to ensure that both now 
and in the future we seek to minimise this 
impact. There are a number of important 
areas that we place emphasis on, to reduce 
the environmental impact of the business. 
Our focus is to maximise the level of waste 
recycling, reduce our electricity usage, 
improve our fuel efficiencies and source 
products with integrity. 
Waste recycling
ScS is committed to reducing waste. All of 
our waste packaging, principally plastic and 
cardboard, generated by our stores, head 
office, distribution centres and used for 
protecting the product we deliver directly 
to our customers, is collected and recycled. 
We now recycle or divert from landfill 
95.7% of all waste collected (2016: 92%). 
Greenhouse gas emissions reporting
We aim to reduce our carbon footprint.  
All ScS sites now have automatic meter 
readers (AMR) fitted for recording 
electricity usage and meter loggers for 
recording gas usage. This allows greater 
control of costs by more accurate recording 
of data but also the policing of anomalies  
as these are highlighted within 24 hours. 
ScS are currently trialling a building energy 
management system (BEMs) at four sites. 
use of delivery vehicles to be optimised  
in terms of load en route, minimising the 
mileage required to achieve our customer 
deliveries, thus reducing fuel consumption. 
During 2017 we estimate that we have 
reduced our fuel consumption by a further 
1.6% per delivery (2016: 4.1%).
Sourcing with integrity
The statement has been made pursuant to 
Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. 
The Group has long been committed to  
the rights and well-being of the people 
who work for us, and in our supply chain, 
although we recognise modern forms  
of slavery can be very difficult to detect 
outside of the Group. 
In line with our own values, policies and 
processes, we operate a zero-tolerance 
approach to slavery and remain committed 
to tackling this type of human rights abuse 
through the effective due diligence and 
risk assessment of our supply chains.
The Group benefits from having close,  
well established and stable trading 
relationships with a relatively small number 
of 1st tier suppliers in both our furniture 
and flooring product offering. We also  
sell dining and occasional furniture  
which we source from a small number  
of well-established and highly regarded 
wholesalers. Our distribution supply  
chain is in-house, and we employ circa  
400 drivers, crew and operatives in our  
UK-based distribution network.
At ScS, sustainability, our people and 
the communities in which we operate 
are a key part of our business and  
is integrated into the day-to-day 
management of our Company. It is 
important to our reputation in the 
marketplace and to our customers 
and colleagues, as well as the wider 
stakeholders in society and the 
communities we serve. 
We focus on three key priority areas: 
sustainability, where our emphasis  
is on recycling waste, reducing 
electricity usage, improving fuel 
efficiencies and sourcing with 
integrity; people, to ensure that  
our staff and customers can work 
and shop in a safe environment,  
and a focus on ensuring that  
ScS is a great place to work and 
develop; and community, where  
we put great emphasis on local 
charitable fundraising.

III II I. Strategic Report
Risk assessment
Goods are principally manufactured in the 
UK, however, around a third of goods are 
manufactured in the Far East. 
The Group risk assesses its supply chain by:
• Assessing the risk profile of individual 
countries based on the Global Slavery 
Index, together with the inherent profile 
risk associated with the manufacturing 
of the goods in that territory;
• Analysing the insights and expertise  
of specialist third parties; and
• Reviewing the extent to which types  
of employees may be more vulnerable 
than others due to cultural, economic  
or demographical reasons.
The Group has well-established, stable  
and long-standing working relationships 
with its key suppliers based in the Far East 
and has achieved full support to our 
approach. The manufacturing of all goods 
in the Far East are completed in modern 
purpose built factories. Given the size  
and nature of the goods, the level of risk  
is considerably lower when compared to 
other types of manufacturing activities  
in the region.
In addition, the Group operates a 
Whistleblowing Policy, aimed principally at 
our employees, but also available to others 
working in our supply chains which allows 
the reporting of any wrongdoing and 
extends to human rights violations including 
modern slavery. Any reporting will be fully 
investigated and appropriate remedial 
actions taken.
Action completed
All our suppliers conduct regular  
Modern Slavery risk assessments  
and have commissioned or provided 
independent ethical audits within their 
own manufacturing processes to ensure 
alignment to local laws; standards set out 
by the International Labour Organisation 
and our internal policies and standards, 
which include:
• Clear obligations on suppliers to comply 
and implement controls to prevent 
Modern Slavery; 
• Ensuring all employment shall be 
voluntary; and
• Provision of an employment contract 
confirming the employee’s right  
to leave work and the ability  
to terminate employment upon  
expiry of reasonable notice. 
Training has also been completed by  
all employees in our merchandising and 
compliance departments to ensure a  
high level of awareness and understanding 
of the risks of modern slavery and human 
trafficking in our supply chains. 
Our new supplier process has been updated  
to enable the Group to adopt a more 
collaborative approach to tackling modern 
slavery. Where appropriate, we have assisted 
our suppliers to build upon their capability to 
detect modern slavery risk within their supply 
chains through the sharing of best practice.
Next steps 
As well as assessment of the effectiveness 
of the measures put in place by the Group, 
the following will be reviewed and reported 
on in future Modern Slavery Statements: 
• Increasing awareness to our retail and 
distribution teams demonstrating our 
commitment to tackle this issue;
• Supplementation of our existing terms 
of business with a code of conduct 
further highlighting our expectations  
of our supply chain; and
• Begin the process for risk assessing  
our supply chain for consumable goods 
supplied to the Group.
PEOPLE
Health and safety
We take the welfare of our customers and 
employees very seriously. We are therefore 
committed to ensuring that our business 
has appropriate health and safety standards 
across our store portfolio as well as our 
distribution centres and our head office.  
We want to ensure that our customers and 
employees can shop and work in a safe 
environment. The Board has the ultimate 
responsibility for ensuring health and safety 
compliance. The business regularly 
monitors a number of KPIs, including the 
number of accidents, particularly those that 
are required to be reported to the Health 
and Safety Executive.
In 2017 there were four accidents reportable 
to the Health and Safety Executive. In 2016 
there were eight reportable accidents, thus 
achieving our aim of reducing the number  
of reportable accidents though a review of 
the root causes and revisions to operating 
procedures. During 2017 we did see a 
significant overall reduction in incidents 
across the business, the accident frequency 
rate reducing from 7 .2 (per 100,000 hours 
worked) in 2016 to 1.14 (per 100,000 hours 
worked). This reduction was as a result of  
a drop in the total number of incidents, but 
also a decrease in the number of working 
days lost as a result of incidents. 
Our Health and Safety Policy is 
communicated throughout the business 
and all our colleagues receive health and 
safety training that is appropriate to their 
job role. Observance of policy is monitored 
through regular health and safety audits 
and we ensure that we are abreast of all 
current statutory requirements. Retail and 
distribution managers bonus earnings are 
reduced for a poor Heath and Safety Audit. 
Colleagues
Our people are core to our business, whether 
they work in our stores, are part of our 
distribution operation or are a member of our 
support teams. ScS is a growing business and 
in the last 12 months we have created 104 
new jobs across our organisation.
We are an equal opportunities employer 
and we strive to ensure that no employee  
is discriminated against on the grounds  
of gender, race, religion, disability, sexual 
orientation or age. We want ScS to be a 
great place to work and everyone working 
in it has an equal opportunity to progress 
within the business. 
ScS has held the Investors in People 
standard for the past 16 years, and we 
undertake regular culture surveys across 
our organisation to ensure that every 
employee has the opportunity to provide 
us with feedback about our workplace; our 
2017 survey achieved a 90% return rate.  ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 34
Our Investors in People accreditation  
was re-assessed in August 2016 and we  
are proud to have retained the standard. 
We offer apprentice opportunities  
within our business and in 2017 , five  
new apprentices joined our business.  
Our aim is always to offer permanent roles 
to apprentices, where it is possible to do  
so, on completion of their training. An open 
programme of Regulated Qualification 
Framework (RQF) training is offered to 
colleagues across the business and in  
2017 16 RQF’s were undertaken. Our  
Time to Train policy gives colleagues the 
opportunity to engage in other external 
training opportunities and, if the course 
meets relevant business criteria, the 
Company offers financial support towards 
this and, where required, a flexible work 
arrangement to allow them to attend their 
chosen course. Using this approach is key 
to the development of our distribution 
teams in identifying potential drivers whilst 
offering career progression and promotion.
We are working on our current training 
strategy to ensure that we optimise use  
of the Apprentice Levy and currently  
have three apprentices working via the  
levy programme.
In addition to external courses we produce 
bespoke development events to increase 
the capability of our people and support 
them through product and policy changes. 
Using technology to deliver some learning 
interventions means our training can be 
more cost-effective and highly responsive in 
terms of identifying best working practices. 
This drives a consistent performance 
standard throughout the business. 
We reward our store teams through 
results-focused bonus and commission 
schemes, which allow our retail sales  
teams to earn rewards commensurate with 
performance. In May 2015, we launched  
a share incentive plan that will allow all 
employees the opportunity to participate 
in the future success of ScS. 
COMMUNITY
Every year we work with and support 
various local and national charities, 
community and voluntary organisations  
to help make a positive contribution to 
their services and fundraising activities. 
From local children’s cancer charities, child 
and adult hospice services to high-profile 
fundraising appeals, such as Children  
in Need and Macmillan’s Biggest Coffee 
Morning, as a nationwide retailer we aim  
to support activities which have a positive 
impact within our local communities and 
which are close to the hearts and minds  
of our employees. During the year we  
made donations and raised funds of more 
than £57,000 and, together with our 
employees, we have benefitted more  
than 150 local and national charities  
and community organisations.
During the year we have continued our 
sponsorship of Sunderland AFC’s sporting 
charity Foundation of Light. In recent 
years our partner sponsorship of their 
award-winning Tackle It and Making 
Celebrating 100 stores, by celebrating 100 ‘good causes’ 
As part of our celebrations for 
reaching 100 stores nationwide, 
we wanted to say a big ‘thank you’ 
and give something back to each  
of the local communities that 
supported us on our journey from 
one local store in Sunderland to 
100 across the UK. We decided to 
create a £10,000 celebratory fund 
to shine a light on hardworking 
local causes and launched a 
national appeal asking members  
of the public to visit our stores  
and nominate local ‘good causes’, 
whether a charity, community 
group or voluntary organisation,  
to receive a donation from the fund.
More than 1,650 votes were cast, 
with nominations ranging from 
local disability swimming groups, 
dog rescue centres, scout groups, 
child and adult hospice services, 
mental health charities, local 
hospital units, emergency services, 
and many more. The benefitting 
cause for each of our 100 stores 
was chosen by the people on  
the basis of the most voted for, 
demonstrating its importance 
within the local community.
Our 100 Good Causes reach  
as far north as Aberdeen’s 
Community Foods Initiative, to as 
far south as Plymouth’s St Luke’s 
Hospice. Others include: Acorns 
Children’s Hospice Birmingham, 
which provides babies, children 
and young people with life limiting 
or life threatening conditions 
specialist palliative nursing and 
care, The Friends of Larkfield 
School, a fundraising and liaison 
group funding school resources 
and activities, The Alzheimer’s 
Society, the leading dementia 
support and research charity in  
the UK, as nominated by people  
in Nottingham, Claire House 
Children’s Hospice in the North 
West which helps seriously and 
terminally ill children live life  
to the full by creating wonderful 
experiences and bringing back  
a sense of normality to family life 
with specialist care and emotional 
support, and Megan’s Summer 
Ball in Kidderminster raising funds 
for youngster Megan, born with a 
very rare chromosome disorder, and 
the T9M Trust, to name just a few.

Causes can be found here:

III II I. Strategic Report
Moves programmes has totalled £40,000 
and continues to help deliver disability 
coaching and awareness for children and 
young adults. Earlier in 2017, employees 
visited Oxclose Primary School in 
Sunderland to see the positive impact  
our support is having across the region. 
We also played an active role in Great 
North Snowdogs’ Tyne and Wear’s  
biggest ever mass-participation public art 
event. A pack of more than 60 Snowdog 
sculptures were dotted around the North 
East region with a mission to help raise 
funds for and celebrate the work of  
St Oswald’s Children’s Hospice, based  
in Newcastle. As sponsor of DonTy  
(@DogOnTheTyne), based at Gateshead’s 
Angel of the North, together with fellow 
sponsors and contributors, the fundraising 
campaign raised £259,000 to help fund the 
work of the hospice. Family is important to 
us, and we couldn’t help but make DonTy a 
permanent fixture and member of the team. 
His new ‘furever’ home is now in our head 
office reception as a lasting memory of the 
event for our employees, as well as a great 
talking point for visitors for years to come. 
Standing together 
We actively encourage and support our 
employees in their ambitions to help and 
support charity initiatives, fundraisers and 
groups close to their hearts and minds. Our 
people are the heartbeat of our business 
and very much the heartbeat of their  
local communities. Some examples of  
the contributions made by our employees 
during the year include:
• From dress down days to crafty 
competitions, raffles and much more, 
employees at our head office have 
taken part and supported a range  
of fundraising events, including 
Macmillan’s Coffee Morning, Comic 
Relief’s Red Nose Day, Children in 
Need, Bradley Lowery’s Football Shirt 
Day, Save the Children’s Christmas 
Jumper Day and more. Together the 
team have raised and donated more 
than £2,000 during the year. 
• Our Manchester store made a  
£1,000 donation to the Manchester 
Emergency Appeal, following the tragic 
events at Manchester Arena to help 
locals rebuild their lives.
• Employee Trevor jumped into action to 
raise funds for Bradley Lowery’s fight 
against neuroblastoma taking up the 
challenge of a sponsored skydive. Trevor 
raised £1,500 through sponsorship from 
his friends and colleagues.
• The ScS team held a silent auction to 
raise funds for Leicester’s Children’s 
Hospital. The auction, part of the 
Group’s annual recognition and awards 
evening, generated £10,000 which  
was doubled by the Company totalling 
£20,000. The funds are already being 
utilised to enhance their provisions  
for sick babies and children, making 
their hospital stays more comfortable 
and homely.
Furnishing the future
Standing together for Macmillan 
We have a real passion for great furniture and  
we know the comfort, value and significance  
the humble sofa often plays in households 
across the UK and beyond. Using our skills and 
experience in this area, in 2017 we donated  
a custom-made armchair to Hazel Oak School 
an all age special school for children with 
moderate learning difficulties in Solihull.
The armchair was specially designed and created 
with UK furniture makers Ashley Manor, based in 
Dudley, and is upholstered in soft, textured fabric, 
with bright cushions, to heighten the senses and 
create a relaxed learning environment. The  
cosy chair is now pride of place in the school’s 
newly-refurbished library, and will enable 
teachers and learning-support staff to create  
an inviting space for the children to read. 
Fighting cancer is one of the biggest battles 
faced by many people and their families  
and loved ones. This battle is a very real and 
personal one to our team, with a number of 
employees currently fighting and surviving 
cancer. Sadly, during the year, it has also  
taken one of our own.
In support of their colleagues and to raise  
much needed awareness and funds, a group  
of employees from our HR, Training and Payroll 
departments committed to walking 100 miles to 
raise funds for Macmillan Cancer Support. The 
group set themselves the challenge of not only 
trekking the 84-mile Hadrian’s Wall but added 
an extra 16 miles to finish at our Sunderland 
store. The team completed their six-day 
challenge over the Easter Bank Holiday weekend 
2017, finishing in Sunderland. The team raised 
£4,000 in sponsorship and the Company further 
boosted the final fundraising total to £10,000. 
Pete Brown, Senior Distribution Manager, visited the 
school to deliver their new armchair, along with a donation 
of new books for the school’s library.

Corporate Governance Statement
Role of the Board
The Board is committed to high standards 
of corporate governance. The Company 
has complied (except where otherwise 
stated below) and intends to continue to 
comply with the requirements of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
The Company is led and controlled by the 
Board which is collectively responsible  
for the long-term performance of the 
Group. The Board focuses on the strategy, 
performance and governance of the  
Group. The Board has delegated certain 
responsibilities to committees to assist  
in discharging its duties and the 
implementation of matters approved  
by the Board. A summary of the terms  
of reference of each committee is set out  
on page 40 and reports of each committee 
are set out on pages 42 to 58.
Detailed implementation of matters 
approved by the Board and operational 
day-to-day matters are delegated to  
the Executive Directors. The Executive 
Directors are also supported by 
experienced and able operational  
senior management.
Matters reserved for the Board
A formal schedule of matters is reserved for 
the Board for its approval, which includes:
• Approval of the Group’s strategic aims 
and objectives, reviewing performance 
and business planning and oversight  
of the Group’s operations. 
• Approving any changes to the capital 
structure of the Group.
• Approving the financial reporting, 
budgets, dividend policy and any 
significant changes in accounting 
policies and practices of the Group. 
• Ensuring maintenance of a sound 
system of internal control and  
risk management.
• Approval of any major capital projects 
and materially significant contracts  
for the Group.
• Ensuring a satisfactory dialogue with 
shareholders based on the mutual 
understanding of objectives.
• Approval of the structure, size and 
composition of the Board and the 
remuneration policy for all Directors 
and Senior Executives. 
• Setting the division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman, Chief Executive 
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. 
This corporate governance statement sets out the  
main elements of the Company’s corporate governance 
structure and how it complies with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. It also includes information required  
by the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Rules and 
Transparency Rules.
Alan Smith
Chairman ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 39
III II. Corporate Governance I 
• Undertaking a formal and rigorous 
review of the Board performance  
and corporate governance matters.
• Approval and supervision of any 
material litigation, insurance levels  
of the Group and the appointment  
of the Group’s professional advisors.
There is a rolling programme of Board 
meetings throughout the year and there 
are six Board meetings presently scheduled 
for 2018.
All Board and committee members receive 
sets of Board packs in advance of the  
Board and committee meetings. For Board 
meetings this includes current trading, 
management accounts and detailed papers 
on other matters where Board approval is 
required. The CEO and CFO present reports 
to the Board at each meeting on trading, 
financial performance and operational 
matters, along with updates on any 
significant health and safety, litigation  
or regulatory matters.
Composition of the Board
The Board comprises the Non-Executive 
Chairman, two Executive Directors, two 
independent Non-Executive Directors and 
a Non-Executive Director appointed by  
Sun Capital Partners Management V, LLC in 
their capacity as the principal shareholder.
The UK Corporate Governance Code 
recommends that smaller companies have 
at least two independent Non-Executive 
Directors, excluding the Chairman. The 
Company has met this requirement and 
Ron McMillan (Senior Independent 
Director), appointed 22 October 2014, and 
George Adams, appointed 9 July 2015, are 
both considered by the Group to meet the 
definition of an independent Director. The 
Chairman, Alan Smith, is also considered 
independent. Each of them is considered 
by the Board to be independent in 
character and judgement and free from 
relationships or circumstances which  
may affect, or could appear to affect,  
the Director’s judgement. Independence  
is determined by ensuring that the 
Non-Executive Directors do not have  
any material business relationships or 
arrangements (apart from their fees for 
acting as Non-Executive Directors) with 
the Group or its Directors which in the 
opinion of the Board could affect their 
independent judgement. Paul Daccus is not 
regarded as independent for the purpose 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code in 
view of his position as a Partner of Sun 
European Partner LLP and his interests in 
Sun Capital Partners Management V, LLC 
which hold shares in the Company.
On 22 October 2014, Sun Capital  
Partners Management V, LLC entered  
into a Relationship Agreement with  
the Company. Under the terms of  
that agreement Sun Capital Partners 
Management V, LLC are entitled to appoint 
one Non-Executive Director to the Board 
for an initial period of three years. At the 
year ended 29 July 2017, Sun Capital 
Partners Management V, LLC held 41.5%  
of the total issued shares in the Company.
The Board believe that the terms of the 
relationship agreement referred to above 
will ensure that the Company and other 
members of the Group are capable of 
carrying on their business independently  
of Sun Capital Partners Management V, LLC 
and that transactions and relationships 
between those parties and the Group are at 
arm’s length on normal commercial terms.
All Directors have service agreements  
or letters of appointment in place and  
the details of the terms of these are set  
out in the Directors Remuneration Report  
on pages 46 to 52.
The Nomination Committee will review on 
an annual basis the Board’s composition, 
experience and skills to ensure the 
effective working of the Board and the 
Standing Committees and the commitment 
of their members. The Chairman has met 
with each of the Non-Executive Directors 
during the year on a one-to-one basis, 
without the Executive Directors being 
present, to discuss matters relating to  
the Board, its balance and the monitoring 
powers of the Executive Directors. 
The Chairman believes the current  
Board and Standing Committees have  
an appropriate balance of skills and 
experience to enable them to discharge 
their responsibilities effectively. Where 
Directors have external appointments, the 
Board is satisfied that they do not impact 
on the time the Director needs to devote  
to the Company.

Corporate Governance Statement continued
Division of responsibilities
The positions of Chairman and CEO  
are occupied by different individuals.  
There is a clear division of the roles and 
responsibilities between the Chairman  
and the CEO and no individual has 
unrestricted powers of decision making.
Alan Smith, as Chairman of the Board,  
is responsible for leading the Board,  
setting its agenda and overseeing its 
effectiveness. The Chairman facilitates  
the contribution of the Non-Executive 
Directors and constructive relations 
between them and the Executive Directors.
David Knight as CEO, together with  
Chris Muir as CFO, is responsible for the 
day-to-day management of the Group  
and the implementation of strategies 
approved by the Board and the 
implementation of other Board decisions.
Diversity
The Group is satisfied overall with its 
record on diversity, and is aware of the 
need to monitor and review its level  
of diversity. Whilst the Group would  
have preferred to appoint a female 
Non-Executive Director following the IPO, 
appointments will always be made on merit 
as opposed to on the basis of gender 
targets, and this is considered in the best 
interests of the Group and its shareholders.
Conflicts of interest
Paul Daccus has an interest in the shares 
held by Sun Capital Partners Management 
V, LLC, which holds 41.5% of the ordinary 
share capital and voting rights in the 
Company as a result of his partnership  
in Sun European Partners LLP.
Except as referred to above there are  
no potential conflicts of interest between  
any of the Directors or senior management 
within the Group and their private interests.
There is an established process of the 
Board for regularly reviewing actual  
or potential conflicts of interest. In 
particular, there is a process for reviewing 
transactions proposed to be entered  
into by related parties of Directors  
with any entities in the Group, including 
professional advice and consideration  
of it by the Board and the Company’s 
corporate brokers on the application of 
 the Listing Rules, the applicability and 
the appropriateness of any exemptions in 
respect of any transactions in the ordinary 
course of business and reporting to general 
meetings of shareholders under England 
and Wales Company Law. This process  
also includes consideration of the  
extent to which the Board may require 
external and any other reports and 
evaluations to be presented to it on  
any proposed transactions.
Committees of the Board
The Board has established and delegated 
authority to an Audit Committee,  
a Remuneration Committee and a 
Nomination Committee. A summary of  
the terms of reference of each of these 
committees is set out below. The full terms 
of reference of each of the committees  
is available at ScS Group plc head office.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by  
Ron McMillan. The duties of the Audit 
Committee as delegated by the Board  
are contained in the terms of reference 
available at ScS Group plc head office, 
which in summary include:
• Monitoring the quality, effectiveness 
and independence of the external 
auditors approving their appointment, 
re-appointment and fee levels;
• Reviewing and monitoring the integrity 
of the financial statements and any 
other price sensitive information of  
the Group; and
• Keeping under review the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
financial controls and internal control 
and risk management systems.
The members of the Audit Committee are 
Ron McMillan (Chair), Alan Smith and George 
Adams. Ron McMillan is an ICAEW chartered 
accountant and his experience formally as an 
audit partner of PwC fulfils the requirement 
under the UK Corporate Governance Code 
that one member of the Committee has 
recent and relevant financial experience. 
The Committee as a whole have competence 
relevant to the retail sector, in which we 
operate. All members served on the 
Committee throughout 2017 and all three 
remain in place at the date of this report.
The Audit Committee meets not less than 
three times a year. Details of the activities 
of the Committee in the last financial year 
are set out in pages 42 to 45.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired  
by George Adams. The Remuneration 
Committee sets the policy for the Group on 
executive remuneration. It determines the 
level of remuneration of the Chairman and 
the Executive Directors of the Company 
and makes recommendations in relation  
to other senior management.
In accordance with its terms of reference, 
the Committee prepares an annual 
Directors Remuneration Report for approval 
by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting of the Company. The terms of 
reference for the Remuneration Committee 
are available at ScS Group plc head office.
The members of the Remuneration 
Committee are George Adams (Chair),  
Alan Smith and Ron McMillan. All members 
served on the Committee throughout  
2017 and all remain in place at the date  
of this report.
The Remuneration Committee meets not  
less than two times a year. Details of the 
activities of the Committee in the last 
financial year are set out on pages 46  
to 52.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises  
all of the Non-Executive Directors.  
It is chaired by Alan Smith and its 
 other members are Ron McMillan,  
George Adams and Paul Daccus.
The duties of the Nomination Committee 
as delegated to it by the Board are 
contained in the terms of reference 
available at ScS Group plc head office, 
which in summary include:
• Reviewing the structure, size and 
composition of the Board, including  
the balance of Executive and Non-
Executive Directors;
• Putting in place plans for the orderly 
succession of appointments to the 
Board and to Senior Management; and
• Identifying and nominating candidates 
for the approval of the Board, to fill 
Board vacancies when they arise.
The Committee meet at least annually.
During the 2017 financial year the 
Nomination Committee has reviewed  
the size, structure and composition of the 
Board, with regard to the experience and 
skills represented on it and the balance  
of Executive and Non-Executive Directors 
represented on it. 
The Committee recognised the need to  
keep under review certain areas where over  
the course of time, appointments may be 
appropriate to consider. The Nomination  ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 41
III II. Corporate Governance I 
Committee also recognises the need to 
monitor and review diversity in relation  
to how the Group is led and represented. 
Appointments will always be made on 
merit-based, objective criteria, recognising 
diversity policy but without setting gender 
targets and this is considered to be in the best 
interests of the Group and its shareholders. 
Board performance evaluation
A review was undertaken during the 2017 
financial year. This will be repeated on an 
annual basis going forward and at least once 
every three years with an external consultant 
to assist in the process are required by the  
UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Re-election of Directors
Based on the performance review by  
the Nomination Committee of the size, 
structure and composition of the Board 
with regard to the experience and skills 
represented on it, the Nomination 
Committee has recommended that each  
of the Directors be re-elected to the Board, 
as they each continue to be effective 
members of the Board and demonstrate 
commitment to their roles.
Risk management and internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for 
ensuring that the Group maintains a strong 
system of internal control.
The system of internal control is designed  
to identify, manage and evaluate, rather  
than eliminate, the risk of failing to achieve 
business objectives. It can therefore 
provide reasonable, but not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement, 
loss or failure to meet objectives of the 
business due to the inherent limitations  
of any such system.
The key elements of the Group’s system  
of internal controls are as follows:
Financial reporting: Monthly management 
accounts are provided to members of  
the Board which contain current financial 
reports. Reporting included an analysis  
of actual verses budgeted performance 
and reasons for any significant differences. 
The annual budget is reviewed and 
approved by the Board. The Company 
reports half-yearly and publishes trading 
updates in line with market practice.
Risk management: The Group maintains  
a risk register, which is continually updated 
and monitored, with full reviews occurring 
on at least an annual basis. Each risk 
identified on the risk register is allocated 
an owner, at least at the level of senior 
manager within the business. The action 
required (where necessary) or acceptance 
of the risk is also recorded. The risk 
registers are provided to the Board,  
key risks and appropriate mitigating 
actions are monitored by the Board.
Information on key risks and uncertainties  
of the Group are set out on pages 26 to 30.
Monitoring of controls: There are formal 
policies and procedures in place to ensure the 
integrity and accuracy of accounting records 
of the Group and to safeguard its assets.  
The Board has carried out a review of the 
effectiveness of the internal controls during 
the year ended 29 July 2017 and for the 
period up to the date of approving the Annual 
Report and financial statements. The Board 
were satisfied after a review of the key risks 
to the business and relevant mitigating 
actions that they were acceptable for a 
business of the type, size and complexity  
as that operated by the Group.
Directors attendance
The Board held six meetings during 2017 and the attendance at the meetings was as follows:

Internal audit: The Group has established 
an Internal Audit function who are 
responsible for the monitoring of the 
Group’s role management approach  
and provides a line between operational 
managers and the Audit Committee.
Staff policies: There are formal policies  
in place in relation to anti-bribery and 
corruption and whistleblowing policies in 
relation to the reporting of any suspected 
malpractice or wrongdoing. In addition,  
the Group have provided all employees 
with access to an independent organisation 
(Safecall) where any concerns regarding 
wrongdoing can be reported to the Group. 
Compliance statement
The Company has complied with the 
provisions of the Corporate Governance 
Code (April 2016) during 2017 , as applicable, 
except where stated above in this report.
Shareholder relations
The Board recognises that good 
communication is key to maintaining 
shareholder relations, and as such we  
will endeavour to explain our actions and 
financial results on a regular basis and to 
respond to investor inquiries and feedback.
Meetings and calls are regularly made with 
institutional investors and analysts in order 
to provide the best quality information to 
the market.
The Company will communicate with its 
shareholders through the Annual General 
Meeting, at which the Chairman will give  
an account of the progress of the business 
over the past year, and will provide the 
opportunity for shareholders to raise 
questions with the Chairman and the 
Chairs of each of the Committees of  
the Board.
The Company also runs a corporate 
website at www.scsplc.co.uk, which is 
regularly updated with our releases to the 
market and other information and which 
includes a copy of this Annual Report and 
financial statements.

Audit Committee Report
Dear Shareholder
The Audit Committee exercises oversight 
of the Group’s financial policies and 
reporting, monitors the integrity of the 
financial statements and reviews and 
considers significant financial and 
accounting estimates and judgements.  
The Committee satisfies itself that the 
disclosures in the financial statements 
about these estimates and judgements are 
appropriate and obtains from the external 
auditors an independent view of the key 
disclosure issues and risks. In relation to 
risks and controls, the Committee ensures 
that these have been identified and that 
appropriate responsibilities and 
accountabilities have been set.
A key responsibility of the Committee is  
to review the scope of work undertaken  
by the internal and external auditors  
and to consider their effectiveness. 
During the year, the Committee again 
oversaw the process used by the Board to 
assess the viability of the Group, the stress 
testing of key trading assumptions and  
the preparation of the viability statement, 
which is set out on page 31, in the principle 
risks section of the Strategic Report. 
The Committee has also considered  
the narrative at the front end of the  
Annual Report and believes that sufficient 
information has been provided to give 
shareholders a fair, balanced and 
understandable account of the  
Group’s business.
The Committee also reviewed, on behalf  
of the Board, the Group’s compliance with 
the Modern Slavery Act and it’s policies in 
relation to money laundering, anti-bribery 
and whistleblowing.
Further information on the Committee’s 
responsibilities and the manner in  
which they have been discharged  
are set out below. 
I shall be available at the Annual General 
Meeting on 22 November 2017 to answer 
any questions you may have on this report 
and would like to thank my colleagues  
for their continued help and support.
The Audit Committee acknowledges and embraces its  
role of protecting the interests of shareholders as regards 
the integrity of publicised financial information and the 
effectiveness of audit.

III II. Corporate Governance I 
Committee composition
The Committee comprises three  
members, two of whom are independent 
Non-Executive Directors. Two members 
constitute a quorum and the Committee 
must include one financially qualified 
member with recent and relevant financial 
experience. The Committee Chairman 
fulfils this requirement. All members are 
expected to have an understanding of 
financial reporting, the Group’s internal 
control environment, relevant corporate 
legislation, the roles and functions of 
Internal Audit and external audit and the 
regulatory framework of the business. 
The members of the Committee during  
the year were Ron McMillan, Alan Smith 
and George Adams. Details of Committee 
meetings and attendance are set out in  
the Corporate Governance Statement  
on page 41. The timing of Committee 
meetings is set to accommodate the dates 
of releases of financial information and  
the approval of scope of and outputs from 
work programmes executed by the internal 
and external auditors. The biographies  
of the members of the Committee can  
be found on pages 36 and 37 and reflect 
the significant experience that the 
Committee members have of working  
in or with companies in the retail and 
consumer goods sectors.
Although not members of the Committee, 
David Knight, as CEO, Chris Muir, as CFO, 
and Paul Daccus, as a Non-Executive 
Director, attend meetings, together with 
representatives from the Internal Audit 
function and the external auditors.
In addition to scheduled meetings, the 
Committee Chairman meets with the Head 
of Internal Audit, the external auditors and 
the CFO during the year.
 
Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Committee, as 
delegated by the Board, are set out in the 
terms of reference and are available from 
the Group’s head office. They include  
the following: 
• Reviewing and monitoring the integrity 
of the financial statements and other 
price sensitive financial releases of  
the Group; 
• Monitoring the quality, effectiveness and 
independence of the external auditors 
and approving their appointment;
• Monitoring the activities of the Internal 
Audit function;
• Assisting the Board with the development 
and execution of a risk management 
strategy, risk policies and current risk 
exposures, including the maintenance  
of the Group’s risk register; and
• Keeping under review the adequacy  
and effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal financial controls and internal 
control and risk management systems.
Activities
In discharging its oversight of the matters 
referred to in the introductory letter to  
this report, the Committee was assisted  
by management and the internal and 
external auditors. 
The recurring work of the Committee 
comprised:
• Consideration of the Annual Report  
and financial statements of the Group;
• Consideration of the interim results 
report and non-statutory financial 
statements of the Group for the  
half year;
• Consideration of the significant areas  
of accounting estimation or judgement;
• Consideration of the significant risks 
included in the Annual Report;
• Approval of the external auditors terms 
of reference, audit plan and fees; and
• Approval of the Internal Audit plan.
The significant matters considered by the 
Committee during the year were:
• Volume rebates with suppliers
 The Group receives volume rebates 
from suppliers. The Committee gained 
an understanding of these arrangements, 
discussed them with management and 
the external auditors and satisfied itself 
with the controls that are in place to 
ensure that amounts received and 
receivable from suppliers are properly 
accounted for on a monthly basis and 
that the related judgements are limited.
 The volume rebate arrangements are 
pre-negotiated with suppliers and are 
split between suppliers with rebate 
‘hurdle’ rates dependent on spend and 
those that have a flat rate. At the year 
end, the vast majority of hurdle rates 
were exceeded and therefore the level 
of judgement involved was significantly 
reduced. Where hurdle rates were not 
surpassed and the arrangements were 
not coterminous with the year-end, 
judgements were required but the 
amounts involved were not material. 
• Completeness of stock provisions
 The Group policy in relation to stock 
provisioning is to provide for obsolete, 
slow-moving and defective stocks. The 
Committee discussed with the CFO and 
the external auditors the judgements 
related to stock provisioning and the 
appropriateness of these in light of the 
aged stock analysis. The Committee 
satisfied itself that stock was not 
materially misstated.
• Internal control and risk management
 The Board has overall responsibility  
for ensuring that the Group maintains a 
sound system of internal control. There 
are inherent limitations in any system  
of internal control and no system can 
provide absolute assurance against 
material misstatements, loss or failure. 
Equally, no system can guarantee 
elimination of the risk of failure to meet 
the objectives of the business. Against 
that background, the Committee has 
helped the Board develop and maintain 
an approach to risk management which 
incorporates risk appetite, the framework 
within which risk is managed and the 
responsibilities and procedures pertaining 
to the application of the policy.
The Group is proactive in ensuring that 
corporate and operational risks are 
identified and managed. A corporate  
risk register is maintained which details:
1. the risks and the impact they may have;
2. actions to mitigate risks;
3. risk scores to highlight the implications 
of occurrence;
4. ownership of risks; and
5. target dates for actions to mitigate risks.
A description of the principal risks is set 
out on pages 28 to 30.
 
The Board has confirmed that it has carried 
out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group, including those 
which threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity.
The Board considers that the processes 
undertaken by the Committee are 
appropriately robust and effective and in 
compliance with the guidelines issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council. During the year, 
the Board has not been advised by the 
Committee nor has it identified itself, any 
failings, frauds, or weaknesses in internal 
control which it has determined to be material 
in the context of the financial statements. ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 44
The Committee continues to believe that 
appropriate controls are in place throughout 
the Group, that the Group has a well-
defined organisational structure with clear 
lines of responsibility and a comprehensive 
financial reporting system. The Committee 
also believes that the Company complies 
with the FRC guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and related Financial 
Business Reporting.
• Going Concern
 The Committee considered the going 
concern position of the Group. In so 
doing, the Committee ensured that the 
assumptions underpinning forecasts 
were stress tested and that the factors 
which impact risks and uncertainties 
were properly considered.
Other areas of focus for the Committee 
were:
• The Group’s significant accounting 
policies and practices;
• The Group’s exposure to tax and  
VAT issues;
• Fraud risk and its mitigation;
• The Group’s business continuity and 
disaster recovery procedures; and
• The adequacy of the Group’s IT systems.
In addition to the above, the Committee 
undertook the following:
• Approval of the external auditors terms 
of engagement;
• Consideration of the level of non-audit 
services provided by the external 
auditors and the application of the 
Group’s policy to these; 
• Consideration of the significant risks 
included in the Annual Report;
• Consideration of the interim results  
and non-statutory financial statements 
of the Group for the half-year ended 
28 January 2017;
• Consideration of the processes that are 
in place to ensure that assurance can be 
provided on whether the Annual Report 
and financial statements is considered 
to be fair, balanced and understandable. 
The Committee receives drafts and 
working papers relating to the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements in 
order to facilitate its review and input. 
Management representations, external 
and Internal Audit reviews have also 
taken place to provide this assurance  
to the Audit Committee and the Board;
• Consideration of this set of full-year 
Annual Report and financial statements 
of the Group;
• Consideration of significant areas of 
accounting estimation or judgement; 
• Consideration of the Market Abuse 
Regulations and Insider Dealing  
Policies; and
• Making recommendations to the Board 
in respect of the Committee’s findings, 
and reporting on how the Committee 
has discharged its duties.
Internal Audit
The Head of Internal Audit has a direct 
reporting line to the Committee and 
attends every Committee meeting  
to present Internal Audit and Risk 
Management reports. During the financial 
year Internal Audit has undertaken a 
programme of work which was discussed 
and agreed with both management and the 
Committee and which was designed to 
address both risk management and areas 
of potential financial loss. Internal Audit 
has also established procedures within  
the business to ensure that new risks are 
identified, evaluated and managed and 
that necessary changes are made to the 
risk register.
During the year the Committee reviewed 
reports from Internal Audit in relation to:
• Fraud risk, money laundering, anti-
bribery, whistleblowing and compliance 
with the Modern Slavery Act;
• Compliance assessments of the Group’s 
retail outlets and Distribution Centres;
• Risk management, along with the 
effectiveness of mitigating actions in 
relation to the Group’s principle risks, 
including IT systems, business 
continuity and cyber risk;
• IT processes and controls;
• Processes and controls related to FCA 
regulated activities; 
• Health and safety processes and controls;
• Payroll and expenses procedures  
and controls;
• HR and training procedures  
and controls;
• Stock management processes  
and controls; 
• Purchase ledger processes and  
controls; and
• Risk management. 
In relation to each of the above, Internal 
Audit made recommendations for 
improvement, the vast majority of which 
were agreed by management and either 
have been or are being implemented.
Internal Audit have reported significant 
progress in compliance at retail outlets 
following the focus applied over the  
past year.
The Committee has evaluated the 
performance of Internal Audit during  
the year and concluded that significant 
progress has been made. Internal Audit is 
viewed as a function which has a strategic 
plan developed in collaboration with the 
Committee, providing constructive 
challenge and demonstrates a realistic  
and commercial view of the business.
External auditors
PwC have been the Group’s auditors for 
nine years, with the current year being  
the third audit signed off by Jonathan 
Greenaway, who is currently responsible. 
The Committee has formally 
recommended that PwC be re-appointed 
as auditors at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting and PwC has signalled  
its willingness to continue in office. 
Resolutions appointing PwC as auditors 
and authorising the Directors to set 
remuneration will be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting. The Group 
intends to review the external audit 
appointment in 2018.
The Committee has established policies  
in relation to the provision of non-audit 
services by the auditors. The external 
auditors are not permitted to perform  
any work that they may be later required  
to audit or which might affect their 
objectivity and independence or create  
a conflict of interest. Furthermore,  
the external auditors may not perform  
any work prohibited by the Ethical 
Standards published by the Financial 
Reporting Council. 
All fees for non-audit work require 
pre-authorisation by the Chief Financial 
Officer and the Audit Committee, and 
non-audit fees paid to the auditors will not 
exceed 70% of audit fees over a three-year 
period. Fees paid and payable to PwC in 
respect of the year under review are as 
shown in note 4.
Audit Committee Report continued ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 45
III II. Corporate Governance I 
The Committee has, in conjunction with  
the Board and the management team, 
reviewed the effectiveness of the external 
auditors, both in relation to audit and 
non-audit services and has satisfied itself 
that the work undertaken by the external 
auditors was effective.
The Committee reviewed the reports 
prepared by PwC on key audit findings  
and any significant deficiencies in the 
control environment, as well as the 
recommendations made by PwC to 
improve processes and controls, together 
with managements responses to those 
recommendations. PwC did not highlight 
any significant internal control weaknesses 
and management has committed to 
making appropriate changes in controls  
in other areas highlighted by PwC.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Dear Shareholder
Our Annual Report on Remuneration 
outlines how the Remuneration Policy, 
approved at the 2015 Annual General 
Meeting, was applied for 2017, and how  
we intend to apply it for 2018. There have 
been no changes to the Policy and we  
will be reviewing the Policy over the 
forthcoming year and setting out our 
proposals for approval at the 2018  
Annual General Meeting.
The Annual Report on Remuneration is 
subject to an advisory vote at our 2017 
Annual General Meeting. 
There will be no resolution on the Policy at 
the 2017 Annual General Meeting. For ease 
of reference, the current policy is set out 
for shareholders’ information on pages  
53 to 58. 
Remuneration principles
The key aims of the Remuneration Policy 
are to:
• Attract, retain and motivate high-
calibre senior management;
• Focus senior management on the 
delivery of the Group’s business 
objectives;
• Promote a strong and sustainable 
performance culture;
• Incentivise profitable growth; and 
• Align the interests of the Executive 
Directors and senior management  
with those of the shareholders. 
In promoting these objectives, the 
Committee’s aims are to develop  
a remuneration policy in a simple, 
transparent and understandable way. 
2017 Performance related pay
For 2017, the annual bonus was based 
solely on EBITDA. Sales and revenue  
for 2017 grew despite the challenging 
market backdrop. 
EBITDA of £17.4m was above the minimum 
target set for the year, as a result the bonus 
was paid out at 39.2% of the maximum. 
The Committee considers that this fairly 
reflects the results for the year. Further 
information on the bonus and targets can 
be found on page 48 of our Annual Report 
on Remuneration. 
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the 
Director’s Remuneration Report for the year ended  
29 July 2017 .

III II. Corporate Governance I 
As set out in our Remuneration Policy on pages 53 to 58 the Committee considered the long-term incentive plan to be awarded to the 
Executive Directors. A long-term incentive plan was awarded during 2017 the details of which can be found in our 2016 Annual Report. 
There were no long-term incentive plan awards vesting during the year, however, the performance-based £nil cost options granted on 
30 March 2015 have been forfeit as of the 29 July 2017, as the earnings per share (EPS) for the Group was lower than the performance 
condition set.
Remuneration proposals for 2018
Base salary 
During the year, the remuneration of the two Executive Directors of the Company, along with the senior management of the Group,  
was reviewed.
The Remuneration Committee decided that, given the uncertain market conditions, the salaries of the CEO and the CFO will remain 
unchanged from their remuneration in 2017. No basic pay awards were given to any of the senior management team. Details of the 
average increase given to other employees is detailed on page 51.
There will be no change in pension provision or benefits framework for Executive Directors.
 
Annual bonus
The 2018 bonus will continue to be based on EBITDA performance supporting our strong emphasis on delivering profitable growth.  
The maximum award opportunity remains 140% of salary for the CEO and 100% of salary for the CFO. The Committee considers the 
forward-looking EBITDA targets to be commercially sensitive, but full disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be 
provided on a retrospective basis in next year’s remuneration report. 
2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The Committee has agreed to a LTIP award in 2018 which is in keeping with our remuneration policy. Awards will be granted at 100%  
of salary for the CEO and 100% of salary for the CFO. The awards will be subject to an EPS performance condition. Taking into account 
internal forecasts for business performance over the next three years, as well as external expectations of performance, the Committee 
agreed the following targets for 2018 awards:
EPS figure (in 2020) Percentage of award that vests
Less than 25.1p Nil
25.1p 25%
Greater than 25.1p but less than 31.0p Straight-line basis between 25% and 100%
31.0p 100%
The Committee considers that the targets are stretching and will ensure that significant reward is only available for delivery of  
a strong performance. 
Shareholder feedback
We value the views of our shareholders and we actively welcome any feedback on our remuneration policy and its implementation.  
We will be reviewing the Remuneration Policy over the next year and presenting a revised Policy for approval at the 2018 Annual  
General Meeting. We hope you find this report helpful and informative and we hope to receive your support for our Annual Report  
on Remuneration at our Annual General Meeting on 22 November 2017.
Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Committee has responsibility for determining the Company’s policy on remuneration for the Executive Directors and the Chairman 
and to recommend and monitor the level and structure of remuneration of other senior management of the Group. 
The Committee’s terms of reference are available from the ScS Group plc head office.
There will be an advisory vote on the Annual Report on Remuneration for 2017 at this year’s Annual General Meeting. The Remuneration 
Policy was approved by shareholders at the 2015 Annual General Meeting. No changes have been made to our Remuneration Policy this 
year and as such there will be no resolution on our Remuneration Policy at the 2017 Annual General Meeting.
The Committee also welcomes feedback generally at any time which will be considered as part of its annual review of remuneration policy.  ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 48

For 2018 the maximum bonus opportunity is unchanged at 140% of base salary for the CEO and 100% of base salary for the CFO.  
The bonus is based on the achievement of stretching EBITDA targets. The Committee does not disclose the targets in advance  
as they are commercially sensitive. Retrospective disclosure of the EBITDA targets will be included in next year’s report. 
Long-term incentives
There was no vesting in respect of performance in 2017 , however, the performance-based £nil cost options granted on 30 March 2015  
have been forfeit as of the 29 July 2017 , as the EPS for the Group was lower than the performance condition set. The awards required an  
EPS for 2017 of at least 24 pence. Full details of the awards and two performance conditions attached are set out in the 2015 annual report.
The Committee has agreed to award a long-term incentive plan in 2018. The CEO and CFO will be awarded shares with a face value of 
100% of base salary subject to EPS targets being met. The awards have a three-year vesting period (no holding period applies, but will  
be considered for future awards) and are subject to the following targets:
EPS figure (in 2020) Percentage of award that vests
Less than 25.1p Nil
25.1p 25%
Greater than 25.1p but less than 31.0p Straight-line basis between 25% and 100%

The value of share interests at the year-end is based on the closing share price at 28 July 2017 of £1.55875.
The Executive Directors are required to build and maintain a shareholding equivalent to 100% of base salary. The shareholding  
for David Knight was significantly in excess of this level at the year end. The beneficial shareholding for Chris Muir is currently nil,  
but he is required to build up a shareholding, which will be achieved by the retention of share options awarded under the LTIP.

Remuneration Committee
The members of the committee for the 2017 financial year were George Adams (Committee Chairman), Alan Smith and Ron McMillan.  
All of the current members are independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The responsibilities of the Committee are set out in the Corporate Governance section of the Annual Report on page 40.
The Committee may invite the Executive Directors or other members of the senior management to attend meetings and assist the 
Committee in its deliberations as appropriate. No person is present during any deliberations relating to their own remuneration or 
involved in determining their own remuneration. During the course of the year David Knight, Chris Muir, Paul Daccus and Marie Liston, 
Corporate Services Director, were in attendance as required.
The attendance of members of the Committee at meetings of it was as follows:

Advisers to the Committee
During the year the Committee received independent advice on executive remuneration matters from New Bridge Street, a trading  
name of Aon Hewitt Ltd. New Bridge Street were appointed by the Remuneration Committee following a selection process.
New Bridge Street is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in 
relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The Committee has received advice provided by New Bridge Street during the 
year and is comfortable that it has been objective and independent. Total fees received by New Bridge Street in relation to remuneration 
advice provided to the Committee during 2017 amounted to £7,367, excluding VAT, based on the required time commitment.  ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 52

Remuneration Policy Report
Remuneration Policy overview
Total remuneration packages for the Executive Directors established at the time of the IPO will provide the basis for the structure  
of Director remuneration for the Group. Variable elements of reward including performance-based annual bonuses and long-term 
incentives will form a significant part of the overall remuneration package for Executive Directors and senior management. 
How the views of shareholders are taken into account 
The Committee recognises that developing a dialogue with shareholders is constructive and informative in developing and applying  
the Remuneration Policy.
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the 2015 Annual General Meeting. For ease of reference it is set out 
below, although some references which were specific to the Policy’s operation in 2016 and 2017 have been removed or updated for ease 
of reading. 
Policy
Remuneration Element Purpose Operation Maximum
Base salary This is the basic pay and 
reflects the individual’s  
role, responsibilities and 
contribution to the Group.
Base salaries are reviewed annually with 
changes typically taking effect from the 
beginning of the relevant financial year.  
On reviews, consideration is given by the 
Committee to a range of factors, including 
the Group’s overall performance, market 
conditions and individual performance of 
Executives and the level of salary increases 
given to employees across the Group.
Base salaries are benchmarked against 
companies both main and AIM listed 
(excluding those in the financial services 
sector) who are of a similar size, sector  
and complexity.
Similarly, in practice, the Committee will 
typically discount the data to recognise  
that the cost of living in the North East  
is lower than some other parts of the UK.
Given the requirements under 
current UK regulations for  
a formal cap, the Committee  
has limited the maximum 
salary it may award to 120%  
of the median salaries in the 
benchmark group. In practice, 
though, the Committee would 
normally expect to keep it at 
the median of this benchmark. ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 54
Remuneration Element Purpose Operation Maximum
Benefits To provide benefits which are 
valued by the individual and 
assist them in carrying out 
their duties.
The Group will provide market competitive 
benefits, which may periodically be reviewed. 
Executives will generally be eligible to receive 
those benefits on similar terms to other 
senior Executives.
The Committee has the discretion to  
add or remove benefits to remain market 
competitive or to meet the needs of  
the business.
In addition, where the Committee considers 
it appropriate to do so, additional relocation 
expenses may be paid.
Executives are entitled to a car allowance  
or a company car, car insurance, other 
running costs and fuel, death in service  
life assurance, private medical care and  
any other Group-wide benefits, including 
employee discount.
Business travel and associated hospitality are 
provided in the normal course of business.
The cost of benefits paid to an 
Executive Director in any one 
year is capped at £100,000,  
but this may be exceeded in 
exceptional circumstances, for 
example, if the cost of a benefit 
were to increase significantly.
Pension Provide a market competitive 
pension contribution (or 
equivalent cash allowance).
Executive Directors may take pension 
benefits as a contribution to defined 
contribution personal pension plans; or,  
on reaching the lifetime limit for pension 
contributions, the Executive Director can 
receive cash in lieu.
A total maximum value  
of 20% of base salary for 
Executive Directors and  
senior management.
Bonus Provide an incentive linked 
principally to the financial 
performance of the Group.
The Committee intends all, or the majority  
of, the bonus to be based on financial 
measures, but it has the discretion to 
introduce operational, corporate, divisional 
and/or individual performance measures  
if appropriate to the business.
Performance conditions, once set,  
will generally remain unaltered, but the 
Committee has the right in its absolute 
discretion to make adjustments during any 
performance period to reflect any events 
arising which were unforeseen when the 
performance conditions were originally  
set by the Committee. Bonuses are normally 
paid in cash.
The current annual bonus 
potential for the CEO is 140% 
of base salary and 100% of 
base salary for the CFO and 
senior managers. The threshold 
bonus levels will be no more 
than 25% of their respective 
maxima. As the regulations 
require a formal cap for a 
three-year period, future bonus 
potential will only increase 
where appropriate against 
market data and, in any event, 
will be subject to an overall 
maximum of 200% of salary  
for any Executive Director.

Remuneration Element Purpose Operation Maximum
Long-term 
incentives 
Awards may be made 
annually of £nil-cost options 
based on performance 
conditions. The Committee 
may set performance 
conditions typically  
over a three-year period.
Dividend equivalents will be made as either  
a cash payment or delivery of Plan Shares  
at exercise equal in value to the dividends 
payable on the number of Plan Shares in 
respect of which the Award is exercised 
between the Award Date and the date  
on which the Award vested.
Malus and Clawback provisions apply to the 
awards made under the LTIP from 28 January 
2015 onwards.
Performance conditions, once set,  
will generally remain unaltered, but the 
Committee has the right in its absolute 
discretion to make adjustments during any 
performance period in case of events arising 
which were unforeseen when the performance 
conditions were first set by the Committee.
Where a holding period is imposed in the 
discretion of the Committee in relation to  
any LTIP award, the default position (unless 
the Committee determines otherwise) is  
for the holding period to expire on the fifth 
anniversary of the date of grant of the 
relevant award.
The policy is to award Executive 
Directors £nil-cost share 
options equating to no more 
that 100% of their basic salary.
No more than 25% of an award 
can be earned for a threshold 
performance.
Shareholding 
guidelines
Executive Directors are 
expected to maintain their 
shareholding levels once 
they have been obtained. 
The Committee will review shareholding 
annually against policy. The Committee 
reserves the right to alter the shareholding 
guidelines during the period of the policy  
but without making the guidelines any less 
onerous overall. 
The minimum required level of 
shareholding is 100% of base 
salary of the relevant Executive.
Employee share 
plan
To encourage share 
ownership by employees  
and participation in the 
long-term success of the 
Group, the Group operates 
an employee share incentive 
plan for UK employees which 
was adopted in April 2015. 
Executive Directors can participate in  
the employee share incentive plan (SIP)  
on the same terms as other employees  
of the Group in the UK.
Under the rules of the SIP 
employees can purchase  
a maximum of £1,800 worth  
of shares per annum from  
their pre-tax and pre-national 
insurance salary through  
a resident SIP trust.
Existing awards
In putting the Directors’ Remuneration Report to an advisory vote of shareholders, the Company will honour any commitments already 
entered into in 2017 with the Executive Directors, which are detailed in the annual remuneration report. 
Remuneration policy and other employees
As well as the Executive Directors, other senior management will also participate in the performance-based annual incentive plan  
to be adopted under the remuneration policy above. A small group of senior management also participate in the LTIP for performance 
share awards. 
The Company is committed to widespread share ownership. Following the IPO the Company made a number of awards under a LTIP which 
was adopted prior to admission. Also the Company employee share incentive plan (SIP), which was adopted prior to admission has been 
launched. Under the SIP , Executive Directors are eligible to participate on a consistent basis to all other employees.  ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 56
In setting the remuneration policy going forward, the Committee will also have regard to pay structures across the broader Group.  
The Committee does not consult directly with employees when reviewing Executive Directors’ remuneration, but takes into account  
the general base salary increase for the broader workforce when undertaking annual salary reviews for the Executive Directors.
 
Operation of variable pay
Annual incentive plan
The Committee will set the performance targets annually under the annual incentive plan to take account of the Group’s strategic plan 
and financial performance. The performance targets are set by the Committee based on a range of factors including against the budget 
for the financial year. The metrics adopted by the Committee and the weighting of them may vary in relation to the Company’s strategy 
each year. 
The Committee sets a threshold pay-out, target and maximum pay-out target under the plan.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The Committee will regularly review the performance targets in relation to the LTIP to take account of the Group strategic plan  
and financial performance. Targets will be set by the Committee at the time of the grant of each award. 
Clawback
The annual incentive plan and the LTIP rules include provisions for malus and clawback within a three-year period following payment  
or vesting if the Committee concludes that there has been a material mis-statement of financial results, or there are circumstances 
which would have warranted summary dismissal of the participant, or there are circumstances having an impact on the reputation of the 
Company which justify clawback being operated, or where the Committee discovers information from which it concludes that a bonus  
or award was paid or vested to a greater extent than it should have been. 
Potential reward scenarios
The graphs below show an estimate of the Executive Directors’ remuneration package for the financial year ending 28 July 2018,  
as a percentage of total potential remuneration and total value, for the policy as it will be implemented for 2018. Share price movements  
and dividend accrual have been excluded from the indicative scenarios below.
Assumptions
• The minimum scenario reflects fixed remuneration only which is base salary, pension and benefits. 
• The on target scenario reflects the fixed remuneration plus 50% of the maximum annual bonus under the annual incentive plan, and 
25% vesting under the LTIP being the threshold level (assuming an award of 100% of salary to Executive Directors under the LTIP).
• The maximum scenario reflects fixed remuneration plus 100% of the maximum annual bonus under the annual incentive plan which 
is 140% of base salary for the CEO and 100% of base salary for the CFO and 100% vesting under the LTIP (assuming an award of 
100% of salary under the LTIP).

Recruitment and promotions
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms of the Company’s remuneration 
policy at the time of the appointment. 
Additionally on appointment of any new Executive Director (whether by external recruitment of internal promotion) the remuneration 
policy will permit the following:
• The UK regulations do not require that caps on fixed pay apply to a new recruit and the Committee reserves the right to set fixed  
pay at such levels as it considers necessary although, in practice, it envisages abiding by the caps set out in this policy. 
• If a new Executive Director’s salary is set on appointment below the median market rates, phased increases (as a percentage of salary) 
above those granted generally to other employees may be awarded subject to the individual’s performance and development. 
• The Company may compensate a new Executive Director for amounts forgone from the individual’s former employer in addition  
to ongoing remuneration provided under the policy (as permitted under Listing Rules) taking account of the amount forfeited,  
the extent of any performance conditions, the nature of the award and the time period for vesting. 
• The annual incentive plan would operate in accordance with its terms pro-rated for the period of employment and depending  
on the appointment timing, different performance targets might be set as the Committee considers appropriate.
• On an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the individual’s former role would be allowed to pay  
out according to its terms, with any relevant adjustment to take account of the appointment. Any other ongoing remuneration 
obligations existing prior to the appointment would also continue. 
• On any appointment, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet the appropriate relocation expenses. 
Service contract and payments for loss of office
Main provisions on termination
The service contract for the CEO and CFO is indefinite but terminable either by the Company or the Executive Director on 12 months’ 
notice. The service contract for the CEO is dated 19 December 2014 and for the CFO 8 January 2016.
An Executive Directors’ service contract can also be terminated without notice or payment of compensation except for pay accrued  
up to the termination date on the occurrence of certain events such as gross misconduct. 
Payment in lieu of notice equal to the base salary only for the unexpired period of notice can be paid under the Executive Directors’ 
Service agreements.
There are no enhanced provisions on a change of control under the Executive Directors’ service contracts. 
Any new contracts will be on similar terms.
The service contracts of the Executive Directors are available for inspection at the registered office of the Company. 
Annual bonus on termination
There is no contractual entitlement to annual bonus on termination or if an Executive Director is under notice. Under the annual incentive 
plan, the Committee has absolute discretion to permit a bonus to be paid to a leaver or under notice based on the full or part-year 
performance, subject to consideration by the Committee of the reasons for the individual leaving. A full or pro-rata time based bonus  
may be awarded, and this may be paid either at or before the normal payment date. 
Performance share plans on termination
Share-based awards made under the Company’s share plans are governed by the relevant plan rules. Under the rules of the LTIP , awards 
lapse if they have not vested on giving or being given notice of termination of employment for any reason, unless the Committee in its 
discretion permits an award to vest in whole or in part and on such terms as it may specify in its absolute discretion. Awards which may 
have vested before giving or receiving notice of termination of employment remain exercisable for a period of six months after leaving  
or (if later) the expiry of any holding period which the award was subject to. The Committee has the discretion to extend this period.  ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 58
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
Fees
The level and structure of fees for the Non-Executive Directors was set by the Board from admission. The fees of the Non-Executive 
Directors are set by the Board taking account of the Chairmanship of Board Committees and the time and responsibility of the roles  
of each of them. The fees are paid in cash. The Committee has responsibility for determining fees paid to the Chairman of the Board.  
All fees are subject to the aggregate fee cap for Directors in the articles of association, which is currently £400,000 per annum. 
Details of the fees paid to the Non-Executive Directors are set out in the Remuneration Report. The Chairman and the Non-Executive 
Directors are entitled to be reimbursed of all expenses reasonably incurred by them in the performance of their duties. The Chairman 
and Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any bonus or share plans of the Company.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts. They are appointed for an initial three-year period subject to being  
re-elected by members annually.

responsibilities of individual Directors and 
their expected annual time commitment.
The aggregate amount

2 October 2017 ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 62
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulation.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’, and applicable law). Under company law the Directors must 
not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and Company for that period. In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• State whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed for the Group financial statements and  
United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101, have been followed for the Company financial statements, subject  
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
• Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Company  
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for  
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group and Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the Board of Directors section on pages 36 and 37 confirm that, to the 
best of their knowledge:
• The Company financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’, and applicable law),  
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company;
• The Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and
• The Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group and 
Company, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

Independent Auditors’ Report  
to the Members of ScS Group plc 
Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion:
• ScS Group Plc’s Group financial statements and Company financial statements (the ‘financial statements’) give a true and fair view  
of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 29 July 2017 and of the Group’s profit and the Group’s and the Company’s 
cash flows for the year then ended;
• The Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• The Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’, and applicable law); and
• The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report, which comprise: the consolidated and Company statements 
of financial position as at 29 July 2017; the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated and Company statements 
of cash flows, and the consolidated and Company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial 
statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.  
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled  
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided 
to the Group or the Company.
Other than those disclosed in note 4 to the financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the Group or the Company  
in the period from 31 July 2016 to 29 July 2017.
Our audit approach
Overview
• Overall Group materiality: £1,165,000 (2016: £1,100,000), based on 0.35% of total revenues.
• Overall Company materiality: £700,000 (2016: £700,000), based on 1% of total assets.
•  We performed an audit of the complete financial information of the Group’s trading entity A. Share & Sons 
Limited as well as its three holding companies including the Company (excluding dormant and immaterial entities).
•  The timing of the audits for the statutory accounts for the Group, Company and the subsidiary companies took 
place at the same point in time and, as such, as at the date of this opinion we have audited all material balances 
across the Group.
• Completeness of stock provisions.
• Volume rebates from suppliers.
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.  
In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates 
that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed 
the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that 
represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Materiality
Audit scope
Key audit 
matters ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 64
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures 
thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Completeness of stock provisions
Refer to page 43 (Audit Committee Report).
The Group holds £22.1m of inventory at the year end. The nature 
of the business is such that stock held at the stores to display 
certain ranges will be more than one year old. As such there is  
a material balance of inventory greater than one year old which 
gives rise to a risk that this aged stock may be unsaleable and 
therefore not held at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
We recognise that there is judgement in arriving at any potential 
value of provision for these items with management needing to 
take into account future saleability of the item, potential proceeds 
and underlying cost. As such, the judgements involved were an 
area of focus.
The integrity of the aged stock listing was tested, with the 
inventory type and stock ageing being vouched to invoice on  
a sample basis. There were no issues noted with the underlying 
data used in calculating the provision.
To check whether stock items were being sold at less than book 
value, a sample of aged stock items sold in the year was selected 
and the book value compared to proceeds and any associated 
provision. No material exceptions were noted and we concurred 
with the provision held by management for aged stock items.
Volume rebates from suppliers
Refer to page 43 (Audit Committee Report).
Volume rebates are negotiated by ScS Group plc as part of its 
dealings in the normal course of business with suppliers. Judgement 
arises when agreements are not co-terminus with the Group’s year 
end and contain spending thresholds or ‘hurdle rates’ that may 
change the rebate percentage offered for all spend in the period. 
In mitigation, hurdle rates are not included in all contracts, there  
is quarterly settlement of rebates and the vast majority of non-
coterminous agreements exceeded the hurdle rate at the year end.
We sent confirmation requests to a sample of suppliers, asking 
them to confirm the rebate year end and percentage included  
in the contract as well as the overall spend in the year. Where a 
response was not received, we agreed the rebate year end and 
percentage to the underlying contract. For the total supplier  
spend during the year, we tested on a sample basis to invoice and 
settlement agreeing that the rebate was calculated in line with  
the rebate agreement. We tested on a sample basis the year-end 
debtor amount to invoice and subsequent receipt post year end. 
No issues were noted on any of the above procedures.
We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the Company to communicate in our report.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements  
as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry  
in which they operate.
The Group is based in and operates solely in the UK market from its 100 stores and 27 House of Fraser concessions. It has one trading 
entity, A. Share & Sons Limited, and three UK based holding companies including ScS Group plc. The Group’s accounting function and 
financial reporting is managed from head office.
We performed an audit of the complete financial information of the Group’s trading entity A. Share & Sons Limited as well as three 
holding companies including the Company (excluding dormant and immaterial entities).The timing of the audits for the statutory 
accounts for the Group, Company and the subsidiary companies took place at the same point in time and, as such, as at the date  
of this opinion we have audited all material balances across the Group.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.  
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent  
of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements,  
both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. 
Independent Auditors’ Report  
to the Members of ScS Group plc continued ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 65
III. Financial Statements II I
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Company financial statements
Overall materiality £1,165,000 (2016: £1,100,000). £700,000 (2016: £700,000).
How we determined it 0.35% of total revenues. 1% of total assets.
Rationale for benchmark applied Based on our professional judgement and 
our knowledge of the client our materiality 
was based on 0.35% (2016: 0.35%) of 
revenue giving an overall materiality of 
£1,160,000 (2016: £1,100,000). We used 
0.35% of revenue as the benchmark for  
our materiality calculations due to the  
low margin nature of the business and  
our judgement around what would affect  
the decisions of the members.
Based on our professional judgement and 
our knowledge of the client our materiality 
was based on 1.0% (2016: 1.0%) of total 
assets giving an overall materiality of 
£700,000 (2016: £700,000). We used 1.0% 
of total assets as the benchmark for our 
materiality calculations due to the entity 
being a holding company with limited 
activity and our judgement around what 
would affect the decisions of the members.
We allocated component materiality of £1,150,000 to A. Share and Sons Limited, the only component in scope for our Group audit.  
This was less than our overall Group materiality of £1,165,000. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £58,000 (Group 
audit) (2016: £55,000) and £35,000 (Company audit) (2016: £35,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, 
warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add  
or draw attention to in respect of the directors’ statement in  
the financial statements about whether the directors considered  
it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements and the directors’ identification 
of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least  
12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. However, 
because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s and Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the directors’ statement relating to 
Going Concern in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’  
report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover  
the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated  
in this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,  
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the  
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement,  
we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement  
of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies 
Act 2006 have been included.  ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 66
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, (CA06),  
ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described 
below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report for the year ended 29 July 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable 
legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit,  
we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity  
of the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• The directors’ confirmation on page 26 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal  
risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The directors’ explanation on page 31 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over  
what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they  
have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the  
period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially less in 
scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; checking 
that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’); and considering 
whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment 
obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules)
Other code provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when: 
• The statement given by the directors, on page 62, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced  
and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s and Company’s position  
and performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and Company obtained  
in the course of performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on page 40 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
• The directors’ statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant 
provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. (CA06)
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 62, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true  
and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation  
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

III. Financial Statements II I
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is  
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed  
by our prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• We have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• Certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• The Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with  
the accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Appointment
We were appointed by the directors on 3 November 2009 to audit the financial statements for the year ended 1 August 2009 and 
subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is nine years, covering the years ended 1 August 2009  
to 29 July 2017.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
1. General information 
ScS Group plc (the ‘Company’) is a company limited by shares incorporated and domiciled in England, within the UK (Company registration 
number 03263435). The address of the registered office is 45-49 Villiers Street, Sunderland, SR1 1HA. The Company’s principal activity  
is to act as a holding company for its subsidiaries. The Company and its subsidiaries’ (the ‘Group’) principal activity is the provision of 
furniture and flooring, trading under the names ScS and ‘House of Fraser Made to Order Sofas, Furniture and Flooring’. The shares in  
the Company were admitted to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) on 28 January 2015.
2. Accounting policies 
Basis of preparation
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (IFRS) as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 29 July 2017 and applied in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies using IFRS and interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee 
(IFRS IC) and under the historic cost convention. The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the 
financial statements for the year ended 29 July 2017. These policies have been consistently applied to all of the years presented, unless 
otherwise stated.
The Group financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (£’000) except 
when otherwise indicated.
Going concern 
The Group generates strong cash flows, reflecting the negative working capital requirements of the business model. In addition the  
Group has a committed £12.0m revolving credit facility in place. The Group’s forecasts and projections show that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue to operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Having considered the Group’s current trading and cash flow generation, including severe but plausible stress testing scenarios,  
the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the Group financial statements on a going concern basis.
New standards, amendments and interpretations 
Standards, amendments and interpretations effective and adopted by the Group:
A number of new standards and interpretations and amendments to existing standards have been issued but not are yet effective nor 
adopted by the EU, including IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’, IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ and IFRS 16 ‘Leases’, and 
have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. Of these, only IFRS 16 is expected to have a material impact 
to the Group.
• IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ will be effective for the year ending 25 July 2020 onwards and the impact on the financial statements will be 
significant. IFRS 16 requires lessees to recognise a lease liability reflecting future lease payments and a right-of-use asset for all lease 
contracts. Therefore, the substantial majority of the Group’s operating lease commitments (£178,418,000 on an undiscounted basis, 
as shown in note 22) would be brought on to the balance sheet. Depreciation of the right of use asset will be recognised in the income 
statement on a straight-line basis, with interest recognised on the lease liability. This will result in a change to the profile of the  
net charge taken to the income statement over the life of the lease. Depreciation and interest charges will replace the lease costs 
currently charged to the income statement and consequently there will be a significant adjustment to the quoted unadjusted  
Group EBITDA. There will be no impact on cash flows, although the presentation of the cash flow statement will change significantly. 
Management has begun to model and quantify the expected impact using the current lease portfolio and presented initial thoughts 
on the expected impact to the Board, however the impact will greatly depend on the facts and circumstances at the time of adoption 
and upon transition choices adopted. It is therefore not yet practicable to provide a reliable estimate of the financial impact on the 
Group’s consolidated results.
Basis of consolidation 
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of ScS Group PLC and the entities it controls (its subsidiaries) 
drawn up to within seven days of 31 July each year.
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern  
the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights 
that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. Control is generally accompanied by a shareholding of more than 
one-half of the voting rights. The financial information of subsidiaries is included in the consolidated financial information from the 
date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation 
Intra-Group balances, and any gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-Group transactions, are eliminated in preparing 
the consolidated financial information. Gains arising from transactions with jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the 
Group’s interest in the entity. Losses are eliminated in the same way as gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.  ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 73
III. Financial Statements II I
Segmental reporting
Segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting to the Board of Directors (see note 3 – Segment information).
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, and represents amounts receivable for goods supplied, 
stated net of discounts, charges associated with interest-free credit sales, returns and value added taxes. The Group recognises revenue 
when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured; when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity; and 
when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods and warranty contracts have passed to the buyer. This is deemed  
to be when the goods and any associated warranty contracts have been delivered to the customer. Warranty services, once sold,  
are subsequently provided by third parties. 
Intangible assets
Intangible assets purchased separately are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic life.  
The useful economic lives used are as follows:
Computer software – 20-33% straight-line per annum.
The carrying value of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying 
value may not be recoverable.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historic purchase cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its 
intended use. Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, 
of the tangible fixed assets over their anticipated useful lives at the rates shown below:
Fixtures and fittings     10-20% straight-line per annum
Computer equipment     20-33% straight-line per annum
Leasehold property improvements straight-line per annum The shorter of the term of the lease or 2% straight-line per annum
Freehold land and buildings     2% straight-line per annum
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate 
the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value and consist of finished goods held for resale. Where necessary 
provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving and defective stocks. Cost comprises the purchase price of goods and other directly 
attributable costs incurred in bringing the product to its present location and condition. Net realisable value is the estimated selling 
price reduced by all costs of completion, marketing, selling and distribution.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. If collection  
is expected in one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not,  
they are presented as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
less provision for impairment.
Trade payables
T rade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts 
payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Payments received on account
The Group operates a negative working capital model whereby customers pay a deposit at the point of order and, unless the order is to 
be financed using consumer credit, settle outstanding balances before delivery. Deposits taken from customers are shown as payments 
received on account within current liabilities until the goods or services are delivered.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised 
cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement 
over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 74
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
2. Accounting policies continued
Cash and cash equivalents
In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax,  
from the proceeds.
Pre-opening and launch costs
Pre-opening and launch costs are charged to the income statement in the year they are incurred.
Advertising expenditure
All routine and general advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs paid to media companies are recognised as a 
prepayment until the advertising is placed in the media and communicated to the public, at which point the expenditure is expensed  
to the income statement.
Supplier contributions
Contributions received from suppliers towards the cost of displaying and promoting their product are recognised as a reduction in the 
advertising and marketing costs to which they relate.
Supplier rebates
Rebates receivable from suppliers are based upon the volume of business with each supplier and are recognised in the income statement 
in cost of sales or credited to stock as appropriate on an earned basis, by reference to the supplier revenue.
Leases 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Provisions for onerous leases are recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a location are lower than  
the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligation under the lease.
Lease incentives
The aggregate benefit of lease incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense. The benefit is allocated on a systematic basis 
over the period to the end of the lease. The balance is carried forward within accruals.
Lease premiums
Premiums paid on entering into a lease are classified as short leasehold property within property, plant and equipment and depreciated 
over the life of the lease.
Pension costs
Contributions to the defined contribution scheme are charged to the income statement in the year in which they become payable.  
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent 
that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method, on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax base of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, to the extent that the Director considers that it is more likely 
than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing 
differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 75
III. Financial Statements II I
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All exchange differences  
are taken to the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Share-based payments
The Company operates an equity-settled, share-based payment plan for Directors of the trading subsidiary undertaking, A. Share & Sons 
Limited, which includes the Executive Directors of the Group. The fair value of the Directors’ services received by the Group in exchange 
for the issue of shares in the Company is recognised as an expense in the financial statements of the subsidiary company to which services 
have been supplied. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares 
issued, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets). Non-market 
vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of shares that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date,  
the Group revises its estimates of the number of shares that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original 
estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
 
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that a transfer of economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates
The preparation of the financial statements under IFRS requires the Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated 
and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable 
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Directors consider that the following estimates and 
judgements are likely to have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated historical financial information. 
Volume rebates
The Group receives income from suppliers via volume rebates which are based on agreed rates based on the level of spend with suppliers 
in the year. Where these arrangements are not coterminous with the year end these are accrued based on management’s judgement  
as to whether the turnover targets will be achieved for the individual supplier. 
Stock provisions
The Group’s policy in relation to stock provisioning is to provide for obsolete, slow-moving and defective stocks.
3. Segment information
The Directors have determined the operating segments based on the operating reports reviewed by the senior management team (the 
Executive Directors and the other Directors of the trading subsidiary, A. Share & Sons Limited) that are used to assess both performance 
and strategic decisions. The Directors have identified that the senior management team are the chief operating decision makers in 
accordance with the requirements of IFRS 8 ‘Segmental reporting’.
The Directors consider the Group operates one type of business generating gross sales and revenue from the retail of furniture and 
flooring. All gross sales and revenue profit before taxation, assets and liabilities are attributable to the principal activity of the Group 
and other related services. All gross sales and revenues are generated in the United Kingdom.

(c) Factors that may affect future tax charges
The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017. Further reductions in the 
corporation tax rate from 19% to 17% from 1 April 2020 were substantively enacted as part of the Finance Bill 2016 (on 6 September 
2016). Accordingly, the profits for this period are taxed at an effective rate of 19.67% and deferred taxation has been calculated based 
on a rate of 17%.

19. Share-based payments
The Group operates equity-settled share schemes for certain employees that are intended to act as a long-term incentive to help retain 
key employees and Directors who are considered important to the success of the business.
Post-admission incentive arrangements
The ScS Group plc Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) was adopted on 21 January 2015 conditional upon admission. The LTIP allows  
for various types of awards and the following grants over shares in ScS Group plc have been made:
(i)  £Nil cost options conditional on the IPO taking place (approved on 21 January 2015).
(ii)    Market value options under a HMRC approved Company Share Option Plan conditional on the IPO taking place  
(approved on 21 January 2015).
(iii) Unapproved market value options conditional on the IPO taking place (approved on 21 January 2015).
(iv)  Performance-based £nil cost options granted on 30 March 2015 (the performance condition is based on EPS as set out in the 
consolidated audited financial statements of the Group for 2017). As the EPS for the Group was lower than the performance 
condition set, these awards have been forfeit as at 29 July 2017.
(v)   Performance-based £nil cost options granted on 17 October 2016 (the performance condition is based on EPS as set out in the 
consolidated audited financial statements of the Group for the financial year ended 27 July 2019).
Fair value of awards
The awards granted have been valued by an independent third party using the Black-Scholes model. No performance conditions were 
included in the fair value calculations.
The expected life is the estimated time period to exercise. The expected volatility is calculated by reference to the historic volatility  
of the Company from the period between admission and the date of grant and historic volatilities of comparator companies measured 
over a period commensurate with the expected life. The dividend yield is based on the target dividend yield set at IPO (with the exception 
of awards that give an entitlement to receive dividend equivalents). The risk-free interest rate is the yield on UK government bonds  
of a term consistent with the expected life. The level of vesting is estimated at the balance sheet date and will be trued up until the 
vesting date.  ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 82

III. Financial Statements II I
23. Financial instruments – risk management
Financial risk management policy
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents. The main purpose of these financial instruments  
is to provide funds for the Group’s operations. The Group has other financial instruments being trade receivables and trade payables 
that arise directly from its operations.
It is, and has been, under review throughout the year, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.  
The Group has not entered into derivative transactions during the years under review. The Group does not undertake any speculative 
transactions and continues to pursue prudent treasury policies by investing surplus funds only with reputable UK financial institutions. 
Credit risk
The finance for all Group’s credit sales is provided from external financing companies who bear the whole risk of customer defaults  
on repayment. The Group’s financial assets which are past due and not impaired are deemed not material for disclosure. The remaining 
balance is deemed fully recoverable due to the use of finance houses to mitigate the risk of recoverability. There have been no gains/
losses on financial liabilities. 
Cash and deposits are invested with Lloyds Bank plc. 
Liquidity risk
The Group’s exposure to liquidity risk is low, as historically working capital requirements have been funded entirely by self-generated 
cash flow. The Group has a £12.0m committed revolving credit facility. 
Financial instruments by category
Financial assets and liabilities are classified in accordance with IAS 39. No financial instruments have been reclassified or derecognised 
in the year. There are no financial assets which are pledged or held as collateral. The Group does not hold any financial assets or liabilities 
held as fair value through the income statement, defined as being in a hedging relationship or any available for sale financial assets. 
All financial assets are deemed to be loans and receivables at amortised cost and their carrying value equal to their fair value. 
All financial liabilities are held at amortised cost and their carrying value equal to their fair value and there is no variance between this 
at initial recognition and the transaction price. 
All financial assets and liabilities are based on readily observable prices and market data (level 1).
Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and retain financial flexibility 
to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. The Group considers capital to be equity and cash. Equity and 
cash are disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
The Group manages its capital through continued focus on free cash flow generation and setting the level of capital expenditure and 
dividend in the context of the current period and forecast free cash flow. 
24. Related parties
Holdings in subsidiaries are disclosed in the Company financial statements in note 4. Only ScS Furnishings Limited and the ScS Group 
Employee Benefit Trust is not included in the consolidation on the grounds of materiality.
25. Contingent liabilities
The subsidiary undertakings of the Group are party to a debenture with Lloyds Bank plc which grants fixed and floating charges over  
the assets of each subsidiary undertaking.
26. Post-balance sheet events
There have been no events since the balance sheet date that either require adjustment to the financial statements or are important  
in the understanding of the Company’s current position. ScS Group plc Annual Report 2017 84
