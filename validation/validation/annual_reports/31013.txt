The Group delivered an outstanding 
performance in 2017 , increasing 
profit before taxation by 44% (50%*) 
to a record £40.6m (2016: £28.1m). 
All of the Group’s regions delivered 
increases in both gross profit (net fee  
income) and operating profit and 71%  
(2016: 69%) of the Group’s net fee 
income is now derived from overseas 
businesses.  
Revenue was up 17% (14%*) to £1.2bn (2016:  
£1.0bn) and net fee income increased by 
24% (20%*) to £345.2m (2016: £278.3m). 
Operating profit was up 60% (54%*) to 
£41.9m (2016: £26.2m) and earnings per 
share increased by 55% to 42.9p per share 
(2016: 27.7p per share). 
The Group further strengthened its balance 
sheet with net cash of £31. 1m as at 31 
December 2017 (31 December 2016: 
£22.5m). The Group’s ratio of permanent 
and contract recruitment net fee income 
is 68% permanent to 32% contract (2016: 
69%:31%).
During the year, headcount increased by 
17% to 3,793 (2016: 3,229). Headcount 
investment is highest in those regions and 
business units demonstrating the strongest 
potential for accelerated growth.
The Board will be recommending a 50% 
increase in the final dividend to 9.3p per share  
which combined with the interim dividend 
of 2.75p per share would result in a 42% 
increase in the total dividend to 12.05p  
per share (2016: 8.5p). 
In 2017, the Group purchased 2.1m shares 
at an average price of £3.79 for £8.0m, which  
were subsequently cancelled. An additional  
0.4m shares were purchased at an average 
price of £4.03 for £1.8m through the Group’s 
Employee Benefit Trust. The Board is 
authorised to re-purchase up to 10% of 
the Group’s issued share capital and will 
be seeking approval for the renewal of this 
authority at the Annual General Meeting  
on 17 May 2018.
As recently announced, I will be stepping 
down from my role as the Group’s Non-
Executive Chairman on 1 March. It has been  
a privilege to serve on the Board for the past  
five years and I have absolutely no doubt that  
the Robert Walters Group will continue to go  
from strength to strength. I would like to take  
this opportunity, one final time, to thank all 
of the Group’s staff for their hard work and 
support in delivering a high-quality service 
to our candidates and clients.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
STRONG GROWTH 
DELIVERED 
WORLDWIDE
THE GROUP’S ABILITY  
TO DELIVER ITS BEST  
EVER PERFORMANCE WAS,  
ONCE AGAIN, TESTAMENT  
TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR  
LONG-TERM STRATEGY  
FOR GROWTH.
ROBERT WALTERS
CHIEF EXECUTIVE STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Annual Report and Accounts 2017  Robert Walters plc 7
The Group’s ability to deliver its  
best ever performance was, once 
again, testament to the success  
of our long-term strategy for growth;  
founded on the two pillars of 
international expansion and 
discipline diversification. 
Our international footprint covers 28  
countries, and most crucially, encompasses 
some of the world’s fastest growing and 
exciting recruitment markets as well as more  
mature and well-established locations that 
continue to have significant scope for 
additional growth. 
The breadth of solutions we can provide to 
our clients, from permanent, contract and 
interim recruitment through to recruitment 
process outsourcing is also a key point of 
differentiation in our ability to provide a true 
end-to-end recruitment offering to both 
candidates and clients.
ASIA PACIFIC  
(40% OF GROUP NET FEE INCOME)
Revenue was £370.2m (2016: £348.6m), 
net fee income increased by 16% (11%*) 
to £136.6m (£131. 1m*) (2016: £1 17 .6m) and 
operating profit increased by 21% (14%*)  
to £17.7m (£16.8m*) (2016: £14.7m).
One of the key strengths of the Group is its  
presence in both established and emerging  
recruitment markets and nowhere is this more  
prevalent than in Asia Pacific. The Group 
operates in 13 countries and has an 
unrivalled footprint across the region. 
In Asia, the Group’s most profitable single  
country, Japan, enjoyed yet another record  
year in both Tokyo and Osaka, reinforcing 
our market-leading position in this exciting  
market. Hong Kong, another of the Group’s  
well-established scale businesses, also had  
a record year whilst market conditions 
in Singapore remained more challenging. 
Across our emerging markets, all businesses  
delivered record performances and 
continued to grow net fee income  
and market share.
Australia had a good year and a particularly 
strong fourth quarter: benefiting from our 
footprint of offices covering five states, 
our focus on margin growth in the SME 
market and high growth disciplines such 
as technology, digital and contract. New 
Zealand had a record year with the Group’s 
successful sponsorship of the recent British 
& Irish Lions Tour helping to further build our 
brand profile and market-leading position. 
Resource Solutions continued to grow  
its client base across the region, winning 
a number of multi-country contracts with 
new clients. A new Global Service Centre 
was opened in Manila during the year  
to complement our existing site in India.
UK  
(29% OF GROUP NET FEE INCOME)
Revenue was £569.6m (2016: £480.6m), 
net fee income increased by 16% to 
£100.9m (2016: £86.7m) and operating 
profit increased by 84% to £11.8m  
(2016: £6.4m).
In the UK and particularly in London  
and the South East, candidate and client  
confidence levels remain somewhat cautious. 
However, activity levels in certain sectors 
and disciplines were strong. In London, 
growth was strongest across technology, 
legal, financial services and commerce 
finance. In the regions, growth was broad-
based with St. Albans and Manchester  
in particular delivering the strongest rates  
of growth, benefiting from a focus on 
SMEs and the trend of a number of large 
businesses moving operations outside  
of London.
Resource Solutions continued to 
deliver impressive rates of growth and 
encouragingly won several clients in new 
industry sectors including retail, mobile 
telecommunications, fintech and property 
management. 
EUROPE  
(23% OF GROUP NET FEE INCOME)
Revenue was £189.1m (2016: £147.0m), 
net fee income increased by 34% (26%*) 
to £80.6m (£75.5m*) (2016: £60.1m) and 
operating profit increased by 168% (149%*) 
to £11.3m (£10.5m*) (2016: £4.2m).
The Group has a geographic footprint 
that spans nine countries. Performance 
was outstanding across the region with 
both net fee income and operating profit 
increasing significantly year-on-year. 
Belgium, Germany, Portugal, the 
Netherlands and Spain all delivered net fee 
income increases in excess of 20%. Our 
French business, our largest in the region, 
grew net fee income by 18% and delivered 
a significant increase in operating profit.
OTHER INTERNATIONAL 
(8% OF GROUP NET FEE INCOME)
Other International encompasses Brazil, 
Canada, South Africa, the Middle East 
and the USA. Revenue was £36.9m (2016: 
£22.3m), net fee income increased by 93% 
(87%*) to £27.1m (£26.2m) (2016: £14.0m) 
and operating profit increased by 16% 
(41%*) to £1.1m (£1.3m*) (2016: £0.9m).
Market conditions in Brazil remain challenging 
but it has been positive to see our business 
deliver in excess of 50% growth in net fee 
income year-on-year. Our new business  
in Canada has started well whilst in the US,  
although financial services remains tough,  
other market sectors, particularly technology  
and digital, continue to be strong. The Middle 
East was largely flat year-on-year whilst in 
South Africa we are seeing good growth 
from Sub-Saharan markets as our brand 
presence grows across the region. 
BOARD CHANGES
Leslie Van de Walle will be stepping down 
from his role as Non-executive Chairman 
on 1 March 2018. On behalf of myself and 
the Board, I would like to thank Leslie for 
his strong contribution to the Group over 
the last five years and wish him all the best 
for the future. Carol Hui, who is currently 
Senior Independent Director will step up  
to the role of Non-executive Chairman 
whilst Brian McArthur-Muscroft will take  
on the role of Senior Independent Director. 
The Board is in the process of identifying 
an additional Non-executive Director.
OUTLOOK
The Group has successfully maintained  
the momentum of 2017 and started the 
year strongly. As a result, we look at the 
year ahead with confidence.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND DRIVERS
TALENT SHORTAGES 
WORLDWIDE
Talent shortages are set to intensify further, even in countries 
experiencing modest growth. Demographic changes continue  
to be a key driver, particularly across Asia. As the European 
job market begins to grow after ten years of stagnation, the war  
for talent shows no sign of slowing. In talent short markets, 
specialist recruitment firms can excel and are in greater demand  
to add value to the hiring process, especially when compared 
to speculative channels like social media or advertising.
KEY DRIVERS 
– Growing middle class across Asia 
– Ageing populations 
– Globalisation driving demand for bilingual talent 
– Legislative and industry changes
OUR RESPONSE 
– Ability to head hunt ‘passive’ talent – channels like LinkedIn  
 can’t replicate 
– Specialist teams quick to recognise new areas of demand 
– Long-standing, genuine relationships, we know who  
 is ready to move 
– Innovative marketing campaigns like ‘Pulang Kampung’  
 see page 30
INDUSTRY TREND 1
KEY TRENDS STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Annual Report and Accounts 2017  Robert Walters plc 9
 
RPO GROWTH
The RPO market, according to leading market research agency  
Nelson Hall, is predicted to grow by 15% annually through to  
2019. Growth is being driven by increased globalisation of the  
workforce as organisations increasingly look for one integrated 
provider with global solutions. Companies are also looking 
to benefit from best practice, economies of scale, global 
standards and measurement as well as a drive for greater 
efficiency across supplier relationships. Whilst cost saving  
is one key driver, this is now balanced with a desire for  
a higher quality candidate experience.
KEY DRIVERS 
– Increasing globalisation of the workforce 
– Organisations moving from multiple outsourcing partners  
 to smaller numbers 
– Demand for global technology platforms to provide  
 common HR standards 
– Blended service requirement: where business partners  
 feed requests to lower cost sourcing centres
OUR RESPONSE 
– First recruitment business to set up an outsourcing  
 arm in 1997 
– Client dedicated service with quality focus: ability  
 to deliver total talent management 
– Cutting edge, proprietary software TalentSource:  
 our end-to-end talent management platform 
– Global service centres in Manchester, Hyderabad,  
 Johannesburg, Jacksonville and Manila
 
SPECIALISATION
Businesses are looking for ever more specialist skill-sets.  
In particular, the rise of digitalisation and changes in technology  
are driving growth in professional skills-sets and new disciplines  
of expertise. The marketing function is a good example of this  
with a shift in demand from general marketers to digital 
specialists and now, niche roles like Pay Per Click (PPC),  
Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) and retargeting specialists 
are increasingly common. The proliferation of digital channels 
is also driving demand for niche technology skills like robotic 
process automation, cyber security, artificial intelligence (AI) 
and business intelligence.
KEY DRIVERS 
– Disruptive technologies and innovation 
– New industry and sector creation e.g. big data 
– Rise in financial technology (fintech) driving demand  
 for hybrid skills 
– Switch from generalists to channel experts 
–  Regulation driving demand for compliance, risk, audit  
 and legal experts
OUR RESPONSE 
– Strategy of discipline diversification 
– Agile approach – able to quickly build new teams  
 and replicate across our business 
– Sector specialists who’ve worked in industry, deep  
 understanding of client/candidate needs 
– Relationship driven network means we are able to  
 work across geographies to relocate specialist talent

STRATEGIC PRIORITIES
RESILIENT BUSINESS MODEL
Entering markets at the right time 
There are no shortages of opportunities 
to enter new markets and develop new 
disciplines, it is always a question of timing 
and management. A new market or new 
discipline must represent a long-term 
growth opportunity for the Group and 
secondly, the right management must  
be in place to ensure we effectively 
maintain and grow our Robert Walters 
Group culture.
Identifying new markets 
Local senior management have 
responsibility for identifying new market 
and new discipline opportunities and are 
required to present a clear business case 
to the Board for approval. The Group has 
benefited greatly over the years from early 
entry and accelerated growth in new and 
developing recruitment markets, where 
first mover advantage can be beneficial. 
This will remain a key focus point of our 
strategy moving forward. 
Organic growth 
Organic growth is critical to how we 
drive sustainable and profitable growth. 
By focusing on long-term, international 
careers we are able to effectively embed 
our culture in new territories. By promoting 
our international mobility programme we  
encourage successful staff to move around  
the world, building new businesses and 
strengthening existing ones.
Whilst we often move people from existing 
offices to open in new markets, we quickly 
build local teams and develop them through 
the business to become directors. 
INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION  
Driving growth through expansion into  
new geographic locations is essential to 
our strategy. Our growth is largely organic 
with the Group only having made four 
market-entry acquisitions in its  
32-year history. 
DISCIPLINE DIVERSIFICATION   
Growing the business through building 
scale in existing disciplines and launching 
new disciplines in response to market 
changes is a key focus. We choose new 
markets and disciplines that represent  
a long-term growth opportunity.
The Group’s strategy for growth is centred on organic 
international expansion and discipline diversification, 
ensuring a balanced footprint covering mature and 
developing markets.
ORGANIC GROWTH 
STRATEGY
WE FEEL WE HAVE THE RIGHT 
BLEND OF A STRUCTURED

AND AGILITY, TO MAXIMISE

WHEN THEY ARISE.

PEOPLE AND CULTURE
Darren Cox was a key strategic 
hire for the Group during the year.  
He gives us his vision for developing 
the Group’s people strategy and 
an insight into our culture. 
“The culture here is strong and distinctive. 
You feel it quickly as soon as you meet 
the people. Their energy is contagious 
and everyone is hungry to achieve more. 
Hungry, yet still humble. We’re pretty 
self-effacing, given our success, and that 
was a key reason I joined the business.
Relationships matter here. Every single 
day consultants are focused on building 
real, deep connections with clients and 
candidates and that reflects internally.  
It makes for a positive working environment.  
Loyalty matters too; that’s unusual and 
a great asset. We have young directors 
who’ve been in the business for  
15-20 years.
We’re growing rapidly and it’s important 
to retain our strengths as we become 
a bigger organisation. I see my role as 
helping the business take this unique 
culture forward, to ensure it’s ready  
to meet the challenges of our next 
growth phase.  
One of my focuses will be connecting 
our staff to the meaningfulness of what 
we do, beyond the services we provide.  
Articulating our purpose clearly will help 
build deeper and longer commitment 
from our people and help us attract the 
highest quality people to join us. 
Values will be important too. Focusing 
on the behaviours that make our 
environment special, reminding us 
what’s important so we can replicate 
them effectively at greater scale.  
We have smart, strong people who are  
passionate about success but still care.  
Importantly, we’re open minded, with  
a very different perspective. It’s a belief  
in continuous improvement – an innovation  
mindset if you like. We always think we can  
be better. That’s a great springboard for  
further growth and success.”
THERE’S PASSION TO ACHIEVE 
BUT THERE’S PERSPECTIVE  
TOO. WHAT MATTERS IN THE  
LONG TERM IS RELATIONSHIPS;  
SO OUR PEOPLE CARE  
AND THE ENVIRONMENT  
IS CONSTRUCTIVE.

GLOBAL CAREERS 
Moving successful people internationally 
is a key motivator for staff and supports 
our organic growth strategy. Over 190 staff 
have transferred internationally in the last 
five years, many making several moves. 
Providing a career path into management 
is something we’ve been good at and is 
the reason our culture is deeply embedded 
throughout our business.
WORKING IN TEAMS 
Whilst an individual’s contribution is critical,  
everyone gets rewarded as a team – it’s at 
the heart of our business. Our specialist  
recruiters don’t receive individual commission 
and that’s key to attracting the right people 
who work to deliver for clients.  
FRIENDSHIP AND COMMUNITY  
The importance we place on relationships 
with clients and candidates flows through 
to our relationships within the business. 
Friendship facilitates cross border working,  
allowing candidates to be shared globally  
and makes for a positive working environment.  
Giving back to our communities is a given; 
we don’t have to mandate people to take 
part, they love to do it. 
FAST TRACK DEVELOPMENT 
Progression is based on performance  
with clear opportunities to develop. To aid  
senior staff retention we encourage senior 
management to participate in equity 
incentive programmes. 
HOME-GROWN MANAGEMENT TEAM 
By giving opportunities for career growth 
we’ve built a successful home-grown 
management team. Encouraging long-term 
development is key to our success and the 
average tenure of our senior management 
team is currently over 13 years. 
MAXIMISING PRODUCTIVITY 
THROUGH DEVELOPMENT  
Through continuous training we focus on 
maximising our consultants’ productivity 
across the globe. It’s essential that new 
consultants, disciplines and offices become 
productive and profitable as quickly as 
possible. We do this through desk-side 
support, effective systems and first-class 
training.
OUR EMPLOYER BRAND
Realising the potential of our people and attracting 
the best talent enables our strategy of international 
expansion and discipline diversification. Our employer 
brand is at the heart of our growth strategy.

our Belgian business. Over the next few 
years I became a true business partner 
to Alain Mlanao, managing director of 
Walters People in Paris.   
MOVING TO AUSTRALIA 
Upon joining the Group I’d flagged that  
I was open to an international move and  
in 2012 the opportunity arose to become  
Finance Manager for Australia and New 
Zealand. I moved first to ensure it was 
the right decision and my family joined 
me a few months later. 
Life was fantastic in Australia. It was such  
a different market and with a high volume  
of niche, boutique recruiters, making  
fees was a very different proposition  
– I relished the chance to improve my  
commercial and business understanding.  
With a bigger finance team I could spend 
more time with managers explaining the 
impact of their role on profit/loss and 
the bonus pool.
MOVING TO JAPAN 
After three happy years in Australia  
I was offered the chance to take on the  
finance director role in Japan. So in 2015  
I moved to Tokyo. Every day is different 
and I’m really enjoying a role where I’m 
a business partner with David Swan, 
managing director for Japan and Korea.”

BUSINESS IN ACTION
“There’s been a real maturing of 
the RPO market across the world, 
particularly in the UK, with quality 
becoming a much bigger driver  
for clients.
Whilst cost saving remains important, 
many are now moving away from 
decisions purely based on costs.  
What we’re now seeing is a growing 
trend towards using onshore locations 
or moving overseas operations back 
home; benefiting both Resource 
Solutions and the Robert Walters 
recruitment business.
As part of the increased emphasis on 
quality, total talent acquisition came to  
the fore as clients looked more holistically  
at their hiring strategy. The idea is to give  
candidates the same experience whether 
they’re applying for a temporary or 
permanent position; with the added 
efficiency of building one talent pool. 
Whereas many competitors focus on 
either temporary or permanent hiring  
(MSP & RPO) we’ve been well placed 
to support businesses with our big 
picture focus on all forms of outsourced 
recruitment and added value service.
We have built a strong reputation for 
delivery and established high levels of  
trust; rarely losing a client. Balancing 
growth whilst maintaining our quality 
reputation is critical to our strategy. 
Remaining close to clients has been 
fundamental to our success. Not just 
through formal processes like quarterly 
business reviews but talking to clients at 
industry roundtables and regular events. 
Innovation also helps us cement client 
relationships and we are their ‘go-to’ 
source for all new recruitment innovations. 
We’ve trialled over 100 technologies and 
implemented numerous new tools for 
some of our biggest clients. It’s a real 
differentiator. 
We offer a one hundred per cent client 
focused model, understanding each 
organisation’s needs and building around 
them: it’s completely bespoke.”

  Balanced blend of 
recruitment businesses: 
 
– Permanent

 Built two premium but very  
 distinct offerings alongside  
 our permanant recruitment  
 business to adapt to market  
 conditions of the last  
 ten years:
 ROBERT WALTERS INTERIM  
 MANAGEMENT 
 Interim professionals are senior 
 executives, capable of leading  
 significant business change,  
 including mergers/takeovers,  
 business process engineering  
 or crisis. We know which high  
 level candidates are available,  
 often proposing them within  
 24 hours and placing them  
 with clients in under a week. 
 WALTERS PEOPLE 
 We specialise in the recruitment  
 of temporary and temporary to  
 permanent employees for financial 
  and business support positions.  
 The success of Walters People  
 is a direct result of our consultants’  
 energy and dedication to finding  
 the right match between client  
 and candidate in the shortest time.
ACCELERATED GROWTH 
ACROSS EUROPE
Against this backdrop we spotted an 
opportunity to adapt by offering greater 
employment flexibility to our clients through  
Interim Management at Robert Walters 
and Contracting via Walters People.
FIVE-STAR CANDIDATE SERVICE  
Candidates are at the heart of our 
business. We give them a premium 
service and every consultant is dedicated 
to putting candidates first. This means 
we have exceptional people to offer  
our clients.
Our consultants’ specialist focus is  
a core principle and means we can  
offer candidates a high level of service. 
Their expertise gives them credibility – 
the majority having worked in the areas 
they recruit. Candidates find that they 
are working with a peer, someone who 
really understands them. 
EMPLOYER OF CHOICE 
We have encouraged teamwork and 
diversity, becoming a Great Place to Work  
in France during 2014 – retaining the award  
to date. We also became a Great Place 
to Work in the Netherlands in 2016. 
Initiatives like these have enabled  
us to attract the best employees.
SIGNS OF CHANGE 
Europe is facing talent shortages now 
that confidence is rising. We’ve seen years 
of understaffing so we’re well-placed 
with our market-leading brand, strong 
candidate relationships and exceptional 
staff to provide businesses with the 
professionals they need.” 
 
“Europe has faced tough economic conditions during a large part of 
the last ten years, together with increasing regulation. It’s an incredibly 
diverse market too, a patchwork of strong identities. 
ANTOINE MORGAUT 
CEO, EUROPE AND  
SOUTH AMERICA
WE ARE GRATEFUL TO OUR 
PEOPLE FOR COMMITTING  
SO MUCH OF THEIR TALENT

OF EUROPE BELONGS  
TO THEM. STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Annual Report and Accounts 2017  Robert Walters plc 21
It’s been exciting to see the market change over the past  
ten years. Interim management used to be considered the last  
career step for senior professionals before retirement, but now 
we are seeing younger managers taking on interim roles to 
diversify their careers with new responsibilities they wouldn’t 
necessarily have in a permanent job. 
One of the keys to our success has been the client focus 
I’ve instilled in the team. I’ve taught them to always challenge 
themselves and to never take anything for granted. We never  
assume that a client will be loyal to us – we are always offering 
outstanding service. Determination is key as our team know 
that we never give up on a client.”
In the early days, we focused on finance and accounting roles  
in Amsterdam. Today we’ve grown from three consultants to  
over 50, spread across three offices and six specialist divisions. 
One thing we’ve done well is anticipating market trends.  
We recognised that temp candidates were becoming more  
scarce so we decided to add value to our service by launching  
Walters People Academy. It’s an e-learning platform where our  
candidates can benefit from free educational programmes 
– in finance, languages and other areas. The platform also 
allows temps to test their skills. It’s something that makes 
candidates want to work with us because we’re giving 
something back.
We are always challenging our people to change their mindset 
– instead of focusing on what you can get, focus on what you 
can give to a candidate or client.”
“I joined Robert Walters in 2004 to help build the new  
interim management division in France. I’ve always  
been convinced by the potential of interim 
management as a new working model. 
“I joined Walters People in 2010 and was excited 
by the opportunity to grow a business within the 
context of a multinational company.

Canada represents a strong, long-term growth 
opportunity for the Group. In this heavily commission-
driven market our non-commission and quality  
driven approach is a key differentiator.
ENTERING A  
NEW MARKET STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Annual Report and Accounts 2017  Robert Walters plc 25
It had always been my ambition to  
open the Group’s business in Canada 
and I initially came to gather market 
intelligence in 2015. Realising the extent 
of the opportunity I moved back home 
to Toronto in 2016 to soft launch the 
business.   
Accounting and finance was my first focus  
as the number of accounting firms here  
is significant and my personal network 
was financial services focused. Common  
to other Robert Walters start-ups we were  
very stringent about the roles we took 
on within our launch discipline; only 
working on permanent roles at qualified 
level and above.
This focused approach helps build 
reputation, especially in a market with  
a small town feel. People place a high 
value on personal recommendations 
here so quality and delivery are critical. 
We built a very qualified database of 
candidates and leveraged my personal 
network to place them. 
 
 
We soon had a very high fill rate so I 
started growing the team. Jon joined  
us from our London business, Emily from  
our Wellington office and I also hired  
locally. Now we’re recruiting accountants  
into commerce and are also moving 
qualified lawyers and accountants  
into compliance roles. 
The market here is exclusively 
commission-driven and because our 
approach is just so different with our 
team-based bonus structure, it actually 
shocks candidates and clients. 
For candidates it builds trust; they know 
we won’t force them into an unsuitable job  
as that’s not how we get paid. We build 
longer and stronger relationships as a 
result and candidates refer others to us.  
Clients really appreciate that they have a 
whole team working on their roles, not just 
the person they met initially. The market 
is immature compared to the size of the 
city so when we send a small selection  
of well prepared candidates and save 
them huge amounts of time, clients 
appreciate our quality approach.”
“I guess I’m a good advert for the Group’s internal mobility programme 
having worked in Dublin, London and now back home in Canada. It’s been  
an amazing experience and I’ve grown my career from a team support 
role in Dublin, following my political science degree, through to setting 
up our Canadian operation in just ten years.

THE LOCAL/GLOBAL 
BALANCE STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Annual Report and Accounts 2017  Robert Walters plc 27
A LOCAL AND  
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 
The key to our success has been building 
the right mix of local and international staff.  
When I joined I identified two Thai 
nationals with fantastic leadership 
potential, Punyanuch Sirisawadwattana 
and Natiya Saul. Punyanuch was a 
manager and is now the director of HR, 
commerce finance, IT and banking, and 
Natiya was a senior consultant who is now  
director of sales and marketing, supply 
chain and procurement. The three of us 
have built the business together. 
Bringing in the Robert Walters culture 
was important too. I hired Eric Mary from  
our Paris business as a senior consultant.  
Crucially, the Thai nationals managed 
the international staff. This attracted a 
lot of outstanding local people to work 
for the business as they knew they could 
have an advanced career with us. It’s a 
very different approach.
Hiring open minded international staff has 
been critical to our success. The Thai  
Buddhist culture is very specific and 
unique so willingness to adapt is key. 
A lot more international recruiters are 
coming into the market now but our 
nuanced local knowledge gives us  
the edge. 
BUILD, REPLICATE MODEL 
At the start we had a strong focus on 
HR recruitment, which opened a lot of 
doors and made a big difference to our 
bottom line. Following the successful 
Robert Walters model we’ve focused 
on existing specialisations, getting to 
critical mass before launching new 
disciplines. We’re set to open another 
new specialisation in 2018.“
“I’m originally from Belgium and after my Masters degree worked in 
Switzerland, India and Japan. I quickly learnt that building businesses 
in growth markets was what motivated me. Robert Walters’ reputation 
for very early entry into emerging markets attracted me to the Group 
and through my network I met Matt Bennett, managing director of our 
Greater China region. Matt recommended me to the South East Asia 
business and in 2013 I moved to Thailand to manage the office.

LONG-TERM, HONEST 
RELATIONSHIPS STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Annual Report and Accounts 2017  Robert Walters plc 29
The Group put their faith in me with  
the relocation from London to Sydney 
and supported my career progression.  
In 2006, I became director of the 
Sydney business and in 2007 took on 
responsibility for Australia as a whole.
The region has maintained constant 
growth without the peaks and troughs 
of other geographies and recruitment 
margins are amongst the lowest in the 
world. The market is relatively small too 
and with limited barriers to entry it’s been 
flooded with new entrants, targeting our 
business streams.  
To succeed we’ve had to be very focused.  
For example, with reducing volumes at 
the big banks we switched emphasis to  
boutique fund managers. SMEs have been  
a large growth area too and we’ve found 
rich seams of niche roles across legal, 
procurement and IT. We will only recruit  
specialist positions where we can maintain 
a price differential.
The right management structure has been  
critical and the team’s longevity of tenure  
has helped enormously. My key front and  
back office staff have worked with me 
for over 12 years and it’s a team I can 
absolutely rely on. The stable team  
has provided a platform for growth.
HONEST RELATIONSHIPS 
The strength of the team has helped  
us maintain long-term relationships with 
clients and the critical success factor has  
been our honest approach. We aren’t 
afraid to explain the cost base of 
supplying labour and that we can only 
do so at a certain price point. Clients 
respect that and value the service.
Our key difference is the consultative 
advice and insights we give clients and 
candidates. Robert Walters’ consultants 
are specialists; most have worked in the 
fields they recruit and understand the 
market in depth because we don’t leave 
during difficult conditions. Our focus  
is beyond earning a dollar.”

OUR APPROACH 
Sustainability has always been at the 
heart of the Group. The business started 
with the ambition of creating a fulfilling 
environment for our people to work in and 
instilling a belief in doing recruitment the 
right way. We are particularly proud that 
so many of our people stayed with us, 
developing their careers for the long term; 
helping to grow our business across the  
globe. And we’ve always focused on 
building relationships for the long term,  
both with clients and candidates. 
Everything we do is about delivering 
organic, sustainable growth.
 Our four sustainability

 – Our people  
  Growing tomorrow’s leaders
 – Our clients & candidates  
  Relationships for the long term
 – Communities & charity

COMMUNITIES AND CHARITY 
Our approach is to keep charity and 
community initiatives relevant to our local 
communities, building on the strengths  
of our people and making them integral  
to our business. 
Everyone has the opportunity to give back 
through a variety of programmes, from 
Volunteering Day, Global Charity Day, 
Global Angels Volunteering Programme 
and other initiatives, whether that’s helping 
underprivileged children, preparing the 
long-term unemployed for interviews  
or providing food and supplies to those  
in need.
Commitment to our local communities 
continued during the year with a wide variety  
of activities taking place across the world.  
In total the Group made charitable donations 
of £164,000 (2016: £57,000).
Some highlights across the Group include:
Our Belgian business supported SOS 
Children’s Villages, an organisation helping  
families at risk and children without parental  
care. The business helped to make the 
SOS Homes look their best and they also  
participated in a wide range of activities, 
from bake sales to marathons to help  
raise funds.
In France, our consultants volunteered  
their time working with Opération Coup de  
Pouce to help the long-term unemployed  
improve their CVs and interview skills. 
Similarly, in Spain our team worked 
with Fundación Atresmedia running 
pre-employment workshops and mock 
interviews to help students prepare for  
the job market. 
Australia’s long-term partnership with 
Dress for Success, a charity helping 
women achieve economic independence, 
continued and our consultants led two 
employment workshops per month.
In South Africa, our team supported 
Cotlands, a not-for-profit organisation 
creating access to play-based, early learning  
opportunities for underprivileged children.  
On Mandela Day staff from the Johannesburg  
office took a group of children to the zoo 
and also volunteered at Cotlands’ annual 
sports day. 
Throughout 2017 our team in San Francisco 
supported the Redwood Empire Food Bank  
by donating much needed food and supplies.  
In New Zealand, staff volunteered their time 
once a month to make school lunches 
for underprivileged children who would 
otherwise go without. 
Our Japan staff and their families 
participated in the FIT For Charity Run.  
FIT (Financial Industry in Tokyo) supports 
local community organisations which  
serve important but not necessarily well 
recognised or understood causes.
GLOBAL CHARITY DAY 
Staff in every country also participated 
in our sixth annual Global Charity Day 
on Friday 13 October 2017, setting a 
new fundraising record by raising over 
£134,000 (2016: £113,000) through a 
display of creativity, fun and teamwork. 
The fundraising activities took a variety of 
forms. Staff from Resource Solutions in the 
UK tested their stamina by taking part in 
treadmill marathons, a bicycle lap around 
London and a 100km triathlon in aid of 
Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH). 
Meanwhile, the director of our New Zealand 
business bravely volunteered to shave 
his head to raise funds for KidsCan, an 
organisation that provides underprivileged 
children in New Zealand with food, clothing 
and healthcare so they can focus on their 
education.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
In Germany, our teams in Frankfurt and  
Düsseldorf volunteered to collect and 
distribute food donations to local people  
in need and staff in Ireland held their own  
‘Great Irish Bake Off’ in aid of the Capuchin  
Day Centre for Homeless People. In Australia, 
our teams organised coffee and cake sales 
and a lawn bowls competition in support  
of Dress for Success.
The Netherlands team held a bake sale, 
raffle and charity run to raise money for 
Hotel Heppie, a place where socially 
disadvantaged and disabled children  
can relax and enjoy a holiday.
Prior to charity day itself, a group of staff 
visited Hotel Heppie where they made lunch 
and ran a soccer clinic for the children. 
Staff from both Walters People and Robert  
Walters in Belgium volunteered their practical  
skills, including baking, gardening and 
painting to help local SOS Children’s Villages.
Across China, staff raised funds to support 
the Suzhou Shancheng Public Welfare 
Association. In Shanghai, staff secured 
sponsorships from a local coffee shop and 
florist, giving staff the opportunity to learn 
new skills in coffee making and flower 
arranging in exchange for donations. Staff in 
Korea took the opportunity to try new skills 
by raising money for Anna’s House, which 
cares for homeless children and adults, 
through candle and perfume making 
workshops. 
GLOBAL ANGELS 
Aligned with our purpose as a business, 
our CSR and sustainability strategy aims to 
transform people’s lives. Particularly those 
who’ve had less opportunity than we have.
In 2016 we chose a Group Charity Partner 
to bring greater focus to our work in the 
community. The Global Angels Foundation 
is a small, international development  
 
 
 
 
 
organisation transforming disadvantaged  
communities around the world, with a focus  
on bringing water, education and social 
empowerment. 
Our partnership has focused on 
empowering a small community in the Itinyi 
Valley in Tsavo, Kenya and we aim to work 
with the same community over the next 
five to ten years, building relationships  
for the long term.
This year we’ve donated a new classroom 
to the local secondary school, where children  
were previously taught outside under a tree.  
We have also funded a large scale shade  
house. The shade house protects crops  
from the harsh sun, allowing the community  
to grow crops with a much reduced water 
intake – critical in a drought prone region.
As well as providing financial support we 
are also giving our time by sending eight 
staff a year on volunteering trips to Tsavo. 
Our teams have already worked hard to dig  
the foundations for our classroom and 
helped build our shade netting project.
The volunteering trips have been an excellent 
way to engage staff in our charitable work 
and highlight our purpose of transforming 
lives. The response to this opportunity has 
been incredible with huge numbers of staff 
from all around the world applying to  
take part.
DIVERSITY 
Diversity is at our heart in such an 
international business. We are an equal 
opportunities employer and aim to provide  
a working environment and culture that values  
difference – a diverse workforce allows us  
to fully realise the Group’s potential right 
across the globe. Our diversity policy forms 
a part of our staff induction programme. 
Diversity is as critical an issue for our 
candidates and clients as it is for our  
own staff. 
 
 
 
 
All candidates are encouraged to complete 
an equal opportunities form on registration, 
the data from which is important to both the  
Group and our clients to ensure we are 
introducing candidates from the widest 
possible talent pool and helping clients  
fulfil their own diversity programmes. 
We are proud to partner with OUTstanding. 
OUTstanding is a not-for-profit professional 
network for lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender (LGBT+) executives and  
their ally leaders.
The Group is also partnering with ENEI 
(Employers Network for Equality and 
Inclusion) to push best practice forward.

GENDER EQUALITY 
In accordance with the Companies Act 
2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report) Regulations 2013, the Group  
has provided the table above.
The Board has a policy to encourage 
diversity, including gender. On 1 January 
2014, the Board implemented a policy to  
ensure that there will be an equal gender 
quota for any future long list for a Board 
appointment. The appointment of Tanith 
Dodge as a Non-executive Director 
demonstrates this policy in action.  
We are also pleased to welcome  
Carol Hui as our new Chairman.
Gender Pay Gap Reporting UK 
We support gender equality and will publish 
our UK gender pay gap on 4 April 2018. 
The data will feature on our UK website  
and we will publish our commitments  
to close any gender pay gaps we have. 
ENVIRONMENT 
The Board recognises its responsibilities in  
respect of social, environmental and ethical  
(SEE) matters and monitors all significant 
risks to the Group, including SEE risks, which  
may impact the Group’s short and long-term 
value. During 2017, no significant SEE risks 
were identified.
Although our impact on the environment  
is minimal as an office-based organisation, 
we are fully carbon balanced and have been  
for three years. That means we’re investing 
in projects that offset emissions through 
reforestation initiatives. The whole of Robert 
Walters’ Group operations have been fully 
carbon balanced since 2015, through a 
partnership with the Woodland Trust and  
a Carbon Balanced programme in Vietnam 
via World Land Trust.
The Group is active in working towards 
the achievement of local Environmental 
Management Systems. In 2017, 24% of 
the Group’s employees worldwide were 
operating in locations which were certified 
to ISO14001, the International Standard for 
Environmental Management. The Standard 
provides a framework for achieving the 
balance between enhancing profitability 
while setting targets for improving the 
organisation’s environmental performance.
The London office has been undertaking 
an environmental initiative throughout 2017  
to reduce purchased electricity and heat. 
This has been achieved by new and 
innovative programming strategies of the 
building management system to maximise 
efficiency of the air conditioning system 
and to make best use of free cooling. 
The initiative culminated in a 31% carbon 
reduction whilst also improving comfort 
levels for staff in the office.
Greenhouse gas reporting 
In September 2013, the Mandatory Carbon 
Reporting requirements prescribed by the  
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Directors’ 
Regulations Report came into effect. This 
section includes our mandatory reporting 
of greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to 
the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013 
(the Regulations).
Reporting year 
The greenhouse gas emissions report 
has been prepared based on a reporting 
year of 1 January to 31 December 2017, 
which is the same as the Group’s financial 
reporting period.
Reporting boundary 
The Group’s report is based on all entities 
and offices which are either owned or under  
operational control globally.
Methodology and scope 
The methodology used to calculate 
the Group’s emissions is based on the 
‘Environmental Reporting Guidelines: 
including mandatory greenhouse gas 
emissions reporting guidance’ (June 2013) 
issued by the Department for Environment, 
Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). The Group  
has also utilised DEFRA’s 2017 conversion 
factors within the reporting methodology.
The greenhouse gas emissions data  
has been prepared with reference to GHG 
protocol, which categorises greenhouse gas  
emissions into three scopes. Reporting on  
emissions from Scope 1 (direct GHG 
emissions) and Scope 2 (indirect GHG 
emissions) activities is mandatory.  
The reporting of Scope 3 (other indirect 
emissions from sources not owned or 
controlled by the Company) emissions is 
voluntary and therefore the Group reports 
on all those Scope 3 activities which it feels 
have a significant impact on its greenhouse 
gas emissions. 
All other Scope 3 activities have been 
considered but the Group feels that the 
impact of these was so limited as to be 
negligible and has decided not to disclose 
these activities within this report. This 
decision will be reviewed on an annual 
basis or sooner if changes are made to 
regulatory reporting requirements.
Intensity metric 
The Group has recorded the total global 
emissions, in tonnes of CO
2
e, and has 
decided to use an intensity metric of tonnes 
of CO
2
e per head, which the Group believes  
is the most relevant indication of our growth 
and provides the best comparative 
measure over time.
Global greenhouse gas emissions data 
The table on page 40 shows the total global 
emissions, in tonnes of CO
2
e and tonnes of 
CO
2
e per head for the Group. 
Base year 
The 2013 financial year was the base year 
for the Group’s greenhouse gas reporting, 
being the first year the Group completed  
a global calculation.
The base year has been recalculated for 
changes to the scope of operation and 
measurements, including any additions to 
measured Scope 3 data. The base year and  
previous year’s data are also recalculated  
if better quality data for the previous year  
is identified.

Reducing carbon  
The Group set a target to reduce the 
mandatory Scope 1 and 2 CO
2
e emissions 
per head by 20% across the Group by 2023,  
from a Full Year 2013 baseline.
The Group’s Scope 1 and 2 mandatory 
emissions per head are down to 1.00 from 
the 2013 base year revised number of 1.37, 
a decrease of 27%, meeting the target set 
in 2013 six years early.
The Group actively seeks to reduce the 
carbon footprint of the business through:
– Consulting closely with the Carbon Trust  
 and considering its recommendations  
 as environmental objectives;
– Establishing objectives for minimising  
 travel to that which is totally necessary;  
 and
– Offsetting carbon emissions through   
 accredited reforestation schemes  
 covering the UK and Asia Pacific.
HUMAN RIGHTS  
AND ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR 
The Group respects all human rights and in 
conducting its business the Group regards 
those rights relating to non discrimination, 
fair treatment and respect for privacy to be 
the most relevant and to have the greatest 
potential impact on its key stakeholder 
groups of clients, candidates, employees 
and suppliers.
The Board has overall responsibility for 
ensuring the Group upholds and promotes 
respect for human rights. The Group seeks 
to anticipate, prevent and mitigate any 
potential negative human rights impacts  
as well as enhance positive impacts through  
its policies and procedures and, in particular, 
through its policies regarding employment, 
equality and diversity. Group policies seek 
both to ensure that employees comply with 
all applicable legislation and regulation and 
to promote good practice.
The Group’s policies are formulated and 
kept up to date by the relevant business 
areas, authorised by the Board and 
communicated to all employees.
The Group has a zero tolerance approach 
to bribery and corruption and has specific 
processes in place to prevent it. The Group’s  
Anti-Bribery Policy (with specific reference  
to the Bribery Act) is issued to all employees.  
The Anti-Bribery Policy is reviewed annually 
to ensure that it is current.
The Group is aware of the new UK Modern 
Slavery Act 2015 and will comply with its 
obligations under it. In respect of actions 
taken during the year, we believe that we  
operate a supply chain with a very low 
inherent risk of slavery and human trafficking 
potential. As such, over and above our 
normal operating procedures, we have 
taken no specific steps in this regard.
The Group undertakes extensive 
monitoring of the implementation of all of 
its policies and has not been made aware  
of significant breaches of policy or any 
incident in which the organisation’s activities 
have resulted in an abuse of human rights.
HEALTH AND SAFETY 
The Chief Executive has overall 
responsibility for the implementation of  
the Group’s health and safety policy, with  
specific operational responsibility delegated 
to managers at each location. Every effort 
is made to ensure that all national safety 
requirements are met at all times and there 
were no notable injuries or health and 
safety issues identified during the year.
POLITICAL DONATIONS 
The Group made no political donations 
during the year (2016: £nil).
FTSE4GOOD INDEX 
The Group has held FTSE4Good status  
since 2008. FTSE4Good index inclusion  
criteria covers a number of corporate 
responsibility themes, such as environmental  
management, climate change, countering 
bribery and supply chain labour standards.  
Our continued inclusion in the index 
recognises that our policies and management  
systems enable us to address and mitigate 
key corporate responsibility risks.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Revenue
Revenue for the Group is the total income 
from the placement of permanent and 
contract staff, and therefore includes the 
remuneration costs of contract candidates 
and the total cost of advertising recharged 
to clients. It also includes outsourcing fees, 
consultancy fees and the margin derived 
from payrolling contracts charged by 
Resource Solutions to its clients.
Revenue increased 17% (14%*) to 
£1,165.8m (2016: £998.5m) with 51.7% 
(2016: 54.8%) of the annual total being 
generated in the second half of the year. 
Revenue from temporary placements 
represents 81% (2016: 83%) of revenue. 
The Group continues to focus on consultant 
productivity and hiring in the areas of the 
business where recruitment activity levels 
are increasing.
Gross profit (net fee income)
Net fee income is the total placement fees  
of permanent candidates, the margin earned 
on the placement of contract candidates 
and the margin from advertising. It also 
includes the outsourcing, consultancy and 
payrolling margin earned by Resource 
Solutions.
Net fee income for the year increased by 
24% (20%*) to £345.2m (2016: £278.3m). 
Net fee income was £180.7m in the 
second half compared to £164.5m in the 
first half (2016: 1H £128.1m, 2H £150.2m). 
The increase in net fee income was due 
to growth in both the permanent and 
temporary Robert Walters divisions and  
the Resource Solutions business.
Operating profit
Operating profit increased by 60% (54%*) to  
£41.9m (2016: £26.2m) and administrative 
expenses were £303.4m (2016: £252.1m). 
The principal reason for the 20% (15%*) 
increase in costs was due to an increase 
of 17% in the Group’s average headcount 
to 3,561 in 2017 , up from 3,032 during 2016.
Conversion ratio
Operating profit as a percentage of gross 
profit was 12.1%, an increase of 2.7%. 
Interest and financing costs
The Group incurred a net interest charge for  
the year of £0.5m (2016: £0.4m). The Group  
has a £45m four-year committed financing  
facility until December 2020. At 31 December  
2017, £30.2m (2016: £38.9m) was drawn 
down under this facility. The Group also 
has an outstanding loan of £0.6m which 
was used to finance the growth in working 
capital of our business in China. This 
Renminbi-denominated loan is secured 
by cash deposits in Hong Kong and is 
repayable in instalments over four years. 
The Group also has a non-recourse £15m 
facility. More details are provided in note 
13 to the accounts.
A foreign exchange loss of £0.9m arose 
during the year on translation of the Group’s 
intercompany trading accounts and external 
borrowings (2016: gain of £2.3m).
Taxation
The taxation charge in 2017 was £11.2m  
(2016: £8.2m) which gives an effective 
rate of 27.7% (2016: 29.3%). The tax rate 
is higher than the standard UK rate of 
19.25%, primarily as a result of higher rates 
of overseas taxation in Japan, Australia 
and France, the impact of adjustments 
to accounting profit in the tax calculation 
and disallowable entertainment. Over the 
medium term, other than governmental 
changes to corporation tax rates, the key 
factor affecting the effective tax rate is likely 
to be the mix of profits generated across 
low and high tax jurisdictions. 
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share were 42.9p 
(2016: 27.7p) and the weighted average 
number of shares for the year was 68.4m 
(2016: 71.9m).
Dividend 
A final dividend of 9.3p (2016: 6.2p) per 
ordinary share is being proposed by the 
Board. Together with the interim dividend 
of 2.75p (2016: 2.30p) per ordinary share 
paid in October 2017, the total dividend 
per share would amount to 12.05p (2016: 
8.50p). The final dividend, if approved,  
which amounts to £6.4m, will be paid  
on 1 June 2018 to those shareholders  
on the register as at 11 May 2018. 
Balance sheet
The Group had net assets of £121.8m at 
31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: 
£101.9m) including goodwill of £8.1m 
(2016: £8.1m). The increase in the Group 
net assets of £19.9m comprises profit for 
the year of £29.3m and credits relating to 
share schemes of £5.3m, offset primarily 
by shares repurchased for cancellation 
of £8.0m, dividends paid of £6.1m, own 
shares purchased for the Employee 
Benefit Trust of £1.8m and currency 
movements of £1.7m.
Cash flow and net cash position
At 31 December 2017 , the Group had net 
cash balances of £31.1m (31 December 
2016: £22.5m). Cash inflow from operating 
activities was £43.0m (2016: £37.2m). 
The significant payments made from 
operational cash flow were made up of 
£1 1.0m of corporation tax payments, £8.0m  
of share buy back for cancellation, £6.1m of  
dividends, £5.1m of fixed asset expenditure,   
£1.9m on computer software and £1.8m  
of own shares purchased. The Group had  
positive cash flows from operations and 
is currently well placed to meet future 
working capital cash requirements.
Surplus cash balances are invested with  
financial institutions with favourable credit 
ratings that offer competitive rates of return.
Subsidiary undertakings

principally affecting the profits or net assets 
of the Group in the year are listed in note 10

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS
The Board recognises the importance of identifying and actively monitoring the full range of financial and non-financial risks facing 
the business, at both a local and Group level. By regularly reviewing the risk profile of the business, the Board ensures that the risk 
exposure remains appropriate at any point in the cycle. The effectiveness of the risk management process is monitored by the Audit 
and Risk Committee. The process involves identifying and prioritising the key risks within the Group and developing and implementing 
appropriate mitigation strategies to address those risks.
We review our risks in terms of likelihood of occurrence and potential impact on the business and the Audit and Risk Committee reviews 
and considers the extent to which management has addressed the key risks through appropriate controls and actions to mitigate those 
risks. Each local management team continues to consider key risk areas on an ongoing basis with a specific periodic review at least 
once a year of their system of internal controls to ensure that each risk area is addressed within the business. The Internal Audit function 
reviews and tests the effectiveness of these controls to ensure that risk is being managed properly and effectively.
A summary of the key risks that we believe could potentially impact the Group’s operating and financial performance, together with 
associated key actions, is shown below:
Risk Actions to mitigate risk
Economic environment 
Job availability and the level of candidate 
confidence in the employment market are 
important factors in determining the total 
number of recruitment transactions in a given 
year. Candidates are less inclined to move 
jobs when the number of jobs available is 
stagnant or in decline, which could lead 
to a deterioration in the Group’s financial 
performance.
The Group is geographically diversified, spanning 28 countries, which reduces the  
reliance on the success of any particular market. The Group also continues to develop 
its contract and Resource Solutions businesses, both of which provide more resilient 
revenue streams in the event of an economic downturn. Historically, the Group has 
successfully diversified into other sectors to reduce its concentration risk in the event of  
a downturn.
The Board’s strategy when facing a slowdown in a market is to balance the cost base, 
such that the impact on profit is mitigated, against the perceived future benefit from the 
retention of key staff. Historically, the Group has benefited substantially from increased 
operational gearing as a result of its policy of deliberately retaining key staff through 
economic downturns.
People management
The Group relies heavily on recruiting and 
retaining talented individuals with the right 
skill-sets to grow the business. In addition, 
as the Group expands its operations in 
emerging markets the supply of people with 
the required skills in specific geographic 
regions may be limited. Failure to attract 
and retain key employees with the required 
sales, management and leadership skills may 
adversely affect the Group’s financial results.
The Group’s policy of linking bonuses to profitability in discrete operating units has a high 
correlation to the retention of efficient and effective members of staff.
The long-term incentive schemes that are detailed in note 18 to the accounts form 
a key part of a wider strategy to improve levels of staff retention, particularly of the 
Group’s senior employees.
Other elements of the strategy to improve staff retention and maximise career 
opportunities include significant investment of time and financial resources in employee 
training and development including regular weekly appraisals, aimed at core consultant 
competencies and focused on enhancing management potential. The Group’s culture 
and the associated processes help to increase productivity and also improve the 
employee’s alignment to the business. A comprehensive approach to succession 
planning is also in place across the Group.
The Group offers international career opportunities and actively encourages the 
redeployment of existing talent to international offices and also to establish new offices.
Business model 
Competition risk varies in each of the Group’s 
main regions depending on the maturity of the 
client and candidate market. The emergence 
of new technology platforms such as social 
media for recruitment purposes may also 
lead to increased competition.
The development of strong commercial relationships with clients has enabled the Group 
to win and then maintain its contracts with large global organisations and the Group 
also has a significant and diverse income stream across the SME marketplace.
The Group reviews and monitors changes in technology and social media trends to ensure  
that it evolves appropriately. The Group continues to promote itself as a relationship 
recruiter operating in specialised markets, ensuring its online presence is competitive 
and provides a high-quality customer experience.
Brand and reputation 
There is an inherent risk that the brand and 
reputation of the Group could be impacted 
by a failure to maintain high-quality service 
levels to both candidates and clients.
Quality control standards are maintained and reviewed for each stage of the recruitment 
cycle with all new employees receiving appropriate levels of training applicable to their role.
Candidate and client satisfaction surveys are carried out on a regular basis, with directors 
addressing any negative feedback directly with the client or candidate. A ‘Contact us’ 
email address is available on the Group’s website so any negative feedback or improper 
conduct can be acted upon swiftly by the Chief Marketing Officer and local senior 
management. STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Annual Report and Accounts 2017  Robert Walters plc 45
Risk Actions to mitigate risk
Laws and regulations  
The Group operates in a number of diverse 
jurisdictions and has to comply with numerous  
domestic and international laws and regulations,  
any change to which could have a detrimental 
effect on the Group’s financial performance.
To ensure compliance, our legal department works with leading external advisors as 
required to monitor potential changes in employment legislation across the markets  
in which we operate.
Contractual terms and conditions are thoroughly reviewed before signing to ensure 
contract provisions are fully understood and risks are fairly allocated between parties.
An escalation process exists such that contracts with non-standard terms are reviewed 
and approved by the Chief Legal Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate.
Technology
The Group is reliant on its technological 
infrastructure to maintain client and candidate 
data. A critical infrastructure or system disruption  
could have a material impact on the Group’s 
financial results, whilst a loss of confidential 
and competitive information can have an 
adverse impact on operations and the 
reputation of the Group.
The Group maintains a comprehensive IT security policy, which is reviewed on a regular 
basis, covering all areas of IT security from user access through to server access.
All sensitive candidate and client information is held securely with restricted access.
Appropriate guidance and training on the security and handling of both manual and 
electronic documents including confidential and sensitive data is provided to all staff.
The Group has a dedicated Chief T echnology Officer and Group Information Security Officer  
with specific remits to consider and ensure that appropriate and reasonable controls 
are put in place, particularly in respect of cyber-related threats and data breach.
The Group continues to review and improve its Business Continuity Plan to mitigate 
against any critical infrastructure disruptions.
Foreign exchange  
The Group operates under a number of 
functional currencies. The main functional 
currencies of the Group are Pounds Sterling, 
the Euro, Australian Dollars and Yen.  
Any unfavourable movements in the foreign 
exchange rates may have an adverse effect 
on translation of overseas operations, and 
subsequently the Group’s Pounds Sterling 
financial results.
Revenues and costs are in their functional currencies in the local entities, which minimises 
the Group’ s transactional exposure. Additionally, there are no material net foreign exchange 
exposures to monetary assets and monetary liabilities.
The Group continues to monitor the sensitivity to foreign currency fluctuations through 
performing regular sensitivity analysis and reducing exposure wherever possible.

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to report that your Company has again complied in full throughout the year with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
As a Board, we are pleased with the progress that the Group has made to ensure high standards of corporate governance are maintained. 
We monitor developments and trends in corporate governance both in the UK and internationally, adopting any emerging practice we feel 
would improve our governance whether or not it becomes mandatory.
One of our core values that is continually communicated within the Group is a belief that the highest standards of integrity are essential 
in business. As a Group, we have an expressed aim of respecting the needs of shareholders, employees, clients, candidates, 
contractors and suppliers.
The Board has a wide range of responsibilities and it is my duty to ensure it has the right mix of skills and talent and to ensure that it works 
effectively as a team towards shared goals. The Board has a policy to encourage diversity, which specifically requires an equal gender 
quota for any future long list for a Board appointment. I am pleased to announce that we have appointed our second female Director, 
Tanith Dodge, to the Board this year. 
The Board Committees have had a successful year. The Audit and Risk Committee continued to see significant improvements in all areas  
of risk management. We have again increased the resources within the Internal Audit function and expanded its breadth of scope with  
a continued focus on the Group’s risk register and overall risk profile of the Group. The Remuneration Committee has continued to engage 
with our shareholders, completing a comprehensive review of Executive Directors’ pay during the year and incorporating current  
best practice. 
A key aspect for ensuring your Board’s effectiveness is our annual Board and Committee evaluation process, which had a positive 
outcome. We will continue to look to enhance the positioning of the business and continue to adapt and improve the Group’s risk 
culture and framework.
On the following pages we describe our corporate governance framework in more detail.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
DIRECTORS’ REPORT Annual Report and Accounts 2017  Robert Walters plc 47
STRATEGIC REPORT
Statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
The Company has complied fully throughout the year ended 31 December 2017 with the Code provisions set out in the 2014 UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the Code).
The Board of Directors is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and has applied the principles set out in the Code,  
including the Main Principles, the Supporting Principles and the Provisions, by complying with the Code as reported above. Further explanation 
of how we integrate the Main Principles of the five sections of the Code into our business, these being: Leadership; Board Effectiveness; 
Relations with Shareholders; Accountability; and Remuneration, is set out below. Our principles and policy in relation to remuneration 
are covered separately in our Remuneration Report on pages 54 to 73. 
Leadership
The Board and its role
The Board is responsible to the Group’s shareholders for the conduct and performance of the Group’s business. Having strong governance 
processes and oversight helps drive the culture of the business so that it can better deliver on its responsibility to all of our stakeholders.
The Board has developed a Board governance framework which sets out the governance structure of the Board and its Committees. 
The Board considers that it has shown its commitment to leading and controlling the Group by:
–  Having a Board constitution which details the Board’s responsibility to the Group’s shareholders for the management of the Group’s 
affairs. It exercises direction and supervision of the Group’s operations throughout the world and defines the line of responsibility from 
the Board to the Chief Executive and the Executive Directors, in whom responsibility for the executive management of the business  
is vested;
–  The Board retaining specific responsibility for agreeing the strategic direction of the Group, the approval of accounts, business plan, 
budget and capital expenditure, the review of operating results, the effectiveness of governance practice and risk management,  
and also the appointment of senior executives and succession planning;
–  A high level of attendance by the Directors at the seven Board meetings held during the year;
–  The provision of appropriate training to all new Directors at the time of appointment to the Board, and by ensuring that existing 
Directors receive such training as to be equipped with the skills required to fulfil their roles; and
–   Delegating responsibilities to sub-Committees: Audit and Risk Committee; Remuneration Committee; and Nominations Committee.
Audit and Risk Committee
The Audit and Risk Committee’s primary focus is to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities. During the year the Committee  
met three times and reviewed the following:
– Half-year results and the annual financial statements;
– The effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls, internal audit and risk management;
–  The performance of the external auditor, their terms of engagement, the scope of the audit and audit findings including findings  
on key judgements and estimates in the financial statements; and
–  The opinions of management and the external auditor in relation to the appropriateness of the accounting policies adopted, significant 
estimates and judgements and whether disclosures were balanced and fair.
Further information on the work of the Committee during the year can be found on pages 51 to 53.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee met two times during the year and its activities included:
–  Monitoring the Board’s structure, size, composition and diversity to achieve a balanced and effective Board in terms of skills, 
knowledge and experience;
– Considering all aspects of the Board with regard to succession planning;
–  Engaging the assistance of Ridgeway as an external advisor, performing a detailed Board skills analysis and subsequently 
recommending Tanith Dodge for appointment as Non-executive Director;
– Reviewing the leadership needs and succession planning of the Group including identifying and developing talent;
– Recommending any changes in the membership of the Board Committees;
– Assessing potential conflicts of interest of all Directors; and
–  An annual review of progress achieved, including the diversity objectives of the Group to increase the level of female representation 
on the Board. Following the appointment of Tanith Dodge, two of the seven Board members are female. 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIRECTORS’ REPORT 48 Robert Walters plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee met three times during the year and its activities included:

–  Ensuring there was a smooth transition between the out-going Chairman, Andrew Kemp, and the incoming Chairman, Tanith Dodge,  
with a four-month handover period;
–  Designing and recommending a new framework for Executive remuneration, incorporating current guidance on best practice  
and in line with the tri-annual requirement for shareholder approval of the remuneration policy;
– Determining the individual remuneration packages for Executive Directors;
– Approving the targets and performance assessments for performance-related incentive schemes; and

3.  Tanith Dodge joined the Board as Non-executive Director on 1 February 2017 and became Chairman of the Remuneration Committee after the Annual General 
Meeting on 25 May 2017.
Division of responsibilities between Chairman and Chief Executive
The Board has shown its commitment to dividing responsibilities for the Board and running the Company’s business by keeping the roles  
of Chairman and Chief Executive separate. The roles are set out in writing and have been approved by the Board. The key responsibilities 
of the Chairman and Chief Executive are summarised below:
–  During the year, as Chairman, Leslie Van de Walle was responsible for leading the Board, its effectiveness and its integrity.  
The Chairman sets the tone for the Company, and ensures the links between the Board and shareholders are strong. 
–  As Chief Executive, Robert Walters is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Group’s operations, implementing  
Board approved strategic objectives and policies, and developing vision and strategy for the Board’s review and approval.
Board balance and independence
The Board comprises the Chairman, three Executive Directors and three independent Non-executive Directors. The Board annually reviews 
its composition to ensure there is an appropriate balance between Executive and Non-executive Directors and by promoting diversity  
ensures the Board has the appropriate mix of skills, experience and knowledge. The Group’s commitment to achieving a balance of Executive 
and Non-executive Directors is shown by:
– The Non-executive Directors comprising more than half of the Board of Directors; and
–  The Non-executive Directors Leslie Van de Walle, Brian McArthur-Muscroft, Carol Hui, Andrew Kemp and Tanith Dodge being considered 
to act independently of management and free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise 
of their independent judgement.
Senior Independent Director
The Board has appointed Carol Hui as the Senior Independent Director. Carol Hui is available to shareholders when they may have issues  
or concerns where contact through the normal channels of either the Chairman or the Executive Directors has failed to resolve concerns, 
or where contact is deemed inappropriate. 
Board effectiveness
Transparency of Board appointments
The Nominations Committee is responsible for nominating candidates to fill Board vacancies, considers the ongoing succession of the 
Board and its Committees and makes recommendations on Board composition and balance. The members of the Committee are the 
Non-executive Directors and Robert Walters. During the year, the Nominations Committee met to consider and approve the re-election 
of the remaining Directors at the May 2017 Annual General Meeting, including the appointment of Tanith Dodge as Non-executive 
Director to the Board and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT CONTINUED Annual Report and Accounts 2017  Robert Walters plc 49
STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIRECTORS’ REPORT
The Board has a policy to encourage diversity, including gender, and this was a focus of the Nominations Committee during the current 
year. The Board implemented a policy to ensure that there will be an equal gender quota for any future long list for a Board appointment. 
This has led to the appointment of our second female Director, Tanith Dodge, to the Board this year.
The Nominations Committee has written terms of reference which are available on request. The procedure for appointments to the Board 
includes the requirement to specify the nature of the position in writing and to ensure that appointees have sufficient time available to meet 
the demands of the position. The terms of the contracts for the Non-executive Directors are available upon request.
Understanding the business
The Board has sought to ensure that Directors are properly briefed on issues arising at Board meetings by establishing procedures for:
–  Distributing Board papers in advance of meetings in the appropriate form including detailed reports and presentations to enable  
the Board to discharge its duties;
–  Presentations on different aspects of the Company’s business from members of the Executive Committee or other members  
of senior management;
– The Non-executive Directors meet senior operational management around the time of the annual global senior management conference;
– Regularly reviewing financial plans, including budgets and forecasts; 
– Adjourning meetings or deferring decisions when Directors have concerns about the information available to them; and
–  Making the Company Secretary responsible to the Board for the timeliness and quality of information.
Professional development
On appointment, the Directors receive relevant information about the Group, the role of the Board and the matters reserved for its 
decision-making, the terms of reference and membership of the principal Board Committees and the powers delegated to those 
Committees, the Group’s corporate governance policies and procedures and the latest financial information about the Group. 
Throughout their period in office, the Directors are regularly updated on the Group’s business and the environment in which it operates,  
by written briefings and by meetings with senior executives, who are invited to attend and present at Board meetings from time to time. 
They are also updated on any changes to the legal and governance requirements of the Group and those which affect them as Directors 
and are able to obtain training, at the Group’s expense, to ensure they are kept up to date on relevant new legislation and changing 
commercial risks.
Performance evaluation 
In line with the Code, a formal and rigorous performance appraisal of the Board, its Committees, the Directors and the Chairman is conducted  
annually as we recognise that our effectiveness is critical to the Group’s continued success. This process includes a tailored questionnaire 
that specifically includes, among other areas, Board effectiveness on communication, strategic approach and risk assessment. 
In 2017 , a detailed review was completed by each Director and individual discussions took place between the Chairman and each of 
the Directors and, in the case of the Chairman’s performance and leadership, this was reviewed by the Senior Independent Director. 
Subsequently, there was a full Board discussion of the matters that were raised and a process to ensure that the decisions taken were 
appropriately implemented. Overall, the outcome of the evaluation process was very positive, with good progress noted on the areas  
of focus raised in previous evaluations. This process did not identify any material issues that needed to be addressed.
Regular re-election of Directors
In line with the recommendations of the Code, the Board has agreed to submit all Directors for annual election. As a result of their annual  
performance evaluation, the Board considers that their individual performances continue to be effective, with each Director demonstrating 
commitment to their role. The Board is therefore pleased to support the re-election of all Directors who wish to stay in office at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Succession planning 
A clear focus on career progression for employees is core to the Group’s growth and helps attract and retain talented individuals.  
The Group remains committed to maximising career opportunities through significant investment in training and professional development. 
Executive succession planning discussions were held in 2017 and a clear succession plan is in place for all Board members and their 
direct reports.
Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with institutional shareholders
The Directors seek to build on a mutual understanding of objectives between the Company and its institutional shareholders by:
– Making annual and interim presentations to institutional investors;
– Meeting shareholders to discuss long-term issues and obtain their views;
–  Providing direct access to the Chairman for regular meetings with shareholders, including an annual invitation to meet with  
the top ten shareholders;
– Communicating regularly throughout the year; and
–  Regular meetings of the Board being used as the forum to ensure that Non-executive Directors are updated on the views  
of major shareholders that have been communicated to the Executive Directors. 50 Robert Walters plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Constructive use of Annual General Meeting
The Board seeks to use the Annual General Meeting as an opportunity for all shareholders to question the Board and the Chairmen 
of the Board Committees on matters put to the meeting including the Annual Report. The Board seeks to encourage shareholder 
participation by:
– Inviting shareholders to submit questions in advance; and 
– Providing a balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’s position and prospects.
The results of voting at general meetings are published on the Company’s website, robertwalters.com/investors, as required by the Code.
Accountability
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control. A review has been completed by the Board for the 
year ended 31 December 2017 and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report. The Board’s monitoring covers all controls, including  
financial, operational, compliance controls and risk management. It is based primarily on reviewing reports from management to consider  
whether significant risks are identified, evaluated, managed and controlled and whether any significant weaknesses are promptly remedied  
and indicate a need for more extensive monitoring. The Audit and Risk Committee assists the Board in discharging its review responsibilities.  
During the course of its review of the system of internal control, the Board has not identified nor been advised of any failings or weaknesses 
which it has determined to be significant. 
The Group’s system of internal control is designed to safeguard the Group’s assets and to ensure the reliability of information used within 
the business and for publication. Such a system is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The full Board meets regularly and has a schedule of matters which are required to be brought to it or its duly authorised Committees 
for decision, aimed at maintaining full and effective control over appropriate strategic, financial, operational and compliance issues  
on an ongoing basis.
The Board has put in place an organisational structure with clearly defined responsibilities and delegation of authority. The Board constitution 
clearly sets out those matters for which the Board is required to give its approval. The Board delegates the implementation of the Board’s 
policy on risk and control to executive management and this is monitored by the Internal Audit function which reports back to the Board 
through the Audit and Risk Committee.
The Internal Audit function provides objective assurance to both the Audit and Risk Committee and to the Board. The Internal Audit annual 
plan is submitted for approval by the Audit and Risk Committee and the level of resource within this area was increased in the current year, 
in line with the growth across the Group. The reviews and tests of key business processes and control activities are reported on throughout 
the year, including follow up in respect of the implementation of management action plans to address any identified control weaknesses 
or potential improvements. It was pleasing to note that once again there were no findings that indicated the existence of key control 
weaknesses and that for areas capable of improvement identified in 2016, improvements had been made during 2017. In conclusion 
there were no areas that were deemed to be unfit for purpose.
The Internal Audit function assists the Board in reviewing the principal risks of the business by continually assessing the principal risks 
in the existing framework against the current environment and operations. Following their review, the Board concluded that the principal 
risks and framework are in line with the current business model. The risk profile and framework are reviewed by the Board on an 
ongoing basis.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE
STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Dear Shareholder
I would like to give you an overview of the operation and scope of the Audit and Risk Committee and report on our work over the past year. 
Composition of the Audit and Risk Committee
The Audit and Risk Committee is appointed by the Board from the Non-executive Directors of the Company. The Audit and Risk Committee’s  
terms of reference include all matters indicated by Disclosure and Transparency Rule 7.1 and the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the Code). The terms of reference are considered annually by the Audit and Risk Committee and are available upon request.
Members of the Audit and Risk Committee include myself, Brian McArthur-Muscroft (Chairman), Carol Hui and Tanith Dodge, all of whom 
are Non-executive Directors. The Committee met three times during the year, with full attendance at each of the meetings. Andrew Kemp, 
a former member of the Committee who resigned as a member of the Committee on 25 May 2017, was present at the first of those 
meetings during the year.
The Audit and Risk Committee is required to include one financially qualified member, with this requirement currently fulfilled by myself, 
and all Audit and Risk Committee members are considered to be financially literate. The composition of the Committee was reviewed 
during the year with the Board and Committee satisfied that it has the expertise and resource to fulfil its responsibilities effectively 
including those relating to risk and control.
As Audit and Risk Committee Chairman, I invited the Chairman of the Board and the Executive Directors to each meeting. In addition, 
the Group Financial Controller, the Head of Internal Audit and representatives from the Group’s external auditor, Deloitte LLP, were 
present at each meeting.
Role of the Audit and Risk Committee
The Audit and Risk Committee meets at least three times a year to review the interim and annual financial statements, the accounting 
policies of the Group, its internal financial control procedures and compliance with accounting standards, business risk, legal requirements 
and the requirements of all other matters indicated by the terms of reference.
A process has been in existence throughout the period that this report relates to in order to assess the risks within the business and to 
report and monitor such risks. The Audit and Risk Committee regularly receives reports identifying the key internal controls in existence 
and also risk reports from the business. The Audit and Risk Committee then evaluates the effectiveness of those controls and the 
management of key risks within the Group.
The Audit and Risk Committee discharges its responsibility in respect of the annual financial statements by: reviewing the terms of the 
scope of the external audit in advance of the audit; and subsequently evaluating the findings of the external audit as presented to the 
Audit and Risk Committee by the Auditor prior to the approval of the annual financial statements.
Significant accounting judgements and estimates
The Committee reviewed the Group’s draft full-year and half-yearly results statements prior to Board approval and reviewed the external 
auditor’s detailed reports thereon. In particular the Committee reviewed the opinions of management and the Auditor in relation to the 
appropriateness of the accounting policies adopted, significant estimates and judgements and whether disclosures were balanced and 
fair. The main areas of focus in 2017 and matters where the Committee specifically considered the judgements that had been made are 
set out below:
Revenue recognition – permanent placements
Revenue in respect of permanent placements is deemed to be earned when a candidate accepts a position and a start date is determined. 
A provision is made by management, based on historical evidence, for the proportion of those placements where the candidate is expected 
to reverse their acceptance prior to the start date. The Committee reviewed the detailed criteria for revenue recognition and a report on 
the cut-off testing performed on earned but not invoiced revenue and was satisfied by the judgements made by management. The 
Committee also reviewed the back-out provision applied to this revenue, whereby a percentage of candidates may in reality reverse their 
acceptance prior to their start date and the level of provision is considered to be appropriate based on historical trends.
Revenue recognition – temporary placements 
Revenue from temporary placements, which is amounts billed for the services of temporary staff, is recognised when the service has been  
provided. Rate cards are used, particularly in the Resource Solutions businesses, to determine the temporary worker rates and to calculate the  
amounts to be billed. The Committee reviews and discusses revenue recognition from temporary placements with management, Internal  
Audit and the external auditor. The Committee also evaluates the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the internal controls  
in place to ensure that changes in rate cards are being processed appropriately and temporary worker rates are being recorded accurately. 
The Committee concluded that management’s approach to revenue recognition from temporary placements was consistent with the 
accounting policy, that any judgements made were appropriate, and that the internal controls currently in place around rate cards are 
operating effectively.  52 Robert Walters plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
REPORT OF THE AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE CONTINUED
Bad debt provisioning
At each balance sheet date, each subsidiary evaluates the collectability of trade receivables and records a provision based on anticipated 
recoverable cash flows, nature of counterparty, past due date, geographical location, the costs of recovery and the fair value of any 
guarantee received. The Committee reviewed the ageing profile of trade receivables and considered this to be consistent with previous 
periods. The Committee also considered that the level of the bad debt provision is appropriate, given the specific nature of individual 
debtors and the overall risk profile of the Group’s trade receivables.
Other significant matters considered by the Committee
The Committee considered other significant matters as set out below:
Going concern
In order to support the going concern assumption, the Committee was presented with detailed forecasts showing the current Group 
financing position and future cash flows. For the three-year period ending 31 December 2020, the Group’s financing arrangements include: 
– Net funds totalling £31.1m (this is net of the facility drawn down to the extent of £30.2m at 31 December 2017);
– A non-recourse £15m facility;
– A further £0.6m Renminbi denominated loan;
– A guaranteed four-year borrowing facility of £45m;
– Net current assets of £92.2m.
The Committee considered that a three-year period is appropriate as it is the longest timeframe over which any reasonable view  
can be formed given the cyclical nature of the market in which the Group operates (more detail is provided on page 76).
Based on the current financing position and projected cash flows, the Committee concluded that the going concern assumption  
was appropriate.
Future accounting standards
The Committee received an update on future accounting standards changes and the potential impact that these may have on the Group’s  
financial statements. Some of these new accounting standards will apply for the financial year 2018 and the Committee will continue  
to assess the impact on the Group’s financial statements.
Fair, balanced and understandable 
A final draft of the Annual Report is reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee prior to consideration by the Board and the Committee 
considered whether the 2017 Annual Report was fair, balanced and understandable and whether it provided the necessary information 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy. They were satisfied that, taken as a whole, the 
Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and provided the necessary information for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
Internal Audit and risk
At the end of 2016, the Committee approved the Internal Audit plan for 2017. During the year, the Internal Audit function has delivered 
both significant geographic and financial coverage, as well as risk-based assurance across a wider remit including operational activities 
and support departments such as human resources. On-site audit reviews at Resource Solutions’ clients have also been carried out. 
Internal Audit reports on key business processes and control activities, including following up the implementation of management action 
plans to address any identified control weaknesses. At each meeting, the Committee received a summary of new audit findings and  
a progress update on previously raised audit recommendations. 
The Committee reviewed the independence and objectivity of the Internal Audit function and approved the Internal Audit plan for 2018.

Assessment of effectiveness of external audit process
The Committee assessed the effectiveness of the external audit process by obtaining feedback from all parties involved in the process,  
including management and the external auditor. As part of a formal review process, audit effectiveness questionnaires are completed  
by members of the Audit and Risk Committee and senior finance employees from across the Group. A summary report of these responses, 
including recommendations for future improvement, was presented to the Committee for their consideration. It was concluded that the 
external audit process was operating effectively. The Committee held private discussions with Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) at both of the Audit 
and Risk Committee meetings which considered the financial statements, to provide an opportunity for open dialogue and feedback 
without management being present. Matters discussed included the preparedness and efficiency of management with respect to the 
audit, the strengths and any perceived weaknesses of the financial management team, confirmation that no restriction on scope had 
been placed on them by management and how they had exercised professional judgement.
Based on this formal feedback and its own ongoing assessment, the Committee remains satisfied with the efficiency and effectiveness 
of the audit.
Reappointment of auditor
The Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board regarding the appointment of its external auditors 
and their remuneration. Deloitte has been the Group’s auditor since 2002. The Audit and Risk Committee, following a review during the 
year, remains satisfied with the effectiveness and independence of Deloitte. Nevertheless, in line with the new European Union Audit  
Directive and Regulation, it is the intention that the Group audit will be put out for tender for the 2019 audit. In line with our Auditor  
Independence Policy, the Group Audit Partner is required to rotate after a maximum of five years; the current Audit Partner, John Charlton, 
was appointed in 2014. The Audit and Risk Committee will give further consideration during the Audit Partner’s term to the application of 
the audit tendering provision of the 2014 edition of the UK Corporate Governance Code. There are no contractual obligations restricting 
our choice of external auditors and no auditor liability agreement has been entered into.
Independence of our external auditor
The Audit and Risk Committee recognises the importance of ensuring the independence and objectivity of the Group’s auditor and reviews 
the service provided by the auditor and the level of their fees. Any non-audit fees greater than £25,000 require the approval of the Audit 
and Risk Committee each financial year. The Audit and Risk Committee has adopted a policy with respect to the provision of non-audit 
services provided to the Group by the external auditor that complies with the requirements of the Code. The Board has delegated 
responsibility to the Audit and Risk Committee for making recommendations on the appointment, evaluation and dismissal of the 
external auditor.
After due and careful consideration, taking account of the processes above, the Committee has recommended to the Board that Deloitte 
be reappointed as the Company’s Auditor.
Raising concerns in confidence
The Audit and Risk Committee also reviews the Group’s whistleblowing procedures to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place  
for employees to be able to raise matters of possible impropriety in confidence, with suitable follow-up action. The Audit and Risk Committee  
considers that the nomination of Brian McArthur-Muscroft, as a point of contact, for raising any such matter is an appropriate measure 
and the procedure for raising such concerns is detailed on the Group’s intranet.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT  
Dear Shareholder
I am delighted to introduce the Directors’ Remuneration Report for 2017 in my first year as Chair of the Remuneration Committee. We set  
stretching targets at the beginning of the year and the Company has had a very successful year, delivering profit before taxation for the 
year of £40.6m, which is 44% higher than last year’s outturn of £28.1m. Last year, we sought and obtained overwhelming approval for 
our Directors’ Remuneration Policy which is designed to reward our Executive Directors for superior performance. I am glad to say that,  
this year, the shares awarded in 2015 under the Performance Share Plan have vested in full. This corresponds to a 115.8% increase  
in absolute TSR over the performance period. Our shorter-term operating performance has also been exceptional and bonuses of 95%  
of maximum are payable.
Robert Walters plc operates in a highly competitive sector. Our approach to the remuneration of all employees, including the Executive 
Directors, has been fundamental to our culture and our success over the years. We pay well across the Company, based upon merit 
and performance. Our objective is to ensure that our shareholders receive value for money from our investment in remuneration. The total 
pay bill in 2017 was £220.4m and the total remuneration of the Executive Directors in 2017 amounted to 3.7% of this. Share ownership  
is considered to be a key element of remuneration across the Group, with 140 senior employees participating in the Group share scheme 
plans. Additionally, the Executive Directors have an obligation to acquire minimum shareholdings in order to align their interests with 
those of long-term shareholders.
The 2017 Directors’ Remuneration Report
This Remuneration Report is split into two main parts and comprises:
−  The Annual Report on Remuneration which details payments made to Directors in 2017 , showing the link between Group performance 
and remuneration for the 2017 financial year and the intended approach to be applied to the 2018 financial year. The Annual Report 
on Remuneration will be subject to an advisory vote.
−  The Directors’ Remuneration Policy which sets out the Group’s Remuneration Policy for Directors. This was approved by shareholders 
at the 2017 Annual General Meeting and is included for information. 
The performance of the business over the last three years
This has been a positive period for the Group, with the share price increasing by 91% over the three-year period ended 31 December 
2017 . Full dividend increased by 101%, TSR grew by 116% over the three-year period compared to small cap average of 47% and profit 
before taxation increased by 223%.
The performance of the business in 2017 
The Group has delivered a strong operating performance, with a 24% increase in net fee income to £345.2m. We have driven performance 
improvement in the majority of our markets and our headcount has grown as we have invested further in recruiting experienced, talented 
employees while focusing upon the retention of our existing employees. This ensures the business is well positioned for future growth 
opportunities. Our productivity has continued to improve and this has increased profit before taxation to £40.6m, an increase of £12.5m 
over 2016. The balance sheet remains strong and our net cash position was £31.1m at the year end. Over two thirds of our net fee income 
now comes from outside the UK and 85% of recruitment net fee income from outside the financial services sector. Basic earnings per 
share was 42.9p, an increase of 55% on the prior year basic earnings of shares of 27 .7p, and a proposed final dividend payment of 9.3p 
per ordinary share represents an increase of 50% on the prior year payment of 6.2p.
Decisions and pay outcomes in 2017
The annual bonus for 2017 was based on reported profit before taxation and a basket of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).  
The Remuneration Committee has again assessed whether the profit before taxation target remains commercially sensitive and has decided  
that, as last year, the targets set for 2017 may be disclosed on a retrospective basis. The profit before taxation achieved for the year was  
greater than the maximum hurdle of £36.5m set at the start of the year. This hurdle was 30% higher than the profit before taxation reported  
for 2016. Profit before taxation of £40.6m was achieved, which results in 100% of the total bonus opportunity for this element of the bonus 
or 105% of salary. The specific strategic KPIs set at the start of the year included both individual objectives for the Executive Directors and 
team objectives. Key areas of focus this year included certain specific strategic objectives, technology objectives, staff retention and 
development of the Resource Solutions business, all of which were delivered. There were however certain country-specific objectives that  
were not achieved. Within the Directors’ Remuneration Report we have sought to give shareholders more information about how performance  
is assessed against the KPIs although we continue to take the view that the specific targets remain commercially sensitive even after the  
end of the year. Based on the Remuneration Committee’s assessment of performance against all KPIs, it was determined that bonus payments  
amounting to 83% of the maximum bonus under this measure (37% of salary) should be made. Consequently, bonus payments amounting 
to 95% of the maximum bonus opportunity were awarded to all Executive Directors, representing 142.5% of salary. The Annual Report 
on Remuneration has more details. A third of the bonus earned is deferred into shares. 
DIRECTORS’ REPORT Annual Report and Accounts 2017  Robert Walters plc 55
STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIRECTORS’ REPORT
This strong operating performance has been reflected in the share price over the year. Robert Walters plc’s share price has outperformed 
the FTSE Small Cap and the share price has more than doubled over the last twelve months, and ended the year at 591.5p, up 23% against 
the FTSE Small Cap which itself was up 15%. The vesting of the shares under the long-term incentive plan aligns with the performance 
of the Group over the last three years. The Group’s total shareholder return (TSR) over the three-year period was 116% compared to a  
relative result for the FTSE Small Cap Index of 47%, and together with the strong EPS growth over the three-year period of 280% has resulted  
in the full vesting of performance shares and the share options granted in 2015. As a result, the total remuneration of the Chief Executive 
is 160% of his total remuneration for the previous year. The Committee is satisfied that the pay outcomes are a fair reflection of the very 
strong corporate and individual performances delivered over the year and also over the last three years. This means that the ratio of the 
CEO’s total realised pay to average pay in the Company is 59:1 for 2017 (2016: 34:1).
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the base salaries of the Executive Directors and considered the overall employment market 
as well as the average base pay increases for employees in the UK and throughout the Group, together with current trading conditions. 
As a result, the Committee has decided to increase Executive Directors’ salaries by 3% with effect from 1 January 2018, below the average  
increase for employees across the Group of 3.2%.
I hope the 2017 Directors’ Remuneration Report is clear and helpful and that our shareholders will support the Annual Report  
on Remuneration.

ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
This section of the report provides details of the payments made to Directors in respect of the 2017 financial year. The sections of the 
report which are subject to audit have been highlighted. 
Single total figure of remuneration (audited)
As illustrated by the TSR performance graph on page 62, the Group has outperformed the FTSE Small Cap since 2009 and there has 
been a correlation between performance and pay. £1 invested in Robert Walters plc in 2009 is now worth £5.69. 
Executive Directors
The total remuneration for 2017 and comparative prior year figures for each Executive Director are set out in the table below. The single  
total figures for 2017 are considerably higher than those for the previous year, and reflect that the annual bonus pay-outs are, on average,  
23% higher than last year and the partial vesting of the shares for 2016, as opposed to full vesting in 2017. The single total remuneration 
figures for 2016 have also been updated to reflect the share price on the date of vesting. The total realised remuneration for the Executive 
Directors is equivalent to 4.5% of the increase in the market capitalisation of the Company in 2017 and 4.0% of the value created over  
the last three years.

Annual bonus performance outcomes
–  The 2017 threshold, budget (i.e. target) and maximum performance standards for reported profit before taxation (which has a 70% 
weighting) were set in the light of both internal budgets and market expectations. The Remuneration Committee has decided that,  
on a retrospective basis, the disclosure of the profit before taxation performance standards or targets set for 2017 is not commercially 
sensitive. The Remuneration Committee takes a view on this each year. The Group profit before taxation thresholds, target and maximum  
performance standards set for 2017 were £29.9m, £33.2m and £36.5m respectively. At threshold, 52.5% of salary (35% of maximum) 
is payable. The outcome of profit before taxation was £40.6m. This was significantly above the maximum of the range set or 70% of the 
overall bonus opportunity and resulted in the payment of 105% of salary for each Executive Director compared with 89% of salary  
for the previous year. 
–  Performance against the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) (which have a 30% weighting) has been assessed against a number of objectives  
which cover several different areas including financial, environmental, social and governance. The Remuneration Committee does  
not consider that it is appropriate to disclose the specific targets for the non-financial KPIs which, in the opinion of the Board, remain  
commercially sensitive even retrospectively. The Board is of the view that this information can give our competitors a competitive advantage. 
The Remuneration Committee takes a systematic approach to setting the KPIs and to the assessment of performance against them 
as follows. Although many of the objectives are individual, the Remuneration Committee seeks to encourage the Executive Directors 
to work effectively as a team. The KPIs therefore reflect their shared responsibilities for moving the business forward and investing 
appropriately in the long-term sustained performance of the Group. At the start of the year, the Remuneration Committee selects and 
agrees, for each of the Executive Directors, specific goals which are designed to develop the Group and to mitigate a variety of the 
risks that face the Company. They are designed to be stretching and require actions and delivery to a high standard. The objectives 
for 2017 covered several areas of focus, including client objectives, potential locations, the Group’s employees, Corporate Social 
Responsibility, internal systems and strategic objectives. Within each area of focus, specific and stretching performance targets are 
set. Examples include: the successful execution of the Group’s investment strategy, specific strategic objectives, including a number 
relating to Resource Solutions, target performance levels in respect of specific offices and regions, staff retention and development, 
client and candidate satisfaction, innovation, such as the roll-out of the Group’s social media strategy, and cost effective improvements 
to IT infrastructure, including the further development of Resource Solutions’ core proprietary software, Talent Source. 
–  The Remuneration Committee discusses after the end of the year each of the KPIs and the performance level achieved by each Executive 
Director. Because the targets are clearly set at the outset, the Committee is able to see if they have been met or not. By way of example  
of two achievements against KPIs in 2017, the Group significantly enhanced its engagement with new technology offerings including 
a number of integrations with candidate search and social media platforms and Resource Solutions grew revenue by more than 30%. 
The majority of objectives were met in full. Following the Remuneration Committee’s detailed assessment of performance over the 
year against all the KPIs that 91% were achieved, it was determined that 83% of the maximum was payable under this element to each 
Executive Director, representing 25% of the maximum bonus and 37 .5% of salary. The bonus outturn is the same for each of the Executive 
Directors because, even where individual Executive Directors take the lead, the Remuneration Committee holds them jointly accountable 
where objectives are met and where they are not. 58 Robert Walters plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Consequently, total bonuses of 95% of the maximum were awarded to all Executive Directors, representing 142.5% of salary (compared 
to 119% of salary for the previous year). One third of the earned bonus for 2017 will be deferred for two years into shares, payable in equal  
tranches at the end of 2018 and 2019. The bonus figure shown in the single total figure table on page 56 is the total bonus awarded in 
relation to performance for the year, including the portion that is deferred. Details of the cash payment and the deferred shares are set

1. 50% of the deferred shares awarded in 2016 and the remaining 50% of the deferred shares awarded in 2015 have vested at the end of 2017.
Over the last five years, the average total bonus pay-out has been 92% of total bonus opportunity. This has been a period during which 
the Group has successfully implanted core strategies of entering new markets, expanding disciplines and scaling individual businesses, 
in particular Resource Solutions which has grown revenues at a compound average rate in excess of 30% during the period. All of which 
has been achieved against a difficult macro-economic backdrop. Over the five-year period, EPS has increased year-on-year on average 
by 46%.
Long-term incentive plans
The remuneration shown in the long-term incentive plan (LTIP) figures in the single total figure table on page 56 shows the total vested 
value of shares granted under the Performance Share Plan (PSP) which are detailed below:

Performance Share Plan (PSP)
On 15 March 2017, the Executive Directors were granted share awards to the value of approximately 180% of salary as follows:
Share

G P Daubeney 234,269 402 942 703 30%
A R Bannatyne 161,216 402 648 484 30%
1.  Grant price is the market value at the time of grant.
2.  Face value has been calculated as the maximum number of shares that would vest if all performance measures and targets are met multiplied by the share price 
at date of grant.
3.  Fair value has been calculated as the fair value of one share as provided by Aon Hewitt New Bridge Street’s stochastic option pricing model, multiplied by the 
number of shares granted.
The performance conditions and weightings for these PSP awards are set out as follows:
Performance measures Weighting
% of award 
vesting at 
threshold*
Total shareholder return (TSR) relative to the FTSE Small Cap Index over a three-year period 50% 15%
Earnings per share (EPS) growth over a three-year period 50% 15%
Total 100% 30%
*  There has been recent advisory recommendations for only 25% to vest at threshold – given that shareholders have just overwhelmingly approved the Group’s  
remuneration policy, the intention is for this view to be considered more fully at the next policy approval vote in 2020.
In relation to the PSP performance measures, the vesting criteria are split into the following two components:
a.  In determining the three-year EPS targets, the first year is set using a specific growth target, which represents the most reasonable 
current expectation for year one performance of the Company, taking into account all available data. For the 2017 awards, the first year 
target was set at an increase of 15% over the previous year. Years two and three targets are then based on a fixed rate of growth in 
earnings per share of UK RPI + 8%. The three-year threshold will be the compound result of EPS growth in years one, two and three. 
There is then a straight-line increase in vesting, with 100% vesting occurring where EPS growth matches the annual compound 
growth rate of UK RPI + 14% in respect of years two and three.
b.  In relation to the three-year relative TSR performance measure no vesting occurs unless performance at least matches the 
performance of the FTSE Small Cap Index and full vesting occurs only when TSR exceeds the FTSE Small Cap Index by annual 
compound growth of 12.5%. This is deemed to be the equivalent of upper quartile performance. 60 Robert Walters plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

In accordance with the guidance issued by The Investment Association and consistent with the rules of the Company’s share schemes, 
the maximum number of new shares that may be issued in respect of all share schemes is limited to 10% of the issued share capital.  
At 1 January 2018 the Company had outstanding options representing 5.5% of issued share capital. Share awards made under the PSP 
are satisfied with market-purchased shares through the Employee Benefit Trust. 
In the event of a change of control, the rules specify that all awards would vest subject to satisfaction of the performance conditions. 
The awards would normally then be pro-rated to reflect the period of time between the date of grant and the date of change of control. 
Further information relating to all equity awards currently available to Executive Directors is detailed on pages 58 and 59 and in note 18

Share ownership policy
Executive Directors are subject to share ownership guidelines which recommend a minimum holding of 200% of salary. Their holdings 
are all well in excess of this, which we believe aligns their interests with those of shareholders. Only shares that are beneficially owned  
by the Executive Directors and connected persons count towards the share ownership policy.
For the avoidance of doubt, Directors are not permitted to take forward options or in any way securitise or hedge their holdings  
of Robert Walters plc shares. 
The percentage and value of the shareholdings of the Executive Directors, based on the share price at 31 December 2017 and expressed 
as a percentage of salary, are as follows:
Shares held % of issued share capital % of salary
R C Walters 2.80% 2,230%
G P Daubeney 2.06% 1,847%
A R Bannatyne 0.61% 799%
TSR performance and the CEO’s pay
The Remuneration Committee supports the Group’s strong view that remuneration should be linked to performance. The following graph  
shows how the Chief Executive’s base salary (and total realised pay) has changed since 2009. It also shows the Company’s total shareholder  
return (TSR) against the TSR of the FTSE Small Cap Index. The FTSE Small Cap Index has been selected because Robert Walters plc is 
a constituent. 
The following table shows the Chief Executive’s total realised pay (calculated using the same approach we have used to calculate the 
single total figure) in each of the last nine years. It also shows the levels of pay-outs from the annual bonus and the long-term share-based 
plans in each year going back to 2009.

Chief Executive’s pay compared to employees
The table below shows the year-on-year percentage movement of base pay, other benefits and annual bonus in 2017 for the Chief Executive, 
compared with the average percentage change for Group employees.
The Chief Executive’s remuneration disclosed in the table below uses the same information for base salary, other benefits and bonus  
as the single total figure on page 56. The Group employee pay is calculated using the movement of the average remuneration (per head) 
for all Group employees.
Base salary
Other benefits  
including pension Bonus
R C Walters 2.5% 2.5% 22.3%
All employees 3.2% 3.5% 10%
The ratio of the CEO’s total realised pay to average pay in the Company is 59:1 for 2017 (2016: 34:1).
Relative importance of the spend on pay
The graph below shows details of the Group’s profit after taxation, dividends paid, share buybacks, total spend on pay and taxation paid 
for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2017 . In the opinion of the Board, profit before taxation and taxation paid are both helpful 
reference points for putting the investment of pay costs necessary in a professional services business into context. 
Notes to the illustrative graph:
1.  The total dividend paid during the year ended 31 December 2017 was £6.1m based on a final dividend of £4.2m, paid on 9 June 2017, and an interim dividend  
of £1.9m paid on 13 October 2017. Further details on dividends are given in note 6.
2.  The shares purchased by the EBT represent the total amount spent by the EBT on shares and shares purchased for cancellation during the year ended  
31 December 2017.
3.  Overall spend on pay includes wages and salaries, social security costs, pension costs and share-based payments for all employees including Directors.  
Further details of the total remuneration of the Group are given in note 4.
4. Taxation paid during the year represents the corporation taxation paid for the Group during the year ended 31 December 2017.

The implementation of our remuneration policy in 2018
The Group’s policy on Executive Directors’ remuneration and implementation for the year ended 31 December 2018 will be as follows:
(a) Executive Directors
(i) Base salary
For 2018, the average salary increase for employees across the Group other than Executive Directors is expected to be approximately 
3.2%. The Committee has decided to give the Executive Directors salary increases lower than the average salary increase. Robert Walters, 
Giles Daubeney and Alan Bannatyne will each receive a base salary increase of 3.0%. The graph below sets out the base salaries  
of the Executive Directors going back to 2009. 
(ii) Other benefits
No changes will be made to benefits in 2018.
(iii) Annual bonus
For 2018, the Remuneration Committee has determined that the annual bonus payment for the Executive Directors will be by reference 
to specific performance targets set at the beginning of the year and on the same basis as the previous year. The performance  
measures are:
− Reported profit before taxation for the Group (70% weighting); and
−  Key Performance Indicators (30% weighting) which include objectives covering a range of key areas such as strategic development, clients,  
locations, the Group’s people, internal systems and Corporate Social Responsibility. The targets set and performance achieved will be 
disclosed in next year’s report to the extent deemed possible by the Remuneration Committee. 
For 2018, the on-target bonus for each of the Executive Directors will remain at 97 .5% of salary and the maximum bonus at 150% of salary. 
One third of any earned bonus will be deferred for two years into shares, payable in equal tranches at the end of 2019 and 2020. 
(iv) Performance Share Plan (PSP)
For 2018, it is envisaged that each Executive Director will receive awards under the PSP to the value on grant of 180% of base salary.
The performance period is the three-year period ending 31 December 2020. The performance conditions and weightings for these PSP 
awards are set out as follows:
Performance condition Weighting
% of award vesting  
at threshold
Total shareholder return (TSR) relative to the FTSE Small Cap Index over three years 50% 15%
Earning per share (EPS) growth over a three-year period 50% 15%
Total 100% 30%
The proportion of shares that vest for threshold performance reflects the high standard of performance expected before the shares start  
to vest. The historical vesting record of the maximum on average over the last nine years – see page 62 – of 48% of maximum on average 
suggests that the three-year performance standards set for the longer-term share plans are robust. The Group’s remuneration policy 
was approved in 2017 and given recent developments, this area will be reconsidered in detail at the date of the next policy approval.

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIRECTORS’ REPORT
In relation to the PSP performance conditions, the vesting criteria are split into the following two components:
a.  In determining the three-year EPS targets, the first year is set using a specific growth target, which represents the most reasonable 
current expectation for year one performance of the Company, taking into account all available data. For 2018 the first year target  
is set at 17 .5%. Years two and three targets are then based on a fixed rate of growth in earnings per share of UK RPI + 8%. The overall

b.  In relation to the TSR performance condition, no vesting will occur unless performance at least matches the performance of the  
FTSE Small Cap Index and full vesting occurs when TSR exceeds the FTSE Small Cap Index by annual compound growth of 12.5%. 
The Remuneration Committee believes that this is broadly equivalent to upper quartile performance.
(v) Pensions
No changes in the level of pension contributions or cash in lieu of pension as a percentage of base salary are envisaged for any of the 
Executive Directors in 2018, which will remain at 20% of salary. 
(b) Chairman and Non-executive Directors 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the remuneration of the Chairman and the Board is responsible for determining  
the fees of the Non-executive Directors.
As of 1 January 2018, the agreed fees for the Chairman (as determined by the Remuneration Committee) and the Non-executive 
Directors (as determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors) are as follows:

The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Tanith Dodge (Chairman), Brian McArthur-Muscroft and Carol Hui, all of whom are independent 
Non-executive Directors. The Chairman of the Board, Leslie Van de Walle, is invited to attend all meetings. 
The purpose of the Committee is to consider all aspects of Executive Directors’ remuneration and to determine the specific remuneration 
packages of the Executive Directors, including bonus schemes, pension contributions and other benefits. The Committee also recommends 
to the Board the remuneration of the Chairman. The Committee ensures that the remuneration packages are competitive within the 
recruitment industry, and reflect both Group and personal performance during the year, while also having regard to the broader levels  
of remuneration within the Group itself and environmental, social and governance issues. The Committee meets when required to consider 
all aspects of Executive Directors’ remuneration and received independent external advice from FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP during  
the year. The Committee has satisfied itself that the advice provided is independent and objective. FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP 
has been formally appointed by the Committee and does not provide other services to the Remuneration Committee or to the Group. 
The Committee has used its best judgement to satisfy itself that the advice provided is objective and independent. FIT Remuneration 
Consultants LLP is also a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group. The fees paid during the year were £22,818. The fees are 
charged on a time and expenses basis.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on our website.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
This section details the Group’s remuneration policy for Executive Directors, which was approved by the shareholders in a binding  
vote during the 2017 Annual General Meeting. The policy (detailed in this section) took effect from the Annual General Meeting on  
25 May 2017.
How the Remuneration Committee sets remuneration
The Remuneration Committee reviews the Group’s remuneration philosophy and structure each year to ensure the remuneration 
framework remains effective in supporting the Group’s business objectives. The review ensures the policy is in line with best practice 
and fairly rewards individuals for the contribution to the business, having regard for the size and complexity of the Group’s operations 
and the need to motivate and attract employees of the highest calibre.
The total remuneration package links corporate and individual performance with an appropriate balance between long and short-term 
elements, and fixed and variable components. The policy is designed to incentivise Executive Directors to meet the Company’s key 
objectives and, consequently, a significant portion of total remuneration is performance related.
Executive Directors’ remuneration policy

Performance conditions 
and assessment
Base salary The base salary of each 
Executive Director takes into 
account the performance 
of each individual and is set 
at an appropriate level to 
secure and retain the talent 
needed to deliver the Group’s 
strategic objectives.
Salaries are normally 
reviewed annually on  
1 January and are  
influenced by:
–  The performance of 
each individual Executive 
Director;
–  Average increase for 
employees across the 
Group as a whole; and, 
–  Information from relevant 
comparator groups 
including our industry  
peer group.
Annual increases will not 
exceed 7.5% + RPI, or 
the average increase of 
employees across the Group 
in any given year, whichever 
is higher.
The level of increase may 
deviate from this maximum 
in the case of special 
circumstances (for example, 
increases in responsibilities 
or promotion). In these 
cases, any exceptional 
increase will not exceed  
20% a year.
Base salary increases are 
principally set in line with 
market movement and also 
consider the average salary 
increase for other employees 
across the Group rather than 
individual performance. Poor 
performance is likely to lead  
to no adjustment being made.
Pensions To provide a competitive 
employment benefit and 
long-term security.
Robert Walters plc operates 
a money purchase pension 
scheme. Executive Directors 
participating in the pension 
plan may benefit from annual 
Group contributions worth 
up to 20% of base salary.
Executive Directors are 
entitled to take all or part of 
their pension contributions 
as a cash allowance.

Annual 
bonus
1
The annual bonus is 
designed to drive the 
achievement of the Group’s 
financial and strategic 
business targets on an 
annual basis.
The on-target bonus 
opportunity is 97.5% of 
salary and is dependent 
upon the achievement of 
specific annual performance 
conditions.
One third of any earned 
bonus will be deferred 
for two years into shares, 
payable in equal tranches  
at the end of years one  
and two.
The Group will apply a 
clawback (i.e. recovery) 
provision in respect of 
any annual bonus deferral 
into shares in the event 
of material restatement 
of previously published 
financial statements within 
18 months of the financial 
year end of the year in which 
the deferred shares were 
awarded.
A malus provision will 
operate in respect of any 
act or omission by the 
participant which, in the 
opinion of the Remuneration 
Committee, has amounted 
to gross misconduct.
The maximum bonus 
opportunity is 150% of 
salary for the achievement 
of stretch performance in 
any given year. Threshold 
performance equates to 
52.5% of salary. 
Zero payment will be made 
for performance below 
threshold performance.
Performance is measured over 
one financial year, based on 
the following measures:
–  Financial targets as set out 
in the budget at the start of 
the year; and,
–    KPIs set against pre-
determined strategic 
performance objectives.
The intended weighting of 
these measures is not less 
than 70% financial and no 
more than 30% on KPIs. 
The Committee reserves 
the right to determine which 
performance measures and 
targets are to be used at the 
beginning of each financial 
year in order to align to the 
Group’s strategic objectives. 
The Committee will not 
change the mix of measures 
or targets mid-year but does 
retain the right to apply its 
judgement when assessing 
formulaic outcomes in 
the case of a material 
misstatement of financial 
results or similar situation. The 
Committee will not exercise 
discretion to reward failure and 
will report on any exercise of 
discretion that changes the 
amount of remuneration paid 
in any year. 68 Robert Walters plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Plan (PSP) 
award
2,5
The PSP is designed to 
promote staff retention, 
motivate executives across 
the Group and promote team 
efforts towards Group-wide 
strategic objectives.
The three-year time horizon  
of these share awards also 
aligns leadership with the 
longer-term returns of the 
business and shareholder 
interests.
PSP awards are normally 
granted annually and vest 
after three years, dependent 
on the achievement of 
performance conditions  
over a three-year period. 
A two-year holding period 
will apply to the post-tax 
value of vested shares in 
respect of awards made 
from 2017 where Executive 
Directors have not met the 
share ownership guideline  
of two times salary.
The Group will apply a 
clawback (i.e. recovery) 
provision in the event of 
material restatement of 
previously published financial 
statements within 18 months 
of the financial year end of 
the year in which the PSP 
shares were awarded.
A malus provision will 
operate in respect of any 
act or omission by the 
participant which, in the 
opinion of the Remuneration 
Committee, has amounted 
to gross misconduct.
The maximum award of PSP 
shares that may be made 
to an Executive Director in 
any financial year is limited 
to shares with an aggregate 
market value of 200% of 
base salary. The normal 
award level is 180% of salary 
and no change to this is 
envisaged. 
Threshold performance will 
result in the vesting of 30% 
of the shares under award 
while maximum performance 
will result in full vesting. 
There will be no vesting 
for performance below 
threshold.
Performance will be measured 
over a three-year period, 
subject to the following 
performance conditions:
–  50% of the award will vest 
based on relative total 
shareholder return (TSR). 
This is currently measured 
relative to the FTSE Small 
Cap Index; and,
–  50% of the award will vest 
based on earnings per 
share (EPS) growth over  
the three-year period. 
The TSR and EPS 
components will operate 
independently. Vesting  
levels between threshold  
and maximum performance 
will be calculated on  
a straight-line basis.
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED  Annual Report and Accounts 2017  Robert Walters plc 69
STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Notes to the policy table:
1. In relation to the annual bonus:
 a.  The financial performance measure or measures will be set by the Board at the beginning of each year in line with the budget and market expectations and 
will include measures such as profit before taxation which drive our business. In order to achieve maximum pay-out the financial performance delivered will 
have to be significantly ahead of budgets and market consensus.
 b.  KPIs are linked to the delivery of key projects designed to enhance the Group’s operational strength and competitiveness in line with future strategy. They help 
to balance our financial operational performance with strategic investments during the year in, for example, clients, our people and internal systems to ensure 
the long-term growth and sustainability of the Group. At the end of the financial year, the Remuneration Committee meets to assess the performance of each 
Executive Director against the financial performance targets and KPIs and determine the bonus pay-out. Examples of KPIs include successful execution of the  
Group’s investment strategy, opening of new offices, staff retention and development, client and candidate satisfaction, innovation and cost-effective improvements  
to IT infrastructure. There is no formulaic threshold vesting for KPIs and it is for the Remuneration Committee to judge performance against KPIs. KPIs are designed 
to hold individuals accountable for delivering on non-financial value creation and to encourage them and reward them for working as a team.
 c.  The financial measures of the awards (e.g. profit before taxation) are not disclosed in advance as these are deemed to be commercially sensitive. The Committee 
assesses each year whether to disclose these targets at such a time when they are no longer deemed to be commercially sensitive and at the earliest after the 
end of the financial year. This has been the case for the last three years. The KPIs remain more commercially sensitive in the view of the Board but every effort  
is made to disclose how the decisions on assessing performance have been reached.
2. In relation to the PSP, the vesting criteria are split into the following two components:
 a.  In determining the three-year EPS targets, the first year will be set using a specific growth target, which represents the most reasonable current expectation 
for year one performance of the Committee, taking into account all available data. Years two and three targets are then based on a fixed rate of growth in earnings 
per share of UK RPI + 8%. The overall threshold target will be the compound result of years one, two and three. At threshold, 30% of the awards will vest. 
There is then a straight-line increase in vesting with 100% vesting occurring where EPS growth matches the annual compound growth rate of UK RPI + 14%  
in respect of years two and three. 
 b.  In relation to the TSR performance condition, no vesting will occur unless performance at least matches the performance of the selected peer group which  
is currently the FTSE Small Cap Index and full vesting occurs when TSR exceeds the FTSE Small Cap Index by annual compound growth of 12.5%. This level 
of performance is deemed to be broadly equivalent to upper quartile performance.
 c.  The two criteria above have been selected on the basis that they are considered to align the interests of management with shareholders. EPS is a KPI for the 
business. The existence of a market-related component ensures that performance is also benchmarked against relative performance and not just absolute 
performance.
 
In addition, any vesting will be subject to satisfactory financial performance over the period, as determined by the Committee. The Committee will retain the right to 
change the performance measures, targets and weightings (within the framework of policy) as appropriate at the beginning of each plan cycle to reflect the Group’s 
current operations. Performance measures, targets and weightings will be set at the beginning of each three-year period and will not be adjusted mid cycle although 
the Committee does retain the right to alter formulaic vesting of awards in the case of material misstatement of financial results or similar situation. The Committee 
will not exercise discretion to reward failure and will report on any exercise of discretion that changes the amount of remuneration paid in any year. A holding period 
of two years will apply to the net value of vested shares awarded under the PSP where Executive Directors have yet to reach the share ownership guideline. This has  
been introduced in the light of shareholders’ views and has been applied to awards granted in 2017 onwards.
3.  In addition, the Group operates the Robert Walters plc Save As You Earn (SAYE) option scheme, which is an HMRC-approved scheme open to all permanent  
UK employees. Each individual is allowed to acquire options over ordinary shares of the Company at a discount of up to 20% of their market price up to a maximum 
value of £18,000. Options granted under the scheme can normally be exercised during a period of six months starting on the third anniversary of the start of the  
relevant SAYE contract. The current scheme started in 2017 and will vest in 2020. All Executive Directors have enrolled in this new scheme to the maximum value 
of £18,000.
4.  In respect of other benefits, the maximum benefit costs of £72,500 a year exclude potential costs in respect of any relocation which will be capped by the Robert 
Walters plc policy.
5. Dividends do not accrue to unvested equity awards.
6.   The Committee operates the annual bonus, PSP and all-employee share plans in accordance with their respective rules, the Listing Rules and, where appropriate, 
HMRC rules. The Committee retains a number of discretions to ensure the efficient operation of the plans, which includes:
 a. The participants of each award plan.
 b. The timing of award grant, vesting or payment.
 c. The award quantum (although limited to that set out in the policy table on page 68).
 d. The determination of good/bad leaver status for incentive plan purposes.
 e. How to deal with a change of control situation.
 f. Any adjustments which are required to take account of a variation in share capital.
7.  The Committee also retains the ability to make adjustments to the performance measures or targets for outstanding awards and/or set different targets if an event 
occurs (e.g. a material acquisition or divestment) which means the original targets, in the opinion of the Committee, are no longer considered appropriate. Any change  
will be no less challenging to achieve in the opinion of the Committee. Any use of Committee discretion will be disclosed in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration. 
8.  To the extent that the remuneration policy for Executive Directors differs from the remuneration policy which applies to employees generally, this reflects differences 
in levels of responsibility, affordability and market practice.  70 Robert Walters plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017

The graph below provides an indication of the potential total remuneration of each Executive Director based on three performance 
scenarios: minimum, on-target and maximum. As required by the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Amendment Regulations 2013, the graph below takes no account of changes in share price growth or dividend and hence 
may differ from realised earnings shown in the single total remuneration figures on page 56 of the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
Notes to the illustrative graph:
1.   Share price appreciation and the value of dividends have not been included (i.e. the deferred bonus and PSP awards are based on the face value at grant).

Recruitment and appointment policy
Any remuneration arrangements for a new Director will be in line with the remuneration policy for existing Directors. Incentive awards  
will be in line with the current awards given to Directors and will be subject to the same maximum award levels and vesting criteria.
Where the appointee has variable remuneration arrangements with a previous employer that will be forfeited on the termination of that  
employment, the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to offer a share-based buyout for value foregone. A cash-based buyout  
may be required if shares may not be awarded. This is meant to facilitate the recruitment of key individuals and may be done in accordance 
with the rules of the UK Listing Authority. Any such award would only be made in exceptional circumstances, would not exceed the 
estimated value being forfeited and would take into account any performance and timing conditions appropriate to the awards being 
replaced. Relocation costs which are reasonable and appropriate may also be paid.
The service contracts for each of the Executive Directors are subject to review annually. These service contracts are terminable by either  
party giving up to 12 months’ written notice at any time and there are no specific provisions relating to any payments for early termination 
of office, or in the event of a change of control.
Policy on payment for loss of office  
For the current Executive Directors, in the event of early termination of an Executive Director’s service contract, the Group has an absolute 
requirement to pay compensation reflecting the salary and benefits to which the Executive Director would have become entitled to under  
the contract during the notice period. Alternatively the Group may, under the contracts of employment in place and the rules of the plans, 
at its discretion make the following payments in the event of a ‘good leaver’ scenario:
− Notice period of 12 months’ base salary, pension and contractual benefits or payments in lieu of notice;
−  Bonus payable and time pro-rated for the period worked, subject to the achievement of the relevant personal and financial 
performance conditions; and,
−  Vesting of PSP awards and any existing share options granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme are governed by the rules  
of the relevant incentive plans. These rules provide the Remuneration Committee discretion to allow vesting depending on the extent  
to which performance conditions have been met at the date of cessation and the length of time the awards or options have been held.
Each Executive Director has a duty to mitigate his loss in the event of termination. The Committee may settle any other amounts reasonably  
due to the Executive Director, for example to reimburse the leaver for a reasonable level of legal fees in connection with a settlement 
agreement or for outplacement services. The Chairman and the Non-executive Directors are not entitled to any compensation in the 
event of early termination.
Legacy awards and any other contractual obligations
All contractual commitments or awards made which are consistent with the remuneration policy in force at the time that the commitment 
or award was made will be honoured even if they would not otherwise be consistent with the policy prevailing when the commitment 
is fulfilled or awards vest. For example, this will include payment for the vesting of option awards made prior to the introduction of this 
policy. Any contractual commitments entered into before the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Amendment Regulations 2013 came into force or before a person became a Director will also be honoured.
On 16 February 2017, Alan Bannatyne became a Non-executive Director of Xafinity plc. None of the other Executive Directors currently

The Executive Directors are required to seek approval from the Board prior to the acceptance of any such positions in companies 
outside the Group.
Statement of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
Each year, prior to reviewing the remuneration of the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee is fully briefed on the remuneration 
practice across the Group, including an overview by country of how employee pay compares to the market, and material changes during 
the year and detailed comparative analysis of basic pay and variable pay changes within the UK where all of the Executive Directors are  
based. It ensures that the decisions on the remuneration of Executive Directors are made in the context of pay and employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Group. The Group does not consult with employees as part of the process of reviewing executive pay. We do consult 
with our major institutional shareholders when making major changes to pay.
Consideration of shareholders’ views
The Committee engages in dialogue with major shareholders and their representatives and meets with the Group’s largest investors to 
discuss and take feedback and to consult on major changes to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy and governance matters. The level  
of support for the Directors’ Remuneration Policy was high even though our shareholders have differing views on remuneration, for example, 
on performance measures.
Approval
This report was approved by the Board of Directors on 28 February 2018 and signed on its behalf by:
Tanith Dodge
Remuneration Committee Chairman
28 February 2018 74 Robert Walters plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable laws  
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required  
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the  
European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation, and have chosen to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK Accounting Standards and applicable laws). Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and  
of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires 
that Directors:
− Properly select and apply accounting policies;
−  Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
−  Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
− Make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
Statement of the Directors in respect of the Annual Report
As required by the Code, the Directors confirm that they consider that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and 
strategy. When arriving at this position the Board was assisted by a number of processes, including the following:
−  The Annual Report is drafted by appropriate senior management with overall coordination by the Chief Marketing Officer and Group 
Financial Controller to ensure consistency across sections;
− An extensive verification process is undertaken to ensure factual accuracy;
− Comprehensive reviews of drafts of the report are undertaken by members of the Executive Board and senior management team;
− An advanced draft is considered and reviewed by two regional Managing Directors and the Legal General Counsel; and
− The final draft is reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee prior to consideration by the Board.
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
−  The financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken  
as a whole; and
−  The Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

Appointment and retirement of Directors
The Directors may from time to time appoint one or more additional Directors. The Board may appoint any person to be a Director (so long 
as the total number of Directors does not exceed the limit prescribed in the Articles of Association). The UK Corporate Governance Code  
recommends that all Directors be subject to annual re-election by shareholders. Therefore, all Directors who wish to stay in office will offer 
themselves for re-election at the 2018 Annual General Meeting.
Power of Company’s Directors and acquisition of Company’s own shares
The business of the Company shall be managed by the Directors, who may exercise all powers of the Company, subject to legislation, 
the provisions of the Articles of Association and any directions given by special resolution.
The Directors were authorised at the Company’s last Annual General Meeting, held on 25 May 2017 , to make market purchases of ordinary 
shares representing up to 10% of its share capital at that time and to allot shares within certain limits permitted by shareholders and the  
Companies Act. The Directors intend to renew this authority annually and will continue to exercise this power only when, in the light of market  
conditions prevailing at the time, they believe that the effect of such purchases will be to increase earnings per share and will likely promote 
the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole.
During the year ended 31 December 2017, 2.1m ordinary shares have been purchased and cancelled at an average price of £3.79  
for £8.0m. A further 0.4m shares were purchased at an average price of £4.03 for £1.8m through the Group’s Employee Benefit Trust.
Provisions on change of control 
The Company’s revolving credit facility agreement for £45m includes a provision for a lending counterparty to amend, alter or cancel  
the relevant commitment to the Group following a change of control of the Company.
The Company does not have agreements with any Director or employee that would provide specific compensation for loss of office  
or employment resulting from a takeover, except that provisions of the Group’s share plans may cause options and awards to vest  
on a takeover.
Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association may only be amended by a special resolution of the members.
Viability statement
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out  
on pages 41 and 43. 
The Directors have assessed the long-term prospects of the Group based upon business plans and upon cash flow projections for the 
three-year period ending 31 December 2020. 
The three-year period was chosen as it is considered the longest timeframe over which any reasonable view can be formed, given the 
cyclical nature of the market in which the Group operates. The forward visibility of permanent recruitment can be measured in weeks, and whilst  
temporary recruitment and recruitment process outsourcing may be less affected, with 68% of the Group based upon recruitment permanent  
activity, three years is considered to be the maximum period over which to consider the future cash flows of the business. The forecasts 
and cash flow projections being used to assess going concern have been comprehensively stress-tested by using simulation techniques 
involving sensitivity analysis applying, in particular, projections of reduced net fee income of up to 20% from forecasts each year over a 
three-year period. It should be noted that the Group has limited forward visibility and consequently there is a high degree of uncertainty in  
respect of future outcomes. Importantly, cash risk is mitigated to an extent as in the event of a reduction in the overall number of contractors 
working capital is released. Credit risk is seen as an ongoing area of key focus and the Group has historically managed to maintain dividend  
payments during previous economic downturns and it is the policy of the Directors to at least maintain the dividend in future periods.
DIRECTORS’ REPORT Annual Report and Accounts 2017  Robert Walters plc 77
In forming their opinion the Directors have performed a robust assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group as set 
out on pages 44 and 45. In addition, note 16 to the accounts includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its 
capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposure to credit risk 
and liquidity risk.
The Group had £31.1m of net cash at 31 December 2017 and a £45m four-year committed financing facility until December 2020.  
The Group also has a non-recourse £15m facility. Further details of the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are described within the Financial Review. 
The Group has a strong balance sheet and considerable financial resources and remains confident of the Group’s long-term growth 
prospects, together with a diverse range of clients and suppliers across different geographic locations and sectors. As a consequence, 
the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
After making enquiries, the Directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving the accounts, that there is a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year 
assessment period. For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Auditor and disclosure of information to the Auditor
As required by Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, each of the Directors as at 28 February 2018 confirms that:
– So far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group’s Auditor is unaware; and
–  The Director has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a Director to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group’s Auditor is aware of that information.
Deloitte LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in office as Auditor and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held on 17 May 2018 and the Notice of the Annual General Meeting, including an explanation  
of the special business of the meeting, will be sent out in due course.
By order of the Board,
Alan Bannatyne
Chief Financial Officer

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
In our opinion:
–  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
–  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)

to the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements of Robert Walters plc (the ‘Parent Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) which comprise:
– the Consolidated Income Statement;
– the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income;
– the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets;

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF ROBERT WALTERS PLC
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report and Accounts 2017  Robert Walters plc 81
STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
– Revenue recognition, both from permanent placements and temporary workers; and
–  Recoverability of aged trade receivables and bad debt provisioning.
Materiality The materiality that we used for the Group financial statements was £1.75m which was determined  
on the basis of pre-taxation profit.
The current year materiality represents 4.3% of pre-taxation profit, 0.5% of net fee income and 1.3%  
of net assets.
Scoping Our work was primarily focused on the audit work at six significant components, which were all subject to 
a full audit. These six significant components were Australia, China, France, Hong Kong, Japan and the 
United Kingdom. 
We also performed specified audit procedures in the Netherlands, and for Resource Solutions in the USA.
Across the components in scope for a full audit, and those where we performed specified audit procedures, 
we have coverage of 81% of the Group’s revenue (2016: 84%), 71% of the Group’s net fee income  
(2016: 72%) and 75% of total assets (2016: 80%).
Significant changes  
in our approach
In the previous year, the office in Singapore was included within our audit scope. Due to the small size and 
consistent performance of this component, we have not included it within scope in the current year, but 
have instead performed specified audit procedures for Resource Solutions in the USA, which is a recently 
established and rapidly growing part of the Group.
We have changed the focus of our revenue recognition key audit matter for temporary income. 
This year we have concentrated on the impact of changes in pay rates for temporary workers covered  
by Resource Solutions contracts. 
This key audit matter was previously focused on the recognition of revenue relating to work performed 
before year end, where timesheets are not received until after year end. 
We have also refined our approach to the key audit matter we have identified around the recoverability  
of receivables. 
This year we have focused on the recoverability of receivables on aged balances relating to sales  
in the permanent recruitment business.
In previous years, this key audit matter was focused on the entire receivables balance.
More details on both these changes are provided in the key audit matter section, on pages 83 to 85. 82 Robert Walters plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Conclusions relating to going concern, principal risks and viability statement
Going concern
We have reviewed the Directors’ statement within the financial statements about whether 
they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the financial statements (this is in the Accounting Policies note). We have also reviewed the 
Directors’ identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and Company’s ability  
to continue to act as a going concern over a period of at least twelve months from the date  
of approval of the financial statements.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in 
relation to that statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing 
material to report, add or draw 
attention to in respect of these 
matters.
Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the Directors’ statements and considering whether they were consistent  
with the knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, including the knowledge obtained 
in the evaluation of the Directors’ assessment of the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern, we are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw  
attention to in relation to:
–  the disclosures on pages 44 and 45 that describe the principal risks and explain how they 
are being managed or mitigated;
–  the Directors’ confirmation on page 77 that they have carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity; or
–  the Directors’ explanation on page 76 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the 
Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We are also required to report whether the Directors’ statement relating to the prospects  
of the Group required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing 
material to report, add or draw 
attention to in respect of these 
matters.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements 
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we 
identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Revenue recognition
Key audit matter 
description
Permanent revenue – accuracy and completeness of the provision for back-outs
For permanent placements, which accounted for 68% of the net fee income (gross profit) of the Group’s 
recruitment business in 2017 (2016: 69%), the Group’s policy (as detailed in the Accounting Policies note) 
is to record revenue when specific recognition criteria have been met, namely where a candidate accepts 
a position in writing and a start date is agreed. Accordingly, revenue is accrued in respect of permanent 
placements meeting the above criteria but which remain unbilled.  
A provision is made for placements expected to be cancelled prior to the start date (‘back-outs’) on the 
basis of past experience.
Determining the level of provision required for back-outs involves a significant degree of management 
judgement, and is an area where there is potential for fraudulent manipulation of the financial results.
Please see page 51, where the Audit and Risk Committee has addressed this risk.
Temporary revenue – changes in temporary worker rates in the Resource Solutions business
The Group’s policy is to recognise revenue relating to temporary workers as the service is provided,  
at contractually agreed rates (as detailed in the Accounting Policies note).
For temporary income, the risk identified in the current year is that changes in temporary worker rates  
in the Resource Solutions business may not be recorded accurately. 
The Resource Solutions business has continued to grow in the current year, and now represents 44.8%  
of Group revenue (2016: 40.0%). 
The contracts which govern the rates at which revenue should be recognised for temporary workers within 
the Resource Solutions business are complex. The margin earned varies with role, length of tenure and 
the entity which originally sourced the temporary worker. These rates are also subject to change when 
contracts are renegotiated.
Rate changes have a number of different drivers, and do not occur on a readily predictable timetable. 
The process for updating the temporary worker rates is manual, as are the controls which management has 
put in place to mitigate the risk. A systematic error in the recording of these rates could lead to a material 
misstatement, and is most likely to occur when changes to rates are processed. 
Please see page 51, where the Audit and Risk Committee has addressed this risk.
Note that this is a change from the revenue recognition key audit matter we identified in the prior year, which 
focused on the recognition of revenue relating to work performed before year end, where timesheets are not 
received until after year end. 
Our work on this risk in the previous year demonstrated that the process is well controlled, and involves little 
management judgement. We have therefore concluded that the recognition of late timesheets is not  
a significant risk in the current year. 84 Robert Walters plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Revenue recognition (continued)
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
Permanent revenue
In all full scope locations, we evaluated the design and implementation of the internal controls in place to ensure 
that all permanent placements are recorded in the correct period.
In Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan and the United Kingdom, we performed additional testing  
to confirm that the internal controls for permanent placements were operating effectively.
Our testing involved agreeing a sample of permanent placement fees earned but not invoiced to written 
evidence of candidate acceptance, including confirmation of start date.
Temporary revenue
In all full scope locations within the Resource Solutions business, we evaluated the design and implementation 
and tested the operating effectiveness of the internal controls in place to ensure that any changes in the rate 
at which revenue is recognised were recorded appropriately.
We selected a sample of temporary workers in the Resource Solutions business where there had been 
a change in rates during the year. The change in rates was then agreed to contract, and the associated 
revenue recalculated.
We reviewed a sample of contracts with clients of the Resource Solutions business, for evidence  
of any change in the underlying rates which should be reflected in the revenue recognised.
A sample of temporary workers in the Resource Solutions business where there was no change in the 
underlying rates was also selected for testing. 
We confirmed that it was appropriate that the revenue recognised in respect of these temporary workers  
did not change through agreeing to the contract.
Key observations We did not identify any reportable misstatements or significant deficiencies in internal controls as a result  
of our audit work.
We concluded that the provision for back-outs was conservative, but within an acceptable range compared 
to actual historical back-outs experienced.
We concluded that the revenue for temporary placements during the period was recognised appropriately.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Recoverability of trade receivables 
Key audit matter 
description
Gross trade receivables at 31 December 2017 were £166.9m (2016: £187.0m). 
Whilst historically the Group has not suffered from a significant level of write-offs, given the relatively small  
balances due from a large number of customers, significant management judgement is required in estimating  
the appropriate level of provision against trade receivables.
The Group’s policy is to record a provision based on anticipated recoverable cash flows, nature of counterparty, 
past due date, geographical location, the costs of recovery and the fair value of any guarantee received,  
as detailed in the Accounting Policies note.
We have refined our approach to the risk we have identified around the recoverability of receivables.  
In previous years, this was focused on the entire receivables balance.
Our work in prior years has shown that the recoverability of the year-end receivables ledger is typically very 
high and the control environment around the receivables ledger is robust.
Both the Resource Solutions business and the temporary recruitment business predominantly deal with 
long standing clients, with whom the Group has strong relationships. 
By contrast, one-off clients are far more common in the permanent recruitment business, and this part  
of the business typically holds large numbers of small balances due from a variety of clients.
We have therefore focused our risk on aged balances (> 30 days overdue) relating to sales in the permanent 
recruitment business.
Please see page 52, where the Audit and Risk Committee has addressed this risk.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
In all full scope locations, we evaluated the design and implementation of the internal controls in place to ensure  
that an appropriate provision is recognised against trade receivables. In Australia, China, France, Hong Kong, 
Japan and the United Kingdom, we performed additional testing to confirm that these internal controls were 
operating effectively. 
We focused our substantive testing on higher risk balances on the basis of the ageing profile, collection 
history and the credit quality of the client. 
We agreed a sample of balances to subsequent cash receipts which supported the recoverability of the 
balance. Where cash had not subsequently been received at the date of testing, we have used alternative 
evidence to support the recoverability of the balance such as email correspondence between the Group 
and clients, proving that the service was provided, and historic payment patterns.
For certain components, debtor confirmations were also sent out for a sample of balances.
We evaluated the diligence applied by management in determining the risk associated with the recoverability 
of the receivables balance and tested the adequacy of provisioning by recalculating the provision for significantly 
aged balances, and considering receivables where the ageing profile of debtors has deteriorated or there is 
evidence that the credit quality of the debtor is considered a risk, and challenged management to justify why 
no provision is required.  
We analysed the make-up of the year-end provision for bad debts and assessed it against the bad debt cost  
experienced in the year. 
We performed a retrospective review, comparing the provision recognised at the end of 2016 with actual 
cash receipts against year-end balances during 2017, to determine the historical accuracy of management’s 
judgements. 
We also compared the level of provision recognised with a number of similar businesses within the recruitment 
industry, to determine if the Group was recognising a provision which was not in line with industry norms.
Additionally, we evaluated post year-end developments to determine whether any provisions required 
reversal or further provision.
Key observations We did not identify any reportable misstatements or significant deficiencies in internal controls as a result  
of our audit work.
We concluded that the provision for bad debts was in the middle of the acceptable range. 86 Robert Walters plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions 
of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work 
and in evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements
Materiality £1.75m (2016: £1.35m) £1.74m (2016: £1.34m)
Basis for determining  
materiality
4.3% of pre-taxation profit. This is consistent with 
the prior year.
0.2% of net assets
Rationale for the  
benchmark applied
Pre-taxation profit was selected as an appropriate 
benchmark for determining materiality based on 
market practice and investor expectations. This is  
consistent with the basis used in the prior year. 
The materiality used represents 0.5% of Group  
net fee income (2016: 0.5%) and 1.3% of equity 
(2016: 1.3%).
Net assets was selected as an appropriate 
benchmark for determining materiality, as the  
Parent Company does not trade, and acts only  
as a holding company.
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £87,500 (2016: 
£50,000) for the Group and the Parent Company, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit and Risk Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.

STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing  
the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. 
Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at six significant components, which were  
all subject to a full audit. 
The six significant components, being Australia, China, France, Hong Kong, Japan and the United Kingdom, represent the principal business 
units and account for 77% of the Group’s revenue (2016: 84%), 64% of the Group’s net fee income (NFI) (2016: 72%) and 69% of the 
Group’s total assets (2016: 80%). 
These components were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material 
misstatement identified above. Our audit work at the six significant components was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each 
individual entity, which were lower than Group materiality, and capped at £1,225,000 (2016: £877,500). 
In the prior year, the component in Singapore was also in scope, and is included within the prior year comparatives given above. Due to  
the small size of this component, and the rapid growth of the Resource Solutions activities both within and outside the United Kingdom 
in the past year, we have elected to replace our work on the component in Singapore with specified audit procedures performed on 
Resource Solutions in the USA. The extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the 
materiality of the Group’s operations in the Resource Solutions USA.
In addition, we also performed specified audit procedures at one other location, the Netherlands. The extent of our testing was based  
on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the materiality of the Group’s operations in the Netherlands. 
Our coverage from the components in scope for specified audit procedures was 4% of the Group’s revenue (2016: 2%), 7% of the Group’s 
net fee income (2016: 3%) and 6% of total assets (2016: 3%).
Specified audit procedures are procedures which are performed to address the risks of material misstatement arising from key balances 
(for the entities in scope these were revenue, accrued income and trade receivables). This is in contrast to a full audit, where procedures 
are performed on all material balances within a component.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that 
there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject 
to audit.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that the Senior Statutory Auditor 
or a senior member of the Group audit team visits, on an annual basis, a number of the in-scope components (three in the current year) 
where the Group audit scope was focused. In 2017, as well as the United Kingdom, this included visits to France and the Netherlands 
(2016: France, Japan and the Netherlands). 
Annually, for each of the six in-scope components (and any offices where specified audit procedures are performed), we include the 
component audit team in our team briefing, discuss and agree their risk assessment and audit approach before their work commences, 
attend the audit close meetings either via telephone, teleconference or in person, and, for all components where this is not prohibited  
by local laws and regulations, review a selection of working papers on scoped significant audit risks. 
The Parent Company is located in the UK, and is audited by the Group audit team.

Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report 
(the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report), other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report,  
we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears 
to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material 
misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, 
we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information 
include where we conclude that:
–  Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the Directors that they consider the Annual Report and financial statements 
taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
–  Audit and Risk Committee reporting – the section describing the work of the Audit and Risk Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit and Risk Committee; or
–  Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the Directors’ statement required under 
the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for 
review by the Auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal controls as the Directors determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

1.  An immaterial adjustment of £1.25 million has been made to increase brought forward retained earnings. £0.195 million of this adjustment related to the 2015 
financial year. The adjustment was made in order to recognise two changes in the prior year in the application of the revenue recognition policy in part of the 
business (the impact on the equivalent balance sheet and income statement captions is similarly immaterial).
  The first change relates to permanent placements. These were previously recognised by this component when a candidate started a position. However, given 
the maturity of the market for this part of the business, the Group considers that it is more appropriate to recognise this revenue when the candidate accepts a 
position and the start date is determined, in line with the rest of the Group, as this reflects the underlying agreements. A provision is made for candidates who fail 
to start employment after accepting the offer and is based on the historic rate of “back-outs”. The adjustment has not been treated as a change in accounting 
policy, under IAS 8, as it is not material.
  The second change relates to temporary placements. The adjustment made is to recognise the impact of timesheets received after the year-end date, where work 
was performed during the 2016 financial year. The adjustment has also not been treated as a change in accounting policy, under IAS 8, as it is not material.
STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 94 Robert Walters plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
Robert Walters plc is a public company limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act.
The financial report for the year ended 31 December 2017 has been prepared in accordance with the historic cost convention and with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), including International Accounting Standards and Interpretations as adopted for use 
by the European Union.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. This is discussed in the Financial Review on page 41.
The principal accounting policies of the Group are summarised below and have been applied consistently in all aspects throughout the 
current year and preceding year.
(a) Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Robert Walters plc and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 
31 December each year. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly 
or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
(b) Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate  
of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group  
in exchange for control of the acquiree.
All costs directly attributable to the business combination are accounted for as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred 
and the services received. The only exception to this is in respect of the costs incurred to issue debt or equity securities, which should 
be recognised in accordance with IAS 32 and IAS 39. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the  
conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal 
groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, 
which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business 
combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after 
reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds 
the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Non-controlling interests in the acquired entity are initially measured at the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the net fair value of the 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
(c) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings, representing any excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the 
fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, is not amortised but reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment 
is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the net 1 January 2004 Pounds Sterling UK GAAP  
amounts, subject to being tested for impairment at that date. On disposal the attributable amount of goodwill is included in determining 
the profit or loss on disposal.
(d) Taxation
Current taxation, including UK corporation taxation and foreign taxation, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) 
using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates except where 
the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred taxation is reviewed at each balance sheet date and is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted 
by the end of the reporting period.
Current and deferred taxation is recognised in the income statement except when the taxation relates to items charged or credited directly 
to equity, in which case the taxation is also recognised in equity.
STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report and Accounts 2017  Robert Walters plc 95
(e) Employee share schemes
The cost of awards made under the Group’s employee share schemes after 7 November 2002 is based on the fair value of the shares 
at the time of grant and is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the 
Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a stochastic model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best 
estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. A liability equal to the portion of the 
services received is recognised at the current fair value determined at each balance sheet date for cash-settled share-based payments.
(f) Revenue
Revenue comprises the value of services, net of VAT and other sales-related taxes, provided in the normal course of business. Any bad  
debt provision that may be deemed necessary is treated as an administrative expense. The Group provides a breadth of services to clients 
with revenue generated by all service offerings, including recruitment process outsourcing, primarily due to the placement of permanent 
and temporary candidates. There are occasions where the Group will manage the recruitment supply chain on behalf of a client and in such 
cases a fee is received in respect of the work performed managing a supply chain. This is in accordance with IAS 18 and on the basis 
of work to date compliant with IFRS 15 and is not considered a matter of judgement. The cash value of funds managed during 2017 was 
£2.8bn (2016: £2.5bn). 
Revenue from the placement of permanent staff on non-retained assignments is recognised when a candidate accepts a position and  
a start date is determined. A provision is made for the cancellation of placements prior to or shortly after the commencement of employment 
based on past experience of this occurring. For retained assignments revenue is recognised on completion of defined stages of work. 
Revenue from temporary placements represents the amounts billed for the services of temporary staff including the salary costs of those 
staff. This is recognised as the service is provided, to the extent that the Group is acting as a principal. Where the Group is not considered 
to act as a principal, the salary costs of the temporary staff are excluded from revenue and only the net margin is recognised as revenue. 
Revenue in respect of outsourcing and consultancy is recognised as the service is provided.
(g) Gross profit (net fee income)
Gross profit is the total placement fees of permanent candidates, the margin earned on the placement of contract candidates and 
advertising margin. It also includes the outsourcing and consultancy margin earned by Resource Solutions.
(h) Operating profit
Operating profit is the total revenue less the total associated costs incurred in the production of revenue. The only items that are excluded 
from operating profit are finance costs (including foreign exchange), investment income and expenditure, taxation, and, if deemed 
appropriate, amounts that are identified as non-recurring material items.
(i) Finance income
Interest received is recorded as finance income in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which it is received.
(j) Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date, with any gain  
or loss that may arise as a result being included in net profit or loss for the period.
The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates 
ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and the results of overseas operations 
are dealt with through other comprehensive income and reserves, and recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which  
an operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity 
and translated at the closing rate. The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the 
date of transition to IFRSs as Pounds Sterling denominated assets and liabilities.
(k) Property, plant and equipment and computer software
Property, plant and equipment and computer software are stated at cost, net of depreciation and amortisation. Depreciation and 
amortisation are provided on all property, plant and equipment and computer software at rates calculated to write off the cost, less 
estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, as follows:
− Leasehold improvements and finance leases: the shorter of estimated useful life and the period of the lease;
− Motor vehicles: 17.5%;
− Fixtures, fittings and office equipment: 10% to 20%; and
− Computer equipment and computer software: 20% to 33.3%.
Depreciation and amortisation are recognised in administration expenses.
STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 96 Robert Walters plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
(l) Leases
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
(m) Investments
Investments are shown at cost, less provision for impairment where appropriate.
(n) Receivables
Trade and other receivables are recorded at cost, less any provision for impairment.
(o) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
(p) Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
(q) Pensions
The Group currently contributes to the money purchase pension plans of certain individual Directors and employees. Contributions payable 
in respect of the year are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement.
(r) Provisions
A provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or contractive obligation as a result of a past event for which it is probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and when the amount can be reliably estimated. If the effect is material, 
provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects the current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
(s) Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers 
the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers 
nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its 
retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises  
a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
(t) Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled, or they expire.
Developments in accounting standards/IFRSs
There were no new IFRS or IFRIC interpretations that had to be implemented during the year that significantly affect these financial statements.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been 
issued but are not yet effective and have not yet been adopted by the EU:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (and the related Clarifications)
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 2 (amendments) Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions
IFRS 4 (amendments) Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts
IAS 40 (amendments) Transfers of Investment Property
IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (amendments) Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture
Annual Improvements to IFRSs  
2014-2016 Cycle
Amendments to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards  
and IFRS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advanced Consideration
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
The Directors have carried out an assessment of the adoption and potential impact of the standards listed below:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 introduces a new classification approach for financial assets and financial liabilities and becomes effective for accounting periods  
beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The categories of financial assets will be reduced from four to three and financial liabilities will 
be measured at amortised cost or fair value through profit and loss. The standard also prescribes an ‘expected credit loss’ model for 
determining the basis of providing for bad debts. Following a review of the Group’s financial instruments, the Directors concluded that 
the Group does not hold any complex financial instruments and therefore do not expect this to have a material impact on the financial 
statements.
STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report and Accounts 2017  Robert Walters plc 97
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. 
IFRS 15 will supersede the current revenue recognition guidance including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and the 
related interpretations when it becomes effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. A comprehensive review 
of the contracts that exist across the Group’s revenue streams has been completed and it was concluded that revenue recognition under 
IFRS 15 is expected to be consistent with the Group’s revenue recognition policy and there would have been no material impact on the 
financial statements had IFRS 15 been applied in the current reporting period.
IFRS 16 Leases
The full impact of IFRS 16 is currently under review, including understanding the practical application of the principles of the standard.  
It is therefore not feasible to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of the adoption of the standard until this review has been completed. 
However, IFRS 16 will require the Group to recognise a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for most of these leases previously treated as  
operating leases when it becomes effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. This will affect both non-current  
and current liabilities, fixed assets and the measurement and disclosure of expense associated with the leases which under the new 
standard will be treated as depreciation and financing expense which were previously recognised as operating expense over the term  
of the lease.
Certain other new accounting standards, amendments to existing accounting standards and interpretations which are in issue but not 
yet effective either do not apply to the Group or are not expected to have any material impact on the Group’s net results or net assets.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectation of 
future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates and 
assumptions, actual outcomes could differ from those assumptions and estimates. 
−  Revenue recognition: revenue from the placement of permanent staff is recognised when a candidate accepts a position and a start 
date is determined. A provision is made by management, based on historical evidence, for the proportion of those placements where 
the candidate is expected to reverse their acceptance prior to the start date.
−  Bad debt provisioning: at each balance sheet date each subsidiary evaluates the collectability of trade receivables and records a 
provision based on anticipated recoverable cash flows, nature of counterparty, past due date, geographical location, the costs of 
recovery and the fair value of any guarantee received.
Critical accounting judgements 
Management has identified the timing of revenue recognition as a critical judgement in arriving at the amounts recognised in the Group’s 
financial statements.
−  Revenue recognition: revenue in respect of permanent placements is deemed to be earned when a candidate accepts a position and 
a start date is agreed, but prior to employment commencing. In making this judgement, management considered the detailed criteria 
for the recognition of revenue from permanent placements.

The carrying value of goodwill primarily relates to the acquisition of Talent Spotter in China (£1,199,000) and the historic acquisition of the  
Dunhill Group in Australia (£6,847,000). The historical acquisition cost of Talent Spotter was £768,000, with the movement to the current 
carrying value a result of foreign currency translation differences. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if there 
are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable amount of the goodwill is based on value in use in perpetuity. The key 
assumptions in the value in use are those regarding expected changes to cash flow during the period, growth rates and discount rates.
Estimated cash flow forecasts are derived from the most recent financial budgets and an assumed average growth rate of 5% for years  
two and three, which does not exceed the long-term average potential growth rate of the respective operations. The forecast for revenue 
and costs as approved by the Board reflect the latest industry forecasts and management expectations based on past experience. 
The value of the cash flows is then discounted at a post-tax rate of 10.5% (pre-tax rate of 14.4%), based on the Group’s estimated weighted 
average cost of capital and risk adjusted depending on the location of goodwill. The weighted average cost of capital has also been 
adjusted for a terminal growth rate, between 2-3% depending on location, for year four onwards.
Management has undertaken sensitivity analysis taking into consideration the impact in key assumptions. This included reducing the 
cash flow from year two onwards by 0%, 10% and 20% in absolute terms. The sensitivity analysis shows no impairment charge would 
arise under each scenario.

Group balance sheet at the date of transaction of £532,000. 
Under the legal form of this transaction, 30% of the ordinary shares are still owned by Talent Spotter, but in substance the control  
of these shares has come under the control of the Group. 
Total payment of Renminbi 19,200,000 (£1,909,000) was made by the Group between September 2012 and 31 December 2014.

At 31 December 2017 , no deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £16.2m (2016: £13.9m) relating to the unremitted 
earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing and reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable 
that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets of £2.1m (2016: £2.2m) have been recognised in respect of carried forward losses and latest forecasts show that 
these are expected to be recovered against future profit streams.
The Group has total unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to tax losses of £5.2m (2016: £4.9m) of which £0.8m (2016: £1.8m) have  
no time restriction over when they can be utilised, and the remaining £4.4m (2016: £3.1m) are time restricted, for which the weighted average

16. Financial risk management
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade receivables, trade payables, etc. 
that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Group’s operations. The Group 
has not entered into derivative transactions and no gains or losses on hedges have been incurred.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are foreign currency risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and interest rate risk. 
(i) Financial assets
Surplus cash balances are invested in financial institutions with favourable credit ratings that offer competitive rates of return, while still 
providing the Group with flexibility in its cash management.

1.  Included in the Hong Kong Dollars cash balance is £3.3m (2016: £3.6m) of restricted cash held on deposit as security against the Chinese Renminbi bank loan.
Further details of this loan are provided in note 13.
All financial assets, as detailed above, are at floating rate. There is no material difference between the fair value and the carrying value  
of the financial assets.
(ii) Currency exposures
The main currencies of the Group are Pounds Sterling, the Euro, Australian Dollars and Yen. The Group does not have material 
transactional exposures because in the local entities, revenues and costs are in their functional currencies.
There are no material net foreign exchange exposures to monetary assets and monetary liabilities.
The Group has translation exposure in accounting for overseas operations and its policy is not to hedge against this exposure.
(iii) Liquidity risk
The Group’s overall objective is to ensure that at all times it is able to meet its financial commitments as and when they fall due.
Surplus funds are invested on short-term deposit. Short-term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities, if appropriate.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net cash of £31.1m and equity of the Group, comprising issued share capital,  
reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 17 and 18.
Details of the Group’s bank overdrafts and loans facilities are disclosed in note 13.
(iv) Interest rate risk
The Group manages its cash funds through its London head office and does not actively manage its exposure to interest rate 
fluctuations. Surplus funds in the UK earn interest at a rate linked to the Bank of England base rate.
Surplus funds in other countries earn interest based on a number of different indices, varying from country to country.
(v) Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and investments. The Group’s credit risk  
is primarily in respect of trade receivables.
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group  
has adopted a policy of only dealing with counterparties that are deemed creditworthy and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate, 
as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Group transacts with entities that are considered to have adequate 
credit ratings. This information is supplied by independent rating agencies where available and if not available the Group uses other 
publicly available financial information and its own trading records to rate its major customers.
NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS CONTINUED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report and Accounts 2017  Robert Walters plc 109
16. Financial risk management continued  
The Group’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are regularly monitored. Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty 
limits that are reviewed and approved by management.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of clients, spread across industry sectors and geographical locations. In a number  
of territories in which the Group operates, particularly in the contract and interim businesses, invoices are contractually payable on demand. 
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, if considered appropriate, credit guarantee 
insurance cover is purchased.
Balances which are considered uncollectable either in part or for the whole amount are written down on a specific basis. The amount  
of the write-down takes into account an estimate of the recoverable cash flows, nature of counterparty, past due date, geographical area,  
the costs of recovery and the fair value of any guarantee received. The Group has provided fully for all receivables over 120 days because 
historical experience is such that receivables past due beyond 120 days have a significantly higher risk associated with collectability.
The maximum exposure of credit risk for trade receivables is represented by their carrying value, net of impairment.
Out of trade receivables totalling £163.3m at 31 December 2017 (2016: £183.7m), balances totalling £123.2m (2016: £145.3m) are not 
due. The amount of trade receivables past due up to one month are £27.5m (2016: £28.3m) and past due greater than one month are 
£16.2m (2016: £13.4m). The amount of trade receivables outstanding by more than 90 days from invoice date at 31 December 2017  
was £1.5m (2016: £2.7m). The level of bad debt provision at 31 December 2017 was £3.6m (2016: £3.3m).
(vi) Financial liabilities
The Group financed its operations during the year through a mixture of retained earnings and also has a Renminbi loan, which was taken  
out in 2008, and a four-year committed Pounds Sterling sales financing facility, expiring in December 2020. The average effective interest  
rate for 2017 on the sales financing facility approximates to 2.75% and is determined upon the lenders’ published rate plus 2.25%. As the  
rates are floating, the Group is exposed to cash flow risk. Further details in respect of these loans are disclosed in note 13 to the accounts.
The Group’s sensitivity to foreign currency has decreased during the year as repayments have been made on the bank loans. Trade and 
other payables are settled within normal terms of business and are payable in less than 120 days.

of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Exercise of the Executive Share Options is subject to the achievement of a percentage increase in earnings per share which exceeds 
the percentage increase in inflation by at least an average 8% per annum, over a period of three financial years of the Group.
On satisfaction of these performance targets, 33.33% of the options vest. Vesting then increases progressively with the Executive Share 
Options fully vesting where earnings per share growth matches the UK retail price index plus an average of 14% per annum.

The awards outstanding at 31 December 2017 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 15 months (2016: 17 months).
No awards expired during the year (2016: none).

Expected volatility has been calculated over the period of time commensurate with the remainder of the performance period immediately 
prior to the date of grant. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based upon management’s best estimate, for the effects  
of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Under the terms of the PSP the number of shares receivable by Executive Directors for a nominal value is dependent upon the total 
shareholder return (TSR) and the earnings per share (EPS) growth over the three-year period from the initial date of grant. In the case 
of co-investment awards, the continued ownership of qualifying shares in the Company is also required. As such it is not possible to 
determine the interests of the individual Directors prior to the completion of the vesting period, although no shares will vest if the TSR 
performance does not at least equal the performance of the FTSE Small Cap Index or the EPS compound annual growth exceed 8%. 
For all of the PSP shares to vest, the TSR must exceed the FTSE Small Cap Index by a compound 12.5% per annum and the EPS 
compound annual growth must also exceed 14%.
The Group recognised an expense of £5,324,000 (2016: £4,590,000) during the year in respect of equity-settled share-based payment 
transactions and £nil (2016: £nil) in respect of cash-settled share-based payment transactions.
The liability for cash-settled share-based payment transactions at 31 December 2017 was £nil (2016: £nil).
19. Reserves
The other reserves of the Group include a merger reserve of £83,379,000 (2016: £83,379,000), a capital reserve of £9,301,000 (2016:

The own shares are held by an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) to satisfy the potential share obligations of the Group. The Company also 
has an obligation to make regular contributions to the EBT to enable it to meet its financing costs. £1.8m of own shares were purchased 
into the EBT at an average price of £4.03 in 2017. Rights to dividends on shares held by the EBT have been waived by the trustees. 
Charges of £42,000 (2016: £51,000) have been reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of the EBT.
The number and market value of own shares held at 31 December 2017 was 6,172,248 (2016: 6,825,151) and £36,509,000 (2016:

25. Accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies of the Company are summarised below and have been applied consistently in all aspects throughout 
the current year and the preceding year.
(a) Basis of accounting
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The Company meets the 
definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 (Financial Reporting Standard 100) issued by the Financial Reporting Council. 
The financial statements have therefore been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 (Financial Reporting Standard 101) ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’ as issued by the Financial Reporting Council. 
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under the standard in relation to 
share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, 
presentation of a cash flow statement, disclosure of standards not yet effective and certain related party transactions.
Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis. The principal accounting policies adopted are the same  
as those set out in the Statement of Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements on page 94 except as noted below. 
The Company has made no critical judgement and there are no key sources of estimation uncertainty in arriving at the amounts in the 
Company’s financial statements.
(b) Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange 
prevailing at that date.
The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the 
rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and the results of overseas 
operations are dealt with through reserves.
(c) Investments
Investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment where appropriate.
