VAN ELLE HOLDINGS PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Dear	Shareholder,
I	am	delighted	to	announce,	on	behalf	of	the	Board	of	
Van Elle Holdings	plc,	a positive	set	of	results	for	the	year	
ended 30 April	2017.	This	is	the first	full	year	statement	following	
the successful	Initial	Public	Offering	(“IPO”)	on	the	Alternative	
Investment	Market	(“AIM”)	of	the	London	Stock	Exchange	in	
October 2016.	
Van	Elle’s	equity	story,	which	centred	around	the	Company’s	
leading	position	in	the	UK,	its	differentiated	offering	and	attractive	
end	markets,	supported	by	a	strong	financial	profile,	a	well	invested	
platform	and	a	strategy	for	growth,	was	well	received	by	investors.
Although	we	have	only	been	a	quoted	company	for	a	short	time,	
I believe	that	we	have	made	much	progress	across	the	business	
and confidence	is	high.	It	is	thanks	to the	hard	work	put	in	by	our	
talented	management	team,	as	well	as	those	working	across	and	
with	the	business,	that	we	could	make	this	progress	and	create	
the foundation	from	which	to continue	to	grow	our	operation.
Highlights
I	am	pleased	that	in	our	maiden	results	as	a	quoted	company	
Van Elle has	reported	an	11.8%	increase	in	revenue	to	£94.1m	
(2016:	£84.2m)	and	an	underlying	operating	profit	of	£11.6m	
(2016:	£11.1m),	representing	a	record	year	and	continuing	our	
impressive	year‑on‑year	profitable	growth.
These	results	reflect	our	continuing	strategic	drive	to	focus	on	
growth	markets,	enabled	by	targeted	investment	in	specialist	rigs,	
expansion	of	our	precast	concrete	manufacturing	capabilities	and	
further	expansion	of our	geographical	footprint	in	Scotland,	
serviced	by	a	dedicated	facility	at	Blantyre,	Glasgow.
The	IPO	in	October	2016,	together	with	the	funds	raised,	strengthens	
our	balance	sheet	and	gives	us	the	flexibility	to	invest	in	new	
equipment	and	consider	acquisitions	that	complement	our strategy	
for	growth.
As	a	company,	we	have	worked	hard	to	bring	together	a team	that	has	
the	right	combination	of	sector	knowledge	and	corporate	experience	
to	enable	us	to	deliver on	our	vision	and strategy.
Dividend
As	a	quoted	company,	one	of	our	key	ongoing	objectives	is	to	create	
shareholder	value.	The	Board	has	adopted	a	progressive	dividend	policy	
and,	having	paid	an	interim	dividend	of	0.85p,	is	recommending	a	final	
dividend	of	1.75p,	making	a	total	of	2.6p	for	the	financial	year.	
Chairman’s statement
Excellent progress in maiden year 
following successful IPO

STRATEGIC REPORT Board and governance
On	behalf	of	the	Board,	I	would	like	to	express	our	thanks	to	
Michael	Ellis,	who	retired	from	the	Board	in	December	2016.	
Michael,	along	with	his	wife,	Joan,	founded	the	business	some	
33 years	ago	and	their	contribution	during	that	time	has	been	
invaluable.	Michael	and	Joan	created	the	high‑quality	company	that	
Van	Elle	now	is	and	I	would	like	to	wish	them	a	happy	retirement.
I	am	delighted	to	follow	Michael	Ellis	as	Chairman	of	Van Elle Holdings	plc	
and	I	am	joined	by	Robin	Williams	as	Senior Independent	Director.	
Robin	chairs	the	Audit	Committee	and sits on the	Remuneration	and	
Nomination	Committees,	both	of which	I chair.	We	are	joined	on	the	
Board	by	the	two	Executive	Directors:	Jon	Fenton	as	Chief Executive	
Officer	and	Paul	Pearson	as Chief	Financial	Officer.	The Board	intends	
to	recruit	a	further	Non‑Executive	Director	to	broaden	the	experience	
and	support	offered	to	the	Company	during	the	new	financial	year.
I	would	also	like	to	thank	Thomas	Lindup,	who	left	the	Board	as	Executive 
Director	in	March 2017.	Thomas	joined	the	Company	in 2015	and	
helped	steer the	Group	through	its	successful	IPO	in October 2016.
As	a	board,	we	are	committed	to	promoting	the	highest	standards	
of corporate	governance	and	ensuring	effective	communication	
with	shareholders.	We	intend	to	apply	the	UK	Corporate	Governance	
Code	as	far	as	it	is	appropriate	for	a	company	of	its	size	and	our	
corporate	governance	statement	is	included	on	pages	36	and	37.
People
Van	Elle	has	an	outstanding	group	of	employees	and	we	continue	
to	place	great	importance	on	their	engagement.	Our	objective	is	
to provide	opportunities	for	development,	personal	growth	and	
successful	careers	with	the	Company.
All	our	staff	have	gone	through	a	year	of	significant	change.	They	
have	coped	admirably	and	delivered	an	excellent	result.	On	your	
behalf	and	on	behalf	of	the	Board,	I	wish	to	formally	record	our	thanks.
Outlook
The	fundamental	market	drivers	for	our	business	look	positive	in	
the	short	and	medium	terms.	The	order	book	remains	in	line	with	
our	expectations	and	we	are	well	placed	in	each	of	our	markets.	
This	is	an	exciting	time	to	be	part	of	Van	Elle	as	we	seek	to	build	
on the	performance outlined	in these	accounts.	As	a	profitable	and	
fast‑growing	geotechnical	engineering	company,	I	am	confident	
that	the	Company	has	an exciting	year	ahead.	The	Board	looks	
forward	to meeting	shareholders	at	the	Annual	General	Meeting	
(“AGM”)	on	12 September	2017.

VAN ELLE HOLDINGS PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Dear	Shareholder,
This	year	will	stand	out	as	being	transformational	in	the	development	
of	Van	Elle.	We	successfully	joined	AIM,	the	junior	market	of	the	
London	Stock	Exchange,	on	26	October	2016	after	extensive	
preparations.	This	step	is	important	for	the	Group	as	not	only	does	
it	give	us	access	to	equity	capital	markets	as	we	seek	to	grow the	
business,	but	it	has	also	resulted	in	enhanced	governance	and	
improved	discipline,	which	we	implemented	in	preparation	
for our IPO.	
You	have	already	heard	from	our	Chairman	on the	appointments	
to the	Board	and	the	corporate	governance	report	details	many	
of the	changes	and	improvements	that	have	already	been	made.	
I would	also	like	to	echo	the	words	of	our	Chairman	and	take	this	
opportunity	to	thank	our	founders,	Michael	and	Joan,	for	their	vision	
and	hard	work	over	the	last	33	years	and	to	reassure	them	that	the	
business	is	in	safe	hands	as	they	enjoy	their	well	earned	retirement.
Delivering the strategy
Van	Elle’s	strategy	can	be	framed,	quite	simply,	as	“Driving	
Profitable	Growth”.	We	aim	to	grow	the	business	by	broadening	
our range	of	products	and	services	and	extending	our	geographical	
footprint	into	high‑growth	markets.	This	will	be	achieved	both	
organically	and	selectively	through	acquisitions.
Capital	investment	has	been	a	key	driver	of	our	growth	with	a	further	
£11.8m	spent	in	the	current	year	bringing	the	total	to	£31.5m	over	
the	last	three	years.	Our	rig	fleet	now	stands	at	111	rigs	(2016: 98 rigs)	
and	we	believe	that	Van	Elle	has	the	broadest	and	most	modern	
range	of	specialist	piling	rigs	in	the	market.	Some	of	our	recent	
additions	and	innovations	are	detailed	within	the	strategic	
overview on page 13. 
Following	our	successful	move	into	rail	infrastructure	and	after	
swiftly	becoming	one	of	the	sectors	leading	on‑track	ground	
engineering	specialists,	we	have	recently	completed	works	on	our	
new	test	track	located	at	our	Kirkby‑in‑Ashfield	site.	As	one	of	the	
largest	privately	owned	specialist	facilities	in	the	country,	it	is	
designed	to	enable	us to test	equipment,	develop	new	techniques	
and	practice	for	complex	projects.	There	is no	other	UK	specialist	
putting	such	time and	resource	into	developing	innovative	
solutions	for	the	UK’s rail	network.
As	part	of	our	continued	development,	the	Group	is	launching	
its own	training	academy	to	deliver	an	unequalled	standard	of	
training	to	all	industry	professionals	and	companies.	Our	brand	
new state‑of‑the‑art,	purpose‑built	training	facility	is	due	for	
completion	late	summer	2017.
To	extend	our	geographical	footprint,	we	have	recently	invested	
in a new	factory,	offices	and	a	maintenance	depot	in	Blantyre	
near Glasgow.	We	often	work	on	large	schemes	in	Scotland	and

see	this	commitment	to	Scotland	as	the	next	step	in	delivering	a	
truly	comprehensive	service	for	years	to	come.
We	continue	to	pursue	acquisition	opportunities	and	discussions	are	
ongoing	with	several	interested	parties.	We	have	discounted	certain	
targets	due	to	unrealistic	price	expectations	and	lack	of	fit;	however,	
there	remains	a	positive	pipeline	of	good opportunities.
Trading performance
I	am	pleased	that	we	successfully	grew	revenues	by	11.8%	in	
the year	to	£94.1m	(2016:	£84.2m),	our fourth	successive	year	of	
double‑digit	revenue	growth.	UK	construction	output	grew	by	2.2%	
for	the	same	period,	reflecting	our	view	that	we	continue	to	grow	our	
market	share.	We	also	maintained	our	record	of	profitable	growth	
since	2010.	We	report	in detail	on	the	financial	performance	of	
Van Elle	during	the	year	on pages	30	to	33.
In	terms	of	our	performance	in	the	end	markets,	sales	to	the	
housebuilding	sector	were	up	24.4%	to	£42.5m	(2016:	£34.2m)	and 
infrastructure	sector	were	up	17.3%	to	£28.9m	(2016:	£24.6m).	Sales to 
the	commercial	and	industrial	sector	reduced	by	17.0%	to £18.8m	
(2016:	£22.7m)	which	was,	in	part	a	reflection	of	some	short‑term	
market	uncertainty	and	the	deferral	or	cancellation	of several	
projects	but also	reflects	the	completion	of	several	large	education	
and	retail	projects	by	the	Company	in	the	previous	year.	The	ability	
to	redirect	resources	to	reflect	short‑term	trends	in	our	markets	is	a	
key strength	of	the	business,	mitigating	the	impact of	a	slowdown	
in any one sector.
As	we	reported	in	March	2017,	the	Group	experienced	a	challenging	
period	in	its	rail	business	during	the	fourth	quarter	with	the	start	
dates	for	several	contracts	delayed	and	expected	call‑off	and	work	
distribution	schedules	revised.	Whilst	we	have	seen	some	encouraging	
signs	of	stabilisation	in	the	market,	and	remain	confident	in	the	
long‑term	structural	growth	opportunity	in	rail,	we	are	remaining	
cautious	as	to	the	near‑term	outlook	for	the	sector.
Operating performance
Sales	have	grown	in	each	of	our	operating	segments,	with	a	particularly	
strong	performance	in	Ground	Engineering	Products,	up	71.2%	to	
£10.4m	(2016:	£6.1m).	This	has	been	driven	by	a	significant	increase	
in	demand	for	Smartfoot
®
 as well as additional precast concrete 
products	and	our	additional	investment	in	manufacturing	capacity	
has	enabled	this demand	to	be	met.
Sales	growth	was	also	strong	in	Specialist	Piling,	up	16.6%	to	£30.1m	
(2016:	£25.8m),	enabled	by	our	investment	in	several	specialist	rigs	
and	equipment	during	the	year.	The	restricted	access	business	performed 
strongly,	including	securing	its	largest	ever	contract	at	Eden	Brows.	
The division’s	profit	result	though	was	adversely	impacted	by	the	
weaker‑than‑expected	performance	in	the	higher	margin	rail	business	
during	the	fourth	quarter.
General	Piling	has	seen	sales	growth	in	the	year,	up	1.9%	to	£42.9m	
(2016:	£42.1m),	a	result	of	the	healthy	housebuilding	sector	offset	by	
reduced	demand	for	industrial	and	commercial	work.	Divisional	gross	
margin	remained	strong	at	32%	(2016:	31%),	reflecting	the	Group’s	
ability	to	deliver	a	large	number	of	contracts	across	a	broad	range	of	
end	markets,	achieving	good	returns	through	its	long‑standing	and	
effective	operational	model.	
Ground	Engineering	Services	has	increased	its	sales	by	4.6%	
to £10.6m	(2016:	£10.2m),	boosted	by	the establishment	
of a stand‑alone	operation	in	Scotland	during	January	2017.
Further	details	of	the	operational	performance	of	each	division	are	
included	in	the	operating	review	on	pages	22	to	29	and	in	note	5	
of the	consolidated	financial	statements.	
Outlook
Trading	in	the	new	financial	year	has	started	well	and	is	in	line	with	
our	expectations.	We	are	seeing	opportunities	with	each	of	our	
markets	as	we	continue	our	strategy	of	broadening	our	range	of	
products	and	services.	We	continue	to	actively	monitor	conditions	
in	our	core	markets	and,	whilst	mindful	of	the	risks	posed	by	any	
sustained	period	of	political	or	economic	uncertainty,	we	are	
cautiously	optimistic	for	further	progress	in	the	year	ahead.
I	continue	to	believe	that,	with	our	growth	strategy	described	above,	
Van	Elle	is	well	positioned	to	deliver	further	value	to	shareholders	
in the	year	ahead.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Market overview
Diverse and adaptable 
end-market profile
UK construction market overview
The	key	underlying	construction	markets	for	the	Group	are	the	
housebuilding,	infrastructure,	commercial	and	industrial	sectors.
These	markets,	except	for	the	industrial	sector,	have	either	been	stable	
or	growing	steadily	since	the	financial	crisis.	Total	construction	output	
has	grown	at	a	compound	rate	of	2.7%	p.a.	since	2009	but	registered	
a more	modest	growth	rate	of	2.2%	in	the	year	ended	30	April	2017.
We	attribute	this	steady	growth	to	three	factors:
 l an	acute	shortage	of	housing	and	rising	house	prices	helping	
to stimulate	development;
 l the	establishment	of	the	National	Infrastructure	Commission	
to advise	the	Government	on	major	long‑term	infrastructure	
challenges;	and
 l interest	rates	at	record	low	levels,	good	availability	of	credit	
and a	generally	supportive	economic	backdrop.
Van	Elle	revenue	growth	of	11.8%	in	the	current	year	versus	
an underlying	market	growth	of	only	2.2%	is	an	exceptional	
performance	and	reinforces	the	growth	strategy	being	pursued	
by the	Directors	as	they	seek	to	increase	market	share.
As	new	housing	and	infrastructure	continue	to	generate	strong	
revenues,	our	strategy	is	to	direct	our	resources	and	investment	
into	these	sectors.
The	reduction	in	the	commercial	and	industrial	sector	reflects	the	
completion	of	several	large	contracts	in	the	year	ended	30	April	2016	
and	some	short‑term	uncertainty	in	the	wake	of	the	EU	referendum.	
This	strategy	highlights	the	Group’s	ability	to	adapt	to	changing	
conditions	and	align	resources	with	markets	with	a	higher	
growth potential.
Outlook
In	April	2017,	the	Construction	Products	Association	(“CPA”)	
published	its	forecast	of	UK	construction	output,	which	is	shown	
opposite.	It	expects	that	uncertainty	created	by	the	referendum	
result	has	potentially	caused	some	projects	in	certain	sectors	
to be put	on	hold.
In	our	view,	given	the	ongoing	chronic	shortage	of	housing	and	
the economic	multiplier	effect	of	well	targeted	infrastructure	
investment,	we	believe	it	is	logical	that	these	two	sectors	should	
receive	considerable	further	support	from	the	Government.
UK construction 
output 2016/17 (£bn)
The	demand	for	geotechnical	
engineering	services	in	the	UK	
is driven	primarily	by	the	level	
of construction	activity	across	a	
broad	range	of	end	markets,	both	
in the	public	and	private	sector.”

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Business model
A structured but simple approach 
to drive growth and profitability
Our resources
In	providing	geotechnical	solutions,	Van	Elle	
typically	operates	in	the	early	stages	of a	
construction	project.	We	are	often	the	first	
contractor	on	and	off	site,	consequently	working	
efficiently	to	minimise	costs	and	save	time	is	
critical	for	our	customer.	Whilst	the	contractor	
relationships	and	construction	processes	vary	
significantly	from	project	to	project,	ensuring	
work	is	completed	efficiently	is	critical	for	our	
customers	in	saving	them	money	and	providing	
a	sound	platform	for	the remaining	work	on	a	
project	in	terms	of	cost saving	and	programme.
Working	across	the	construction	spectrum,	
the majority	of	our	projects	are	of	short	duration	
with	an	average	value	of	less	than	£100,000.
Early	engagement	of	Van	Elle	usually	guarantees	
efficiencies	and	savings	are	realised	at	the	
beginning	of	a	project.	Particularly	so	with	the	
complex	projects	in	which	we	are	regularly	
asked	to	participate	in.
Depending	on	the	nature	of	a project,	Van	Elle	may	
provide	insights	into	design	and	other	phases	of	
the	construction	process, but	value	is created	
and captured	principally	from	our	groundwork	
activities.	Our products	and	services	are	not just	
about	foundations	for construction,	but are most	
commonly	geotechnical	solutions	to	complex

STRATEGIC REPORT Our strategy  
in action
Larger and deeper 
CFA piling
Van	Elle’s	Llamada	P160TT	delivers	a	CFA	
capability	unequalled	by	any	other	company	
operating	in	the	UK,	enabling	us	to	install	
large	diameter	CFA	piles	to	a	greater	depth	
and also delivering increased production 
and reliability.
Van Elle further 
expands its 
product portfolio
An	increase	in	large	civil	
engineering	projects,	retaining	
wall	solutions	and	basements	
and	a	requirement	for	more	
accuracy	have	resulted	in	
innovative solutions being 
considered for rotary bored 
piles.	To	tackle	this	Van	Elle	has	
acquired	a	Soilmec	SR‑95:	this	
large,	powerful	and	adaptable	
rig	allows	us	to	install	cased	CFA	
piling	to	satisfy	the	above	
mentioned	chief	requirements	
but	with	increased	productivity	
compared	to	traditional	methods.

Van Elle Rail invests in follow-on 
civil engineering capabilities
Further	to	investment	in	the	world’s	first	two	Colmar	
T12000FS	RRVs	earlier	this	year,	Van	Elle	Rail	has	recently	
taken	delivery	of	two	state‑of‑the‑art	Colmar	T10000FSCG	
road	rail	cranes.	The	first	of	their	class	worldwide,	they	
expand	our	track	capability	allowing	us	to	do	continuous	
lifting	works	after	our	piling	such	as	masts,	signals	and	
also	specialist	lifts	such	as	footbridges.
Van Elle invests in new rail test track 
As	part	of	our	commitment	to	geotechnical	innovation	and	the	development	of	specialist	
rail	equipment	in	house,	combined	with	striving	to	maintain	our	position	as	the	number	
one	ground	engineering	contractor	both	on	and	off	the	rail	track,	we	have	constructed	
the	largest	rail	test	track	facility	in	the	UK.	This	allows	us	to	carry	out	practical	on‑track	
rail	training	to	personnel	and	also	testing	of	rail	equipment.	The	facility	will	also	soon	be	
open	for	third	party	hire.

to	grow	profitably	and	to	expand	our	margins.
Description
Tracking	our	underlying	profitability	ensures	
that	the	focus	remains	on	delivering	profitable	
outcomes	on	our	contracts.	It	is	a	measure	
of	pure	operating	performance	including	
depreciation	and	amortisation	charges	
but excluding	financing	and	tax.
Description
This	KPI	measures	our	after‑tax	earnings

Description

Description
This	measure	indicates	the	rate	of	return	
per pound	invested	in	the	operating	
assets of the	business.	Capital	employed	
is taken to	be	net	assets	excluding	net	
debt and earnings	is taken	as	underlying	
operating	profit.
Performance
Strong	revenue	growth	of	11.8%	in	the	year	
delivered	the	highest	turnover	ever	for	the	
Group.	The	Compound	Annual	Growth	Rate	
(“CAGR”)	over	the	last	three	years	is	26.4%	
p.a.,	which	reflects	our	investment	in	both	
our	facilities	and	specialist	equipment	and	
techniques	for	delivering	targeted	growth	
in end	markets.
Performance
Strong	underlying	EBITDA	growth	of	12.9%	
in	the	year	and	a	CAGR	of	51.6%	p.a.	over	
the	last	three	years.	This	measure	shows	that	
the	growth	in	revenue	has	been	achieved,	
but	not	at	the	expense	of	profitability.	EBITDA	
in	the	current	year	of	17.3%	is	the	highest	
level	achieved	by	the	Company	and	reflects	
the	investment	incurred	to	continue	our	
drive	towards	higher	margin	specialist	
activities,	focused	into	growth	end	markets.	
Performance
Underlying	operating	profit	is	up	4.6%	in	
the	year;	however,	the	underlying	operating	
margin	of	12.3%	is	down	slightly	on	last	
year’s	13.1%.	This	was	the	result	of	a	slow

quarter	experienced	in	rail,	which	did	not	
leverage	our	rig	utilisation	and	overhead	
due	to	revised	work	scheduling	and	project	
deferments	by	clients.
Performance
The	underlying	EPS	of	12.1p	is	consistent	
with	the	prior	year	and	reflects	the	additional

in October	2016	in	anticipation	of	funding	
future	acquisitions.	
Performance
High	operating	cash	conversion	of	91.9%	
in	the	year	gives	comfort	that	working	capital	
is	well	managed	and	that	operating	profits	
convert	into	cash	either	for	reinvestment	in	
the	business	or	distribution	to	shareholders.	
Performance
The	ROCE	of	30.6%	represents	an	excellent	
return	on	funds	invested	for	the	year.	It	is	
however,	a	reduction	from	earlier	years,	which	
reflects	the	significant	investments	incurred	
over	the	last	three	years.	During	this	growth

Increasing shareholder value
Risk management framework
The	Board	is	responsible	for	setting	the	
Group’s	risk	appetite	and	ensuring	that	
appropriate	risk	management	systems	are	
in	place.	The	Board	reviews	the	Group’s	
principal	risks	throughout	the year	as	
part of	its	normal	agenda,	adopting	an	
integrated	approach	to	risk	management	
by regularly	discussing	our	principal	risks.	
In	addition,	once	a year	the	Board	formally	
assesses	the Group’s	principal	risks,	taking	
the	strength	of	the	Group’s	control	systems	
and	its	appetite	for	risk	into	account.
How we identify risk
Our	risk	management	process	has	been	built	
to	identify,	evaluate,	analyse	and	mitigate	
significant	risks	to	the	achievement	of	our	
strategy.	Our	risk	identification	processes	
seek	to	identify	risks	from	both	a	top‑down	
strategic	perspective	and	a	bottom‑up	local	
operating	company	perspective.
The	principal	risks	and	uncertainties	identified	
by	management	and	how	they	are	being	
managed	are	set	out	opposite.	These	risks	
are not intended to be an extensive analysis 
of	all	risks	that	may	arise	in	the	ordinary	
course	of	business	or	otherwise.
The	principal	financial	risks	are	disclosed	in	
note	21	to	the	financial	statements	on	page	73.

VAN ELLE HOLDINGS PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Corporate	responsibility,	awareness	and	mitigation	of	adverse	
impacts	on	the	environment,	and	positive	engagement	with	our	
employees	and	the	local	community	have	long	been	core	values	
of Van	Elle.
Approach 
The	Company	is	committed	to	conducting	business	with	fairness,	
honesty	and	integrity.	The	Board	recognises	its	responsibility	for	
establishing	high	ethical	standards	of	behaviour	and	corporate	
governance,	and	the	Group	has	several	established	policies	in	place	
including,	but	not	limited	to:	anti‑bribery	and	corruption;	health	and	
safety;	environmental	protection;	sustainable	development;	quality	
assurance;	equal	opportunities;	equality	and	diversity;	training	and	
development;	whistleblowing;	and	modern	slavery,	supporting	our	
approach	to	conducting	business	in	an	open	and	transparent	manner.
The	Company	expects	its	employees	to	conduct	themselves	in	a	manner	
which	reflects	the	highest	ethical	standards,	and	comply	with	all	
applicable	laws	and	regulations.	Employees	are	judged	not	only	
on the	results	they	achieve,	but	also	on	how	they	achieve	them.	
Furthermore,	the	Company	has	a	zero‑tolerance	policy	towards	any	
form	of	bribery	or	corruption	and	has	training	and	an	appropriate	
procedure	in	place	whereby	any	concerns	in	relation	to	malpractice	
can	be	raised	in	an	appropriate	forum.
It	is	our	policy	to	ensure	that	the	highest	possible	standards	are	
achieved	and	maintained	throughout	the	Company	and	that	we	
strive	for	continual	improvement.	We	therefore	operate	an	integrated	
business	management	system	in	accordance	with	the	requirements	
of	ISO	9001,	ISO	14001	and	OHSAS	18001.
Safety
At	Van	Elle	the	health,	safety	and	well	being	of	its	staff	is	paramount	
and	every	precaution	is	taken	to	protect	them	and	fellow	contractors	
on	site.	As	the	largest	independent	geotechnical	engineering	contractor	
in	the	UK,	it	is	our	duty	and	priority	to	ensure	the	safety	of	our	
employees	whilst	at	work.
Our	dedicated	safety	team	undertakes	regular	internal	audits	of	our	
procedures	to	ensure	they	are	as	comprehensive	as	possible,	highlighting 
any	areas	for	improvement.	As	members	of	all	the	industry’s	best	
known	certification	and	qualification	schemes,	our	systems	are	
under	constant	review	by	external	bodies	promoting	best	practice.	
We	are	Network	Rail	Plant	Operations	Scheme	(“POS”)	providers	
and	are	active	members	of	the	Federation	of	Piling	Specialists	
(“FPS”)	and	the	British	Drilling	Association	(“BDA”).	
During	2008,	we	implemented	our	safety	campaign,	“Think	Safety,	
Act	Safely”.	This	has	produced	an	increase	in	the	reporting	of	hazards	
and	near	misses.	This	proactive	approach	has	improved	awareness	
and	helped	prevent	accidents	on	our	sites	and	in	our	yard	and	for	
other	contractors	working	alongside	us.	This	has	contributed	to	an	
overall downward trend of reportable incidents in recent years.
This	improving	trend	faltered	in	the	current	financial	year	where	we	
suffered	several	lost	time	accidents	over	the	second	half	of	the	year.	
This	remains	a	prime	focus	of	the	business	and	we	expect	the	incident	
rate	to	return	to	its	recent	levels	well	below	the	industry	average.	
All	our	engineers,	managers	and	directors	are	tasked	with	carrying	
out	monthly	compliance	and	safety	audits.	The	safety	scores	are	
linked	to	our	site	team's	performance	results.	
Van	Elle	is	an	accredited	CITB	training	provider,	delivering	the	health	
and	safety	awareness,	site	supervisor	safety	training	scheme	and	
site	management	safety	training	scheme	courses.	We	are	also	a	
CSCS	platinum	award	holder	with	96%	of	our	staff	holding	the	
relevant card. 
People
Investing in our workforce
At	the	heart	of	Van	Elle	lies	the	belief	that	our	people	are	our	greatest	
asset.	We	recognise	that	their	behaviours	and	choices	are	crucial	
to performance.	Fundamental	to	our	approach	is	the	knowledge,	
competence	and	skills	of	our	workforce	gained	through	awareness	
and	structured	training,	and	this	is	recognised	externally	where	
we hold	Investors	in	People,	silver	accreditation.
We	invest	heavily	in	our	workforce,	dedicating	time	and	resources	
so	that	they	can	develop	career	paths	within	the	Company.	In	
November	2016,	we	announced	a	£0.7m	investment	to	develop	a	
training	academy	for	our	staff.	As	we	continue	to	grow	significantly,	
it	is	important	that	we	have	the	right	facilities	to	equip	our	people	
with	the	skills	to	drive	the	Company	and	the	industry	forward.
Corporate social responsibility
Conducting business with 
fairness, honesty and integrity

STRATEGIC REPORT Recruitment and retention
An	important	part	of	our	HR	strategy	is	to	attract	talented	individuals	
who	can	demonstrate	and	live	by	our	values	and	behaviours	whilst	
delivering	business	results.	This	has	been	achieved	by	continuously	
improving	our	recruitment	process,	including	creating	strong	
partnerships	with	our	prime	recruitment	agencies.	We	have	also	
put career	structures	in	place	and	identified	successors	for	key	
roles,	so	that	people	can	see	how	they	can	develop	within	the	Group.
In	October	2016,	due	to	the	successful	IPO,	several	long‑serving	
employees	and	senior	executives	became	eligible	to	qualify	for	
share	options.	It	is	hoped	that	future	awards	will	be	made	to	retain	
and	incentivise	our	staff	and	allow	them	to	share	within	the	success	
of	the	Company.
Diversity and equality
The	Group	maintains	an	equality	and	diversity	policy,	selecting	
and promoting	employees	based	on	their	aptitudes	and	abilities.	
The	Group	is	committed	to	providing	equal	opportunities	to	all	
current	and	future	employees	and	values	the	difference	that	a	
diverse	workforce	can	contribute	to	the	organisation.	
The	Group	recognises	its	obligations	towards	employment	of	disabled	
people	and	gives	full	and	fair	consideration	to	suitable	applicants,	
having	regard	to	individuals’	aptitudes	and	abilities.	The	Company	
is	committed	to	ensuring	that	everyone	is	treated	equally	regardless	
of	disability	or	any	other	condition	which	cannot	be	shown	to	be	
relevant	to	their	performance.	The	Company	is	committed	to	ensuring	
that	any	individual	who	becomes	disabled	during	their	employment	
remains	in	their	own	role	where	possible,	or	is	employed	in	another	
suitable	position.	Training,	career	development	and	promotion	of	
disabled	employees	will	be,	as	far	as	possible,	identical	to	that	
of other	employees.
Whilst	facilitating	our	growth,	the	training	academy	will	provide	
individuals	with	opportunities	and	skills	to	develop	themselves	
and their	careers.	It	will	also	ensure	that	we	continue	to	maintain	
and	control	our	high	standard	of	training.
Due	to	open	late	summer	2017,	it	will	provide	improved	welfare	
facilities	for	our	employees,	including	a	canteen	and	gym.	
Communication
As	our	people	are	our	most	valuable	asset,	we	appreciate	the	mutual	
benefits	of	keeping	employees	informed	and	take	appropriate	steps	
to	ensure	that	they	are	kept	aware	of	matters	of	concern	and	factors	
that	affect	the	performance	of	the	Company.	We	value	the	views	of	
our	employees	and	consult	with	them,	or	their	representatives,	when	
making	decisions	which	affect	their	interests.
We	maintain	communication	channels	with	our	staff	using	a	combination 
of	face‑to‑face	meetings,	the	intranet,	the	website,	Works	Committee	
and newsletters.

Some	ways	in	which	we	minimise	the	impact	of	our	services	upon

 l dedicated	in‑house	research	and	development	of	new	products

Supporting charities and local communities
We	recognise	the	importance	of	engaging	with	local	communities	
and	are	involved	in	a	wide	range	of	schemes.	Local	projects	provide	
an	opportunity	to	assist	communities	using	our	skills,	time	and	financial	
support,	helping	to	ensure	our	work	leaves	a	lasting	positive	impact.
Each	year	we	invite	students	from	a	local	school	to	Van	Elle	for	their	
work	experience.	They	spend	two	weeks	with	us	and	have	the	chance	
to	experience	our	different	departments.	It	introduces	them	to	working	
life	and	the	many	different	roles	available	in	the	construction	industry.	
Children	from	the	same	school	recently	attended	a	tour	of	our	
recently	expanded	production	facilities	at	Kirkby‑in‑Ashfield.
Environment and sustainability
In	a	sector	where	the	use	of	steel	and	concrete	is	inevitable,	Van	Elle	
considers	this	subject	very	seriously	and	reviews	waste	reduction	and	
the	use	of	recycled	products	and	alternative	materials	at	
every opportunity.	
Our vision includes: 
 l the	use	of	competitive	local	suppliers;
 l working	with	our	supply	chain	to	propose	the	most	
environmentally	friendly	materials	for	each	project;
 l working	with	our	suppliers	to	develop	new,	more	sustainable	
materials	with	a	higher	recycled	content,	producing	less	waste	
product	and	requiring	less	water	usage;
 l reducing	and	avoiding	the	production	of	waste	when	on	site;	and
 l producing	engineered,	bespoke	solutions	in	house	to	address	
several	industry	requirements	including	sustainability.
We	rarely	subcontract	and	aim	to	use	only	fully	employed	labour,	
which	enables	us	to	use	site	teams	who	are	local	to	each	project,	
reducing	distances	travelled	and	in	turn	reducing	CO2	emissions.	
We	always	engage	with	the	communities	local	to	projects	
with which	we	are	involved,	welcoming	feedback	based	on	
our interaction	with	the	community,	the	impact	of	our	services,	
our responsibility	and	actions	taken.	
We	recognise	the	importance	of	
engaging	with	local	communities	
and are involved in a wide range

General Piling
The	General	Piling	division	has	the	largest	fleet	within	the	Group	
and offers	a	variety	of	ground	engineering	solutions	for	open‑site	
construction	projects.	
Revenue	growth	has	been	modest	at	1.9%	with	strong	housebuilding	
revenues	being	partially	offset	by	reduced	commercial	and	
industrial activity. 
Innovation	continues	to	drive	new	opportunities	with	the	division	
taking	delivery	of	a	Llamada	P160TT,	which	is	believed	to	be	the	UK’s	
largest	specialist	CFA	rig.	The	Directors	expect	this	new	rig	will	allow	
the	Group	to	offer	a	more	efficient	alternative	to	bored	piling,	opening	
up	new	opportunities	for	Van	Elle	in	additional	segments	of	the	market.	
By	leveraging	the	division’s	strong	market	position,	this	additional	
capacity	will	enable	Van	Elle	to	grow	its	market	share.	In	addition,	
the division	has	recently	acquired	two	Soilmec	truck	mounted	rigs,	
enabling	it	to deliver	mobile	piling	services	on	roads	and	motorways.
The	division’s	focus	on	rig	utilisation	and	operational	execution	
of its	contracts	has resulted	in	an	increase	in gross	margin

range	of	techniques	and	services	it	can	offer and	has	identified	
several	services,	including	displacement	piling	and	pulse	piling,	
which	are	not	currently	provided	by	the	Group.	By	offering	these

Portland Green, Newcastle
Over	the	past	few	years,	we	have	undertaken	drilling,	grouting	and	piling	work	for	new	student	
accommodation	blocks	at	Portland	Green	in	Newcastle.	
The	grouting	work	was	carried	out	to	stabilise	old	mine	workings	and	consisted	of 352	
boreholes,	over	750	tonnes	of	PFA	and	62	tonnes	of cement.	Although	the	foundations	for	the	
first	three	buildings	were	constructed	using	traditional	piling	techniques,	the	most	recent	three	
structures	required	a rotary	solution	to	advance	beyond	the	coal	seams.
The	extremely	powerful	LLamada	P160TT	CFA	rig	enabled	us	to	install	deeper	larger	piles	
than	would	otherwise	be	possible.	This	new	capability	meant	that	we	could	redesign	the

from	400	to	500mm	diameter	and	from	13	to	34m	in	depth),	significantly	reducing	both	the

Specialist Piling
The	Specialist	Piling	division	provides	a	range	of	piling	and	other	
geotechnical	solutions	in	operationally	constrained	environments	
such	as	inside	existing	buildings,	under	bridges,	in	tunnels	and	
basements	as	well	as	on‑track	rail environments.	
Revenue	growth	of	16.6%	was	driven	by	strong	performance	in	
restricted	access	with	Van	Elle	securing	its	largest	ever	contract	
at Eden	Brows,	which	is	detailed	in	the	case	study	opposite.	
The	reduction	in gross	margin	reflects	the	sales	mix	impact	
of deferred	rail	work.
The	Directors	believe	that	the	Group’s	competitive	position	within	
the	restricted	access	piling	market	is	particularly	strong	due	to	the	
high	technical	barriers	to	entry.	
The	Directors	believe	that	the	rail	sector	presents	a	particularly	
significant	growth	opportunity	for	the	Group	over	the	medium	term.	
Revenues	from	the	division’s	on‑track	services	have	grown	from	zero	
in	2013	to	nearly	£12.0m	in	2017	and	notwithstanding	some	of	the	
market	issues	in	the	fourth	quarter,	the	Directors	believe	that	the	
Group	is	well	positioned	to	win	additional	work.	The	Company	has	
constructed	its	own	100m‑long	test	track	to	carry	out	obligatory	rail	
track	tests	on	its	equipment,	which	is	also	being	used	as	a	training	
facility	and	will	be	offered	externally	to	third	parties.	
In	addition,	the	division	has	developed	a	large	diameter	rotary	
percussion	drilling	system	which	is	the	only	such	system	at	present	
available	to	Network	Rail	for	specific	use	on	the	rail	network.

In	the	winter	of	2015/16,	torrential	rains	lead	to	a	landslip and

Network	Rail’s	principal	contractor,	Story	Contracting,	appointed	
Aecom	to	undertake	the	design	work	and	Van	Elle	to	install	the	
226	piles	in	two	parallel	contiguous	rows.	The	“Up	Line”	piles	
were	in	compression	and	were	installed	to	20m	depth	whilst	the	
“Down	Line”	piles	were	in	tension	and	were	installed	to	18m	
depth	with	between	4m	and	18m	being	within	the	bedrock.	Van	
Elle	was	chosen	due	to	our	unique	experience	of	installing	the	
innovative	Elemex	air	drilling	technique.
In	all,	4040m	of	piles	were	drilled	and	it	was	the	first	time	that	
660mm‑diameter	Elemex	piles	had	been	installed	anywhere	in	the	
world.	Working	through	the	night	with	six	piling	teams	using	two	rigs

Services
The	Ground	Engineering	Services	division	offers	a	range	of ground	
stabilisation	and	geotechnical	services	on	construction	projects	
across	a	broad	range	of	end	markets.	Ground	stabilisation	services	
are	frequently	required	for	large	civil	engineering	projects,	such	as	
motorway	expansion	and	embankment	cutting,	as	well	as	new‑build	
residential	schemes.	The	division’s	geotechnical	services	operating	
unit	provides	a	range	of	technically	complex,	critical	services	including	
ground	investigation,	pile	testing	and	geothermal	boreholes.
Revenues	have	increased	by	4.6%	and	gross	margin	has	improved	
because	of	the	sales	mix,	with	higher	value	works	delivered	in	
ground stabilisation.
The	division	has	invested	to	establish	a	new	dedicated	Scottish	office	
and factory	facility,	which	commenced	operations	in	January	2017.
Given	the	large	addressable	market	for	geotechnical	and	ground	
stabilisation	services,	the	Directors	believe	that	there	is	scope	to	
increase	the	division’s	market	share	by	capitalising	on	the	Group’s

intends	to	acquire	additional	specialist	geotechnical	and	ground	
stabilisation	equipment	to	increase	its	capacity,	with	a	focus	on	
road	and	rail	infrastructure.	The	Directors	believe	that	the	Group’s	
strong	relationships	with	customers	in	the	infrastructure	and	civil	
engineering	sectors	position	the	division	to	bid	for	additional	
work on	projects	such	as	the	SMART	motorway	initiative.
In	addition,	the	division	can	leverage	the	Group’s	strong	position	in	
the	rail	market	by	providing	its	range	of	geotechnical	services	on‑track.	
There	is	an	opportunity	to	provide	site	investigation	services	to	rail

Gross profit
The	gross	margin	of	the	Group	has	reduced	slightly	to	35.5%	
(2016:	36.1%),	reflecting	sales	mix	changes	due	to	reduced	rail	
activity	in	Q4.	The	delay	and	restructuring	of	several	rail	contracts	
prior	to	the	year	end	adversely	impacted	utilisation	of	our	RRV	rigs	
which	had	a	consequent	impact	on	divisional	overhead	recovery.	
The	variability	of	timing	of	contracts	in	the	rail	sector	is	unfortunately	
a	feature	of	Government‑backed	infrastructure	spend	and	one	that	
we	are	mindful	of	and	will	continue	to	monitor	closely	going	forward.

VAN ELLE HOLDINGS PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Operating profit continued
Our	underlying	EBITDA	margin	has	improved	marginally	to	17.3%	
(2016:	17.1%)	despite	the	sales	mix	impact	of	reduced	rail	activity	
and	an	investment	in	overheads	to	facilitate	our	year‑on‑year	growth	
strategy.	Consequently,	our	underlying	operating	margin	has	
reduced	slightly	to	12.3%	(2016:	13.1%).
Exceptional costs
Exceptional	items,	by	their	size,	incidence	or	nature,	are	disclosed	
separately	to	allow	a	better	understanding	of	the	underlying	
performance	of	the	Group.	During	the	year,	exceptional	items	of	
£1,781,000	were	incurred	in	respect	of	the	IPO	of	the	Company	
on 26	October	2016	and	legal	costs	associated	with	post‑IPO	claim	
and	settlements	(see	note	7	to	the	consolidated	financial	statements).
The	Board	believes	that	the	underlying	performance	measures	for	
operating	profit,	EBITDA	and	EPS,	stated	before	the	deduction	of	
exceptional	items	and	share‑based	payment	charges,	give	a	clearer	
indication	of	the	actual	performance	of	the	business.
Net finance costs
Net	finance	costs	were	£422,000	(2016:	£333,000)	and	interest	was	
covered	23.0	times	(2016:	33.2	times).	This	increase	reflects	the	
targeted	capital	investment	expenditure	over	the	last	couple	of	years	
funded	by	hire	purchase	lease	contracts.	The	hire	purchase	contracts	
are	at	fixed	rates	of	interest	and	normally	for	a	five‑year	term.
Taxation
The	effective	tax	rate	for	the	year	was	20.8%	(2016:	21.2%).	
The decrease	in	effective	tax	rate	from	the	previous	year	is	principally	
due	to	the	adjustment	in	respect	of	prior	year	charges	mitigated	by	
exceptional	IPO	costs	of	£1,348,000	being	disallowed	for	tax	purposes.	
The	tax	charge	includes	a	deferred	tax	credit	of	£40,000	arising	due	
to	substantively	enacted	reductions	in	the	rate	of	corporation	tax	
to 17%	by	April	2020.
The	Group	paid	£2,281,000	(2016:	£1,748,000)	of	corporation	tax	
during	the	year.
Contingent liability
Our	interim	announcement	referenced	a	possible	liability	relating	
to	material	bonus	payments	allegedly	due	to	a	former	employee	
pursuant	to	historic	employment	arrangements.	Having	robustly	
rejected	that	any	such	liability	existed,	the	Board	has	now	been	
informed	by	solicitors	acting	for	the	former	employee	that	he	
no longer	wishes	to	pursue	the	claim.
Dividends
The	Board	has	adopted	a	progressive	dividend	policy.	On 28 February	
2017,	the	Company	paid	an	interim	dividend	of	0.85p	per	share.	
The	Board	is	now	recommending	a	final	dividend	of	1.75p	per	share	
making	a	total	dividend	of	2.60p	per	share	for	the	financial	year.	
Subject	to	approval	at	our	Annual	General	Meeting	of	shareholders	
on	12	September	2017,	the	recommended	final	dividend	will	be	paid	
on	29	September	2017	to	shareholders	who	are	on	the	register	on	
22	September	2017.
Earnings per share
The	underlying	basic	earnings	per	share	was	12.1p	(2016: 12.1p),	
based	on	underlying	earnings	of	£9,125,000	(2016:	£8,445,000).	
Underlying	earnings	are	stated	after	adding	back	£1,781,000	of	
exceptional	IPO	costs	and	£77,000	of	share‑based	payment	charges	
and	deducting	tax	arising	on	exceptional	charges	of	£86,000.	
This	flat	performance	in	underlying	earnings	per	share	reflects	the	
consequences	of the	additional	funds	raised	on	IPO	to	fund	future	
acquisitions	with	no	acquisitions	having	been	completed	in	the	period.	
Capital structure and allocation
The	Group’s	capital	structure	is	kept	under	constant	review,	taking	
account	of	the	need	for,	and	the	availability	and	cost	of,	various	
sources	of	finance.
The	Group’s	objective	is	to	deliver	long‑term	value	to	its	shareholders	
whilst	maintaining	a	balance	sheet	structure	that	safeguards	the	
Group’s	financial	position	through	economic	cycles.	In	this	context,	
the	Board	has	established	clear	priorities	for	the	use	of	capital.
In order	of	priority	these	are:
 l to	fund	profitable	organic	growth	opportunities;
 l to	finance	bolt‑on	acquisitions	that	meet	the	Group’s	
investment criteria;
 l to	pay	ordinary	dividends	at	a	level	which	allows	dividend	
growth	through	the	cycle;	and
 l where	the	balance	sheet	allows,	to	deploy	funds	for	the	benefit	
of	shareholders	in	the	most	appropriate	manner.

STRATEGIC REPORT 01–33 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 34–53 are able, if necessary, to take independent professional advice 
in the furtherance of their duties at the Company’s expense.
The Board intends to regularly conduct an appraisal of its own 
performance and that of each Director consisting of individual 
assessments using prescribed questionnaires to be completed by 
all Directors. The results will be reviewed, and individual feedback 
given, by an independent Non-Executive Director in respect of 
assessments of each of the other Directors and of the Board.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises both Non-Executive Directors 
and is chaired by Robin Williams. The Audit Committee has primary 
responsibility for monitoring the quality of internal controls, ensuring 
that the financial performance of the Group is properly measured 
and reported and reviewing reports from the Group’s auditor. The 
Audit Committee met on five occasions during the year with both 
members in attendance. The operations of the Audit Committee are 
set out in the separate Audit Committee report on pages 38 to 40.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises both Non-Executive Directors 
and is chaired by Adrian Barden. The purpose of the Committee 
is to establish a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for 
the appointment of new Directors to the Board. The Nomination 
Committee met on two occasions during the year and both members 
attended. The operations of the Nomination Committee are set out in 
the separate Nomination Committee report on page 41.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises both Non-Executive Directors 
and is chaired by Adrian Barden. The Remuneration Committee is 
responsible for reviewing the performance of Executive Directors 
and determining their terms and conditions of service, including 
their remuneration and the grant of options. The Remuneration 
Committee met on two occasions during the year with both members 
in attendance. The Remuneration Committee report is set out on 
pages 42 and 43.
Directors
Each of the Directors is subject to election by the shareholders at 
the first annual general meeting after their appointment. Thereafter, 
all Directors are subject to retirement by rotation in accordance 
with the Articles of Association. The service contracts of Executive 
Directors require six months’ notice. 
The Non-Executive Directors have received appointment letters 
setting out their terms of appointment. All Non-Executive Directors 
are appointed for an initial period of three years, continuing thereafter 
subject to not less than three months’ notice.
The appointment of new Non-Executive Directors to the Board 
is considered by the whole Board.
Introduction
As set out in the Admission document, the Board acknowledges the 
importance of the principles set out in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and intends to apply them as far as it considers appropriate 
for a company of its size and nature.
Under the rules of AIM, the Group is not required to comply with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 (the “Code”). Nevertheless, 
the Board has taken steps to comply with those aspects of the Code 
that it considers appropriate, as described below.
Board composition and operation
The Board currently comprises two Executive and two Non-Executive 
Directors, of which one is Chairman. A search for a third Non-Executive 
Director is underway. The names of the Directors together with their 
roles and biographical details are set out on page 34. The roles of 
Chairman and Chief Executive are separated, clearly understood and 
have been agreed by the Board. The Chairman is responsible for the 
management of the Board and the Chief Executive is responsible for 
the operating performance of the Group. 
A formal schedule of matters requiring Group Board approval is 
maintained and regularly reviewed, covering such areas as strategy, 
approval of budgets, financial results, Board appointments and dividend 
policy. The Board normally meets eight times a year and additional 
meetings are called when required. Comprehensive briefing papers 
are sent to all Directors prior to each scheduled Board meeting. Directors

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Internal controls
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group 
maintains a system of internal control, to provide it with reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial information that is 
used within the business, and for external publication and the 
safeguarding of assets. There are inherent limitations in any system 
of internal control and accordingly even the most cost-effective 
system can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. 
The Group’s organisation structure has clear lines of responsibility 
with operational and financial responsibility for operating segments 
delegated to operational directors.
The Group’s risk management programme, which assesses key risks 
and the required internal controls that are delegated to Directors and 
managers within the Group, is reviewed regularly to ensure that it 
continues to meet the Board’s requirements.
Shareholder relationships
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors will always make 
themselves available to meet with shareholders. Each AGM is an 
opportunity for this. Normal relationships with shareholders are 
maintained by the Executive Directors, who brief the Board on 
shareholder issues and who relate the views of the Group’s advisers 
to the Board. The Board believes that the disclosures set out on 
pages 4 to 33 of the annual report provide the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy.
Going concern basis
The Group’s business activities, together with the key factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position, are 
set out in the Group financial review. The financial position of the 
Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are 
also described in the Group financial review. In addition, note 21 
of the consolidated financial statements includes the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, financial 
risk and management objectives. This also details financial instruments 
and exposure to price, interest rate, credit and liquidity risk. Accordingly, 
the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the 
Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future based on the following factors:
 l the Group has prepared financial projections to 30 April 2021 which 
forecast positive earnings and cash generation;
 l positive cash balance at 30 April 2017 and undrawn overdraft 
facilities of £3.0m;
 l low levels of gearing and net debt (£1.5m at 30 April 2017); and
 l high levels of interest cover (23 times at 30 April 2017).
Based on the above, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
Forward-looking statements
The annual report and accounts includes certain statements that 
are forward-looking statements. These statements appear in several 
places throughout the strategic report and include statements 
regarding the Group’s intentions, beliefs or current expectations 
and those of its officers, Directors and employees concerning, 
amongst other things, the results of operations, financial condition, 
liquidity, prospects, growth and strategies of the Group. By their 
nature, these statements involve uncertainty since future events 
and circumstances can cause results and developments to differ 
materially from those anticipated.
Approval
The Board approved the corporate governance report on 25 July 2017.
By order of the Board

Acting Company Secretary

Membership and attendance
The Code recommends that all members of an audit committee be 
non-executive directors, independent in character and judgement 
and free from any relationship or circumstances which may, could 
or would be likely to, or appear to, affect their judgement and that 
one such member has recent and relevant financial experience.
Accordingly, the Committee comprises both Non-Executive 
Directors, with the Chairman having recent and relevant financial 
and accounting experience. Regular Audit Committee meetings are 
also normally attended by the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief 
Financial Officer, the external auditor and the Company Secretary, 
who acts as secretary to the Committee. Other members of 
management are invited to attend depending on the matters 
under discussion. The Committee meets regularly with the 
external auditor with no members of management present. 
The Committee has met five times during the year with both 
Non-Executive members present.
Robin Williams
Chairman of the Audit Committee
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the report on the activities of the Audit 
Committee for the year and to be able to confirm on behalf of the 
Board that the annual report and accounts taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable.
Roles and responsibilities
The primary function of the Committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling 
its responsibilities regarding the integrity of financial reporting, 
audit, risk management and internal controls. This comprises:
 l monitoring and reviewing the Group’s accounting policies, 
practices and significant accounting judgements; and
 l reviewing the annual and interim financial statements and any 
public financial announcements and advising the Board on whether 
the annual report and accounts is fair, balanced and understandable.

VAN ELLE HOLDINGS PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Activities during the year
The following matters were considered at the Committee meetings 
held during the year:
Financial statements and reports:
 l reviewed the preliminary results announcements, annual report 
and accounts, interim results announcement, trading update 
and received reports from the external auditor;
 l reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and 
disclosures made in the annual report and accounts;
 l reviewed management representation letters, going concern 
reviews and significant areas of accounting estimates and judgements 
(including exceptional items, intangible assets and share-based 
payments); and
 l reported to the Board on the appropriateness of accounting 
policies and practices.
Risk management:
 l considered the Group risk register, which identified, evaluated 
and set out mitigation of risks, and reviewed the principal risks 
and uncertainties disclosed in the annual report and accounts.
External audit and non-audit work:
 l reviewed the relationship with the external auditor including its 
independence, objectivity and effectiveness and, based on that 
review, recommended to the Board its reappointment at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting;
 l reviewed, considered and agreed the scope and methodology 
of the audit work to be undertaken by the external auditor;
 l agreed the terms of engagement and fees to be paid to the 
external auditor; and
 l reviewed and approved the Group policy on non-audit services 
and reviewed any non-audit fees.
Compliance:
 l met with the external auditor without executive management 
being present; and
 l reviewed the Committee terms of reference and confirmed 
its intention to evaluate its performance.
External audit
The Audit Committee also approves the appointment and 
remuneration of the Group’s external auditor and satisfies itself 
that it maintains its independence regardless of any non-audit work 
performed by it. The Group adopts the following policy governing 
the performance of non-audit work by the auditor. The auditor is 
permitted to provide non-audit services which are not, and are not 
perceived to be, in conflict with auditor independence, providing 
it has the skill, competence and integrity to carry out the work and 
it is the most appropriate adviser to undertake such work in the 
best interests of the Group. All assignments are monitored by the 
Committee. Details of services provided by, and fees payable to, 
the auditor are shown in note 8 of the consolidated 
financial statements.
Whilst the Audit Committee has not adopted a formal policy 
in respect of rotation of the external auditor, one of its principal 
duties is to make recommendations to the Board in relation to the 
appointment of the external auditor. Various factors are considered 
by the Committee in this respect including the quality of the reports 
provided to the Committee, the level of service provided and the 
level of understanding of the Group’s business.
BDO LLP has been the Company’s external auditor for six years. 
The Audit Committee considers that the relationship with the 
auditor is working well and remains satisfied with its effectiveness 
and independence. Accordingly, it has not considered it necessary 
to date to require the firm to re-tender for the audit work. The auditor 
is required to rotate the audit partner responsible for the Group 
and subsidiary audits every five years. The current audit partner 
is in his first year of his term as audit partner. 
Internal audit
The Group does not have a formal internal audit function but intends 
to perform targeted reviews and visits to operations by the head 
office team and occasionally professional advisers. The results of 
these reviews will be communicated back to the Audit Committee. 
This approach is considered appropriate and proportionate given 
the size of the business and the extensive work performed by the 
external auditor; however, the need to establish a separate 
independent internal audit function is kept under constant review.
Internal controls and risk management
The Board is responsible for the effectiveness of the Group’s system 
of internal control, which has been designed and implemented to meet 
the requirements of the Group and the risks to which it is exposed.
The Group has a robust risk management process that follows a 
sequence of risk identification, assessment of probability and impact, 
and assigns an owner to manage mitigation activities. Throughout 
the year, the Group risk register and the methodology applied was 
the subject of review by senior management and updated to reflect 
new and developing areas which might impact business strategy. 
The Committee reviews the Group risk register each year to assess 
the actions being taken by senior management to monitor and mitigate 
the risks. The Group’s principal risks and uncertainties are 
described on pages 16 and 17.

STRATEGIC REPORT 01–33 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 34–53 Audit Committee report continued
group by customers or third parties. The Committee has 
reviewed the estimates and judgements applied by 
management and is satisfied with management’s conclusions.
 l The carrying value of trade receivables (including WIP) – 
The Group holds material trade receivable balances, and the 
calculations of provisions for impairment are estimates of future 
events and therefore uncertain. The Committee has reviewed 
the current year provisions against trade receivables, including 
an assessment of the adequacy of the prior year provisions, and 
is satisfied with management’s conclusions that the provisioning 
levels are appropriate.
 l The charge for share-based payment awards – The Group 
operates two equity-settled share-based payment awards. 
The Group is required to derive the fair value of the option at 
the date of grant using various models and assumptions which 
can have a material impact on the accounts. The Committee has 
reviewed the current year charges and is satisfied with the key 
assumptions applied.
 l Exceptional items – The Committee has considered the presentation 
of the Group financial statements, and the presentation of 
exceptional items and the items included within such categories. 
The Committee has discussed these items with management 
and agreed that the presentation is consistent with the Group’s 
accounting policy and provides more meaningful information to 
shareholders about the underlying performance of the Group.
 l The carrying value of goodwill – Annual impairment reviews are 
performed which use key judgements including estimates of 
future business performance and cash generation, discount rates 
and long-term growth rates. The Committee is comfortable with 
the key assumptions applied and management’s conclusion that 
no impairment has occurred.
I look forward to meeting with shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting in September to answer any questions on the work of 
the Committee.
Robin Williams
Chairman of the Audit Committee

Internal controls and risk management continued
The following key elements comprise the internal control environment 
which has been designed to identify, evaluate and manage, rather 
than eliminate, the risks faced by the Group in seeking to achieve 
its business objectives and ensure accurate and timely reporting 
of financial data for the Company and the Group:
 l an appropriate organisational structure with clear lines 
of responsibility;
 l an experienced and qualified finance function, which regularly 
assesses the risks facing the Group;
 l a comprehensive annual strategic and business planning process;
 l systems of control procedures and delegated authorities, which 
operate within defined guidelines, and approval limits for capital 
and operating expenditure and other key business transactions 
and decisions;
 l a robust financial control, budgeting and rolling forecast system, 
which includes regular monitoring, variance analysis and key 
performance indicator reviews;
 l procedures by which the consolidated financial statements are 
prepared, which are monitored and maintained using internal 
control frameworks addressing key financial reporting risks arising 
from changes in the business or accounting standards; and
 l established policies and procedures setting out expected standards 
of integrity and ethical standards which reinforce the need for 
all employees to adhere to all legal and regulatory requirements.
Going concern
Financial projections covering a period of not less than two years 
are prepared to support the review of going concern. Sensitivities 
are calculated to ensure that headroom exists in both financial 
resources and covenants, both of which are sufficient.
Significant accounting matters
The Audit Committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies 
have been adopted and whether management has made appropriate 
estimates and judgements. The Committee reviews accounting papers 
prepared by management which provides details on the main financial 
reporting judgements. The Committee also reviews reports by the 
external auditor on the interim and full year results which highlight 
any issues arising from the work undertaken. The specific areas of 
audit and accounting risk reviewed by the Committee were:
 l Revenue recognition – The revenue recognised in the accounts 
requires the use of estimates and judgements when assessing 
the percentage of work completed at the balance sheet date on 
contracts, the costs of the work required to complete the contract 
and the outcomes of claims and variations raised against the

diversity and knowledge on the Board;
 l completed a process for the replacement of Michael Ellis as Chairman;

 l reviewed and approved the recommendations to be made to

Election of Directors
On the recommendation of the Committee and in line with the 
Company’s Articles of Association all four directors will stand for 
re-election at the Annual General Meeting. The biographical details of 
the Directors can be found on page 34. The Committee considers 
that the performance of each of the Directors standing for election 
at the Annual General Meeting continues to be effective and each 
demonstrates commitment to their role.
Board changes
On 31 December 2016, Michael Ellis, our non-independent 
Non-Executive Chairman, stepped down from the Board. Following 
a review the Committee appointed me as Chairman and Robin Williams 
became the Senior Independent Director. Both changes were confirmed 
by the Board on 1 June 2017. A search for an additional Non-Executive 
Director has commenced and the individual is expected to be in 
position later this year.
On 6 March 2017, Thomas Lindup, Managing Director and Company 
Secretary, left the Company. Since that date, Paul Pearson, the Chief 
Financial Officer, is also acting as interim Company Secretary. The 
Committee continues to review the balance of skills remaining within

Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to present 
the Remuneration Committee report for the year ended 30 April 2017.
Roles and responsibilities
The role of the Committee is to recommend to the Board a strategy 
and framework for remuneration for Executive Directors and the 
senior management team to attract and retain leaders who are focused 
and incentivised to deliver the Company’s strategic business priorities, 
within a remuneration framework which is aligned with the interests 
of our shareholders and thus designed to promote the long-term 
success of the Company.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Following the review, it was determined that the annual bonus 
maximum levels and the performance measures continue to be 
appropriate. The Committee will continue its policy of setting 
stretching annual bonus targets which take into account several 
internal and external factors and disclose performance against 
targets and associated payouts unless the Committee considers 
them to be commercially sensitive.
Remuneration report
As an AIM-listed entity, the Company is not required to fully apply 
the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority or the BIS 
Directors’ Remuneration Reporting Regulations and hence is not 
required to present a board report on remuneration in accordance 
with those rules. Nevertheless, the Board considers it appropriate 
for the Company to provide shareholders with information in respect 
of Executive remuneration that follows the “spirit” of the Regulations 
and will include some details of the Directors’ remuneration policy 
and the annual report on remuneration, which together form the 
Directors’ remuneration report.
I look forward to meeting with shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting in September to answer any questions on the work of 
the Committee.
Adrian Barden
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

 l reviewed market trends and developments in executive 
remuneration in advance of considering Executive Director 
and senior management team proposals for 2017/18;
 l reviewed and approved Executive Director and senior 
management team salaries for 2017/18;
 l reviewed and approved the parameters of the Annual Bonus 
Plan, including performance measures for 2017/18 for the 
Executive Directors and senior management team; and
 l reviewed the Committee’s terms of reference. 
Performance and outcomes 2016/17
This has been another year of solid results for Van Elle Holdings plc, 
despite challenges in some of the Group’s operating markets. The 
business model proved robust with delayed contracts in the Specialist 
Piling division being offset by growth in General Piling, Ground 
Engineering Services and Ground Engineering Products.
For 2016/17, the performance achieved against financial and 
operational targets resulted in no annual bonus being paid to the 
Executive Directors.
As the earliest vesting date for awards made under the LTIP and the 
CSOP since their introduction is 26 October 2019, no LTIP or CSOP 
awards vested during the year.
Remuneration decisions for 2017/18
The Committee has recently undertaken a review of the remuneration 
arrangements for our Executive Directors. We believe that the 
framework remains broadly fit for purpose and so we are not 
proposing any significant changes.
As part of the review, we assessed the base salaries of the 
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. To ensure 
base salaries remain competitive, the Committee awarded a salary 
increase of 2% to the Chief Executive Officer and 10% to the 
Chief Financial Officer with effect from 1 June 2017.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT 01–33 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 34–53 Introduction
The policy described below is intended to apply for three years 
from the date of admission to AIM. The Committee will consider the 
remuneration policy annually to ensure that it remains aligned with 
the business needs and is appropriately positioned relative to the 
market. However, there is no intention to revise the policy more 
frequently than every three years. We use target performance to 
estimate the total potential reward and benchmark it against 
reward packages paid by Van Elle’s competitors (to the extent 
that they can be identified).
Principles adopted
The principles adopted, taken from the Association of British 
Insurers (“ABI”), are as follows:
 l remuneration structures should be appropriate to the specific 
business, efficient and cost effective in delivery;
 l complexity is discouraged in favour of simple and 
understandable remuneration structures;
 l remuneration structures should seek to align Executive and 
shareholder interests including through a meaningful level 
of personal shareholding;
 l remuneration structures should promote long-term focus 
through features such as deferral and measuring performance 
over the long term;
 l structures should include performance adjustments (malus) 
and/or clawback provisions;
 l pay should be aligned to long-term sustainable success and the 
desired corporate culture throughout the organisation; and
 l the Remuneration Committee ensures that rewards properly 
reflect business performance.
Balancing short and long-term remuneration
Based on our view of current market practice, and the principles 
of our remuneration policy, we have established the remuneration 
policy set out in this report. Fixed annual elements, including salary, 
pension and benefits, are to recognise the status of our Executives 
and to ensure current and future market competitiveness. The short 
and long-term incentives are to motivate and reward them for 
making Van Elle Holdings plc successful on a sustainable basis.
The shareholding linkage cements the relationship between the 
Executive Directors’ personal returns and those of Company 
investors. Long-term incentives, in the form of conditional share 
awards, are granted annually and Executive Directors are expected 
to retain vested shares (after they have paid income tax and National 
Insurance contributions in respect of the awards) until they have 
met their shareholding requirement.
The Committee reserves discretion to flex the weighting of annual 
bonus KPIs from year to year to ensure that the Executive Directors 
are incentivised to drive performance through the Company’s core 
strategic objectives.
Performance measures and targets
The Committee selected the performance conditions because these 
are central to the Company’s overall strategy and are key metrics used 
by the Executive Directors to oversee the operation of the business. 
The performance targets are determined annually by the Committee 
following consultation with the Audit Committee and are typically 
set at a level that is above the level of the Company’s forecasts.
The Committee believes the performance targets for the annual bonus 
are commercially sensitive in respect of the Company and that it 
would be detrimental to the interests of the Company to disclose 
them before the start of the financial year. The targets will be disclosed 
after the end of the relevant financial year in that year’s 
remuneration report.
Differences in remuneration policy for all employees
All employees of the Company are entitled to base salary, benefits, 
a pension and an annual bonus. The maximum opportunity 
available is based on the seniority and responsibility of the role.
The Committee has regard to pay structures across the wider Group 
when setting the remuneration policy for Executive Directors. The 
Committee considers the general basic salary increase for the broader 
workforce when determining the annual salary review for the 
Executive Directors.
Overall, the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors is 
more heavily weighted towards performance-related pay than for other 
employees. The level of performance-related pay varies within the 
Group by grade of employee and is calculated by reference to the 
specific responsibilities of each role as appropriate.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere 
in the Group
The Committee invites the Chief Executive Officer to present at its 
meeting in March on the proposals for salary increases for the 
employee population generally and on any other changes to 
remuneration policy within the Company. The Committee limits any 
salary increase for the Executive Directors to the inflationary increase 
available to employees unless there has been a change in role.
The Chief Executive consults with the Committee on the KPIs for 
Executive Directors’ bonuses and the extent to which these should be 
cascaded to other employees. The Committee approves the overall 
annual bonus cost to the Company each year. The Committee 
has oversight over the grant of all LTIP and CSOP awards across 
the Company.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT 01–33 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 34–53 Any share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director 
under the Company’s share plans will be determined based on 
relevant plan rules. 
The default treatment under the LTIP is that any outstanding awards 
lapse when the individual leaves the Group. However, in certain 
prescribed circumstances, such as death, ill health, injury or 
disability, transfer of the employing entity outside of the Group or 
in other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee (except 
where the Director is summarily dismissed), “good leaver” status 
may be applied.
For good leavers, awards will normally vest to the extent that the 
Committee determines, taking into account the satisfaction of the 
relevant performance conditions and, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise, the period that has elapsed between the 
grant and the date of leaving. Awards will normally vest at the 
original vesting date, unless the Committee decides that awards 
should vest at the time of leaving.
Service agreements and letters of appointment
Each of the Executive Directors’ service agreements is for a rolling 
term and may be terminated by the Company or the Executive Director 
by giving not less than six months’ prior written notice.
The Chairman and each of the Non-Executive Directors of the Company 
do not have service contracts. Each of these Directors has a letter of 
appointment which has an initial three year term which is renewable 
and is terminable by the Company or the individual on three months’ 
written notice.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in cash or 
share incentive arrangements and their service does not qualify 
them for a pension or other benefits. No element of their fee is 
performance related.

Approach to recruitment remuneration
The Committee will aim to set a new Executive Directors’ 
remuneration package in line with the remuneration policy 
approved by shareholders.
Element of remuneration Maximum % of salary
Salary
Benefits Dependent on circumstances
Annual bonus 60–80%*
Long-term incentives 100%*
Pension allowance 5%
* Higher percentage for CEO appointment.
In arriving at a total package and in considering value for each element 
of the package, the Committee will consider the skills and experience 
of a candidate, the market value for a candidate of that experience, 
as well as the importance of securing the preferred candidate.
Where it is necessary to “buy out” an individual’s awards from a 
previous employer, the Committee will seek to match the expected 
value of the awards by granting awards that vest over a timeframe 
like those given up, with a commensurate reduction in quantum 
where the new awards will be subject to performance conditions 
that are not as stretching as those on the awards given up.
Policy on Directors leaving the Group
The Committee must satisfy any contractual obligations agreed 
with the Executive Director. This is dependent on the contractual 
obligations not being in contradiction with the remuneration policy 
set out in this report.
If an Executive Director’s employment is terminated, in the absence 
of a breach of service agreement by the Director, the Company may, 
although it is not obliged to, terminate the Director’s employment 
immediately by payment of an amount equal to base salary and the 
specified benefits (including pension scheme contributions) in lieu 
of the whole or the remaining part of the notice period. Payments 
in lieu of notice may be paid in monthly instalments over the length 
of the notice period. The Executive Directors are obliged to seek 
alternative income during the notice period and to notify the Company 
of any income so received. The Company would then reduce the 
monthly instalments to reflect such alternative income.
Discretionary bonus payments will not form part of any payments 
made in lieu of notice. An annual bonus may be payable, at the 
Committee’s discretion, with respect to the period of the financial 
year served, although it would be paid in cash and normally 
pro-rated for time and paid at the normal payment date.

Statement of Directors’ shareholding and share interests (audited)

Statement of implementation of remuneration policy – 
year to 30 April 2018
The basic salaries of Jon Fenton and Paul Pearson have increased by 
2% to £263,568 and by 10% to £137,500, respectively, with effect 
from 1 June 2017. The level of increase for Paul Pearson reflects his 
increased level of responsibility following his appointment as Acting 
Company Secretary. The increase for Jon Fenton is aligned to the 
average annual pay award across the Group excluding rises for 
promotions or other changes in responsibility.
The Annual Bonus Plan for the year ending 30 April 2018 has been 
agreed. The structure of the scheme is like the scheme for the previous 
year as set out above in all material respects (except for the targets). 
Executive Directors will therefore be entitled to receive a bonus of 
80% of their basic salary if the Group achieves target operating profit.
It is expected that the next award under the LTIP scheme will be 
announced shortly after the publication of the Company’s annual 
results. Awards are limited to 100% of basic salary.
The fees for the Non-Executive Directors, Adrian Barden and Robin 
Williams, have increased by 70% to £85,000 and by 11.1% to £50,000, 
respectively, with effect from 1 January 2017 and 1 June 2017, 
respectively. The level of increase for Adrian Barden reflects his increased 
level of responsibility following his appointment as Chairman and for 
Robin Williams his move to the role of Senior Independent Director. 
Approval
The Directors’ remuneration policy and the annual report on 
remuneration, together comprising the Directors’ remuneration 
report, were approved by the Board of Directors on 25 July 2017

under which certain Directors have been granted conditional share 
awards. Details of the share options granted are detailed in the 
Directors’ remuneration report on page 49.
Directors may be appointed by ordinary resolution of the Company 
or by the Board. In addition to any powers of removal conferred by 
the Companies Act 2006, the Company may by special resolution 
remove any Director before the expiration of their period of office.
Directors’ indemnities
The Articles of Association of the Company permit it to indemnify 
the Directors of the Company against liabilities arising from the 
execution of their duties or powers to the extent permitted by law.
The Company has directors’ and officers’ indemnity insurance in place 
in respect of each of the Directors. The Company has entered into a 
qualifying third party indemnity (the terms of which are in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006) with each of the Directors. Neither the 
indemnity nor insurance provide cover if a Director or officer is 
proved to have acted fraudulently.
Employees
The Group systematically provides employees with information on 
matters of concern to them, consulting them or their representatives 
regularly, so that their views can be considered when making 
decisions that are likely to affect their interest. Employee involvement 
in the Group is encouraged, as achieving a common awareness on 
the part of all employees of the financial and economic factors 
affecting the Group plays a major role in its performance.
The Group recognises its responsibility to employ disabled persons 
in suitable employment and gives full and fair consideration to such 
persons, including any employee who becomes disabled, having 
regard to their aptitudes and abilities. Where practicable, disabled 
employees are treated equally with all other employees in respect 
of their eligibility for training, career development and promotion.
Further details regarding employees are detailed in the corporate 
social responsibility statement on pages 18 and 19.
Share capital
The Company has only one class of equity share, namely 2p 
ordinary shares. The shares have equal voting rights and there are 
no special rights or restrictions attaching to any of them or their 
transfer to other persons.
As at 30 April 2017 the issued share capital of the Company was 
80,000,000 ordinary shares of 2p each. Details of the share capital 
as at 30 April 2017 is shown in note 24 of the consolidated

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT 01–33 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 34–53 The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to 
prepare the Group and Company financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted 
by the European Union. Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of 
the profit or loss of the Group for that period. The Directors are 
also required to prepare financial statements in accordance with 
the rules of the London Stock Exchange for companies trading 
securities on AIM.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 l select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 l make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 l state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
 l prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the annual report and 
the financial statements are made available on the Company’s 
website. Financial statements are published on the Company’s 
website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements, 
which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance 
and integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the 
Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing 
integrity of the financial statements contained therein.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 30 April 2017
1. General information
The consolidated financial statements present the results 
of Van Elle Holdings plc (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries 
(collectively referred to as the “Group”) for the year ended 
30 April 2017. A list of subsidiaries and their countries of 
incorporation is presented in note 5 of the parent company 
financial statements on page 83.
Van Elle Holdings plc is a public limited company incorporated and 
domiciled in the UK under the Companies Act 2006. The principal 
activity of the Group is a geotechnical contractor offering a wide 
range of ground engineering techniques and services including site 
investigation; driven, bored, drilled and augered piling; and ground 
stabilisation services. The Group also develops, manufactures and 
installs precast concrete products for use in specialist foundation 
applications. Further information on the nature of the Group’s 
operations and principal activities are set out in the strategic 
report of the consolidated financial statements.
The address of the Company’s registered office is Van Elle Holdings plc, 
Kirkby Lane, Pinxton, Nottinghamshire, NG16 6JA. The Company has 
its primary listing on AIM, part of the London Stock Exchange.
The Group’s financial statements were authorised for issue by the 
Board of Directors on 25 July 2017.
2. Basis of preparation
Basis of accounting
The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the 
European Union (“IFRS”), International Financial Reporting Standards 
Interpretation Committee (“IFRS IC”) interpretations and those 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. The Group financial statements have been 
prepared on the going concern basis and adopting the historical 
cost convention. 
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with adopted 
IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates, which 
are outlined in the critical accounting estimates and judgements 
section of the accounting policies disclosed in note 3.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, 
which is also the Group’s functional currency. Amounts are rounded 
to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise stated.
Going concern
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. The Directors regard the 
foreseeable future as no less than 12 months following publication 
of its annual financial statement. The Directors have considered 
the Group’s working capital forecasts and projections, taking 
account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance 
and the current state of its operating market, and are satisfied that 
the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current 
facilities and in compliance with covenants arising from those 
facilities. Accordingly, they have adopted the going concern basis 
in preparing the financial information.
Underlying profit before tax and earnings
The Directors consider that underlying operating profit, underlying 
earnings before depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”), underlying 
profit before taxation and underlying earnings per share measures 
referred to in these Group financial statements, provide useful 
information for shareholders on underlying trends and performance. 
Underlying measures reflect adjustments adding back the exceptional 
costs, share-based payment charges and the taxation thereon 
where relevant.
The calculation of underlying basic and diluted underlying earnings 
per share is shown in note 13.
Adoption of new and revised standards
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the 
previous financial year except for the following new and revised 
standards and interpretations which have been adopted in the 
current year. Their adoption has not had any significant impact 
on the amounts reported in the financial statements.
 l Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative
 l Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 Clarification of Acceptable 
Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation
 l Annual improvements to IFRSs 2012–2014 Cycle
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers has been adopted 
by the EU with an effective date of 1 January 2018. This standard 
modifies the determination of how much revenue to recognise and 
when, and provides a single, principles based five-step model to be 
applied to all contracts with customers. It replaces the separate 
models for goods, services and construction contracts under 
current IFRS.
The Group is in the early stages of assessing the impact of the 
standard but, based on a preliminary review, does not expect the 
standard to have a significant impact on the Group’s results. It is 
likely that the Group will adopt a prospective transition approach 
to the standard.
The standard is only expected to impact those contracts that 
are ongoing at the end of a reporting period and have multiple 
performance obligations and/or contract modifications. With a 
typical contract size of less than £100,000 with short duration,  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 34–53 STRATEGIC REPORT 01–33 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 54–84

VAN ELLE HOLDINGS PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
2. Basis of preparation continued
Adoption of new and revised standards continued
for the vast majority of contracts revenue will continue to be recognised 
in the year. It is not possible to quantify the expected financial impact 
on the results for the year ended 30 April 2019, the first applicable 
year, as the application of the standard is dependent on the specific 
details of contracts ongoing at both 30 April 2018 and 30 April 2019. 
For the limited number of contracts that will be ongoing at the end 
of a reporting period and have multiple performance obligations 
and/or contract modifications, these will need to be considered on 
a contract-by-contract basis. Given that the Group’s largest contract 
only contributed 5% of revenue in the current year, any impact of 
the standard on the Group’s reported revenue is likely to be limited. 
We will continue to progress our assessment of the impact of 
this standard.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was adopted by the EU in November 
2016 with an effective date of 1 January 2018. In addition, IFRS 16 
Leases has been issued during 2016 but not yet adopted by the EU. 
The IASB effective date of IFRS 16 is 1 January 2019. The Group is 
in the early stages of assessing the impact of these accounting 
standards on the Group’s results.
3. Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements are set out below. The policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless 
otherwise stated.
Basis of consolidation
Where the Company has control over an investee, it is classified as a 
subsidiary. The Company controls an investee if all three of the following 
elements are present: power over the investee, exposure to variable 
returns from the investee, and the ability of the investor to use its 
power to affect those variable returns. Control is reassessed whenever 
facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any 
of these elements of control.
The consolidated financial statements present the results of the 
Company and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) as if they formed a single 
entity. Intercompany transactions and balances between group 
companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of 
business combinations using the acquisition method. In the statement 
of financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values 
at the acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are 
included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
from the date on which control is obtained. They are deconsolidated 
from the date on which control ceases.
Any changes in ownership in minority interests is accounted for as 
an equity transaction.
Revenue
Turnover represents the total amounts receivable by the Group for 
goods supplied and services provided, excluding value added tax 
and trade discounts. The Group’s turnover arises in the UK.
In the case of contracts, when the outcome can be assessed 
reliably, contract revenue is recognised by reference to the stage 
of completion of the contract activity at the statement of financial 
position date. The stage of completion of the contract at the statement 
of financial position date is assessed regarding the costs incurred 
to date as a percentage of the total expected costs.
Margin on contracts is calculated in accordance with accounting 
standards and industry practice. Industry practice is to assess the 
estimated outcome of each contract and recognise the revenue and 
margin based upon the stage of completion of the contract at the 
statement of financial position date. The assessment of the outcome 
of each contract is determined by regular review of the revenues 
and costs to complete that contract. Consistent contract review 
procedures are in place in respect of contract forecasting.
The gross amount receivable from customers for contract work is 
presented as an asset for all contracts in progress for which costs 
incurred, plus recognised profits (or less recognised losses), exceed 
progress billings.
The gross amount repayable to or paid in advance by customers for 
contract work is presented as a liability for all contracts in progress 
for which progress billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised 
profits (less recognised losses). Full provision is made for losses 
on all contracts in the year in which the loss is first foreseen.
Margin associated with contract variations is only recognised when 
the outcome of the contract negotiations can be reliably estimated. 
Costs relating to contract variations are recognised as incurred. 
Revenue is recognised up to the level of the costs which are 
deemed to be recoverable under the contract.
Segment reporting
The operating segments are based on the components that the Board, 
the Group’s principal decision-making body (the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker), monitors in making decisions about operating matters. 
Such components are identified based on information that is provided 
internally in the form of monthly management account reporting, 
budgets and forecasts to formulate allocation of resources to 
segments and to assess performance. Revenue from reportable 
segments is measured on a basis consistent with the income 
statement. Revenue is generated from within the UK, the Group’s 
country of domicile. Segment results show the contribution directly 
attributable to each segment in arriving at the Group’s operating 
profit. Segment assets and liabilities comprise those assets and 
liabilities directly attributable to each segment. Group eliminations 
represent such consolidation adjustments that are necessary to 
determine the Group’s assets and liabilities. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
For the year ended 30 April 2017
3. Significant accounting policies continued
Exceptional items
The Group’s income statement separately identifies exceptional 
items. Such items are those that in the Directors’ judgement are one 
off in nature or non-operating and need to be disclosed separately 
by their size or incidence and may include, but are not limited to, 
restructuring costs, acquisition-related costs and costs associated 
with the IPO. In determining whether an item should be disclosed 
as an exceptional item, the Directors consider quantitative as well 
as qualitative factors such as frequency, predictability of occurrence 
and significance. This is consistent with the way financial performance 
is measured by management and reported to the Board. Disclosing 
exceptional items separately provides an additional understanding 
of the performance of the Group.
Taxation
The income tax expense represents the sum of current and 
deferred income tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax 
is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity, respectively.
Current income tax is based on taxable profits for the year. Taxable 
profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable 
or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are 
never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the statement of financial position date.
Dividends
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. 
Interim equity dividends are recognised when paid. Final equity 
dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders 
at an annual general meeting. 
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost 
less accumulated depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure 
that is directly related to the acquisition of the asset. 
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount, 
or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is 
probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset 
will flow to the Group, and the cost of the asset can be measured 
reliably. All other repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to 
the statement of comprehensive income during the financial period 
in which it is incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation on assets under 
construction does not commence until they are complete and 
available for use. Depreciation is provided on all other items of 
property, plant and equipment and is calculated, using the 
straight-line method, to write off their carrying value over their 
expected useful economic lives. It is provided at the following rates:
Freehold buildings – 10%–20% per annum straight line
Plant and machinery – 10%–20% per annum straight line
Office equipment – 10%–25% per annum straight line
Motor vehicles – 10%–25% per annum straight line
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if 
appropriate, at each balance sheet date. An asset’s carrying amount 
is written down immediately to its estimated recoverable amount 
if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated 
recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposal of assets are determined by 
comparing the proceeds of disposal with the carrying value and 
are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over 
the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets of 
the acquired entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is capitalised 
as an intangible asset. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment 
and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment 
losses on goodwill are recognised immediately in the statement of 
comprehensive income and are not subsequently reversed. 
Goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units 
for the purposes of the impairment testing. The allocation is made 
to those cash generating units or groups of cash generating units 
that are expected to benefit from the business combination in 
which they arose, identified by operating segment.
Computer software
Costs incurred to acquire computer software and directly 
attributable costs of bringing the software into use are capitalised 
within intangible assets and amortised, on a straight-line basis, 
over the useful life of the software. The estimated useful life and 
amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting 
period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted 
for on a prospective basis. The estimated useful life for computer 
software is five years. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 34–53 STRATEGIC REPORT 01–33 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 54–84

3. Significant accounting policies continued
Impairment of non-financial assets
Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with 
indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually at the 
financial year end. Other non-financial assets are subject to 
impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where 
the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount (i.e. 
the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell), the asset 
is written down accordingly.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an 
individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the smallest 
group of assets to which it belongs for which there are separately 
identifiable cash flows – its Cash Generating Units (“CGUs”). 
Impairment charges are included in profit or loss, except to the extent 
they reverse gains previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Inventories are initially recognised at cost, and comprise 
raw materials and consumables held in storage or on project sites 
and work in progress. Cost comprises all costs of purchase, costs 
of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories 
to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value comprises the estimated selling price in 
the ordinary course of business less applicable variable selling 
expenses. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective 
items where appropriate.
Work in progress represents amounts earned and recoverable 
on contracts that have not yet been charged to customers and 
included within revenue.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories 
discussed below, depending on the purpose for which the asset was 
acquired. The Group has not classified any of its financial assets as 
held to maturity.
The Group’s accounting policy for each category is as follows:
Fair value through profit or loss
The Group does not have any assets held for trading nor does 
it voluntarily classify any financial assets as being at fair value 
through profit or loss.
Loans and receivables
These arise principally through the provision of goods and 
services to customers (e.g. trade receivables), but also incorporate 
other types of contractual monetary asset. They are initially 
recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently 
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, 
less provision for impairment. 
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective 
evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the 
customer or default or significant delay in payment) that the Group 
will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms 
receivable and for trade receivables, which are reported net, such 
provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the 
loss being recognised within administrative expenses in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income. On confirmation 
that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying 
value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other 
receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated 
statement of financial position. 
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at 
call with banks, and, for the statement of cash flows, bank overdrafts. 
Bank overdrafts are shown within loans and borrowings in current 
liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial position.
Financial liabilities
The Group classifies its financial liabilities into one of two categories, 
depending on the purpose for which the liability was acquired. 
The Group’s accounting policy for each category is as follows:
Fair value through profit or loss
The Group does not have any liabilities held for trading nor has it 
designated any financial liabilities as being at fair value through 
profit or loss. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

3. Significant accounting policies continued
Financial liabilities continued
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities include the following items:
 l Bank borrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of any 
transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument. 
Such interest bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which 
ensures that any interest expense over the period to repayment 
is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the 
consolidated statement of financial position. For the purposes of 
each financial liability, interest expense includes initial transaction 
costs and any premium payable on redemption, as well as any 
interest or coupon payable while the liability is outstanding.
 l Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, which 
are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Government grants
Government grants are recognised at their fair value in the statement 
of financial position, within deferred income, when there is reasonable 
assurance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions 
will be complied with.
Government grants relating to revenue items are released to the 
statement of comprehensive income and recognised within cost of 
sales over the period necessary to match the grant on a systematic 
basis to the costs that they are intended to compensate.
Government grants relating to capital items are recognised within 
deferred income and released against the related depreciation 
charge when the completion conditions of these assets are met.
Retirement benefit cost
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for the 
benefit of employees. The Group pays contributions to publicly or 
privately administered pension insurance schemes on a mandatory, 
contractual or voluntary basis. Contributions to defined contribution 
pension schemes are charged to the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income in the year to which they relate.
Leased assets
Where substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership 
of a leased asset have been transferred to the Group (a “finance lease”), 
the asset is treated as if it had been purchased outright. The amount 
initially recognised as an asset is the lower of the fair value of the 
leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments 
payable over the term of the lease. The corresponding lease 
commitment is shown as a liability. Lease payments are analysed 
between capital and interest. The interest element is charged to the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the period 
of the lease and is calculated so that it represents a constant 
proportion of the lease liability. The capital element reduces the 
balance owed to the lessor.
Where substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership 
are not transferred to the Group (an “operating lease”), the total rentals 
payable under the lease are charged to the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the lease 
term. The aggregate benefit of lease incentives is recognised as 
a reduction of the rental expense over the lease term on a 
straight-line basis.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation because of past events, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and 
the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised 
for future operating losses.
Provisions represent management’s best estimates of expenditure 
required to settle a present obligation at the balance sheet date, 
after considering the risks and uncertainties that surround the 
underlying event.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying 
amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated statement of 
financial position differs from its tax base, except for differences 
arising on:
 l the initial recognition of goodwill;
 l the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction 
which is not a business combination and at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit; and
 l investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where 
the Group can control the timing of the reversal of the difference 
and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances 
where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the difference can be utilised. 
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date 
and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) 
are settled/(recovered).  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 34–53 STRATEGIC REPORT 01–33 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 54–84

3. Significant accounting policies continued
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a 
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds of the issue.
Share-based payments
The Group operates two equity-settled share-based payment plans, 
details of which can be found in note 25 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
The fair value of share-based awards with non-market performance 
conditions is determined at the date of the grant using a Black-Scholes 
option pricing model. The fair value of share-based awards with 
market-related performance conditions is determined at the date 
of grant using a Monte-Carlo simulation. Share-based awards 
are recognised as expenses based on the Company’s estimate 
of the shares that will eventually vest, on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in the 
share option reserve.
At each statement of financial position date, the Company revises 
its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest 
based on service and non-market performance conditions. The 
amount expensed is adjusted over the vesting period for changes 
in the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. 
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income such that 
the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a 
corresponding adjustment to equity reserves. Options with 
market-related performance conditions will vest based on total 
shareholder return against a selected group of quoted market 
comparators. Following the initial valuation, no adjustments are 
made in respect of market-based conditions at the reporting date.
4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the 
future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based 
on historical experience and other factors, including expectations 
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances. In the future, actual experience may differ from 
these estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions 
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group is required to test whether goodwill has suffered any 
impairment. The Directors consider that recent and expected 
profitability supports the recorded value of goodwill and that there 
is no impairment.
Impairment of other intangible assets and investments
Other intangible assets and investments are reviewed for impairment 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment is 
conducted the recoverable amount of the asset is based on the net 
present value of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing 
operation of the entities using an appropriate discount rate.
Useful lives of property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their estimated 
useful economic lives based on management’s estimates of the period 
that the assets will generate revenue, which are periodically 
reviewed for appropriateness. 
Contracts
The Group’s approach to key estimates and judgements relating to 
construction contracts is set out in the revenue recognition policy 
above. The main factors considered when making those estimates 
and judgements include the costs of the work required to complete 
the contract in order to estimate the percentage completion, and 
the outcome of claims raised against the Group by customers or 
third parties.
Bad debt provisions
The Group has recognised impairment provisions in respect of 
bad and doubtful trade debtors. The judgements and estimates 
necessary to calculate these provisions are based on historical 
experience and other reasonable factors.
Warranty and claims provisions
The Group has recognised provisions in respect of possible 
warranty claims and claims for issues in delivery of services that 
are considered appropriate to the nature of the business and the 
history of claims received. The Group has insurance against delivery 
of service issues and only provides for any excess above the cover 
of insurance. The judgements and estimates necessary to calculate 
these provisions are based on historical experience and other 
reasonable factors.
Share-based payments
The Group has issued share-based incentives to its Directors and 
employees and is required to recognise an expense through its 
income statement equivalent to the fair value of the goods or 
services received. The Directors estimate the fair value using 
financial models (to provide a fair value of the option at the date 
of grant) and their experience of the likelihood that performance 
conditions will be met (to determine the number of options that 
will vest). FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

5. Segment information
The Group evaluates segmental performance based on profit or loss from operations calculated in accordance with IFRS but excluding 
non-recurring losses, such as goodwill impairment, and the effects of share-based payments. Inter-segment sales are priced along the same 
lines as sales to external customers, with an appropriate discount being applied to encourage use of group resources at a rate acceptable to 
local tax authorities. Loans and borrowings, insurances and head office central services costs are allocated to the segments based on levels 
of turnover. Details of the types of products and services for each segment is given in the operational review on pages 22 to 29. All turnover 
and operations are based in the UK.

During the year ended 30 April 2017, because of the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017, corporation 
tax has been calculated at 19.9% of estimated assessable profit for the year (2016: 20%).
The Finance (No 2) Act 2015, which provides for reductions in the main rate of corporation tax from 20% to 19% effective from 1 April 2017 
and to 18% effective from 1 April 2020, was substantively enacted on 26 October 2015. Subsequently, the Finance Act 2016, which provides 
for a further reduction in the main rate of corporation tax to 17% effective from 1 April 2020, was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016. 
These rate reductions have been reflected in the calculation of the deferred tax at the statement of financial position date. The closing 
deferred tax liability at 30 April 2017 has been calculated at 17%, reflecting the tax rate at which the deferred tax is expected to be 
utilised in future periods. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Basic – excluding exceptional costs and share-based payments 12.1 12.1
Diluted – excluding exceptional costs and share-based payments 12.1 12.1
The calculation of the basic earnings per share is based on the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders and on 75,123,288 ordinary 
shares (2016: 70,000,000) being the weighted average number of ordinary shares. In accordance with IAS 33, the weighted average number 
of shares in issue during the period has been retrospectively adjusted for the proportionate change in the number of the shares 
outstanding because of the bonus issue and share splits that occurred on admission to AIM.
The underlying earnings per share is based on profit adjusted for exceptional operating costs and share-based payment charges, net of tax, 
and on the same weighted average number of shares used in the basic earnings per share calculation above. The Directors consider that 
this measure provides an additional indicator of the underlying performance of the Group.
There is no dilutive effect of the share options as performance conditions remain unsatisfied and the share price was below the exercise price. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 34–53 STRATEGIC REPORT 01–33 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 54–84

Goodwill
Goodwill acquired is allocated, at acquisition, to CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination. The carrying value of 
goodwill is allocated as follows:
 
2017
£’000
2016
£’000
General Piling 1,147 1,147
Specialist Piling 742 742
Ground Engineering Services 240 240
Ground Engineering Products 50 50
2,179 2,179
The Group tests annually for impairment of goodwill. The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined using value-in-use calculations. 
The value-in-use calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on the Board-approved budget for the year ended 30 April 2018. 
Subsequent cash flows are extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 2%.
The rate used to discount the projected cash flows is a pre-tax risk-adjusted discount rate of 10.8% for all business segments. The same 
discount rate has been used for each CGU as the principal risks associated with the Group, as highlighted on pages 16 and 17, would also 
impact each CGU in a similar manner.
The value-in-use calculations described above, together with a sensitivity analysis using reasonable assumptions, indicate ample headroom 
and therefore do not give rise to impairment concerns.

Capital management
The Group’s capital structure is kept under constant review, taking account of the need for, availability and cost of various sources of finance. 
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, as shown in note 28, and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent as 
shown in the consolidated statement of financial position. The Group maintains a balance between certainty of funding and a flexible, 
cost-effective financing structure with all main borrowings being from committed facilities. The Group’s policy continues to ensure that its 
capital structure is appropriate to support this balance and the Group’s operations. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the 
Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Financial risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing finance and capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, to provide 
returns to shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. The Group 
is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
The main financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity risk, credit risk and market risk (which includes interest rate risk). Currently, the 
Group only operates in the UK and only transacts in Sterling. It is therefore not exposed to any foreign currency exchange risk. The Board 
regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks.
Credit risk
The Group’s financial assets are trade and other receivables and bank and cash balances. These represent the Group’s maximum exposure 
to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer fails to meet its contractual obligations. It is Group policy to assess the 
credit risk of all existing and new customers on a contract-by-contract basis before entering contracts. The Board has established a credit 
policy under which each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Group’s standard payment and delivery 
terms and conditions are offered. The Group’s review includes external ratings, when available, and in some cases bank references. Total 
contract limits are established for each customer, which represent the maximum exposure permissible without requiring approval from the 
Board. The ageing of trade receivables that were past due but not impaired is shown in note 17.
The counterparty risk on bank and cash balances is managed by limiting the aggregate amount of exposure to any one institution by 
reference to their credit rating and by regular review of these ratings. The Board regularly reviews the credit rating of the banks where 
funds are deposited ensuring that only the highest rated banks are utilised.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due and managing its working 
capital, debt and cash balances.
The Group’s policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due. To achieve 
this aim, it seeks to maintain cash balances (or agreed facilities) to meet expected requirements for a period of at least 90 days. The Group 
also seeks to reduce liquidity risk by fixing interest rates (and hence cash flows) on its long-term borrowings. This is further discussed in the 
“market risk” section below.
The Board receives rolling three-month cash flow projections on a weekly basis. At the end of the financial year, these projections indicated 
that the Group expected to have sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations under all reasonably expected circumstances and will 
not need to draw down on its agreed £3,000,000 overdraft facility. 
The following table sets out the undiscounted contractual payments and maturities (including future interest charges) of financial liabilities:

Market risk – interest rate risk
It is currently Group policy that 100% of external Group borrowings (excluding short-term overdraft facilities) are fixed-rate borrowings. 
Divisions are not permitted to borrow short or long term from external sources. At 30 April 2017, it is estimated that a general increase 
of one percentage point in interest rates would have a negligible impact on the reported profit.

Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 17% (2016: 18%) being the rate

There is a further deferred tax asset of £45,320 (2016: £45,320) in respect of capital losses that have not been recognised in the financial 
statements, as it is not considered probable that there will be future capital profits in this entity.

24. Share capital continued
Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) – 26 October 2016
As part of its Listing on the AIM market several changes were made to the share capital of the Company immediately prior to listing.
On 21 October 2016, the Company carried out a bonus issue of shares allotted to existing shareholders for no consideration. The bonus 
issue increased the issued share capital of the Company by £331,000. On the same day, the Company redesignated its 50p “A” ordinary 
shares, 50p “B” ordinary shares, 1p “C” ordinary shares and 15p “D” ordinary shares into a single class of 2p ordinary shares. This process 
did not result in changes to the issued share capital of the Company and was carried out to facilitate the Listing.
On 26 October 2016, the Company’s shares were admitted to trading on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange. 
In conjunction, the Company made an Initial Public Offering of 10,000,000 new 2p ordinary shares at a price of 100p per ordinary share. 
Costs relating directly to the new issue of shares to the amount of £1,167,000 were deducted from the share premium account. Other costs 
attributable to the Listing were expensed (note 7).
Share options
The maximum total number of ordinary shares which may vest in the future, in respect of conditional performance share plan awards at 
30 April 2017, amounted to 2,743,060 (2016: nil). These shares will only be issued subject to satisfying certain performance criteria (note 25).
25. Share-based payments
The Company operates two share-based incentive schemes for Directors and key employees, known as the Van Elle Holdings plc 
Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) and the Van Elle Holdings plc Company Share Option Plan (“CSOP”). Both schemes are United Kingdom 
tax authority-approved schemes.
The Group recognised total expenses of £77,000 (2016: £nil) in respect of equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the year.
Long T erm Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
The Group operates an L TIP for senior executives. Share options were granted on admission to the AIM market in October 2016. The exercise 
price is 2p, being the nominal value of shares. The options will vest after three years assuming continuing employment with the Company. 
The extent to which the options will vest is dependent upon the Company’s performance over the three year period set at the date of grant. 
The vesting of 50% of the awards will be determined by the Company’s relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance and the 
other 50% by the Company’s absolute EPS performance. 
Details of the maximum total number of ordinary shares, which may be issued in future periods in respect of conditional share awards 
at 30 April 2017, is shown below.

VAN ELLE HOLDINGS PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Notes to the parent company financial statements 
For the year ended 30 April 2017
1. General information
These financial statements were approved and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 25 July 2017.
Van Elle Holdings plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the 
Company’s registered office is Van Elle Holdings plc, Kirkby Lane, Pinxton, Nottinghamshire, NG16 6JA. The Company has its primary listing 
on AIM, part of the London Stock Exchange.
2. Basis of preparation
The financial statements of Van Elle Holdings plc (the “Company”) are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The financial 
statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the European Union 
(“IFRS”), International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretation Committee (“IFRS IC”) interpretations and those provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Company financial statements have been prepared on the going 
concern basis and adopting the historical cost convention. 
The Company financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is also the Company’s functional currency. Amounts are rounded to the 
nearest thousand, unless otherwise stated.
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under Section 408 of the Companies Act and not presented an income 
statement or a statement of comprehensive income for the Company. The profit for the year is disclosed in the statement of changes in 
equity. The Company has no direct employees and all personnel costs are borne by the subsidiary company, Van Elle Limited.
The parent company does not maintain a separate bank account and all cash flows are transacted by subsidiary undertakings and therefore 
a statement of cash flows is not presented.
The assessment of going concern and the adoption of new accounting standards are consistent with those set out in note 2 of the 
consolidated financial statements.
3. Significant accounting policies
The policies adopted by the Company are consistent with those set out in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. The following 
additional policies are also relevant to the Company financial statements.
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are valued at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and including directly attributable 
transaction costs. The carrying value is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not 
be recoverable.
Dividends received
Revenue is recognised when the Company’s right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when the shareholders approve 
the dividend.
4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of the Company financial statements requires the use of certain judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on 
historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will seldom equal the actual 
results. The estimates and assumptions relevant to the financial statements are embedded within the relevant notes in the consolidated 
financial statements.
Carrying value of investments
The key source of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that has a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the parent 
company financial statements is the recoverability of the investments set out in note 5.
The recoverability is estimated based on the expected performance and value of the investments factoring in the potential expected future 
net cash flow to be generated from the investment. The Company based its estimation on information available when these financial statements 
were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments may change due to market changes or circumstances 
arising beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are reflected when they occur. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 34–53 STRATEGIC REPORT 01–33 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 54–84
