intu Trafford Centre is the only UK 
location other than Oxford Street 
where you can ﬁnd Selfridges, 
John Lewis, Debenhams and 
Marks & Spencer in one place. As 
the prime shopping destination in 
the northwest, with a catchment 
of nearly 10 million, it is no 
wonder it is often the ﬁrst stop for 
retailers as they expand outside 
central London. 
intu Lakeside offers its loyal 
customer base from Essex and the 
southeast a compelling mix of 
retail, catering and leisure at the 
heart of nearly 5 million sq ft of 
retail space in the wider Lakeside 
basin. The centre is popular  
with families – which is why 
Nickelodeon has chosen  
intu Lakeside for its ﬁrst theme  
park in a UK shopping centre.

Overview Chairman’s statement
Our motivated and experienced staff ensure our centres 
remain vibrant and enticing to both customers and retailers 
in a fast-changing environment
As I come towards the end of my ﬁrst 
year in the role of Chairman, I have been 
phenomenally impressed by the business 
and the people who are the driving force 
behind its success. 
Spending more time in our centres and 
meeting staff, as I have done ﬁrst as a 
non-executive director and this year  
as Chairman, has conﬁrmed these 
impressions. Our vibrant centres are the 
best in their regions and are continuously 
changing to meet new customer and 
retailer needs created by today’s 
multichannel retail world. This constant 
evolution is directed by our experienced 
and ambitious management team  
whose drive is shaping the shopping 
centre industry.
The last 12 months
The last 12 months have been an 
interesting time in our industry –  
capital markets have been concerned  
by perceived headwinds in retail, from  
Brexit in the UK to structural issues in  
the US, as well as the impact of online.  
Yet throughout this period we have 
outperformed against our  
operational benchmarks.
Our success has come from ensuring our 
centres are the places where people want 
to be. Our purpose is to make customers 
smile, leading to strong footfall, increased 
dwell time and higher spend, and this, in 
turn, helps our retailers ﬂourish – resulting 
in high occupancy and near record levels 
of lettings and tenant investment.
In Spain, we enhanced our platform with 
the acquisition of Madrid Xanadú and 
advanced our plans for the world-class 
intu Costa del Sol shopping resort. In the 
UK, we continue to see encouraging 
levels of pre-lets on our exciting pipeline 
of development projects. 
The disposal of 50 per cent of intu 
Chapelﬁeld at a price in line with the 
December 2016 valuation underwrites 
our property values as well as recycling 
capital into our development pipeline.
Innovation is engrained in our business, 
and using our experience and expertise in 
the shopping centre industry, we continue 
to deﬁne the future of the shopping mall. 
intu Accelerate is just one example of this, 
testing out a range of pioneering ideas for 
both customers and retailers. Online, our 
premium content publisher and shopping 
platform, intu.co.uk, continues to see 
strong growth with sales through the 
website increasing by 50 per cent.
Corporate responsibility
I have always believed that behaving 
responsibly is fundamental to the best 
and most sustainable businesses. It is 
especially vital for a retail property 
business such as ours where our centres 
play a pivotal role at the heart of their 
communities. As a long-term investor 
in the UK and Spain, we focus on people 
and placemaking, and ensure our 
initiatives, measured through key 
performance indicators, align with  
the communities we serve.

Our vibrant centres

our experienced and

team whose drive is

John Strachan
Chairman
intu properties plc  Annual report 2017 6 I am pleased to report that the measure 
of our community investment, gross 
value added, remains stable on a like-for-
like basis at £4.6 billion this year, and we 
have reached our 2020 target for a  
50 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas 
emissions three years early.
As a long-term business and a major 
employer in many of the regions where 
we operate, we have an important role 
in the future and the wellbeing of our 
communities. We take our responsibilities 
seriously, whether that is ensuring we 
reduce our environmental impact or 
helping local people by working with  
a charity to provide prom dresses for 
students. Recognising the importance  
of locally created and relevant projects, 
my Chairman’s prize for 2017 has gone  
to The Bus Shelter MK, a project to 
provide short-term accommodation 
for homeless people in Milton Keynes 
in a converted double-decker bus.
Our people
I would like to convey my warmest 
thanks to my colleagues on the Board 
and to all our staff for their commitment 
and creativity. As I said in my introduction, 
I am remarkably proud of our people, 
from apprentices to senior managers, 
who day in and day out deliver the 
intu difference that sets us apart from 
the competition. 
Dividend
Your Directors are recommending  
a ﬁnal dividend of 9.4 pence per share, 
bringing the total amount paid and 
payable in respect of 2017 to 14.0 pence, 
unchanged from the 2016 dividend.  
A scrip dividend alternative may  
be offered.
Looking to 2018
As David discusses in his Chief Executive’s 
review, we are refocusing our strategic 
objectives. They are to deliver growth in 
like-for-like net rental income, building 
further on the previous three years of 
growth, all underpinned by operational 
excellence. Our development 
programme, focused on ﬂagship 
destinations and ﬁnanced through 
astute capital recycling and allocation, 
will add further organic growth.
The Bus Shelter MK
This unique partnership with intu Milton 
Keynes raised money to convert a bus to 
provide short-term accommodation for 
homeless people in Milton Keynes
Creating a pan-European portfolio
In December we agreed a recommended 
all-share offer for the company by 
Hammerson. The boards of Hammerson 
and intu believe that there is a compelling 
strategic rationale for the acquisition, 
which will bring together high-quality 
retail property portfolios and combined 
expertise to create a leading European 
retail REIT with a strong income proﬁle 
and superior growth prospects.
Both boards believe that, following the 
acquisition, the enlarged group will be 
better placed to enhance its position in 
its geographic markets and across its 
retail formats, with a more efficient and 
adaptable platform allowing it to respond 
to fast-changing consumer preferences 
and retail trends.
The transaction is subject to certain 
approvals and is not expected to complete 
until late 2018.
Strategic report
7 Chairman’s statement Chief Executive’s review
intu focuses solely on regional shopping centres  
in the UK and Spain
Our performance in 2017
The underlying strengths of the intu 
business were much in evidence in 2017 
as we have recorded a robust overall 
performance, confounding the external 
gloom and negativity in pre-Brexit UK 
about retail and retail property, and 
showing the success of our asset 
management initiatives and  
strategic positioning.
Our underlying earnings per share were 
steady at 15.0 pence; we grew like-for-like 
net rental income by 0.5 per cent, within 
our original guidance 12 months ago;  
and net asset value per share, helped by  
a tremendous performance from the 
Spanish business, increased from  
404 pence to 41 1 pence.
We delivered on each of our four core 
objectives for 2017:
 — asset performance was resilient in 
the UK and buoyant in Spain, with the 
clear message from key performance 
indicators, such as lettings, occupancy, 
footfall and dwell time, that intu is in 
ﬁne shape
 — the investment programme in the UK 
moved on at pace with expenditure in 
the year of £184 million. The pipeline 
for the next three years amounts 
to £562 million, with plenty of 
opportunity beyond that date.  
In addition to the £180 million  
intu Watford extension, opening in 
2018, signiﬁcant projects are underway 
at major centres, such as intu Lakeside, 
intu Trafford Centre and intu Merry Hill
 — the awareness and importance of 
the intu brand has continued to 
grow. Five years on from launch, we 
can clearly see the advantages of a 
strong brand for a shopping centre 
business such as ours. Among these 
advantages we would include superior 
customer service, refreshing changes 
to the centres’ physical and digital 
environments and new and innovative 
sources of revenue
 — we continued to seize the growth 
opportunity in Spain. We acquired 
Madrid Xanadú in the year, a centre 
full of growth opportunities and an 
ideal ﬁt for our shopping resort model 
in Spain, with a Nickelodeon theme 
park attraction and aquarium under 
construction, to add to the existing 
indoor ski slope
Outlook and 2018 strategic objectives
The environment for the business is  
likely to remain challenging as the  
UK continues through the Brexit 
negotiations. Our shopping centres have 
not been immune to the UK’s relatively 
sluggish economic performance. 
Decision-making about investing in  
the UK has inevitably been impacted  
in the pre-Brexit period and domestic 
consumers have been adapting to 
ﬂuctuations in their discretionary 
spending capacity. 
The 2017 results are, however, a 
considerable endorsement of the 
underlying strength of the intu business 
and our strategic objectives for 2018  
build on those we have pursued in  
the last few years. They are:
 — growing like-for-like net rental income
 — optimising our ﬂagship destinations
 — delivering operational excellence
 — making smart use of capital
Front of mind for investors is the changing 
mix of online and in-store sales and how 
that might affect demand for physical 
space, hence our particular focus on the 
basic measure of growing like-for-like net 
rental income. At intu, we are still seeing 
key retailers taking more space, and 
investing for the long term in our centres, 
as they recognise the footfall we deliver 
and our ability to create more reasons  
for customers to visit and stay longer.
The underlying
strengths of the intu
business were much in
evidence in 2017 as  
shown by our robust
overall performance.”
David Fischel
Chief Executive
intu properties plc  Annual report 2017 8 Our energies are also concentrated on 
ensuring all our centres evolve with 
consumer and retailer needs, so that they 
deliver sustainable growth. Keeping our 
centres at the forefront of people’s minds 
requires continual focus on bringing in 
new attractions, be it a key retailer or 
restaurant or a compelling leisure 
attraction. In addition to delivering our 
target return hurdles, our projects 
innovate what we offer our customers 
and keep us at the leading edge of the 
shopping centre industry.
Nowhere will this be more obvious  
than at our ground-up scheme in  
Spain, intu Costa del Sol, where we  
have the opportunity to create a world-
class centre, delivering our signature  
shopping resort product and  
showcasing our expertise.
Operational excellence is a clear 
differentiator in both the UK and Spain. 
Our knowledge and insight are important, 
as is our culture and living our values – 
bold, creative and genuine – which 
underpin everything that we do. Our 
culture is embodied by our brand which 
has become recognised throughout the 
shopping centre industry, with intu a 
byword for fantastic customer service, 
motivated and enthusiastic staff,  
expert mall operations and good 
corporate citizenship.
Our skill in this area is recognised by the 
partners we have brought into the 
business in the last few years, including 
CPPIB, LaSalle Investment Management 
and TH Real Estate. The ability to partner 
on assets allows us to astutely recycle 
and allocate capital to deliver superior 
returns. With over £800 million of cash 
and committed facilities, our ﬁnancial 
position is very sound.

Utilising technology
The retail industry has been embracing new 
technology like never before, as retailers 
increasingly see tech as a catalyst for 
creating new business opportunities,  
rather than a threat. Retailers are ﬁnding 
ingenious ways to shape their technological 
infrastructures, deﬁne their online presence 
and drive engagement with customers.
At intu, we adapted and changed our 
business model in 2013 to offer a seamless 
multichannel proposition. This year we 
began working with seven tech start-ups  
as part of intu Accelerate, our incubator 
programme, which has been trialling a 
range of new ideas in our shopping centres, 
from robotic customer services assistants 
to an online personal shopper service.
And while few new shopping centres are 
being built in the UK, we aim to be on site at 
intu Costa del Sol in Spain next year to build 
a groundbreaking shopping resort that 
takes everything we have been putting into 
practice over the last few years in the UK to 
a whole new level.

Our culture
In one way, we are a simple business,  
with a focus on creating the best shopping 
centre experience. Our culture is driven by  
a single-minded purpose to make our 
customers feel better about life through  
a visit to one of our centres.
This is an important part of the intu 
difference and a cause of our success.  
We encourage all our employees to look at 
things differently and creatively, to consider 
carefully and then act boldly and genuinely.
Strategic report
9 Chief Executive’s review Our 2018 strategy
Our results highlight the underlying strength of the intu business based on 
the strategic objectives we have pursued over the last few years. For 2018, 
we are enhancing our strategy to build on this strong base
Over the last three years, we have 
focused on four strategic objectives  
and consistently delivered against these 
with 2017 being another strong year  
of results. These objectives have seen  
us optimising our assets and growing 
like-for-like net rental income, delivering 
award-winning developments, building  
a business in Spain and maximising our  
operations through our brand. 
In Spain, we now own three top-10 
centres and are on target to begin the 
construction of intu Costa del Sol. Our 
challenge is no longer to build a business 
in Spain – we are now an established 
national player. Our brand is ﬁve years old 
and is a recognised market leader with a 
distinctive approach and clear purpose.
Knowing this, and with an eye on the 
potential challenges facing us in a 
changing market, we are tilting the 
emphasis of our objectives to increase  
our focus on the growth and continuing 
excellence of our ﬂagship destinations  
in the UK and Spain. We set out our 
objectives in more detail below.
By delivering a compelling mix of retail, catering and leisure, each  
of our ﬂagship destinations generally draws footfall of 20 million  
or more and the average customer stays for over two hours.  
We use our insight, expertise and innovation to ensure that  
they are the destinations of choice for our customers.
Priorities in 2018
 — ensure the leisure extension at intu Lakeside remains on target
 — complete the aquarium and Nickelodeon leisure attractions at 
Madrid Xanadú
 — commence the redevelopment and repositioning of Barton Square, 
further improving the tenant mix at intu Trafford Centre
 — complete the ﬁnal planning consents at intu Costa del Sol
Like-for-like net rental income growth is our key income measure.  
Given our relatively low cost base and ﬁxed ﬁnance costs, growing  
our net rental income drives earnings and ultimately dividend  
and total property return.
Priorities in 2018
 — grow like-for-like net rental income, currently expected to be in the 
range of 1.5 to 2.5 per cent
 — deliver new lettings ahead of previous rent and increasing rents 
through the rent review cycle
 — reduce vacancy rate year-on-year

12 Our strategic focus going forward
Making customers smile and helping retailers ﬂourish is what we do, and 
operational excellence is how we measure our success. From a customer’s 
point of view, this is measured by our brand metrics, including net 
promoter score and brand recognition. For our retailers, it relates to 
how many customers we attract and how long they stay in our centres. 
For our wider communities, it is about being a good corporate citizen.
Priorities in 2018
 — ensure we continue to outperform footfall benchmark
 — enhance brand recognition and consistency of net promoter score
 — build on digital platform and continue to grow sales through  
the website
 — communicate, and start working towards, our 2030 corporate 
responsibility strategy
As the leading owner, developer and manager of shopping centres in  
the UK and Spain, we and our assets are well respected throughout the 
industry. This means we can access capital and attract partners to 
increase focus and achieve superior returns at our ﬂagship locations.
Priorities in 2018
 — ensure facilities available for the development pipeline – maintaining 
loan to value in the 40 to 50 per cent range 
 — continue the recycling of capital to deliver higher returns  
from developments
 — deliver ﬁnancing for the intu Costa del Sol development
Delivering operational excellence Making smart use of capital
 See our business model on page 30
Our overall business model remains unchanged. Our  
assets and resources and what we do remain the same  
but the strategy that delivers sustainable value for our 
shareholders and stakeholders has been adjusted to  
better represent today’s opportunities and challenges.

We have a strong pipeline of organic growth opportunities for the next decade in the UK 
and Spain. We are on site with extensions at intu Watford and intu Lakeside and approaching 
the required level of tenant demand to start several other major projects 
Over the next three years we will focus on 
projects with proven tenant demand. With 
signiﬁcant levels of pre-letting, we are on  
site at intu Watford and intu Lakeside and 
expect to start several other near-term 
projects shortly.
intu Watford
This leisure-led extension is on site and  
on track for opening in October 2018.  
The transformation will be anchored by  
a nine-screen Cineworld IMAX cinema,  
10 restaurants and a Debenhams department 
store and includes a refurbishment of the 
existing malls. Pre-lets stand at around 
two-thirds, by space, with new lettings 
including Hollywood Bowl and Superdry.
intu Lakeside
The extension, anchored by a Nickelodeon 
theme park, will bring additional leisure and 
catering brands to intu Lakeside, increasing  
the catchment and dwell times of the centre. 
Hollywood Bowl, Flip Out and Puttshack 
complete the leisure attractions, which along 
with 11 new restaurants will further enhance 
this family-oriented extension.

intu Trafford Centre (Barton Square)
The expansion and transformation of Barton 
Square at intu Trafford Centre will be anchored 
by Primark and provide a fashion offer for the 
ﬁrst time at Barton Square. Enclosing the 
courtyard will enable trading from two levels 
and add an additional 110,000 sq ft of  
retail space.
intu Broadmarsh
The second phase of our Nottingham  
vision is to redevelop the 500,000 sq ft  
existing centre to provide a complementary 
offer to that of intu Victoria Centre. The 
redevelopment will focus on new brands to the 
city, with a cinema and restaurant-led upper 
level and convenience-driven lower level. The 
Light cinema and Hollywood Bowl will anchor 
the leisure element of the redevelopment.
intu Costa del Sol
With ﬁnal planning consents expected  
shortly and strong demand from retailers,  
we expect to be on site with this shopping 
resort development in the next 12 months. 
intu Costa del Sol will have a high proportion 
of leisure and will be a must-visit destination 
for both residents and tourists from the  
whole of the region.
Our active asset management capital expenditure projects offer 
attractive returns, with stabilised initial yield on costs of 6 to 10 per cent. 
These projects vary in scale but all focus on improving the customer 
experience, whether it is retail, catering or leisure. Committed examples 
include the new Next ﬂagship stores at intu Metrocentre and intu Merry 
Hill, as well as a new restaurant quarter at Manchester Arndale. In the 
pipeline we have plans at intu Merry Hill to increase the catering and 
leisure, embedding its position as one of the UK’s best shopping centres.
Beyond 2020, we continue to work on securing the required planning 
approvals and tenant demand to start £2.5 billion of projects in the UK 
and Spain which we would expect to deliver stabilised initial yields of 
around 7 per cent. We have the required planning for extensions to  
intu Lakeside, intu Victoria Centre, intu Braehead and intu Milton Keynes 
and are at earlier stages of the approval process for the extension at 
Cribbs Causeway. These plans aim to enhance local prosperity through 
job creation in both the construction and operating phase.

With the whole business centred 
around our customer , we 
bring together our experience, 
insight and expertise to create 
compelling experiences, in centre 
and online, which deliver real 
results for our retailers, caterers 
and leisure operators
Our statistics are impressive but it

ur insight and research programmes help us 
understand what motivates customers to visit 
their local intu, stay longer and return more often. We 
then combine our expertise with our brand to attract 
the best retailers, the most sought-after brands and 
exciting immersive experiences to do just that.
Our purpose is to put  
a smile on the face of our 
customers. We want them to be 
happier after a visit to our centres 
than when they walked through 
the door. We know that happy 
customers mean happy retailers.”

17 The intu difference Making the difference Anticipating customers’  
changing needs
Our customers want to be able to shop 
when they like through different channels. 
However, the store is king, and the place 
shoppers spend the vast majority of their 
money. They like the ability to see, touch 
and try on the full range from all key 
retailers in one location, or as part of a 
day out, to conﬁrm online research and 
pick up products bought online.
Economic uncertainty
For customers there is pressure on 
disposable income from inﬂation 
outpacing wage growth, for retailers 
there are challenges from inﬂation on  
the cost base and dealing with the 
structural shift to online. Brexit brings 
further uncertainty and retailers need  
to ensure they get their required returns 
from new stores.
Innovation
In the same way that retailers innovate  
for today’s market, innovation in shopping 
centres delivers better ways of doing 
things, reducing costs and building a more 
sustainable business. Examples of how 
intu is meeting the innovation challenge 
can be found throughout this document.
The power of data
The ability to gather and understand 
data, then act quickly on the conclusions 
drawn, is critical in today’s world where 
disruptors look for gaps in the market. 
Owning our digital infrastructure, and 
hence owning the data, means we can 
maximise the power of our data to the 
beneﬁt of our customers and retailers.
Good corporate citizen
Behaving responsibly and thinking long 
term about the environment and local 
communities around our centres are 
important in our future planning. 
New retail anchors
The retailers that attract customers to a 
centre are changing. Super retailers, such 
as Primark and Next, are increasing their 
store size, while the likes of Inditex and 
H&M are taking additional stores for their 
portfolios of brands. Customers are 
drawn to these retailers because  
they offer their full ranges in our  
ﬂagship destinations. 
Market overview
Retail is a dynamic industry, and retailers 
the world over are used to dealing with an 
ever-changing environment. Right now 
they are facing economic and structural 
challenges which are speeding up the  
rate of change of their online and  
in-store strategies. 
The store, and its value, is still integral  
to these strategies. Retailers are 
continuing to invest in ﬂagship stores in 
locations that offer a compelling mix of 
retail, catering, leisure and experience  
and deliver high footfall. That is why  
we continue to be a key landlord for  
our retailers.
Understanding 
our markets
Retail 
trends
As a leading shopping centre operator in the UK,  
we understand the trends that affect our industry  
and the impact they will have on customers and retailers
18 intu properties plc  Annual report 2017  Informed by data
W
e have many touchpoints with our 
customers. Our experience and 
expertise allow us to critically analyse  
and interpret what they tell us so we can 
deliver days out that make them smile.
Our data covers the whole customer 
journey, from customers’ website and 
digital behaviour before they go to our 
centres, through to what they thought  
of their experience while they were there.
Our comprehensive data consolidation 
project is bringing this information 
together to enhance our understanding 
of our customers. We take a responsible 
approach to our data and are using the 
opportunity afforded by this project to 
ensure all our data meets General Data 
Protection Regulations requirements. 
We are piloting new ways to employ  
both our own data and that of third 
parties more effectively. For example,  
we are testing the use of anonymised 
information of wiﬁ usage through  
our digital infrastructure, in order to 
understand customer ﬂow patterns 
during busy times, so we can deploy 
teams more swiftly.
By segmenting our customer data 
according to demographics, shopping 
habits and location we can tailor the  
mix of retail, leisure and great offers,  
and ensure our facilities meet their 
expectations, so everyone has a 
compelling experience every time  
they come.
International
Despite the challenging headwinds  
facing retailers, the UK is still an attractive 
market for international retailers who 
focus their expansion plans on high 
footfall, experience-based locations. 
Demand is truly global, with Victoria’s 
Secret from the US, Australian 
accessories brand Lovisa and Polish 
cosmetics store Inglot all expanding.
Brands
As direct access to new customers 
becomes harder, brands are considering 
different routes, with shopping centres an 
attractive option as they offer high levels 
of footfall and long dwell times. Global 
brands such as Nespresso, Mercedes and 
Tesla are following this route and we are 
having conversations with fast-moving 
consumer goods companies. 
Leisure
From trampolining and minigolf to skiing 
and aquariums, brands such as Puttshack, 
Flip Out and Gravity are increasingly 
taking space in our ﬂagship centres,  
to reach the leisure-hungry customer. 
Leisure and experience play a key role  
in what people decide to do with their  
free time and they want to enjoy such 
attractions at a place convenient to them.

19 The intu difference Understanding our markets The customer at the heart of  
everything we do
C
reating the intu brand in 2013 was a bold move, putting the 
customer at the heart of everything we do for all our staff. 
Our commitment to this strategy over the last ﬁve years has  
paid off with the success of the brand evident throughout the 
business. Our reputation, awareness and consideration scores  
are now the highest in the industry. 
The brand works equally well in Spain. Since we launched the 
brand at intu Asturias there has been a 135 per cent rise in  
net promoter score (NPS). We will be rebranding both Puerto 
Venecia and Madrid Xanadú in 2018 to repeat that success.
Using experiences to drive brand choice
Research helps us understand what makes our customers smile, 
and we use what we discover to create unique experiences  
to do just that. Three big campaigns in 2017 , described below, 
delighted millions of customers while generating international 
PR that built brand awareness both in the UK and around the 
world. This publicity helps us become the top choice when 
customers think about where they want to spend their shopping 
and leisure time. 
Making 
customers 
smile 
Discovering money turns out to be 
one of the most joyful surprises. 
Cue our spring release of hundreds 
of origami birds worth £10 each 
around our centres. 
Using science we researched 
what made the happiest 
Christmas song – and then 
had one written which was 
performed at our centres to 
help get our customers into 
the Christmas mood.
Our customers love ice cream 
– so during the school summer 
holidays, we created and 
unveiled the world’s smallest 
ice cream van, giving out free 
ice cream to shoppers, to their 
great delight.
Bringing joy to our customers and making 
them smile helps retailers ﬂourish and

E

our brand promise – they provide compelling 
experiences for customers and attract people  
from further who stay longer.
As well as collaborating with some of the biggest 
names in entertainment, from Sony Pictures to 
Playmobil and Nickelodeon, we run a biennial  
touring exhibition.
We kicked off in 2014 hosting the world-renowned 
Elephant Parade for its ﬁrst ever national touring 
event. In 2016 it was the Big Birdhouse Tour with the 
RSPB and the 2018 tour will embrace biodiversity.
Our strategy is not just about big set 
pieces – every centre has an 
events programme designed 
around its retailers and 
audiences to celebrate 
local, national and 
international events.
Nickelodeon All Stars
O
ne of our star turns in 2017 was the Easter campaign with  
the Nickelodeon All Stars. The intu tour by the PAW Patrol  
crew gave us a national proﬁle through the Nickelodeon channel  
and brought fantastic activities for 25,000 children – making intu  
the ﬁrst choice for families during the school holiday period.

So now we are taking our random 
acts of kindness concept online,  
with the digital joy jar pilot at intu 
Lakeside. Aimed at the grown-ups 
this time, we use social media 
monitoring tool Local Measure  
in a geofenced area to spot people 
who are sharing their celebrations 
online. If they opted in, we can  
reply to their message with  
a positive response, offering  
them an intu treat. 
The pilot has created such surprise 
and delight that we are rolling the 
scheme out across all our centres  
in 2018.

21 The intu difference Making customers smile  Unique model helps retailers ﬂourish
O
ur leasing-experiential-digital (LED) model ensures that 
retailers working in partnership with intu can reach their 
true potential across all intu channels. 
Leasing – an integral part of successful retailing remains  
the store. In taking space with us retailers know that they are  
in safe hands – our centres are continuously improving and 
developing, always destinations where customers want to be. 
Experiential – our tailor-made promotional services model  
is designed to help retailers and brands reach their true 
potential. In centre, this can include pop-up space on the  
mall, promotional events and digital media advertising,  
all with the aim of delivering improved recognition and 
ultimately increased sales.
Digital – with a transactional website that has an annual  
digital audience of 26 million, we can help retailers meet  
their multichannel aspirations. From volume sales through  
our online shop and dedicated emails to our engaged  
‘shopper’ community, along with brand awareness through 
strong editorial content across our online and social media,  
we actively support our retailers’ growth.
Not only have we redeﬁned the customer experience, we are 
redeﬁning the tenant experience too. Through our LED model, 
we offer a multichannel approach that truly supports their 
retail strategies.

A
s we build our presence in Spain, we and our 
tenants are beneﬁting from opportunities across 
both the UK and Spain. We have seen enhanced 
collaboration for UK-based retailers in our Spanish 
centres with the likes of Five Guys and Quiz taking 
some of their ﬁrst spaces in Spain at intu centres  
and many discussions starting for intu Costa del Sol. 
For Spanish companies looking to grow in the UK,  
we have enhanced our relationships. Grupo Parques 
Reunidos, the Spanish entertainment operator,  
is launching its ﬁrst venture in the UK, with a 
Nickelodeon theme park at intu Lakeside. It is  
also constructing one at Madrid Xanadú.
Digital success
B
ack in 2013 we introduced our 
new affiliate website, intu.co.uk, 
enabling retailers to promote their 
products to our digital audience. It is 
now one of the country’s leading 
affiliate websites, used by over  
500 retailers and generating £9 million in sales from  
5.7 million visits. Its latest functionality uses AI-powered 
visual search to enable shoppers to pick an item and then 
instantly be shown similar products from across all  
our retailers.
Shop Insider, our digital magazine, creates content around 
topical shopping behaviours and rising social trends, that 
helps the reader eat, shop and save. In 2017 Shop Insider  
had 1.4 million readers and our inhouse editorial team were 
commissioned to produce content on behalf of 37 retailers 
and brands, including John Lewis, MAC, Debenhams and 
Marks & Spencer. Retailers can also get access to our  
one million social media followers through bespoke paid-for 
social content.
Just as retailers are choosing our shopping centres to 
promote their brands, they are now realising the beneﬁts of 
using digital content to build their brands. And it has given us 
an edge with pureplays too – digital brands such as Boohoo 
and ASOS are some of intu.co.uk’s most proliﬁc clients.
Improving our business every day
A
t intu, if we can ﬁnd a way of doing things better we will, 
and when it comes to supporting our tenants, we harness 
our thirst for innovation to drive cost efficiencies and make 
their lives easier. Insurance charges have been trimmed by up 
to 20 per cent, thanks to our proactive approach to reducing 
risk. We continue to cut waste costs while assuring our 
tenants that their waste is being treated to the highest 
environmental standards. Our energy procurement strategy 
buys ahead, providing greater cost certainty to our tenants.
This is business as usual at intu, as is our constant search for 
new ways to run our business, supporting exciting start-up 
businesses that offer signiﬁcant technological and process 
innovation in property and retail. Our work with Invida to 
design and implement an entirely new cloud-based software 
platform to support lifecycle management will revolutionise 
the facilities management industry. We are also supporting 
start-up enModus, whose groundbreaking communications 
technology, Wattwave, can transform any industrial, 
commercial or retail property into a smart building, simply by 
connecting all devices to the cloud via the existing power line.
intu Accelerate 
Through intu Accelerate we worked with some of the 
smartest minds to answer some of the questions facing  
the retail and leisure industry today. We chose 
seven start-ups who ran live trials across 
our business to test and demonstrate 
the potential of their ideas to shape the 
future of retail. Four of the best were:
botsandus – intelligent and friendly robot 
assistants (right) to guide customers around 
and help retailers promote their stores
GoInStore – live videos to promote retailers’ 
products to online customers
Infraspeak – efficient building 
management using predictive sensors, 
user-friendly apps and powerful software
WoraPay – a multiretailer app  
allowing customers to order ahead  
to beat the queues

23 The intu difference Helping retailers ﬂourish What are our ﬂagship destinations?
O
ur ﬂagship destinations are the shopping centres where 
retailers aspire to be, both now and in the future. They 
offer them consistently high footfall combined with a long 
dwell time and we know the longer people stay, the more  
they spend. This is why they have their biggest and best  
stores in these locations and have the conﬁdence to invest  
in these stores for the long term. 
For the shopper, they offer a mix of retail, catering and leisure –  
a day-out destination where they can shop, eat and be 
entertained. Customers are willing to spend time travelling  
to these destinations and once there they know they will have 
easy access to all the best stores offering the retailers’ full 
ranges plus a wide variety of leisure to keep everyone happy 
for the day.
Their locations out-of-town, with at least 10,000 free car 
parking spaces, provide an appealing variety of leisure – 
whether it is an aquarium, an indoor ski slope, zip wires, 
trampoline parks or theme parks such as Legoland Discovery 
Centre or Nickelodeon, or the already successful cinemas  
and bowling – there is something for everyone.
And it is a constant evolution. We have a masterplan for every 
centre and the expertise and insight to ensure these ﬂagship 
centres remain at the forefront of both retailers’ and 
customers’ minds for years to come. Trends change and new 
disruptors emerge, but we are always working to improve  
our offering so we remain at the cutting edge of shopping  
and leisure.
Our ﬂagship destinations
As retail evolves, the demand for space  
in ﬂagship destinations increases. These 
locations offer a compelling mix of retail, 
catering and leisure for customers and

n Spain, our ﬂagship destinations are 
shopping resorts. As we compete for 
people’s free time, we want to provide 
something for every member of the 
family, offering variety and surprise.  
Puerto Venecia was the ﬁrst in its class 
and epitomises the shopping resort 
concept. Madrid Xanadú will join the  
club with the opening of the aquarium 
and Nickelodeon theme park and our 
development of intu Costa del Sol  
will take the design  
to the next level.

n 2018, we expect to have the ﬁnal 
planning consents and required  
pre-lets to start the development  
of intu Costa del Sol, near Málaga.  
Even now, pre-construction, it is being  
talked about as a world-class centre.
The site is ideally located to draw 
residents and holidaymakers from  
the whole Costa del Sol region. The 
design ticks all the boxes of a ﬂagship 
destination, and more. This shopping 
resort will deliver our signature product 
and showcase our expertise, taking the 
best of our existing centres plus adding 
the extra qualities that will deﬁne 
leading centres over the coming years.

25 The intu difference Our ﬂagship destinations The sky’s the limit
i
ntu Lakeside was state of the art  
when we built it in 1990, one of the  
ﬁrst out-of-town shopping centres in the 
UK, and it remains one of the top retail 
destinations in the country with 20 million 
visits a year and over 250 shops and 
restaurants, delivering retail sales of over 
£0.5 billion a year and dwell time which 
has risen to nearly 2.5 hours.
It’s no wonder it stays so popular – as a 
company we take a long-term approach, 
always looking 10, 20 years into the  
future to make sure our centres remain 
ahead of our customers’ and tenants’  
expectations. Over the years we have 
made astute land acquisition decisions 
that now give us many options for 
expanding the range of attractions to 
drive dwell time and frequency.
Above all, our talented people know how 
to make the shopping experience special. 
We have a knowledgeable local team, 
supported by experienced national 
experts, who use their understanding  
of the shopping centre environment in 
general, and our customers in particular, 
to create an iconic destination, lauded  
by celebrities and locals alike – thousands 
of social media mentions each month 
show just how much intu Lakeside  
means to its shoppers.
What keeps pulling them in is the great 
retail mix, with the top brands ﬁghting  
for space to do business with some of  
the country’s most loyal shoppers.
We keep intu Lakeside at the top of its 
game – great quality design, attention  
to detail and a constant eye on where we 
can improve the customer’s experience 
means a relentless roll-call of new  
 
projects that bring in more retailers, 
customers and rental income. We created 
the Boardwalk in 2007 to allow lakeside 
eating, which opened fully let. Recently 
we enhanced it by creating a year-round 
external dining environment. In 2014 we 
redeveloped the food court to create a 
dynamic dining experience that appealed 
to aspirational brands and customers.
Our most recent completed project  
is the hotel which opened in 2017 .  
Sited overlooking the lake, the  
Thurrock Lakeside Travelodge is one  
of the best performing hotels in  
the Travelodge portfolio. 
Our £72 million leisure extension, now  
on site, will make intu Lakeside one of  
the biggest leisure attractions in the 
southeast, with the ﬁrst Nickelodeon 
theme park in a shopping centre in the  
UK and a host of other leisure names 
including Hollywood Bowl, Flip Out 
trampolining, Puttshack minigolf and 
leading food brands already signed up. 
We expect the 175,000 sq ft extension  
to open fully let in spring 2019.
Our 100 per cent ownership means we 
have lots of options to continue to drive 
value to the southeast’s pre-eminent 
retail and leisure destination. We  
already have planning permission for 
400,000 sq ft of retail space and are 
looking at developing our leisure offer 
further to attract the younger 
demographic that is moving into the 
Thames Gateway area – Europe’s largest 
regeneration project which will bring 
many more jobs and homes to the area 
over the next few years. Zipwires  
and hot air balloons are in the planning 
stages. Up, up and away intu Lakeside!

shopping experience
GoInStore goes live 
G
oInStore, one of our intu Accelerate start-ups, 
predicts live video is going to be the next big 
thing in omnichannel retail. We offered them 
intu Lakeside’s charming and knowledgeable 
personal stylist Carlene Noel to create content for a 
pilot series of real-time videos that would showcase 
the centre’s retailers and attract customers via our 
Shop Insider channel. Over ﬁve days she worked with 
many of our stores at intu Lakeside such as Toni & 
Guy, Debenhams and MAC, to introduce customers 
to new ranges and brands. The results were 
impressive – 30 per cent of viewers started shopping 
through our website, 12.5 per cent booked a stylist 
and the average viewing time was nearly six times 
the usual dwell on our site. “Live video proved to be  
a great way to enhance the shopping experience,” 
says Carlene.
A 21st-century tenant mix
T
he evolving tenant mix at intu Lakeside tells the 
story of the changing face of shopping centres. 
Over the last ﬁve years we have seen a 10 per cent 
increase in the number of leisure and catering outlets 
as a proportion of stores, as we meet customers’ 
growing expectations for experiences. We can see 
the beneﬁts of satisfying this demand through 
increase in dwell times by eight per cent (and we 
know that the longer customers stay the more they 
spend). The space devoted to leisure and catering will 
double when the leisure extension opens in 2019.
But we are not ﬁnished there…
As the importance of leisure to our customers 
grows we are bringing lots of top new attractions
27 The intu difference intu Lakeside As a business we believe in doing what we 
can to improve local social issues, and we 
prioritise good community engagement 
because it beneﬁts local people, staff and 
ultimately is good for our shopping centre 
by bringing in new customers. Over the 
last year we have:
 — employed a community manager  
to strengthen local relationships
 — launched the Re-Beat Campaign to 
raise over £8,500 to place 10 accessible 
deﬁbrillators in Dudley and train over 
1,000 people within the community in 
their use 
 — taken part in intu’s national campaign 
to make our centres autism-friendly 
and provided assisted shopping guides 
 — worked with local charity the Beacon 
Centre to train over 60 intu staff in 
blind awareness and offered assisted 
shopping sessions to make intu Merry 
Hill accessible to more people
 — helped local young people develop the 
skills they need to ﬁnd work, run a Jobs 
Fair with Dudley South MP Mike Wood, 
taken part in Retail Matters Week  
and supported Young Enterprise 
 — raised £8,000 through all our 
Christmas activity for local cancer 
charity, the White House, and 
volunteered 60 hours of staff time
 — employed local charity, Go Green,  
to sort cans collected through the 
Every Can Counts recycling campaign
W
e have owned our newest ﬂagship 
destination, intu Merry Hill, for just 
three years. In that time we have 
refreshed the mall, attracted new brands, 
enabled £15 million of retailer investment 
and upgraded Next to the 75,000 sq ft 
site recently vacated by Sainsbury’s.
Over the next few years we are going  
to spend £100 million enhancing the 
shopping centre’s leisure and retail mix. 
This investment will contribute even  
more to the £369 million gross value  
we currently add to the local community, 
through employment, business  
rates, capital investment and  
charitable donations.

for the use of local charities, the ‘Espacio 
Solidario’. In 2017 our Spanish centres 
collaborated with 52 charitable projects 
covering everything from environmental 
issues to cancer information. The Caritas 
charity used the Puerto Venecia space 
over the year to collect clothes for 
recycling, collecting 40 tonnes of  
clothes and raising €77 ,466. 
The total value of our charitable support 
in Spain, from all sources, came to 
€310,000 for the year.

31 Our business model Relationships
People are what make us tick. Our relationships and reputation with our stakeholders  
are important to the overall sustainable success of our business
We maintain close relationships with  
our stakeholders, checking in with them 
regularly to ﬁnd out what we are doing 
well, what we can do better, and where 
their needs have changed. Every two 
years our materiality process takes a 
formal sounding of the issues around our 
business that are most relevant to them. 
In 2017 we introduced a reputation 
management framework into the 
business to enable us to measure how  
we are perceived by our stakeholders 
robustly and to ensure that our strategy 
reﬂects their needs and perceptions. 
We have a large number of stakeholders 
but we initially focused on ﬁve primary 
groups: customers, tenants, employees, 
local and national government and 
investors. Working with Reputation 
Institute we identiﬁed areas of most 
concern or interest to each of these ﬁve 
groups and then used existing data sets 
to see how intu was perceived. 
Combined with the 2017 RepTrak UK 
survey this resulted in a reputation score 
across a number of core competencies. 
We also benchmarked ourselves against 
not only our property peers but also 
relevant leisure and retail brands in the 
FTSE 100 and 250. 
As a result of this initial work, in 2018  
we are undertaking bespoke qualitative 
research with our tenants and will be 
introducing a net promoter score system 
similar to Tell intu, to measure key points 
along the relationship chain with tenants, 
such as leases or shopﬁtting. 
Working with our stakeholders
Customers
Our customers are at the heart of 
everything we do, so we listen to them 
carefully to keep our centres continually 
evolving and meeting their requirements. 
Our net promoter score, which we assess 
from Tell intu and is consistently high at 
70, shows where we are succeeding and 
where we could make improvements.
This year we continued our research  
into the customer journey which aims  
to enhance customer experience in our 
centres. Our brand tracker measures 
awareness, advocacy and consideration  
of our brand by customers – spontaneous 
awareness was 26 per cent at the end  
of 2017 . We heard from 20,000 shoppers 
through our Tell intu customer feedback 
programme and our Shopper View 
research panel of 2,000 customers 
participated in 22 projects. 
Retailers
Good relationships with our retailers are 
essential to understanding their retail 
requirements and helping them ﬂourish.
We build our relationships through open 
communication across the business. As 
well as day-to-day contact we hold 
regular client reviews with customer 
relationship managers.
We attend a wide range of industry 
conferences and we host regular 
Merchants Association meetings with 
tenants during the year to discuss local 
plans and issues. 
Investors
We deliver long-term value to our 
investors through strong, stable income 
streams and capital appreciation. This 
ensures we have the ability to move the 
business forward. Understanding the 
requirements and concerns of both 
existing and potential investors is key.
This year we conducted 390 meetings 
with investment institutions, including 
away days to see our centres in action in 
the UK and Spain. We hosted regular 
investor visits to our centres to show  
how we are meeting our objectives and 
attended investor conferences in the UK 
and internationally. We took analysts and 
investors to Madrid Xanadú, to show 
them the quality of our Spanish portfolio 
and to reveal our latest plans for  
intu Costa del Sol. 
We also engaged in environmental, social 
and governance indices which show high 
performance year-on-year.
intu properties plc  Annual report 2017 32 This year intu staff volunteered 28,000 
hours to help local community groups. 
We held over 1,300 community activities 
in our centres. We engaged with nearly 
900 charities and reached over 3,600 
people through our various community 
employment and other schemes. In total, 
we donated £1.9 million in community 
support through time, space and money.
Centre managers are empowered  
to engage with their local MPs and 
councillors and to actively participate in 
local Business Improvement Districts and 
town centre partnerships. For example, 
intu Chapelﬁeld’s general manager is  
the vice-president of the Chamber of 
Commerce, putting us at the heart of 
local business and community activity. 
We also work with local authorities to 
progress our development pipeline.
Our people 
Our employees are the experts behind 
the success of the business. In centres, 
they are the face of intu and delivering 
our brand promise is central to making 
both customers and retailers happy.  
Our commitment to employee 
engagement is the key to our motivated 
workforce and was central to achieving 
Investors in People gold award for all 14 
of our centres.
This year we engaged with our employees 
using many channels such as our intranet, 
staff presentations, brieﬁngs and 
employee consultation forums. Our Win 
Your Dream reward and recognition 
programme entered its third year. 
Local communities
intu centres are at the heart of the 
communities where they are located. 
Good community engagement beneﬁts 
our customers and local people, and 
ultimately is good for our business. 
Suppliers
We rely on our suppliers to help our 
business run smoothly, from day-to-day 
operations through to the construction  
of major developments. We have open, 
transparent and long-term relationships 
with suppliers to ensure they maintain the 
same high standards we set ourselves. 
For example, our relationship with Trinity 
Fire & Security goes back ﬁve years. Not 
only does it give us peace of mind that  
our crucial ﬁre alarm systems function 
correctly, but knowing our centres so well 
enables them to proactively initiate ideas 
that keep us innovative. 
Local and national government
Enduring relationships with local 
authorities, town centre management 
and MPs is vital to our sustainability as a 
long-term business. Our centres are at the 
heart of many of the towns and cities in 
which we operate and where we play a 
vital community role. In some the local 
authority is our investment partner.
Each year we host an annual 
parliamentary dinner for MPs in whose 
constituencies our centres lie, to discuss 
issues of local importance.
We are working closely with the Minister 
of State for Disabled People, Health and 
Work to champion accessibility in retail 
and our CR Manager is co-chairing a retail 
accessibility forum with the Minister.
The value of long-term relationships
Good long-term relationships are essential 
to our development programme, ensuring 
projects run smoothly with planners, 
suppliers and residents. Over the last  
10 years we have worked closely with 
Watford Borough Council to bring the  
intu Watford extension to fruition and 
create a scheme that enhances Watford 
town centre and will beneﬁt residents for 
years to come. We have worked with our 
construction partner Laing O’Rourke 
previously, and they are well-versed in 
what we expect of them in their role as  
an intu supplier.

Why is this important? 
Footfall is an important 
measure of a centre’s 
popularity with customers. 
Retailers use this measure 
as a key part of their 
decision-making process 
on where to locate  
their stores.
How is this measured? 
Footfall numbers across 
intu’s centres are captured 
using a combination of 
person or car counting 
cameras located at speciﬁc 
entrance and exit points 
within the centre.
How have we performed? 
Footfall increased in the 
year, driven by our retail, 
catering and leisure 
offerings, together with our 
customer-focused events, 
and outperformed the 
ShopperTrak measure of 
UK national retail footfall.

Strategic report
37 Key performance indicators Focus on risk
The effective assessment and management of risk  
is key to the delivery of the Group’s strategy
Monitoring and reporting responsibility
Implementation and compliance responsibility
intu’s Board has responsibility for 
establishing the Group’s appetite for risk 
based on the balance of potential risks 
and returns in achieving its strategic 
objectives, and has overall responsibility 
for identifying and managing risk. Risk 
management is embedded in our 
culture, with all employees aware of 
the role they play. 
Risk appetite
An assessment of the Group’s risk 
appetite in 2017 showed that this 
remained broadly unchanged and is set in 
the context of our focus on one sector – 
quality shopping centres. As experts in  
this sector we are able to mitigate the  
risk involved in growing the business by 
acquisition, development, our active asset 
management strategy and brand focus. 
This focus on our core strengths is 
balanced by a more cautious approach  
to risk in other areas. 
In ﬁnancing we set a target Group debt to 
assets ratio of 40-50 per cent and require 
interest cover of more than 160 per cent, 
giving us signiﬁcant headroom against 
our loan covenants to ensure that we  
are in a strong position in the event of any 
substantial falls in property values. We 
continue to look to minimise interest  
rate risk with a policy of hedging at least  
75 per cent of the exposure and seek to 
reﬁnance debt early to reduce risk. This 
does not, however, prevent us looking at 
innovative debt structures that provide 
the Group with diverse funding options. 
The Group also relies on insurances to 
mitigate against other ﬁnancial risks.

Board
Risk management process
intu’s Board has overall responsibility  
for risk management. The effectiveness  
of the risk management system is 
monitored and reviewed by the Audit 
Committee and through periodic external 
review. All recommendations made within 
the 2015 external review have been 
implemented. Our ongoing assessment 
of risk is underpinned by a formal risk 
review process conducted for each area 
and every level of the business including 
each centre, each department, internal 
committee and the executive team. 
These reviews provide an opportunity to 
identify risks and assess them for impact 
and likelihood. The assessment also 
includes how quickly the risks would 
impact our business and for how long. 
The risk registers created through this 
process are subject to at least an annual 
review, facilitated by the risk and assurance 
department. Operational management is 
responsible for managing the risks and for 
updating the risk registers. 
The Audit Committee oversees the risk 
management process, with the Director 
Risk management framework Ri k t f k
intu properties plc  Annual report 2017 38 of Risk and Assurance reporting directly 
to the Audit Committee Chairman, 
ensuring independence and objectivity. 
There are four risk updates per year. 
Principal risks and uncertainties
Fully integrated and thorough risk analysis 
underpins the ability to achieve our 
strategic objectives. The Board and 
Executive Committee have undertaken a 
robust assessment of the principal risks 
we face, including those that would impact 
the business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity. This assessment is 
not limited to purely ﬁnancial metrics but 
spans the whole business model, including 
environmental, social and employee 
matters, respect for human rights and 
anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters. 
We have identiﬁed principal risks and 
uncertainties under ﬁve key headings: 
property market; operations; ﬁnancing; 
developments and acquisitions; and brand. 
These are discussed in detail on the 
following pages. A principal risk is one 
which has the potential to signiﬁcantly 
affect our strategic objectives, ﬁnancial 
position or future performance and 
includes both internal and external factors. 
We monitor movements in likelihood  
and severity such that the risks are 
appropriately managed in line with the 
Group’s risk appetite.
The risk proﬁle for 2017 has remained 
broadly in line with 2016 with no signiﬁcant 
new principal risks identiﬁed nor substantial 
changes in existing principal risks. Where

Active insurance management
We have been using the brand to improve 
our Group-wide purchasing of insurance, 
bringing together external insurance 
partners (brokers, insurers, solicitors and 
loss adjusters) each year to present a 
business update and show how we manage 
new risks and reduce the overall risk proﬁle. 
This gives our insurance family a greater 
insight into our processes, behaviour and 
culture. They are able to identify the scope 
of cover that intu actually requires, and the 
risk that intu are able to transfer.  
The beneﬁts go beyond ﬁnancial savings to 
improved coverage terms and funding to 
allow intu to trial risk reduction initiatives 
and roll out new programmes. Recent 
funded trials include a virtual assistant to 
provide safety messaging to customers; 
more security cameras and yellow comb 
plates for escalators to improve safety. By 
implementing risk-reducing controls, we 
show that a safe and secure environment 
can lead to lower claims, reduce premium 
rates and provide increased risk 
management funding.
the likelihood for certain risks has  
increased additional risk mitigation 
strategies have been put in place. We 
have also assessed the impact of the 
proposed transaction with Hammerson 
on our principal risks.
The main impact from the UK’s decision 
to exit the EU on the risks that the Group 
faces is the potential negative impact on 
the macro-economic environment as a 
result of the continuing uncertainty around 
transitional and post-Brexit arrangements. 
Speciﬁcally, the risks we face are affected 
by any changes in sentiment in the 
investment and occupier markets in  
which we operate, in our ability to execute 
our recycling and investment plans  
and in broader consumer conﬁdence  
and expenditure.

Weakness in the macro-
economic environment 
could undermine rental 
income levels and property 
values, reducing return  
on investment and  
covenant headroom
 — focus on high-quality shopping centres together with  
their upgrading
 — covenant headroom monitored and stress-tested
 — make representation on key policies, for example  
business rates
 — company-wide marketing events across centres  
to attract footfall
 — use our respected brand to attract and retain  
aspirational retailers
 — continued geographic diversiﬁcation by increasing  
Spanish presence
Likelihood of macro-economic weakness continues to  
be a risk with political uncertainty in the UK and Brexit 
arrangements not yet detailed, which has increased 
investor caution with lower transaction volumes in the year
 — like-for-like property values broadly holding up, but 
under pressure at the lower end of the market
 — substantial covenant headroom 
 — no signiﬁcant near-term debt maturities and average 
unexpired term of 6.6 years
 — long-term lease structures with average unexpired  
term of 7 .5 years 
 — €517m acquisition of Madrid Xanadú and subsequent 50 
per cent sale to joint venture partner at the same price
 — sale of 50 per cent interest in intu Chapelﬁeld at

2 Retail environment 
Failure to react to changes 
in the retail environment 
could undermine intu’s 
ability to attract customers 
and tenants
 — active management of tenant mix including letting of former 
BHS units
 — regular monitoring of tenant strength and diversity
 — upgrading assets to meet market demand
 — Tell intu customer feedback programme helps identify 
changes in customer preferences
 — work closely with retailers
 — digital strategy that embraces technology and digital 
customer engagement. This enables intu to engage in and 
support multichannel retailing, and to take the opportunities 
offered by ecommerce
Likelihood and severity of potential impact was monitored 
closely in 2017 with intu’s strategy continuing to deliver 
solid footfall numbers and occupancy
 — signiﬁcant progress on planning and pre-letting of  
near-term pipeline with a focus on leisure
 — continuing digital investment to improve relevance  
as shopping habits change
 — occupancy remains strong at 96 per cent
 — footfall growth continues to beat the benchmark
 — on site with the £72m intu Lakeside leisure extension

 — retailer liaison and brieﬁngs
 — appropriate levels of insurance
 — staff succession planning and development in place to ensure 
continued delivery of world class service
 — health and safety managers or coordinators in all centres
Likelihood of potential impact has not changed

by new enforcement structure
 — retained OHSAS 18001, demonstrating consistent 
health and safety management process and procedures 
across the portfolio
 — work continuing towards achieving additional 
accreditations with focus on ISO 14001
 — gold award from RoSPA
 — full review undertaken of each centre’s ﬁre strategy 
and building speciﬁcations post-Grenfell has provided

4 Cybersecurity 
Loss of data and information 
or failure of key systems 
resulting in ﬁnancial and/ 
or reputational loss
 — data and cybersecurity strategies
 — regular testing programme and cyber scenario exercise  
and benchmarking
 — appropriate levels of insurance
 — crisis management and business continuity plans in place

 — Data Committee and Data Protection Officer in place
 — monitoring of regulatory environment and best practice
 — cybersecurity assessment performed by external consultancy 
and full action plan in place (programme of works)
 — managing of supply chain and service providers who  
hold intu data
Likelihood has increased with greater reliance on 
operational and third party systems and data, and with the 
number of recent high-proﬁle hacks. Severity of potential 
impact has reduced by signiﬁcant development of tools 
and controls. Hacking attempts have not resulted in data 
loss or major operational impacts 
 — ongoing Group-wide cybersecurity project with 
investment in tools, consultancy and staff to  
mitigate impact of threats from evolving  
cybersecurity landscape
 — implementing updated GDPR policies and procedures
5 Terrorism 
Terrorist incident at an intu 
centre or another major 
shopping centre resulting in 
loss of consumer conﬁdence 
with consequent impact on 
lettings and rental growth
 — strong business processes and procedures, supported by  
regular training and exercises, designed to adapt and  
respond to changes in risk levels
 — extraordinary pre-planned operational responses to changes 
in national threat level
 — annual audits of operational standards carried out internally 
and by external agencies
 — culture of visitor, staff and contractor safety
 — crisis management and business continuity plans in place  
and tested with involvement of multiple external agencies
 — retailer liaison and brieﬁngs
 — appropriate levels of insurance
 — strong relationships and frequent liaison with police,  
NaCTSO and other agencies
 — NaCTSO approved to train staff in counter-terrorism 
awareness programme
 — internal head of security appointed
Overall likelihood and severity of potential impact 
unchanged. In May 2017 we enacted our operational plan 
for the period of increased threat level. The threat level 
was subsequently reduced to the prior threat level
 — there have been ﬁve terrorist-related incidents in the  
UK in 2017
 — national threat level remains at Severe 
 — major multi-agency security exercises held at all ﬁve 
super-regional intu shopping centres 
 — operating procedures in place for the introduction  
of further security measures if required

Our operating review analyses how we have  
performed in the year against our strategy
Optimising asset 
performance
We focus on creating vibrant 
environments where customers and 
retailers want to be. This increases the 
value of our centres and provides strong, 
stable income streams and positive 
operating metrics. These elements 
ensure we deliver attractive long-term 
total property returns.
The table below shows the main 
components of the £47 .3 million 
revaluation surplus:
 — UK super-regional centres and major 
city centres: stable values recognising 
the continuing attraction of this asset 
class which remains key to retailers’ 
requirements. The small overall 
deﬁcits relate to investment on the 
existing intu Watford centre and 
tenant repositioning at intu Merry Hill 
not yet reﬂected in rental values 
 — Spanish centres: strong rental growth 
and continued strong demand for 
top-quality Spanish centres has driven 
valuations up at both intu Asturias and 
Puerto Venecia
 — Spanish developments: with most 
of the planning requirements in 
place at intu Costa del Sol, the ﬁrst 
independent valuation of the site, 
which was previously carried at  
cost, delivered a £74 million surplus 
over cost
 — other: represents valuation 
movements on assets valued below 
£200 million each
The weighted average nominal equivalent 
yield at 31 December 2017 remained 
stable at 5.03 per cent, an increase of  
one basis point in the year.
On a like-for-like basis, ERV increased by 
1.0 per cent in the year, compared with 
the IPD index which indicated a 
0.4 per cent increase.

UK investment market
Prime shopping centres continue to 
attract interest from both international 
and domestic investors. While activity  
was limited in 2017 , good levels of demand 
remain for quality assets in the UK’s  
liquid and transparent market for large 
shopping centres. 
A ﬂight to quality has ensured prime yields 
on assets with simple ownership 
structures remain stable as investors look 
at the quality and longevity of income 
streams coupled with rental growth 
potential in a market where new supply,  
by way of development, remains low. 
Against this, the depth of investor demand 
for secondary assets has diminished.

Against previous passing rent, lettings 
were on average up 7 per cent and rent 
reviews up 9 per cent. 
This growth was partially offset by the 
1.4 per cent impact of units closed for 
redevelopment and/or repositioning, 
mainly from the former BHS stores which 
are now substantially relet with excellent 
lettings to quality retailers such as Next, 
Primark and Uniqlo. These were not 
income producing in 2017 , but will come 
back on stream in 2018.
As previously stated, we expect to deliver 
medium term like-for-like net rental 
income growth of 2 to 3 per cent per 
annum, over the next three to ﬁve years, 
and in 2018 we expect this to be in the 
range of 1.5 to 2.5 per cent, subject to no 
material tenant failures.
UK consumer market 
Uncertainty regarding the ﬁnal terms of 
the UK’s exit from the EU is creating a 
mixed picture on the state of the UK 
consumer. Unemployment continues at 
record low levels which should in turn 
drive growth in personal income. However, 
the increase in inﬂation from the 
weakening of sterling after the EU 
referendum vote is causing prices to rise 
faster than wages at the moment which 
impacts consumers’ disposable income. 
The Asda benchmark index of household 
disposable income has remained level 
since December 2016.
Looking further ahead, the Bank of 
England’s forecasts suggest that wage 
growth will overtake inﬂation as we go 
into 2018.
Consumer conﬁdence, as measured by 
GfK, has reduced slightly in 2017 , 
reﬂecting the negative sentiment on the 
expectations for the economy, although 
consumers’ view on their personal  
ﬁnance situation over the next  
12 months is stable.
These mixed messages have not had a 
material effect on total non-food retail 
spending, which remained unchanged in 
2017 against the previous year (British 
Retail Consortium total non-food retail 
index), although, with the continued 
growth in online, in-store sales were down 
by around 2 per cent in the year.

Retailers continue to focus on increasing 
their space in prime, high footfall retail

 — new retail anchors, in the shape of key 
fashion brands, upsizing to optimise 
their offering and conﬁguration. This 
includes Primark, Next and River Island

Delivering UK developments
In 2017 , we invested £184 million in the 
UK. This included £63 million on the  
intu Watford extension, £58 million on 
the acquisition of additional properties 
(all currently income-generating) which 
will be integral to future development 
projects, £12 million on the leisure 
extension at intu Lakeside and 
£51 million on other active asset 
management projects, including the new 
Travelodge hotel at intu Lakeside and the 
Next ﬂagship store at intu Metrocentre.
Near-term pipeline
Looking ahead, we are progressing our 
near-term pipeline of £562 million over 
the next three years, reinforcing our 
existing assets and delivering value-
enhancing returns. Our development 
team continues to progress these projects 
on budget and on time, with major 
developments on site at intu Watford  
and intu Lakeside and soon to start at  
intu Trafford Centre (Barton Square) and 
intu Broadmarsh, Nottingham.
We are committed to investing  
£264 million, most of which is on key 
ongoing projects: 
 — at intu Watford we remain on target 
with our £180 million extension 
expected to open in October 2018. 
The development has topped out, 
with the feature roof now installed and 
anchor tenants due to start ﬁtting out 
in the next few months. The 380,000 
sq ft project, anchored by Debenhams 
and Cineworld, is two-thirds let by 
space with Superdry and Hollywood 
Bowl exchanged in the year. The 
259 shops opened or reﬁtted in our UK 
centres in 2017 (2016: 225 stores), around 
9 per cent of our 2,800 units. Tenants 
have invested around £89 million in these 
stores, a signiﬁcant demonstration of 
their commitment to our centres.
We settled 218 rent reviews in the year 
for new rents totalling £47 million, an 
average uplift of 9 per cent on the 
previous rents.
Footfall improved by 0. 1 per cent in the 
year, signiﬁcantly outperforming the 
ShopperTrak measure of UK national 
retail footfall which was down by 
2.8 per cent, highlighting the attraction  
of our compelling destinations against  
the wider market.
Estimated retailer sales in our centres 
were down 2. 1 per cent predominantly 
driven by some clothing retailers who had 
a challenging year in 2017 . In-store sales 
ﬁgures take no account of the beneﬁt of 
the store to retailers’ online sales and are 
further impacted by returns of online 
sales. The ratio of rents to estimated sales 
for standard units remained stable in the 
year at 12. 1 per cent.
Catering and leisure units now comprise 
over 500 of our overall 2,800 leases and 
have increased steadily in recent years in  
a growing market. Reﬂecting changing 
customer preferences, over the last  
ﬁve years, this market has increased to 
around 13 per cent of total rental income. 
Over the same period, we have seen a 
reduction in rental income from fashion 
outlets to around 25 per cent.
The difference between annual property 
income (see glossary) of £462 million and 
ERV of £544 million represents 
£37 million from vacant and development

We will fund our near-term pipeline from

31 December 2017 were £833 million  
on a pro forma basis including the  
£148 million disposal of 50 per cent of intu 
Chapelﬁeld. Further recycling potential 
lies in the introduction of partners into 
some of our centres, although this would 
have a short-term negative earnings 
impact until the proceeds are reinvested. 
In addition, we expect to raise ﬁnance  
on near-term projects, such as the  
intu Watford extension, as they complete, 
to fund future opportunities.
cost to completion of this project is 
£80 million, and as previously stated, 
the project is expected to deliver 
a return on cost of 6 to 7 per cent, 
including 1 to 2 per cent from the 
existing centre 
 — at intu Lakeside we have commenced 
construction of the £72 million 
leisure extension, with £57 million of 
cost remaining to completion. This 
175,000 sq ft project is expected to 
deliver a return on cost of 6.5 per cent 
and has the four leisure attractions 
Nickelodeon, Flip Out, Puttshack and 
Hollywood Bowl exchanged
 — at intu Trafford Centre, we have signed 
Primark to anchor the expansion and 
transformation of Barton Square. The 
£72 million project will enclose the 
courtyard, enhance interiors, allow 
trading from two levels and provide 
a fashion offer for the ﬁrst time at 
Barton Square. We are progressing 
the procurement of the construction 
works and expect the project, 
delivering a return of 6 to 7 per cent,  
to be completed by mid-2019 
 — active asset management projects 
total £55 million and include the  
Halle Place restaurant redevelopment 
at Manchester Arndale, the creation  
of ﬂagship stores for Next at  
intu Metrocentre and intu Merry Hill 
and the redevelopment of former 
BHS units for Uniqlo and Primark at 
Manchester Arndale and intu Merry 
Hill respectively. These projects are 
expected to deliver a range of returns 
between 6 and 10 per cent dependent 
on the nature of the individual project
Our pipeline of planned projects amounts 
to £298 million, with a focus on extension 
and redevelopments:
 — at intu Broadmarsh we have a planned 
redevelopment which is expected to 
cost £81 million and deliver a stabilised 
initial yield of around 7 per cent. 
We have signed The Light cinema 
and Hollywood Bowl to anchor the 
scheme and we would expect to have 
the required level of pre-lets and 
completed detailed design to enable 
us to commit to this by the second half 
of 2018
 — at intu Merry Hill we are planning to 
increase the catering and leisure to 
bring it in line with other super-regional 
centres. In total, we expect to invest 
around £100 million, of which  
£70 million will be spent in the period 
to 2020, delivering a return at a similar 
level to that of the leisure extension  
at intu Lakeside
 — at intu Milton Keynes we expect to 
invest £15 million commencing phase 
one of the redevelopment of  
under-utilised space
 — other active asset management 
projects are smaller in nature, across 
all centres and at various stages of 
feasibility. We have the ﬂexibility to 
start these projects when we have the 
required level of pre-lets and expect 
them to deliver similar returns to those 
that we have committed to
Future opportunities
Beyond 2020, we continue to work on 
securing the required planning approvals 
and tenant demand to start £1.4 billion of 
further projects which we would expect 
to deliver stabilised initial yields of around 
7 per cent. We have planning approvals 
for extensions to intu Braehead,  
intu Lakeside, intu Victoria Centre and 
intu Milton Keynes and are at earlier 
stages of the planning process for the 
extension of Cribbs Causeway.
Making the brand count
The intu brand has positioned us well, as 
the role of the shopping centre operator 
has changed, to ensure our centres 
remain relevant for both customers and 
retailers. The unprompted awareness of 
the intu brand increased to 26 per cent,  
a threefold increase since 2015 when we 
started monitoring, highlighting its 
increasing recognition and value. 
Additionally, our prompted awareness 
has increased to 71 per cent in 2017 , 
from 63 per cent in 2016.
The combination of our national presence, 
attractive digital offering and in-house 
experiences team offers retailers and 
brands promotional opportunities, which 
in turn gives us a multidisciplinary 
opportunity to help retailers ﬂourish 
within our centres.
The importance of identifying new ideas 
and services emerging in the UK retail 
market cannot be underestimated. In 
2017 we launched intu Accelerate, an 
incubator for these technologies and 
services, identifying start-ups to pilot  
Hill respectively.

new concepts in centre and online, 
including what is believed to be Europe’s 
ﬁrst customer services robot in a 
shopping centre. 
Customer service
Putting the customer ﬁrst is embedded  
in our culture. Our net promoter score,  
a measure of customer service, ran 
consistently high throughout the year 
averaging 70 and demonstrating our 
in-centre operational excellence. 
intu Experiences
Curation of the customer experience is a 
key element of our role in managing 
shopping centres. Our in-house team,  
intu Experiences, which generated 
income of £22 million, is crucial in 
delivering immersive brand partnerships, 
mall commercialisation and advertising 
which is complementary to the asset 
strategy of each centre and meets our 
quality standards.
An example of this end-to-end control is 
the large format digital screen we have 
introduced to each of our out-of-town 
centres, providing new income streams 
from global brands. We own all these 
screens and, in many instances, produce 
the content in-house – an area of growth 
for us.
Similarly, choosing the brands we work 
with promotionally is important in 
delivering the right messages. Through 
the Easter holidays we furthered our 
collaboration with Nick Jr., Nickelodeon’s 
pre-school television channel, adding 
augmented reality functionality to our 
in-centre app to deliver a new family 
experience to our customers. 
intu Digital
Our attractive digital offering through our 
premium content publisher and shopping 
platform, intu.co.uk, continued to grow 
strongly and delivered online sales for 
retailers of £9 million in the year, an 
increase of 50 per cent against 2016. 
We continue to develop the site, with 
image recognition to assist product 
search added in 2017 . Shop Insider, the 
premium content section of the site, saw 
traffic up nearly 200 per cent in the year 
to 1.5 million visits, leading to a 50 per 
cent increase in visits to the shopping 
pages. This highlights the power of quality 
content to drive both physical and digital 
sales, as shoppers continue to be ever 
more considered in their purchases, 
researching heavily online before  
planned visits. 
Key to this growth is our online marketing 
expertise with over two million individuals 
on our active marketing database and a 
social media audience of over one million.
Seizing the growth 
opportunity in Spain
Our Spanish strategy has been to create 
a business of scale through acquisitions 
and our pipeline of development 
projects, concentrating on the top-10 key 
catchments, where we now own and 
manage three of Spain’s top-10 shopping 
centres, with the acquisition of Madrid 
Xanadú in 2017 (see Acquisitions and 
disposals). In addition, we have three 
development sites with the most 
advanced project being intu Costa  
del Sol, near Málaga.
Operational performance
The occupancy of our Spanish centres  
is 97 per cent. We agreed 38 long-term 
lettings in the year, amounting to over 
£2 million annual rent, at an average of 
25 per cent above previous passing rent 
(like-for-like units). New names to our 
centres included Quiz, Levis, Pandora, 
Alcott and Xiaomi.
Footfall increased by 1.0 per cent in the 
year and this includes the disruption in the 
ﬁrst half of 2017 from the redevelopment 
work at intu Asturias where we developed 
a previously underutilised area to 
Our cutting-edge network 
Our converged Cisco network across our 
centres gives us a co-ordinated, managed 
and increasingly secure technical platform 
that beneﬁts customers, tenants and staff.
This robust, high-bandwidth backbone 
enables us to implement an array of new 
technologies quickly and securely, more 
cheaply and with a lower carbon footprint.
For instance, as well as free customer wiﬁ, 
we have been able to install large screens 
at ﬂagship centres, with programming from 
our central production studio. Having the 
network in place also enables us to 
experiment with new ideas.
The network facilitates predictive 
maintenance and standardisation of key 
building management and security 
systems, which in turn allow economies of 
scale and interoperability between centres.
intu properties plc  Annual report 2017 46 Spanish market Acquisitions and disposals 
introduce a supermarket and new retail 
units. This opened in July with a strong 
uplift in footfall.
We have increased the value of the 
centres owned throughout the year  
with growth in rental values being the 
main driver. Our share of Puerto Venecia, 
Zaragoza was valued at £231 million, an 
increase of 4 per cent, and our share of 
intu Asturias increased by 1 1 per cent,  
to £141 million.
In 2018, we plan to roll out the intu brand 
to Puerto Venecia and Madrid Xanadú.
Near-term pipeline
Our Spanish development pipeline 
through to the end of 2020 amounts  
to £397 million.
We have active asset management 
projects of £57 million through to the  
end of 2020 across all three centres with  
a focus on enhancing the resort content 
of each centre.
Our world-class project at intu Costa del 
Sol will create a shopping resort of around 
230,000 sq m. In 2017 , the approval of the 
General Plan of Torremolinos was a major 
step forward, with the remaining consents 
expected in the coming months. We have 
very strong interest from tenants and 
would anticipate being on site in the next 
12 months.
The land, with planning mostly approved, 
was independently valued at the end of 
2017 , delivering a surplus of £74 million.
The total cost to completion of the 
development is expected to be around 
£600 million (£340 million through to 
2020), excluding the land, and deliver a 
stabilised initial yield of around 7 per cent. 
We expect to fund the project through 
bank and other ﬁnance, and introduce a 
partner at a later stage.
Future opportunities
We continue to develop plans at the two 
other sites in Valencia and Vigo, having 
decided not to progress with our 
development option in Palma. At this 
point, intu Valencia, where we have 
renewed support from the regional 
government, is the most likely to follow 
intu Costa del Sol.
The Spanish economy is still one of 
Europe’s fastest growing economies and 
this should continue in 2018 with its GDP 
growth expected to be one of the highest 
of the major European economies. For the 
consumer, unemployment is at its lowest 
level for several years and consumer 
conﬁdence at its highest. This in turn 
beneﬁts retail sales which are further 
enhanced by record levels of tourists 
which have increased by 20 per cent over 
the last two years.
The investment market remains strong 
with continuing investor conﬁdence in 
Spanish real estate supported by an 
economy that is growing. With banks 
willing to lend against Spanish assets, the 
weight of money in the market looking to 
invest in quality assets has continued to 
strengthen the market. Partly due to the 
lack of development in recent years, prime 
regional shopping centres are scarce 
which is reﬂected in good demand.
In line with our strategy, we continue to 
recycle capital to focus on our ﬂagship 
destinations where we have the 
opportunity to deliver superior returns.
Acquisitions
In March 2017 , we acquired Madrid 
Xanadú, one of Spain’s top-10 shopping 
centres, for an agreed headline price of 
€530 million. The centre has many of the 
key retailers, including El Corte Inglés, all 
the Inditex fascias, Primark and Apple, 
along with a strong leisure offering of 
Spain’s only indoor ski slope, cinema, 
bowling and soon-to-open aquarium and 
Nickelodeon theme park. Footfall is 
13 million, with a potential catchment of 
four million people living within a 
30-minute drive time. Over the medium 
term, we see good reversionary potential, 
with further growth opportunities from 
key asset management initiatives which 
will enhance the centre’s status as a truly 
regional retail and leisure resort, drawing 
visitors from a wider catchment.
In July 2017 , we formed a joint venture 
with TH Real Estate for them to take 
ownership of 50 per cent of Madrid 
Xanadú based on the original  
acquisition price. 
Disposals
In November 2017 , we announced the 
formation of a joint venture with LaSalle 
Investment Management for them to  
take ownership of 50 per cent of  
intu Chapelﬁeld, Norwich for a net 
consideration of £148 million, in line with 
the December 2016 valuation. The 
transaction completed in January 2018.

Presentation of information
We account for our interests in joint ventures using the equity method as required by IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements. This means that the  
income statement and the balance sheet include single lines for the Group’s total share of post-tax proﬁt and the net investment in joint 
ventures respectively.
Management review and monitor performance as well as determine the strategy of the business primarily on a proportionately consolidated basis. 
This includes the Group’s share of joint ventures on an individual line-by-line basis rather than a post-tax proﬁt or net investment basis. The ﬁgures 
and commentary presented are consistent with our management approach as we believe this provides a more meaningful analysis of the Group’s 
performance. The other information section provides reconciliations of the income statement and balance sheet between the two bases.
Alternative performance measures are also used to assess the Group’s performance. The signiﬁcant measures are summarised as follows:
Alternative performance 
measure used
Rationale
Like-for-like amounts Like-for-like amounts are presented as they indicate operating performance as distinct from the impact of acquisitions or disposals. In 
respect of property, the like-for-like measure relates to property which has been owned throughout both periods without signiﬁcant 
capital expenditure in either period, so that income can be compared on a like-for-like basis. For the purposes of comparison of capital 
values, this will also include assets owned at the previous reporting period end but not throughout the prior period. Further analysis is 
presented in the other information section and in the operating review.
Net asset value (NAV)  
(diluted, adjusted)
NAV (diluted, adjusted) is presented as it is considered to be a key measure of the Group’s performance. The key difference from EPRA 
NAV, an industry standard comparable measure, is the exclusion of interest rate swaps not currently used for economic hedges of debt 
as, in our view, this better allows management to review and monitor the Group’s performance. A reconciliation of NAV (diluted, 
adjusted) to NAV attributable to owners of intu properties plc is provided in note 13(a) as well as on page 51 and to EPRA NAV within 
the other information section.
Underlying earnings Underlying earnings is presented as it is considered to be a key measure of the Group’s recurring income performance and an indication 
of the extent to which dividend payments are supported by underlying operations (see underlying proﬁt statement in the other 
information section). It excludes property and derivative valuation movements, exceptional items and related tax. The key difference 
from EPRA earnings, an industry standard comparable measure, relates to adjustments in respect of exceptional items where EPRA is 
prescriptive about the adjustments that can be made. A reconciliation of underlying earnings to proﬁt for the year attributable to 
owners of intu properties plc is provided in note 12(c) as well as on page 49 and to EPRA earnings within the other information section.
the sale of our interest in Equity One and 
£34.6 million on the acquisition of the 
remaining 50 per cent of intu Merry Hill.
NAV per share of 41 1 pence has increased 
7 pence from 2016, which when taking 
account of the dividend paid in the period 
of 14.0 pence delivers a total ﬁnancial 
return for the year of 5.2 per cent. NAV 
per share includes a timing impact within 
retained earnings of 4 pence in relation to 
our Spanish development partner 
Eurofund’s expected future interest in  
the share capital of the intu Costa del Sol 
development company. The positive 
impact on retained earnings is expected 
to reverse, once these arrangements are 
concluded, with the Eurofund interest to 
be included in non-controlling interests 
during 2018. In this event NAV per share 
would be 407 pence. 
intu properties plc  Annual report 2017 48 In March we continued to increase our 
presence in Spain and strengthen our 
quality portfolio, acquiring 100 per cent 
of Madrid Xanadú for €517 .3 million 
(£453.9 million). As part of this we 
arranged a €263 million loan facility, with 
a 2022 maturity. In July we disposed of  
50 per cent of Madrid Xanadú to TH Real 
Estate based on the original acquisition 
price, retaining a 50 per cent interest. 
Further, in November we announced the 
formation of a joint venture with LaSalle 
Investment Management (acting on 
behalf of Greater Manchester Pension 
Fund and West Yorkshire Pension Fund) 
for them to take ownership of 50 per cent 
of intu Chapelﬁeld for initial net proceeds 
of £148.0 million. This transaction has 
now completed following the receipt of 
EU merger approval in January 2018.  
As a result, in accordance with IFRS, the 
net assets of intu Chapelﬁeld have been 
classiﬁed as held for sale at 31 December 
2017 in the balance sheet.
Our ﬁnancing metrics remain strong 
mainly due to our continued reﬁnancing 
activity. During the year we reﬁnanced 
over £1. 1 billion of debt, including the 
reﬁnancing of intu Milton Keynes and  
intu Merry Hill, securing ﬁnancing on 
Madrid Xanadú and additional ﬁnancing 
on intu Trafford Centre. Our interest cover 
ratio of 1.94x is broadly unchanged in the 
year (31 December 2016: 1.97x) with 
satisfactory headroom above our target 
minimum level of 1.60x.
At 31 December 2017 , pro forma for  
the 50 per cent part disposal of  
intu Chapelﬁeld for initial net proceeds  
of £148.0 million, our debt to assets ratio 
has increased to 45.2 per cent  
(31 December 2016: 43.7 per cent), 
remaining below our target maximum 
level of 50 per cent. Also on a pro forma 
basis, we had cash and available facilities 
of £833. 1 million (31 December 2016: 
£922.3 million) which have decreased in 
the year due to the acquisition and part 
disposal of Madrid Xanadú as well as 
buying back and cancelling £139.6 million 
of the £300 million 2.5 per cent 
convertible bonds, maturing Autumn 
2018, partially offset by the net proceeds 
from the part disposal of intu Chapelﬁeld.

Underlying earnings per share is

Net rental income increased £13.0 million 
in 2017 to £460.0 million due to the

2017 , the acquisition of the remaining  
50 per cent of intu Merry Hill in June 2016 
and 0.5 per cent growth in like-for-like net 
rental income, partially offset by the 
impact of the disposal of intu Bromley  
in December 2016.
Like-for-like net rental income increased 
by £2. 1 million, 0.5 per cent, driven by 
rental growth from new lettings and rent 
reviews, partially offset by the impact of 
the redevelopment and reletting of the 
former BHS units which were fully income 
producing in the ﬁrst half of 2016 (see 
operating review).
Administration expenses increased by 
£3.0 million in 2017 to £41.6 million, 
primarily due to increased headcount in 
Spain partially offset by a cost reduction 
programme in the second half of the year 
from which we will beneﬁt in 2018.

Strategic report
49 Financial review Financial review continued
Net ﬁnance costs have increased by  
£9.6 million in 2017 to £222.5 million 
primarily due to the increase in net 
external debt for the acquisition of  
Madrid Xanadú and capital expenditure  
in the year.
As discussed in the overview, proﬁt 
attributable to owners of intu properties 
plc is £216.7 million, an increase from the 
£182.7 million reported for the year 
ended 31 December 2016.
Our investment in joint ventures 
contributed £35.5 million to the proﬁt of 
the Group (2016: £32. 1 million) including 
£18.3 million to underlying earnings 
(2016: £19.8 million) and a gain on 
property valuations of £15.9 million  
(2016: £14.2 million).
As detailed in the table above, our net 
rental income margin has reduced to 87 .5 
per cent primarily due to higher void costs 
from the former BHS units. Property 
operating expenses largely comprise car 
park operating costs and the Group’s 
contribution to shopping centre 
marketing programmes. Our ratio  
of total costs to income, as calculated  
in accordance with EPRA guidelines, 
remains low at 15. 1 per cent (see other 
information section).
Balance sheet
The Group’s net assets attributable  
to shareholders have increased by  
£96.2 million to £5,075.0 million at  
31 December 2017 , while net assets 
(diluted, adjusted) have increased by 
£85.0 million to £5,522.7 million at  
31 December 2017 .
NAV per share (diluted, adjusted) at  
31 December 2017 has increased 7 pence 
from the prior year to 41 1 pence, the key 
movements are shown in the chart to the 
right. This was driven principally by the 
revaluation surplus in the year of 4 pence 
and the timing impact within retained 
earnings of 4 pence in relation to our 
Spanish development partner Eurofund’s 
expected future interest in the share 
capital of the intu Costa del Sol 
development company. The positive 
impact on retained earnings is expected 
to reverse, once these arrangements are 
concluded, with the Eurofund interest to 
be included in non-controlling interests 
during 2018. In this event NAV per share 
would be 407 pence.
Investment and development property 
has increased by £248.0 million  
primarily due to capital expenditure  
of £246.7 million, the impact of the 
acquisition and subsequent  
50 per cent disposal of Madrid Xanadú  
of £225.3 million and a surplus on 
revaluation of £47 .3 million, partially 
offset by the £302.0 million transfer  
of intu Chapelﬁeld to assets held for sale.
Our net investment in joint ventures is 
£735.5 million at 31 December 2017  
(31 December 2016: £587 .6 million), which 
includes the Group’s share of net assets, 
on an equity accounted basis, of  
£452.6 million (31 December 2016:  
£355.4 million) and loans to joint ventures 
of £282.9 million (31 December 2016: 
£232.2 million). The movement in the 
year primarily reﬂects the addition of 
Madrid Xanadú from 31 July, when 50 per 
cent was sold to TH Real Estate, which is 
accounted for as a joint venture rather 
than as a 100 per cent owned subsidiary.
Investments in associates of £64.8 million 
represent our interests in India, which 
comprise a 32 per cent interest in Prozone 
(£45. 1 million), a shopping centre 
developer listed on the Indian stock 
market, and a direct interest in Empire 
(£19.7 million). Prozone and Empire own 
and operate shopping centres in 
Coimbatore and Aurangabad, with 
Coimbatore recently opened in 2017 .
Net external debt of £4,835.5 million has 
increased by £471.4 million primarily from 
funding our acquisition of Madrid Xanadú 
as well as capital expenditure in the year. 
Cash including the Group’s share of joint 
ventures has reduced slightly by  
£13.4 million to £278.2 million and gross 
debt has increased by £458.0 million  
to £5, 1 13.7 million.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments comprise

swaps. The net liability at 31 December

intu properties plc  Annual report 2017 50 The non-controlling interest at

to our partner’s 40 per cent stake in  
intu Metrocentre.
We are exposed to foreign exchange 
movements on our overseas investments. 
At 31 December 2017 the exposure is  
10.6 per cent of net assets attributable  
to shareholders. Once the Eurofund 
expected future interest in the share 
capital of the intu Costa del Sol 
development company concludes, we 
expect this to reduce to 9.7 per cent, 
below the Group’s policy of a maximum 
of 10 per cent.
Cash ﬂow
During 2017 cash and cash equivalents 
decreased by £26.6 million.
Cash ﬂows from operating activities of 
£140.9 million is £9.5 million higher than

Cash ﬂows from ﬁnancing activities 
include net debt drawdowns of  
£539.2 million primarily to fund our 
acquisition of Madrid Xanadú as well  
as development spend. We paid cash

syndicated bank debt secured on 
individual or pools of assets, with limited 
or no recourse from the borrowing

intu properties plc  Annual report 2017 52 Covenants
Full details of the debt ﬁnancial 
covenants are included in the other 
information section of this report. We are 
in compliance with all of our covenants 
and regularly stress test them for 
changes in capital values and income.  
A 25 per cent fall in property values and  
a 10 per cent reduction in income would 
only require a £6 million equity cure.
Capital commitments
We have an aggregate commitment  
to capital projects of £267 .6 million at  
31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: 
£257 .0 million).
In addition to the committed expenditure, 
we have an identiﬁed uncommitted 
pipeline of active management projects, 
major extensions and developments that 
may become committed over the next 
three years (see operating review).
Other information
Tax policy position
The Group has tax exempt status in the 
UK (REIT) and for certain investments in 
Spain (SOCIMI) which provide exemption 
from corporation tax on rental income 
and gains arising on property sales, with 
tax instead being paid at shareholder 
level. See glossary for further information 
on REIT s and SOCIMIs.
The Group’s principle of good governance 
extends to our responsible approach to 
tax. We look to minimise the level of tax 
risk and at all times seek to comply fully 
with our regulatory and other tax 
obligations and to act in a way which 
upholds intu’s reputation as a responsible 
corporate citizen by regularly carrying out 
risk reviews, seeking pre-clearance from 
HMRC in complex areas and actively 
engaging in discussions regarding 
proposed changes in the taxation system 
that might affect the Group. It remains 
important to our stakeholders that our 
approach to tax is aligned to the long-
term values and strategy of the Group.
Madrid Xanadú
In March we increased intu’s presence in Spain 
with the acquisition of a centre in the capital
We have published ‘intu’s Approach  
to T ax’ in respect of the year ending  
31 December 2017 on the Group’s 
website intugroup.co.uk which provides 
further information about the Group’s  
tax strategy.
We pay tax directly on overseas earnings, 
any UK non-property income under the 
REIT rules, business rates and transaction 
taxes such as stamp duty land tax. In the 
year ended 31 December 2017 the total 
of such payments to tax authorities was 
£28.5 million (2016: £20.6 million), of 
which £26.0 million (2016: £20.0 million) 
was in the UK and £2.5 million (2016:  
£0.6 million) in Spain. In addition, we also 
collect VAT, employment taxes and 
withholding tax on dividends for HMRC 
and the Spanish tax authorities. Business 
rates, principally paid by tenants, in 
respect of the Group’s UK properties 
amounted to around £280.6 million in 
2017 (2016: £292.2 million).
Dividends
The Directors are recommending a ﬁnal 
dividend of 9.4 pence per share bringing 
the amount paid and payable in respect 
of 2017 to 14.0 pence, unchanged from 
2016. A scrip dividend alternative may be 
offered. Details of the apportionment 
between the PID and non-PID elements 
per share will be conﬁrmed in due course.
At 31 December 2017 , the Company has 
distributable reserves of £977 million, 
sufficient to cover around ﬁve years of 
dividends at the 2017 level. The Company 
typically pays dividends which are covered 
by the current year earnings of the Group 
and does not anticipate that the Group’s 
level of distributable reserves will create 
any restrictions on this approach in the 
foreseeable future.

We are proud of our employees’ commitment to our vision  
and purpose – creating compelling and joyful experiences  
for customers and helping retailers ﬂourish
We are the ﬁrst shopping centre landlord 
to be able to boast the gold Investors in 
People award across our UK portfolio. 
The award recognises our commitment to 
our people and their role in our business. 
Diverse and inclusive
Diversity is important to us – as a people 
business with over 400 million customer 
visits a year our workforce should both 
reﬂect and understand our customers 
and the communities around our centres. 
We have at least 27 different nationalities 
and the ethnic background of our staff is 
close to that of the country as a whole.
We maintained our position in the top  
20 per cent of FTSE 250 and 350 
companies for the number of women at 
board, senior and executive management 
levels – with over 30 per cent of female 
staff at this level (FTSE Women Leaders, 
Hampton-Alexander Review 2017). We 
continued to work with the Mentoring 
Foundation, to enhance the opportunities 
for women to reach executive roles.
In order to attract a diverse range of 
candidates, we are part of an industry 
initiative, Pathways to Property, to provide 
work experience for school students from 
less traditional backgrounds
We are signed up to the National Equality 
Standard (NES). Having completed the 
initial assessment process we have a plan 
in place to meet the standard by 2019. 
From our apprentices to our senior asset 
managers our employees are vital to 
fulﬁlling our purpose. Our people are 
talented individuals, and our culture 
enables them to be bold, creative and 
genuine in their work to make shopping at 
intu a joyful experience for our 35 million 
visitors and thousands of retailers. In 
return, we aim to be a great employer, 
promoting diversity and inclusion, treating 
our employees fairly and enabling them 
to grow professionally and personally.
A united and successful team
We employ 2,589 staff: 2,467 employed 
in 17 locations across the UK, in 16 
centres and our head office in London, 39 
in our Madrid office and now 83 at Madrid 
Xanadú. Of the UK staff, 2,036 are directly 
employed by our in-house facilities 
company, intu Retail Services. This year 
we have extended the uniﬁed employee 
database and payroll system, iTrent, to 
bring all our intu Retail Services and intu 
Management Services employees 
together under a single system for the 
ﬁrst time.
We have strong recruitment processes to 
recruit the best people, and a system that 
gives employees career progression so we 
can ﬁll roles internally. This year 54 staff 
were recruited from within and 375 
externally. Many of these were to new 
roles as we adapt to changing markets.
Highlights of the year 
 
 — all our centres achieve the Investors in 
People gold award 
 — our ﬁrst apprentices take up 
permanent roles in intu 
 — pensions auto-enrolment successfully 
implemented for intu Retail Services
 — our consolidated staff data system, 
iTrent, extended to intu Retail Services
Our culture 
Our purpose is simple – to create 
compelling, joyful experiences that surprise 
and delight our customers and make them 
smile. This is the key to achieving our 
commercial focus – running the most 
popular shopping centres in the UK and 
Spain. It is an intentionally simple focus  
that can be understood and delivered by 
everyone in the organisation.
Our culture permeates our business. 
Everyone, regardless of role or seniority, 
goes through the same brand immersion to 
understand our purpose and our values. 
Our values – bold, creative, genuine – 
encourage us all to behave in the right way 
and do the right thing: for our customers, 
our retailers, the environment and society. 
Our people understand if they apply our 
values in their work they will help create  
a successful and responsible business.  
Our culture drives our business.
intu properties plc  Annual report 2017 54 A good job
Part of being a great employer is treating 
our staff members fairly and paying them 
properly. All our staff over 18 who have 
completed their probation are paid above 
the National Living Wage, even staff not 
strictly covered by regulation. We ended 
all zero-hour contracts in 2016. 
We are committed to ending the gender 
pay gap and we comply fully with the 
Equality Act Gender Pay Gap Information 
regulations as they come into force. See 
infographic above.
Talent development
Our learning and development team run 
a programme of internal and external 
training for the whole business. Customer 
Journey training helps centre teams 
enhance the customer experience of intu. 
Steps to Success training, for security, 
customer and environmental services 
teams, ensures the services they provide 
are consistent and legally compliant. 
These programmes keep us at the 
forefront of being a master operator  
and enable us to deliver our world  
class service. 
 
Gender pay gap
We welcome the new gender pay gap 
legislation and increased pay 
transparency that will result. The 
gender pay gap compares the average 
pay for men and women in our business. 
If there are more men than women in 
senior positions, as is currently the case 
at intu, this results in the overall average 
of the pay of men being higher than 
that of women.
The chart below shows the gender pay gap for different groups of employees within the business. In a number of areas we have  
a negative gender pay gap, which means that the average pay of women is higher than that of men. 
The gender pay gap is different to equal 
pay, which takes into account the nature 
of a role and its seniority. We regularly 
review the pay across the organisation 
with the aim of ensuring that the pay of 
men and women is the same for 
equivalent roles and seniority.
Our median pay and bonus gaps are 
signiﬁcantly smaller than the national 
picture with a slightly higher proportion  
of women than men receiving bonuses.  
Our higher mean bonus gap is largely 
due to the current signiﬁcantly higher 
proportion of men in the most  
senior positions.

around a thousand employees were 
rewarded for making people smile.  
This year’s winner was Joseph Mifsud,  
an Orient Support Assistant at  
intu Trafford Centre.
Employee engagement
Ensuring our staff understand our 
business and know how they can 
contribute to intu’s success continues to 
be crucial to our progress. It has been 
integral to our success so far and was part 
of our promise to our staff when we 
rebranded to intu. We use a range of 
channels to communicate with staff:  
our intranet Mint, employee magazine 
Chorus, insight, strategy presentation, 
twice-yearly results presentations and 
staff brieﬁngs. Each location has its own 
staff forum.
Since November 2012 we have run an 
annual employee survey with consistently 
high employee engagement scores (in the 
region of 750). The 2017 staff survey has 
been postponed until spring 2018 to allow 
us to consider the information the survey 
has supplied, combined with information 
from all our other sources, such as 
Investors in People, NES, customer 
surveys, Tell intu and other insight, to  
put really meaningful actions in place.
We continue to encourage staff to 
achieve their personal and professional 
goals and to take part in our corporate 
responsibility, community support and 
sustainability programmes. More than 
one in ﬁve took advantage of the working 
days intu makes available for volunteering 
activity, double last year’s number.
Our plans for 2018
 — build on the intu culture in the UK and 
Spain through stronger performance 
management and staff engagement 
 — focus on equality, diversity and 
inclusion, including further progress  
to reduce the gender pay gap
 — enhance the talent pipeline through 
graduate, management and leadership 
development schemes
 — greater alignment of intu Retail 
Services terms and conditions  
and processes
 — mitigate the risk of employee 
uncertainty leading to short-term  
skill gaps during the proposed 
corporate transaction

We have expanded our webinar-based 
training for management development 
and continued our Leadership 
Development programme to develop 
individuals. This year eight candidates 
completed a 12-month development 
journey to cultivate their leadership skills. 
intu was the ﬁrst major property 
company to have a national 
apprenticeship scheme, now in its third 
year. The pilot group have completed 
their training and all six gained 
permanent jobs within the business. The 
second cohort of 14 has moved into their 
second year and nine new recruits will 
begin their training in 2018. 
Rewarding excellence
Since 2016 we have been piloting 
performance management schemes that 
connect more closely to our business 
strategy, linking performance, strategy 
and reward. We are now rolling these out 
across the business and have recruited a 
rewards manager to benchmark staff, 
harmonise terms and conditions and 
develop more tailored incentive and 
recognition schemes.
Our employee reward and recognition 
programme Win Your Dream celebrates 
employees across intu who have gone 
The graduates 
Senior development managers Oliver Hunt 
and Simon Crouch started as graduates at 
intu. “From the beginning we were given 
real projects and were rewarded for our 
hard work and commitment,” says Simon. 
“My early work covered activities from 
planning to procurement, from purchasing 
an interest to selling a centre,” says Oliver. 
They are now managing multimillion pound 
development projects and mentoring the 
next generation of graduates. “Retail has 
always been a dynamic sector,” says Simon. 
“Working at intu gives us a real opportunity 
to help shape the future of shopping.”
Human rights
At intu we respect the dignity, liberty and 
equality of everyone we work with. We are 
committed to implementing the UN 
guiding principles on business and human 
rights. We only work with people who 
choose to work freely and we respect their 
rights to equal opportunities and freedom 
of association. 
We work with our suppliers, retailers and 
associated companies to ensure they  
meet acceptable standards of human 
dignity in their own sourcing policies.  
We will continue to evaluate the pay and 
conditions of all our employees, to ensure 
all staff earn above the National Living 
Wage, and enjoy fair working conditions. 
Fair treatment of people who work for  
intu or our suppliers is a key focus of our 
corporate responsibility approach. 
Modern Slavery Act
This year we worked to implement the 
requirements of the Modern Slavery Act, 
including a new policy on Modern Slavery 
and Human Rights and communications  
to our suppliers on their responsibilities.

Accessible intu
This year we held the ﬁrst mass Autism 
Quiet Hours with the National Autistic 
Society. On 2 October, we dimmed our 
lights, turned down the music and 
welcomed autistic customers to enjoy our 
centres in a quieter environment. We were 
delighted that every retailer also got 
involved. Each centre is now creating  
their own regular quiet hours for  
their customers.
We are delivering additional support for the 
wide range of disabilities our customers 
may live with. We launched a personal 
shopping service for blind customers at  
intu Braehead and intu Merry Hill. intu staff 
volunteers accompany customers with 
visual impairments around our centres to 
assist them in their shopping. Not only that, 
many of our customers and staff volunteers 
have struck up friendships, making the visit 
not just about getting those special 
purchases but also a social visit too.

Our culture of behaving responsibly 
underpins our approach to CR. We work 
with our stakeholders to address social 
and environmental issues that deliver 
value beyond immediate ﬁnancial return. 
We focus on delivering positive change in 
our communities and on operating with 
minimum impact on the environment. 
Good relationships and partnerships are 
integral to everything we do.
Operational review
We have had a successful year in both our 
work with communities and our efforts to 
reduce our environmental impact, having 
met many of our 2020 environmental 
targets three years early. 
We have surpassed our ambitious target 
of a 50 per cent reduction in carbon 
intensity by 2020 based on our 2010 
levels. Using a mix of technology and 
behaviour change interventions we are 
proud this year to have reached a total 
carbon reduction of 58 per cent from 
2010 emissions. This has saved 144,000 
tonnes of carbon and reduced our energy 
costs by £25 million.
We also maintained our ‘zero waste to 
landﬁll’ status for the second year, 
meaning we diverted 28,000 tonnes of 
waste from landﬁll and saved £2.4 million 
in associated landﬁll costs. However, due 
to market factors, including China’s  
ban on the importing of waste for 
recycling, our recycling rate has fallen  
by 1 1 per cent to 63 per cent. Recycling 
rates will continue to fall until new 
markets are found as there is insufficient 
provision in the UK to handle the quantity  
we produce.
Last year we set up the Green Lab,  
our sustainability innovation group,  
to drive forward a range of sustainability 
initiatives across the business. Following 
the introduction of renewable energy 
generation and food waste trials last year, 
this year we have focused on working with 
sustainability consultants, Bioregional, to 
test new innovations that can be rolled 
out across the business. We are trialling 
some of these ideas on the upcoming  
intu Broadmarsh redevelopment.  
Next year we plan to explore further 
innovations in our operations.
Our strong and open relationships with 
our stakeholders means we have 
delivered real and lasting change in our 
communities. This year our wide-ranging 
community investment – which focuses 
on skills and employment, health and 
wellbeing, and social inclusion – beneﬁted 
3,645 people. Feedback showed 71 per 
cent of responders reported experiencing 
a positive change in their quality of life. 
Jobs in our centres continue to form a 
signiﬁcant proportion of the UK’s retail 
sector employment – we are responsible 
for about 3 per cent of all jobs in the 
sector. The majority of these are locally 
employed, meaning the wealth we create 
is captured locally.
This year we are reporting on our 
sustainability performance in Spain in our 
CR report and plan to include our Spanish 
assets in our future commitments.

 are conservation projects 
with a difference. There is strong  
emphasis on health and ﬁtness, meaning 
volunteers improve both their health  
and the environment.
This year we celebrated a decade of 
partnership with The Conservation 
Volunteers (TCV). Together, we have 
worked with local authorities and 
communities to set up 10 Green Gyms  
near our centres.
Over our 10-year partnership we have 
delivered real social and environmental 
change. We have welcomed over 1,000 
volunteers from the community, in  
addition to the intu staff who have given 
over 80,000 hours (3,000 days) to establish 
and maintain them – making everyone 
happier (attendees report a 21 per cent 
increase in happiness). We have also seen 
marked increases in biodiversity; kingﬁshers  
have been observed returning to the  
intu Merry Hill Green Gym.
This all leads to a £4 social return on every 
£1 invested in Green Gyms.
Strategic review
As we near the end of our current set  
of 2020 targets, we are now ﬁnalising  
our 2030 strategy. We are using the 
opportunity to think about how we take 
forward our sustainability and make sure 
it integrates with our strategic objectives.
As part of this analysis, and following the 
review of our material issues last year, we 
have considered how long-term future 
trends, consumer trends and the key UN 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
will affect our business and scope the big 
issues intu needs to focus on to deliver 
long-term value. 
We have identiﬁed the SDGs where we  
can make the biggest difference: decent 
work and economic growth, sustainable 
cities and communities and partnerships 
for goals.
We know we can make the biggest 
difference by creating economic  
inclusion in our communities through  
our employment and skills programmes, 
futureprooﬁng our assets using One 
Planet Principles and using our 
relationships to mobilise and encourage 
participation from all stakeholders in  
our communities.
We recognise we are not immune to  
what is happening in the wider world  
and understanding how the world is likely 
to change over the next 10–30 years 
means we can prepare ourselves to  
take advantage of further growth 
opportunities and mitigate risks  
to our business. 
We will combine our knowledge of what 
works with our understanding of 
sustainable future needs to create a 2030 
strategy that builds on the successes we 
have delivered through our 2020 strategy.

Meeting our carbon targets  
ahead of time
We have achieved our 2020 carbon targets 
three years ahead of schedule, through a 
groundbreaking programme to install LED 
lightbulbs throughout our centres. 
In 2012 we set ourselves the target of 
reducing our carbon footprint by 50 per 
cent, from our 2010 footprint. Lighting 
accounts for up to 50 per cent of energy 
use in retail spaces so this was identiﬁed as 
the most signiﬁcant aspect to tackle. We 
installed over 60,000 energy-efficient bulbs 
in several phases, achieving savings in one 
phase before moving onto the next. 
We also introduced a new energy 
management system (ISO 50001)  
and appointed energy champions  
at each centre.
We will now set ambitious new energy-
saving targets and have begun to trial 
onsite renewables at intu Chapelﬁeld which 
we plan to roll out to other centres.
External benchmarking
Providing clear and accurate performance 
data for benchmarking against our peers 
is critical for providing investors with 
information on our long-term risk 
assessment and management, 
operational performance and added 
value. It also provides us with valuable 
information to help us respond to 
emerging trends and review our  
own practices.
Our performance in the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index, for example, 
demonstrates we are leading in social 
integration and regeneration, being in the 
93rd percentile; and our performance in 
the GRESB shows that we are leaders in 
our environmental and social disclosures. 
Strategic report
59 Corporate responsibility Compliance with the April 2016 
UK Corporate Governance Code 
(‘the Code’)
The following governance pages 
explain how the Company applies the 
main principles of the Code, issued by 
the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), 
and how it meets other relevant 
governance requirements including 
provisions of the Disclosure Guidance 
and Transparency Rules of the 
Financial Conduct Authority. Both 
documents are publicly available on 
the FRC website (frc.org.uk).
The Board considers that the Company 
complied in full with the provisions of 
the Code during the year.
Governance
Dear shareholder 
Throughout the year we have continued 
to ensure that our governance structures 
at Board, Committee, subsidiary and joint 
venture levels continue to be appropriate 
and support our business and culture in 
an ever-changing regulatory environment. 
In the next few pages we provide details 
of our Board members, the role of the 
Board and its performance and oversight. 
We also provide the information on our 
governance framework which we  
consider is appropriate for a UK  
premium-listed company.
2017 governance highlights 
Succession planning 
It has been an exceptionally active 
year for the Nomination and Review 
Committee with signiﬁcant changes to 
the Board’s composition. Patrick Burgess 
retired from the Board following the 
annual general meeting (AGM) in May 
2017 after nearly nine years as Chairman. 
Andrew Huntley, Non-Executive Director 
and Senior Independent Director (SID), 
also retired from the Board in May 2017 . 
In accordance with the process 
established by the Board, Andrew 
Huntley chaired a Nomination and Review 
sub-committee to oversee the search for 
a new Chairman. The sub-committee 
comprised Andrew Huntley, Adèle 
Anderson and Steven Underwood. Korn 
Ferry Whitehead Mann was engaged to 
assist with the search. The independent 
non-executive directors also contributed 
to the process, all being entitled to attend 
Nomination and Review Committee 
meetings when Board succession matters 
were being discussed. 
Effectiveness and evaluation
As Chairman, it is my role to provide 
leadership to ensure the operation of 
an effective Board. 
The Board consists of nine directors, 
including myself. The directors bring a 
wide range of skills and perspectives to 
the Board’s deliberations, as described on 
the following pages. In relation to gender 
diversity we have three female Board 
members (33 per cent), which meets the 
Lord Davies’ 2020 target of 33 per cent. 
As highlighted in the Nomination and 
Review Committee’s report on page 76, 
the Board considers that broader aspects 
of diversity, rather than purely gender, are 
key to stimulating constructive debate. 
During 2017 we conducted an externally 
facilitated Board performance evaluation 
and the ﬁndings provided a further 
opportunity to continue to enhance the 
Board’s contributions through improved 
communication and best practice.

Centre teams around the country played host to a series  
of visits from the Chairman and Chief Executive as part  
of the Chairman’s induction.
As part of the visits, which each lasted half a day, John Strachan 
and David Fischel were given a centre tour by the general 
manager. They then spent time meeting staff from all areas of 
the centre team over a cup of tea and a bite to eat with centres 
bringing a local twist such as eccles cakes at intu Trafford Centre.
They met and spoke to hundreds of staff from housekeeping 
teams to security, customer services to business support and 
technical services to car park hosts and gardeners. Topics were 
varied as staff quizzed John and David on company plans and 
policies, corporate responsibility, and their views on the 
economy and Brexit as well as more personal questions such as 
which sports teams they supported and their all-time favourite 
ﬁlms. But it wasn’t all one way – John and David found it 
invaluable to learn more about the ﬁner details of people’s jobs, 
discuss any staff concerns and importantly to hear a host of new 
ideas that the staff had about keeping intu at the forefront of 
the retail and leisure market.
It was fantastic to meet John 
and David and talk with them 
about the future of the centre.”

Governance
The Board The Board continued
Leadership
The Board and its governance 
framework
The Board is responsible for setting intu’s 
strategic aims and then monitoring 
management’s performance against 
those aims as well as setting the strategic 
framework within which those aims can 
be achieved. The business model 
described on pages 30 and 31 illustrates 
the key value creation and operational 
drivers for intu’s strategy and the means 
by which the Board ultimately delivers 
long-term growth and sustainable returns 
for shareholders and debt investors. 
Appropriate and effective corporate 
governance is taken seriously at intu and 
is intrinsic to all aspects of the Board’s 
activities. Consequently, governance is 
interwoven into the activities of 
management, who are accountable to the 
Board, and all employees, who are in turn 
accountable to management. This is 
reinforced by the established coherent 
governance framework which underpins 
the culture and workings of the Group 
with clearly deﬁned responsibilities and 
accountabilities, consisting of:
 — Board committees to enable the 
Board to operate effectively and give 
full consideration to key matters (as 
shown in the diagram on page 65)
 — delegated authority limits, which apply 
at all levels of the business and are 
incorporated into all operational 
procedures ensuring matters are  
dealt with at the appropriate level 
 — internal policies, procedures and 
controls (including risk management 
arrangements, delegated authority 
limits and a related parties protocol) 
which are regularly reported on, 
reviewed and updated by the Board 
and relevant committees
 — internal processes which are 
communicated to all staff and  
are available at all times on the 
Group’s intranet
Each aspect is routinely reviewed by the 
Board and updated to satisfy the needs of 
the business. The Board has continued to 
review its governance framework and has 
adjusted, where necessary, the roles, 
structure and accountabilities of senior 
management to reﬂect the demands of 
the business. During the year, the Group’s 
anti-bribery and corruption training and 
controls were reviewed and enhanced, 
including the launch of a dedicated 
e-learning compliance platform and a 
new online gifts and hospitality tool. 
Furthermore, in response to the 
introduction of the Criminal Finances  
Act 2017 , the Group undertook a risk 
assessment of whether it has reasonable 
procedures in place to prevent the 
criminal facilitation of tax evasion with 
further training and monitoring being 
planned for implementation during 2018. 
Board culture
The Chairman is directly 
accountable for the culture of 
the Board, which is deﬁned by:
 — highly experienced and 
knowledgeable directors, with a 
wide range of skills and diverse 
perspectives who act conﬁdently 
and are true to themselves 
 — a conservative, measured approach 
to business, allied with a willingness 
to take considered risks through 
insightful investment to achieve 
strategic goals
 — the relationships between individual 
directors and the senior executives, 
which encourage beneﬁcial debate 
and open discussion of views
The Board’s culture permeates 
throughout the Group’s operations 
and is enshrined within intu’s values, 
which encourage staff to be bold, 
creative and genuine. 
  Further information on intu’s culture  
and values can be found on page 54
Our approach to CR
CR underpins the strategic 
aims of our business, creating a 
long-term and sustainable business 
that brings value to all our 
stakeholders. The Board fully supports 
the Group’s approach to CR with the 
Chairman of the Board chairing the 
Board CR Committee. The Board CR 
Committee’s members also include 
the Chief Executive and the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee.
  Further details of our CR activities  
can be found in the 2017 CR report

Non-Executive 
Directors
Richard Gordon
John Whittaker
intu has representatives of two major shareholders appointed as non-executive 
directors – the Deputy Chairman John Whittaker and Richard Gordon. Direct 
shareholder Board representation, with appropriate management of conﬂicts, 
ensures that key strategic, operational and governance decision-making is more 
closely aligned with the interests of the direct shareholder groups they represent 
and other institutional and retail investors generally. In this respect the Group 
surpasses the expectations of the Stewardship Code
 
The representative directors also contribute strongly to the Board’s culture and 
personality, adding insight and constructive challenge from their varied commercial 
backgrounds, their experience and expertise
Alternate Directors Steven Underwood
Raymond Fine
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, John Whittaker and 
Richard Gordon have appointed Steven Underwood and Raymond Fine respectively 
as their alternates. The Board has generally invited the alternates to attend 
Board meetings
*  The Board reviews the independence of its non-executive directors on an annual basis. With the exception of John Whittaker and Richard Gordon, the Board has 
concluded that all non-executive directors are independent. 
  Biographical details of each director are set out on pages 62 and 63
67
Governance
The Board The Board continued
in which he or she is conﬂicted. Directors 
must also notify the Chairman when they 
take on any additional responsibilities or 
external appointments, and it is their 
responsibility to ensure that such 
appointments will not prevent them from 
meeting the time commitments 
discussed above. 
Effectiveness
Balance and composition
The Nomination and Review Committee 
regularly reviews the composition of the 
Board to ensure that it operates efficiently 
and has access to a broad range of 
knowledge and viewpoints. The Board 
determined that new candidates for the 
role of non-executive director should have 
sector-relevant qualiﬁcations and 
experience – notably in property, retail, 
ﬁnance or digital, to ensure that these key 
areas are well-represented – while also 
having regard to wider business 
knowledge and diverse backgrounds 
which can be beneﬁcial to the Group. 
The appropriate balance of skills, 
independence, experience and knowledge 
does not in itself ensure the efficient 
operation of a board. To this end, the 
Chairman’s style and leadership of the 
Board are essential to creating an 
environment where the Non-Executive 
Directors are able to draw on their own 
experience to constructively challenge 
the views of the executive management. 
The Chairman facilitates this by drawing 
on the Non-Executive Directors’ range of 
experiences to provide insight and 
alternative perspectives and has invited 
all independent Non-Executive Directors 
to attend any committee, irrespective of 
whether they are formally a member of 
such committee.
The balance of the Board is illustrated on 
page 63.
Time commitment  
and external activities 
Non-executive directors are appointed 
for a three-year term and their continuing 
service thereafter is subject to review by 
the Board. All directors are submitted for 
annual re-election by shareholders. Their 
annual time commitment varies with 
speciﬁed minimum requirements within 
the terms of their appointment and is 
assessed as part of each director’s annual 
review. Each director has demonstrated 
that he or she has sufficient time to 
devote to their present role at intu.
Conﬂicts of interest
The Board has adopted a formal 
procedure under which directors must 
notify the Chairman of the Board of any 
potential conﬂicts. The Chairman then 
decides whether a conﬂict exists and 
recommends its authorisation by the 
Board where appropriate. In certain 
circumstances, the conﬂicted director 
may be required to recuse themselves 
from the Board’s discussions on a matter 
Board meetings
Board agendas are shaped to create time for strategic discussion and debate with time 
allocated to routine matters being closely managed.

Review Committees give updates on the workings of and progress made by those 
Committees, highlighting any areas requiring escalation to, or consideration by, the full Board. 
Other matters for discussion are added to the agenda for scheduled Board meetings, or

68 intu properties plc  Annual report 2017  Communication
Directors are kept fully informed of 
progress on key matters, including 
operational and ﬁnancial performance, 
between formal meetings. This is 
achieved by way of either scheduled 
conference calls or less formal update 
meetings in months where there is 
no formal Board meeting scheduled. 
Ad hoc meetings and working visits to 
centres are also regularly arranged to 
support the Chairman’s policy of open 
communication. The Chairmen of the 
Audit Committee and Remuneration 
Committee communicate regularly and 
directly with relevant staff and external 
advisors, including but not limited to the 
Director of Risk and Assurance, the 
Company Secretary and Deloitte LLP , 
who act as the Remuneration 
Committee’s consultants. 
The Chairman of the Board and Company 
Secretary ensure that all directors are 
provided with accurate and timely 
information to facilitate informed 
discussion at Board meetings.
Appropriate and 
effective corporate 
governance is taken 
seriously at intu and is 
intrinsic to all aspects of 
the Board’s activities.”
Relations with 
shareholders
We place considerable emphasis on 
maintaining an open and frank dialogue 
with investors. Our programme of investor 
relations activities involves members of 
the Executive Committee (including, on 
occasion, the Chairman) and the Head of 
Investor Relations. We seek to develop 
existing and potential investors’ 
understanding of intu’s business strategy, 
operations, performance and investment 
case. This provides the Board and Executive 
Committee with an insight into the differing 
views of intu’s institutional and other 
signiﬁcant investors as well as those of 
retail shareholders.
Key activities in 2017 included: 
 — results meetings and update calls: an 
average of 50 institutions attended each 
announcement
 — road show meetings: following results 
announcements we conducted around 
200 meetings in the UK, South Africa, 
US and Europe
 — investor conferences: we attended  
nine real estate conferences organised 
by investment banks, meeting  
110 institutions
 — site visits: toured Madrid Xanadú and 
intu Lakeside with 30 investors and 15 
sell-side analysts
 — interaction with sell-side analysts: 
engaged with analysts from around 20 
institutions to ensure the insight of their 
research was accurate

investor interactions in 2017
Board oversight of  
risk management 
The effective assessment and 
management of risk is key to the 
delivery of the Group’s strategy. The 
setting of the Group’s risk appetite by 
the Board provides the framework 
within which the Group’s risk 
management process operates.
The Board has overall responsibility 
for risk management and the Audit 
Committee monitors and reviews the 
effectiveness of the risk management 
process ensuring that the appropriate 
governance and challenge around risk  
is embedded throughout the business. 
The Group’s risk management process is 
set out in more detail on pages 38 and 
39, and the Group’s principal risks are 
discussed on pages 40 and 41. As part  
of the Governance Framework all 
recommendations to the Board must 
include speciﬁc consideration of 
potential risks to ensure this aspect  
is given due consideration while still 
permitting the Board to act decisively.
Many of the risks to which the Group is 
exposed have remained broadly in line 
with 2016 with the exception of 
cybersecurity, which saw an increase  
in likelihood but the severity of its 
potential impact has reduced. No 
signiﬁcant new risks were identiﬁed. 
  Principal risks and uncertainties are discussed 
in further detail on pages 40 and 41
69
Governance
The Board In accordance with provision C.2.2 of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
Directors have assessed the prospects of 
the Company over a longer period than 
that required in adopting the going 
concern basis of accounting. Based on 
the result of this analysis, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the next ﬁve calendar years. 
This period is considered appropriate 
because of the combination of the 
following factors:
 — the Group’s strategic plan covers  
10 years, with a greater degree of 
detail and rigour applied to the ﬁrst 
ﬁve years 
 — the Group’s weighted average 
unexpired lease term, which at 
31 December 2017 was 7 .5 years
 — the Group’s weighted average debt 
maturity, which at 31 December 2017 
was 6.6 years
 — the term of the Group’s Revolving 
Credit Facility, which currently extends 
to 2021
The strategic plan incorporates the 
Group’s strategic objectives and considers 
the impact of the principal risks. The plan 
considers net rental income, cash ﬂows, 
development expenditure, potential 
corporate transactions including the 
recycling of capital and reﬁnancing plans 
over the 10-year period. It highlights the 
impact of the relevant principal risks on 
key metrics such as debt to assets  
ratio, underlying earnings per share  
and ﬁnancial headroom and also  
models the impact of potential  
corporate transactions. 
Viability statement
Principal risks are set out in detail on 
pages 40 and 41, and the relevant risks for 
assessing viability have been identiﬁed as:
 — macro-economic; speciﬁcally impact 
on rental income levels, property 
values and covenant headroom (Risk 1)
 — retail environment; speciﬁcally impact 
on occupancy and pipeline (Risk 2)
 — terrorism; speciﬁcally negative impact 
on lettings and rental growth (Risk 5)
 — availability of funds; speciﬁcally impact 
on liquidity (Risk 6) 
The Directors also consider the impact on 
the Group’s ﬁnancial position of changes 
in key input assumptions including asset 
values, income and reﬁnancing after 
mitigation strategies including property 
sales not included in the plan. Key 
assumptions and sensitivities  
addressed include:
 — ability to recycle capital as planned
 — reﬁnancing of debt; £2. 1 billion (around 
42 per cent) of the Group’s debt is due 
for repayment in the next ﬁve years
 — falls in the value of investment 
property of up to 25 per cent
 — falls in income of up to 10 per cent
70 intu properties plc  Annual report 2017  Dear shareholder
As the Chairman of the Audit Committee  
it is my role to present to you the Audit 
Committee report for 2017 . 
The Audit Committee has this year 
continued to focus on risk management, 
speciﬁcally in relation to our 
developments in the UK and our 
expanding operations in Spain, as well as 
continued to receive twice-yearly reviews 
of cyber risks. The Audit Committee also 
conducted a review of the Group’s culture 
and concluded the audit tender process.
The Group’s approach to risk management 
is described in detail on pages 38 and 39 
and the principal risks are detailed on 
pages 40 and 41.
The EU Audit Regulation (537 /2014) and 
Audit Directive (2014/56/EU) became 
applicable from 17 June 2016 and must 
be implemented in the UK from that  
date. These limit the length of tenure  
an audit ﬁrm can serve, and put in place 
requirements for the audit tender process 
as detailed below. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) has been 
intu’s audit ﬁrm for more than 20 years 
and a tender process was commenced in 
2016 and concluded in 2017 . Since the 
conclusion of this process the proposed 
combination with Hammerson has been 
announced, and consequently it has been 
decided to defer the appointment of a 
new auditor until the outcome of this 
approach is clear. Under the applicable 
transitional rules PwC is able to act as 
intu’s auditor until 2020.
Following our annual review of auditor 
quality and independence (see page 73 
for more detail), we have recommended 
that PwC be reappointed for the  
2018 audit.
Responsibilities
The Audit Committee’s key 
responsibilities are to monitor  
and review:
 — the integrity of the ﬁnancial 
statements, including a review of the 
signiﬁcant ﬁnancial reporting 
judgements and accounting policies
 — the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal control and risk management
 — the effectiveness of the internal  
audit function, including the work 
programme undertaken by the function
 — the Group’s policy on and approach  
to whistleblowing
 — the Group’s overall approach to 
monitoring areas of risk
 — the Company’s relationship with  
the external auditor, including  
its independence
Main activities during the year
The Audit Committee considered the 
following key matters in 2017:
 — valuation of the Group’s investment 
and development property, including 
the ﬁrst external valuation of the land 
at intu Costa del Sol

71 Audit Committee Key ﬁnancial reporting and 
signiﬁcant judgements
During the year the Audit Committee 
discussed the planning, progress and ﬁnal 
conclusions of the external audit process. 
The audit plan was reviewed and 
approved at the July 2017 Audit 
Committee meeting. The signiﬁcant risk 
areas identiﬁed were: investment and 
development property valuations; 
signiﬁcant transactions during the year; 
revenue recognition; and management 
override of controls. International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) identify  
these latter two risks as signiﬁcant  
for all companies. 
These issues were discussed by the  
Audit Committee following ﬁnalisation  
of the audit.
The Audit Committee takes into account 
the views of the external auditor in 
understanding and assessing whether 
suitable accounting policies have been 
adopted, whether management has 
made appropriate estimates and 
judgements and whether disclosures  
are balanced and fair. The main issues 
discussed by the Audit Committee in  
the year are detailed in the table below.
Issue Action taken
Valuation of investment  
and development property
For the interim results at 30 June 2017 the Audit Committee carried out a review of the investment property 
valuations. The full Board carried out a review of the 31 December 2017 valuations included in this report.
Due to the overall importance of the valuations to the Group’s results, the relevant Audit Committee meeting 
included a presentation from and discussion with Knight Frank as part of the valuation process and the relevant 
Board meeting included a presentation from Cushman & Wakeﬁeld.
The Audit Committee review included discussion with management and the external auditor of the key 
assumptions and results of the valuation process undertaken by the independent third party valuers. 
This review also included understanding which general factors had inﬂuenced the valuers in concluding on 
appropriate yields to use in the valuations. This involved factors affecting both the investment and occupier 
markets and recent comparable market transactions.
Particular emphasis was given to understanding the factors that had resulted in individual property valuations 
being either signiﬁcantly above or below the average movement in the Group’s valuations. The Audit Committee 
speciﬁcally considered the appropriateness of the special assumption that the development land at intu Costa del 
Sol is valued as if all planning consents are in place at the balance sheet date, and the sensitivity of this valuation to 
projected income and cost assumptions.
Presentation of information Operating through joint ventures is a core part of intu’s strategy. Management both review and monitor the 
business, including the Group’s share of joint ventures, on an individual line basis not on a post-tax proﬁt or net 
investment basis. The ﬁgures and commentary presented in the strategic report have therefore been presented 
consistently with this management approach. Reconciliations between the management and statutory bases are 
provided in the other information section on pages 165 to 168.
The Committee has reviewed the prominence given to both statutory information and information on a 
management basis, and concluded that the approach adopted provides the most useful analysis of the results  
for the year.
Going concern The Company’s ‘going concern’ review, which is based on 18-month cash ﬂow projections with particular focus on 
the next 12 months, was discussed with management. The projections cover the major trading cash ﬂows, being 
rental income and interest expense, and capital expenditure plans in the context of the latest debt maturity proﬁle.
Stress tests of the projections were considered, covering reductions in the value of the Group’s properties, a fall in 
income as well as the inability to execute the capital recycling transactions, and what impact such changes may 
have on both the Group’s liquidity and its ability to meet the ﬁnancial covenants on its debt facilities. The discussion 
and analysis also considered what actions were available to the Group to mitigate the impact of such reductions on 
the cash ﬂow projections.
Viability statement In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board has assessed the prospects  
of the Company over a longer period than that required in adopting the going concern basis of accounting. The 
viability statement is included on page 70 and sets out the conclusion of that assessment. 
The same stress tests as outlined in the Going concern section above were conducted on the projections 
underpinning the viability assessment.
The Audit Committee assessed the viability position and reported its recommendations to the Board.
Audit Committee continued
72 intu properties plc  Annual report 2017  Fair, balanced and understandable
At the request of the Board, the Audit 
Committee considered whether the  
2017 annual report was fair, balanced  
and understandable and whether it 
provided the necessary information for 
shareholders to assess intu’s performance, 
business model, position and strategy.  
As part of its considerations the Audit 
Committee took into account the 
preparation process detailed below which, 
together with opinions of key executives 
and the external auditor, has been 
designed to assist the Audit Committee  
in reaching its view:
 — at an early stage, a matrix is produced 
identifying key themes and the  
sections in which those themes  
should be reﬂected
 — individual sections of the annual report 
are drafted by appropriate senior 
management with regular review 
meetings to ensure consistency across 
the whole document
 — a veriﬁcation process is undertaken to 
ensure that information contained is 
appropriately supported and  
factually accurate
 — detailed reviews of drafts of the annual 
report are undertaken by members of 
the Executive Committee and other 
senior management
 — drafts are discussed with the Group’s 
legal advisors and brokers
 — a ﬁnal draft is reviewed by the Audit 
Committee and discussed with senior 
management prior to consideration  
by the Board
As a result of its considerations the Audit 
Committee is satisﬁed that, taken as  
a whole, the annual report is fair,  
balanced and understandable and has 
recommended it as such to the Board.
External auditor
The Audit Committee has assessed the 
effectiveness of the external auditor, 
PwC, in line with the approach set out in 
the Financial Reporting Council’s Audit 
Quality Practice Aid. In carrying out the 
evaluation the Audit Committee has held 
discussions without the auditor, asked the 
auditor to explain the risks to audit quality 
that they have identiﬁed and their 
ﬁrm-wide controls relied upon, enquired 
about the ﬁndings from internal and 
external inspections of their audit, 
challenged the auditor’s strategy and 
plan and discussed the outputs of the 
audit with the auditor. This included direct 
meetings, review of reporting issued by 
the external auditor and review of 
independent reports:
 — senior ﬁnance staff reviewed the 
detailed execution of the 2016 audit 
plan with the engagement team and 
incorporated any ﬁndings into the  
2017 plan 
 — the Chair of the Audit Committee and 
the Chief Financial Officer each met 
privately with a senior partner of PwC 
unrelated to the engagement to 
review the performance of the ﬁrm 
 — the Audit Committee reviewed the 
audit plan provided by PwC, including 
the risks identiﬁed and its approach  
to these
The Company has complied with the 
provisions of The Statutory Audit Services 
for Large Companies Market Investigation 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender 
Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014 and in doing 
so has applied the transitional provisions 
related to the audit tender process. 
The tender process commenced during 
2016 and concluded during the ﬁrst half 
of 2017 with Deloitte being selected for 
appointment for the year ending  
31 December 2018. The tender process 
was conducted in line with the 
requirements of EU Audit Regulation 
(537 /2014) and Audit Directive (2014/56/
EU) (‘the regulations’) which became 
applicable to the Group on 1 January 
2017 . Since the conclusion of this process 
intu has become the offeree in a takeover 
approach, and consequently it has been 
decided to defer the appointment of a 
new auditor until the outcome of this 
approach is clear. Under the applicable 
transitional rules PwC is able to act as 
intu’s auditor until 2020.
A resolution to reappoint PwC for the 
2018 audit will be proposed at the 2018 
annual general meeting. The Audit 
Committee will continue to review the 
effectiveness and independence of the 
external auditor each year.
Non-audit services
On 1 January 2017 the Group 
implemented the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
for Auditors which imposes restrictions on 
certain non-audit services. A number of 
non-audit services are prohibited and 
others require approval by the Audit 
Committee. There is an overall fee limit of 
70 per cent of the average of audit fees 
charged in the past three years, and 
hence the fee limit comes into force for 
the ﬁnancial year to 31 December 2020. 
The Audit Committee has sole authority 
to contract for non-audit services with the 
external auditor subject to observing 
certain guidelines including:
 — the Audit Committee must consider 
whether the proposed arrangements 
will maintain audit independence
 — the external auditor must  
satisfy the Company that it  
is acting independently
The table below summarises the fees paid 
to the auditor over the last three years. 
The three-year average ratio of non-audit 
fees to audit fees is 8 per cent.

Governance
Audit Committee Risk management and 
internal control
The Board has overall responsibility to 
oversee the Group’s system of internal 
control and to keep its effectiveness 
under review, as well as to determine the 
nature and extent of the risks it is willing 
to take in achieving its strategic objectives 
based on the balance of potential risks 
and reward. The Group’s approach to risk 
management is described in detail on 
pages 38 and 39 and the principal risks 
are detailed on pages 40 and 41.
The Audit Committee oversees the 
Board’s annual review of the effectiveness 
of the risk management and internal 
control systems. During this review the 
Board has not identiﬁed nor been made 
aware of any failing or weakness which  
it has determined to be signiﬁcant.
The key elements taken into account  
in this review include:
 — the Group’s internal audit function’s 
work during the year (see right)
 — the Group’s risk management process 
 — the Group’s controls over its ﬁnancial 
reporting process including: the 
comprehensive system for reporting 
results to the Board for review and 
consideration; the review process 
underlying the production of the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements;  
and the experience and quality of  
the team involved in the ﬁnancial 
reporting processes
In the context of the Group’s approach to 
risk management the Audit Committee 
commissioned a report on company 
culture. This consisted of consideration  
of key trends from the employee survey 
conducted in the second half of 2016,  
and a Group-wide review of culture, 
including workshops and questionnaires 
with staff across all levels at head office 
and at the centres. The results from this 
review helped the Audit Committee 
contextualise risks and risk management 
practices. The actions arising have been 
put on hold until after the completion  
of the potential business combination 
with Hammerson.
Internal audit
The Group has a risk and internal audit 
function which reports to the Audit 
Committee. The risk and internal audit 
function reviews internal controls and 
reports to the Audit Committee on 
whether such controls are in place and  
are being operated effectively. The 
function covers intu properties plc  
and its subsidiaries and joint ventures.
The risk and internal audit function has a 
rolling programme of reviews ensuring 
that all centres, functions and areas of 
the business are reviewed regularly. The 
most signiﬁcant areas covered in 2017 
included shopping centre health checks, 
business continuity, insurance, 
procurement and supply chain and 
culture. Additionally, annual assurance 
activities were performed, including a 
review of the assurance map and 
executive expenses. 
Audit Committee continued
74 intu properties plc  Annual report 2017  Committee membership
The Audit Committee members have been 
selected to provide the wide range of 
ﬁnancial and commercial expertise 
necessary to fulﬁl the Committee’s duties 
and responsibilities. The Board is satisﬁed 
that the Audit Committee has recent  
and relevant ﬁnancial experience for the 
purposes of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. Additionally, in accordance with the 
2016 Corporate Governance Code the 
Board has determined that the current 
composition of the Audit Committee as a 
whole has competence relevant to the 
sector in which the Company operates. For 
full detail of the members’ experience and 
skills please see Directors’ biographies on 
pages 62 and 63.
The Audit Committee regularly reviews 
the effectiveness of the risk and internal 
audit function and in particular ensures 
that the function remains sufficiently 
independent of the wider business to 
ensure it can carry out its work effectively. 
An independent review of the risk and 
internal audit function is carried out every 
ﬁve years and was last performed at the 
end of 2013. An external review of the 
Group’s risk management process was 
carried out at the end of 2015 as 
discussed in the focus on risk section  
on pages 38 and 39. The key 
recommendations have all  
been implemented. 
Whistleblowing policy
The Audit Committee is responsible for 
overseeing the Group’s whistleblowing 
policy and procedures, under which 
employees can raise concerns about 
possible improprieties (whether ﬁnancial 
or otherwise) within the Group on a 
conﬁdential basis. 
During the year the Audit Committee 
reviewed and strengthened the policy 
and procedures and a whistleblowing 
committee was established with  
set terms of reference, with key 
representatives from HR, Operations  
and Finance, which reports regularly to 
the Audit Committee. All whistleblowing 
incidents are reported to this 
whistleblowing committee which fully 
investigates each event and agrees any 
remedial action such as procedures  
being reviewed and improved  
where appropriate.
There were 10 whistleblowing incidents 
relating to the intu Group during 2017 . 
These included: 
 — reported breach of health and safety 
procedures, following investigation of 
which one individual was dismissed and 
the other subject to disciplinary action
 — reported security concerns within one 
centre, following which a thorough 
review took place and remedial action 
was taken
 — two connected claims of professional 
misconduct, which resulted in 
disciplinary action
 — one claim of professional misconduct 
which is still being investigated
 — concern over the roadworthiness of a 
centre vehicle, which was proved to be 
without foundation
 — two grievances which were deemed 
not to be whistleblowing incidents
 — two further disclosures which,  
upon investigation, could not  
be substantiated
Audit Committee effectiveness
As part of the Board evaluation process, 
the Audit Committee reviewed its own 
effectiveness and this conﬁrmed that  
the Committee remained effective at 
meeting its objectives.

Audit Committee Nomination and Review Committee
Dear shareholder
2017 continued to be an important  
and busy year for the Nomination  
and Review Committee.
Having taken over the role of the 
Chairman in early May, I am committed 
to maintaining the high standards of the 
Nomination and Review Committee and 
ensuring that we continue to follow a 
robust process and best governance 
practice whenever key decisions are 
taken, in particular relating to new 
appointments and when considering the 
composition of the Board. 
Responsibilities and how they were 
discharged in 2017
The principal role of the Nomination and 
Review Committee is to evaluate the skills 
available on the Board and to determine 
when appointments and retirements  
are appropriate. 
In addition to its key responsibilities set 
out above, the Committee is also 
responsible for carrying out the annual 
performance evaluation of the Board, its 
committees and individual directors, as 
well as making recommendations on 
appointments to the Board, including the 
induction programme for newly 
appointed directors, and on succession 
planning. Those non-executive directors 
who have served on the Board for six 
years or more have been subject to a 
particularly rigorous review.
The Committee carried out a formal 
Board performance evaluation process, 
by way of a questionnaire. The outcome 
of the review is summarised opposite.
The Committee met twice in 2017 with its 
main focus on the composition of the 
Board and succession-planning, in 
particular in relation to the succession of 
the Chairman, and in relation to the role 
of Senior Independent Director. 
Statement on diversity policy
The Nomination and Review Committee, 
and the Board, have always recognised 
the importance of boardroom diversity, 
providing a wide range of perspectives, 
and the Committee’s policy is to seek to 
ensure that a range of suitable candidates 
is taken into account when drawing up 
longlists and shortlists. The priority of the 
Committee is to ensure that the Group 
continues to have the most effective 
Board possible and all appointments to 
the Board are made on merit against 
objective criteria.  A description of intu’s 
company-wide approach to diversity can 
be found on pages 54 to 56.
Board composition
The Committee’s discussions regarding 
the composition of the Board continue to 
be framed by the Company’s previously 
stated goal of reducing the overall size of 
the Board. Accordingly, two non-
executive directors, Patrick Burgess and 
Andrew Huntley, retired from the Board 
and were not replaced. The Committee  
is satisﬁed that the balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience on the  
Board and its committees continues  
to be appropriate. 
The Board is supportive of Lord Davies’ 
aspirational target of 33 per cent female 
Board representation by 2020 and is 
pleased to conﬁrm that the Board’s 
female representation now stands at  
33 per cent. Further information 
regarding our diversity policy is set  
out above.
Succession-planning
A sub-committee was established, 
chaired by Andrew Huntley, to carry out 
the search for a new Chairman to succeed 
Patrick Burgess who retired from the 
Board in May 2017 . Appropriate input was 
provided by independent executive search 
ﬁrm Korn Ferry Whitehead Mann. Korn 
Ferry Whitehead Mann had no other 
connection with the Company other than 
providing input into the Board’s 
succession-planning. I was pleased to

Andrew Huntley also retired from the 
Board on 3 May 2017 . The Committee 
was pleased to appoint Adèle Anderson 
as Senior Independent Director, 
succeeding Andrew Huntley.
Talent, training and development
T alent development is a key focus of the 
Committee and a comprehensive talent 
and leadership programme, including 
succession-planning, has been 
implemented for senior management 
across the Group. The Committee 
receives regular update reports regarding 
progress and remains conﬁdent in the 
future potential of the Group’s most 
promising executives and staff.
As Chairman, with the assistance of the 
Nomination and Review Committee,  
I regularly consider the need for directors 
to update and expand their skills and 
knowledge. Training is provided for 
non-executive directors in the form  
of presentations at Board meetings, 
attendance at relevant seminars  
and courses. 
The Board also recognises the need for 
directors to keep up-to-date with relevant 
legislative and regulatory developments 
as well as changes to corporate 
governance best practice and investor 
expectations. The Company Secretary 
reports to each Board meeting on these 
matters, drawing attention to any issues 
of particular relevance. 
Re-election of directors
All directors will submit themselves for 
re-election at the forthcoming annual 
general meeting in May 2018.

Performance evaluation 
Every year, the Board conducts a performance evaluation of the performance of the Board 
and its committees. In addition, the Chairman reviews the performance of each director and 
the Senior Independent Director oversees the review of the Chairman’s performance. The 
areas identiﬁed for attention during 2017 were as shown in the table below:

2017 performance evaluation
This involved an external independent facilitator, Lintstock, engaging with the Chairman and 
Company Secretary to set the context for the evaluation and tailor surveys for all directors to 
the speciﬁc circumstances of intu. Lintstock is a specialist corporate governance consultancy 
and has no commercial dealings with the Group, other than for the provision of corporate 
governance services to the Board. The anonymity of all respondents was ensured throughout 
the process in order to promote the open and frank exchange of views.
As a result of the analysis, among other things the Board agreed that it should continue to 
devote attention to succession-planning, consider the balance between presentation and 
discussion at meetings and continue to spend more time discussing strategic topics.
Induction for new directors
There is a comprehensive induction programme for new directors which is tailored by the 
Chairman, in consultation with the Chief Executive and Company Secretary, depending on the 
type of appointment. The programme ordinarily includes meetings with Board members, 
senior management and external advisors, as well as a high-level review of all current 
projects, Board strategy and an in-depth review of the Group’s assets. Additional elements  
are added to the programme as needed following discussion between the Chairman and the 
individual director. 
Where required, the Company Secretary provides guidance and facilitates the provision of 
training on directors’ duties under the Companies Act 2006 and on legal, regulatory and 
governance matters with which the Company, Board and individual directors must comply.

Nomination and Review Committee Key areas of focus and decisions in 
2017 and for 2018
The Remuneration Committee made  
a number of decisions regarding the 
application of our policy in 2017  
and for 2018. Key decisions included  
the following:
 — the Chief Executive’s and Chief 
Financial Officer’s salaries will be 
increased by two per cent to £617 ,916 
and £487 ,713, respectively. This 
increase is lower than the average 
increase for other staff in the business
 — fees for our Chairman will remain 
unchanged at £275,000 per annum
 — the annual bonus awarded to the 
Executive Directors for the year ended 
31 December 2017 was 72 per cent 
of salary representing 60 per cent of 
maximum opportunity, based  
on EPS performance in the year  
and the achievement of key  
strategic objectives

 — PSP awards of 250 per cent of salary 
were made to each of the Executive 
Directors. These will only vest subject 
to the achievement of stretching TSR

conditions, over three, four and 
ﬁve years and would be subject to 
performance and time pro-rating on 
the successful acquisition of intu  
by Hammerson
In light of the recommended all-share 
offer by Hammerson to acquire intu, the 
Remuneration Committee also 
considered the remuneration implications 
arising from the acquisition, including the 
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to present intu’s 2017 
Directors’ remuneration report to you, 
which has been prepared by the 
Remuneration Committee and approved 
by the Board.
Results and context of remuneration
This has been another year of good 
results, against a backdrop of headwinds 
to the retail property market, including 
the impact of Brexit and the internet. 
Operationally, we out-performed  
against our benchmarks and made  
strong progress against our strategic 
objectives. In particular in 2017 we 
increased like-for-like net rental income 
and achieved good growth across our 
Spanish assets. 
Remuneration policy
Our Directors’ remuneration policy was 
approved by shareholders at the 2017 
annual general meeting, and we were 
delighted to receive 99.5 per cent support 
from our shareholders. 
A summary of the remuneration policy is 
presented at the end of this report. 
Alignment with long-term success 
The Committee believes that our 
remuneration philosophy and incentive 
policy is aligned with the long-term 
success of the Company. Our long-term 
incentive plan has time horizons 
extending to ﬁve years, and 50 per cent of 
our annual bonus is deferred into shares. 
Performance pay is linked to:
 — out-performance of total shareholder 
return (TSR) against our peers
 — delivering absolute total return (NAV 
per share growth plus dividends) for 
our shareholders
 — annual EPS performance
 — achievement of our strategic initiatives 
that will build value for the longer term
Both Executive Directors are required to 
build up a shareholding in intu shares 
worth 200 per cent of salary.

1.  John Whittaker did not receive any remuneration in 2017 or 2016 in connection with his position as Deputy Chairman and Non-Executive Director of the Company. 
 A management fee of £213,310 was paid to Peel Management Limited for the provision by Peel of management and advisory services, as further described on page 155.  
The ﬁgures in the table have been calculated as follows:
 — Base salary: amount earned for the year.
 — Beneﬁts: the taxable value of annual beneﬁts received in the year. The main beneﬁts are life assurance, long-term sickness insurance, private healthcare, company car cash 
allowance and occasional use of company ﬂat and for 2017 , compensation for a change in life assurance beneﬁt. The value of the company car cash allowance is £18,000.  
The 2016 ﬁgure for David Fischel has been restated by an amount of £2,000 to reﬂect a change in HMRC’s valuation of certain beneﬁts.
 — Pension: the value of the Company’s contribution during the year (30 per cent salary supplement in lieu of contributions for the Chief Executive and 24 per cent SIPP 
contribution, part taken as a salary supplement in lieu of SIPP contributions, for the Chief Financial Officer).
 — Annual bonus (cash and deferred): the value at grant of the annual incentive payable for performance over 2017 and 2016 respectively.
 — Performance share plan: awards shown under 2017 comprise awards made in 2013, 2014 and 2015, which have one third subject to three-, four- and ﬁve-year performance 
periods. The amount shown is the amount due to vest in respect of the ﬁrst tranche of the 2015 award, with a three-year performance period to 31 December 2017; the 
second tranche of the 2014 award, with a four-year performance period to 31 December 2017; and the ﬁnal tranche of the 2013 award, with a ﬁve-year performance period to 
2017. Amounts are calculated using a three-month average share price of £2.219. Further information regarding the vesting can be found on page 83. Performance share 
plan awards shown under 2016 comprise the ﬁrst tranche of awards made in 2014, and the second tranche of awards made in 2013. In line with the regulatory requirements, 
these amounts have been restated from the ﬁgures disclosed last year to reﬂect the actual vesting and share price on the date of vesting in May 2017. For 2016, the amounts 
also include the value of dividends accrued during the performance period on the awards vesting, which amounted to £33,470.

80 intu properties plc  Annual report 2017  Performance out-turns and incentives
Annual bonus §
The maximum award for both the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer in 2017 was 120 per cent of salary, of which 50 per cent 
is deferred for two and three years. This will remain unchanged for 2018.
Annual bonus payments are based on pre-determined performance measures. Given the commercial sensitivity, the Remuneration 
Committee provides retrospective disclosure of targets. T wo-thirds is based on adjusted EPS performance in the year, split evenly 
between performance versus budget and prior year ﬁgures. The overall structure ensures that the maximum EPS related bonus  
is only achievable if management outperform against both the Board’s expectations for the year and if there is an increase in EPS  
on the prior year.
The remaining third is based on achievement of strategic and operational objectives against a scorecard of measures. The 
Remuneration Committee considers the objectives carefully each year to align with intu’s strategic objectives, and the objectives 
include quantitatively assessed ﬁnancial and operational measures and milestones. For 2018, the strategic objectives will include 
objectives in the following key areas:
 — performance of assets, including net rental income 
 — digital and the customer experience
 — implementation of strategic priorities, including the Hammerson transaction 
In the event that the recommended all-share offer by Hammerson to acquire intu completes in the year as expected, the bonus 
framework would apply on a part-year basis.
Annual bonus – 2017 out-turn §
Performance against the targets for the 2017 short-term incentive arrangements is given below. As in previous years,  
full retrospective disclosure of ﬁnancial targets is provided.

The strategic objectives in the annual bonus are a key part of the remuneration framework for incentivising and rewarding 
achievements and milestones which are the foundation for value creation in the future. The Committee follows a rigorous process 
in the setting and monitoring of scorecard objectives and then exercises judgement in assessing performance in the key areas 
selected. This includes determination of objectives by reference to the approved Board strategy, quarterly reviews of quantitative 
and qualitative data, and an end of year full review with supporting evidence, to ensure a robust assessment of performance 
against the objectives.

Governance Awards for 2018
Awards for 2018 will be 250 per cent of salary. Awards under the plan vest one-third after each of three, four and ﬁve years.  
A summary of the applicable targets are as follows:
Absolute Total Return (NAV growth per 
share plus dividends) (50% of award)
Total Shareholder Return relative to top-ﬁve UK-listed REITs 
(50% of award)
Minimum vesting (25% of element vesting) 6 per cent per annum TSR in line with the third-ranked company
Full vesting (100% of element vesting) 10 per cent per annum TSR in line with the top-ranked company
Straight line vesting between points Straight line vesting between points, proportionate to  
TSR achieved, with 60% vesting for TSR in line with the 
second-ranked company. Subject to a Committee-operated 
discretionary assessment of underlying ﬁnancial performance
During the year, consideration was given to whether to introduce a further holding period under the performance share plan. The 
Committee believes that the current performance period of three, four and ﬁve years, combined with clawback provisions of one 
year following vesting, already provides strong alignment between the Executive Directors and shareholders, although this position 
will be kept under review.
Malus and clawback
Shares awarded under the deferred bonus plan and the performance share plan are subject to malus provisions. The Committee 
may apply malus at its discretion in circumstances including (but not limited to):
 — a material misstatement of the Company’s audited ﬁnancial results
 — a material failure of risk management by the Company, any Group company or business unit
 — a material breach of any applicable health and safety or environmental regulations by the Company, any Group company or 
business unit
 — serious reputational damage to the Company, any Group company or business unit
 — serious misconduct of the individual
The annual bonus and the performance share plan are also subject to clawback provisions. The Committee may at its discretion seek 
to apply clawback in circumstances of:
 — a material misstatement of the Company’s audited ﬁnancial results where the individual is responsible or accountable (and where 
Executive Directors would always be deemed to have management responsibility)
 — serious misconduct of the individual
Clawback provisions may be applied up to two years following the determination of the annual incentive and up to one further year 
following vesting for awards under the performance share plan. T aking into account the three, four and ﬁve year vesting timescales, 
this means that performance share plan awards may be reclaimed for up to four, ﬁve and six years, respectively, from the date  
of award.
Other share scheme information
The Company operates a share incentive plan (SIP) for all eligible employees, including Executive Directors, who may receive up to 
£3,600 worth of shares as part of their annual bonus arrangements. As part of the SIP arrangements, the Company offers eligible 
employees the opportunity to participate in a ‘partnership’ share scheme, the terms of which are governed by HM Revenue & 
Customs (HMRC) regulations.
In 2016, intu implemented a HMRC approved Sharesave Plan (the intu Retail Services Sharesave Plan), offering a potential savings 
contract of up to £500 a month for a period of three to ﬁve years. Participants are granted an option to acquire ordinary shares in 
intu using the proceeds of their saving contract. The exercise price is set at the time of invitation to apply for the plan, with a discount 
of 10% of the market value. 
The Company operates an employee share ownership plan (ESOP) which has in the past used funds provided to purchase shares 
required under the annual bonus scheme.

84 intu properties plc  Annual report 2017  Impact of recommended all-share offer by Hammerson to acquire intu on Executive Director remuneration
On 6 December 2017 , the recommended all-share offer by Hammerson to acquire intu was announced. In line with the 
remuneration policy, awards granted under the Performance Share Plan will be subject to both pro-rating and an assessment of 
performance. Deferred shares relating to prior bonuses will vest in full. A signiﬁcant portion of the performance share awards are 
not expected to vest. 
David Fischel and Matthew Roberts will be treated as having been served notice of termination on the effective date of the 
transaction. For a two month period they will be on garden leave but available as required to effect an orderly handover. Following 
this they will receive a payment of salary and beneﬁts in lieu of the balance of their notice period, in accordance with the 
remuneration policy and their contractual terms.
Season ticket loan
All employees of the Group are entitled to an interest-free travel season ticket loan which is repaid over the year via deductions from 
salary. Neither David Fischel nor Matthew Roberts received a season ticket or other loan from the Group during 2017 .

Shareholding and share interests §
Executive Directors must build up over time a holding of intu shares with a value equivalent to 200 per cent of salary. The 
Remuneration Committee reviews shareholdings against the requirement on an annual basis to ensure they are met within an 
appropriate timeframe. 
The graph below illustrates the shareholdings of the Executive Directors as a percentage of salary. Note that only actual holdings 
count towards the shareholding requirements. Shares subject to deferral and/or performance conditions have also been shown

FTSE 350 Real Estate
Nine-year Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance
UK real estate is a cyclical sector. Since 2009, a key driver for growth in value within the UK real estate market has been exposure to 
central London properties. As a result of the demerger of Capital & Counties from Liberty International (now intu properties plc) in 
2010, intu’s portfolio does not include properties in central London and intu has therefore not beneﬁted from the uplift experienced 
by those property companies with exposure to London. However, given the cyclical nature of the property sector, we would not 
expect this trend to endure over the long-term cycle.
For additional context, the following two charts have been provided to show intu’s absolute total return (NAV growth plus dividends) 
and total property return (capital value growth adjusted for capex and net income expressed as a percentage of capital employed) 
over the same period. intu’s total property return is shown relative to the IPD monthly retail index. These two charts have been 
provided as growth in these metrics supports the delivery of long-term returns to our shareholders.

Executive Directors
Base salary  
To provide an appropriately 
competitive level of base pay to 
attract and retain talent. 
Reviewed annually.
Salary levels take account of:
 — Size and nature of the responsibilities 
of each role
 — Market pay levels for the role
 — Increases for the rest of the Group
 — The executive’s experience
 — Changes to the size and complexity 
of the Group
 — Implications for total remuneration
 — Overall affordability
 — Individual and Company 
performance
The Committee may award an 
out-of-cycle increase if it considers it 
appropriate.
Base salary increases may be 
applied, taking into account the 
factors considered as part of the 
annual review. There is no maximum 
increase or opportunity.
For new appointments salaries may 
be set at a lower level. In such cases, 
there may be scope for higher than 
usual salary increases in the ﬁrst 
three years as the individual 
progresses in the role.
None.
Pension 
To help provide for an 
appropriate retirement beneﬁt.
The Company operates an  
approved deﬁned contribution  
pension arrangement.
A cash alternative may be offered  
in certain circumstances, for example 
where HMRC statutory limits have  
been reached. 
Company pension contribution (or 
cash alternative) is up to 24 per cent 
of base salary.
The Chief Executive receives an 
additional 6 per cent of salary in 
recognition of the additional value

closure of the deﬁned beneﬁt 
scheme. This amount was 
actuarially determined to be 
cost-neutral to the Company.

Beneﬁts include a car allowance, private 
medical insurance, life assurance and 
long-term sickness insurance. Other

aims to ensure that the total value 
of beneﬁts remains proportionate.
None.

Short-term incentive 
To align annual reward with 
annual performance and to 
support retention and 
alignment with shareholders’ 
interests through signiﬁcant 
deferral of bonus into shares.
intu operates a short-term incentive 
arrangement with a maximum  
individual opportunity.
A proportion of any earned bonus is 
normally deferred in intu shares, vesting 
over two years and three years, subject 
to continued employment.
The Committee awards dividend 
equivalents in respect of dividends over 
the deferral period which may assume 
reinvestment on a cumulative basis.
The Committee has discretion to apply 
malus to unvested deferred bonus 
awards in certain circumstances and 
annual bonus payments may be subject 
to clawback.
Maximum annual opportunity of 
120 per cent of salary.
Executives’ performance is measured 
relative to targets in key ﬁnancial, 
operational and strategic objectives in 
the year.
The measures selected and their 
weightings vary each year according to 
the strategic priorities, however at 
least two thirds will be based on Group 
ﬁnancial measures or quantitative 
reported key performance indicators.
Entry award level for ﬁnancial 
measures is normally between 0 and 
25 per cent of maximum.
Long-term incentives  
To reward good long-term 
decisions which help grow the 
value of intu over a three to 
ﬁve-year horizon and support 
the retention of critical 
executives.
intu operates a PSP , which was approved 
by shareholders at the 2013 AGM.
Grants are made to eligible employees 
at the discretion of the Committee.
Awards can be made as performance 
shares, nil-cost options or jointly owned 
equity, and vest one-third, one-third,  
one-third after three, four and ﬁve  
years respectively.
The Committee awards dividend 
equivalents in respect of dividends over 
the vesting period, which may assume 
reinvestment on a cumulative basis.
The Committee has discretion to apply 
malus and clawback to awards in  
certain circumstances.
Normal maximum grant size of 250 
per cent of salary per annum.
In exceptional circumstances 
opportunity of up to 375 per cent of 
salary. The intention is that this 
ﬂexibility would only be 
contemplated in recruitment 
circumstances.
Long-term incentive performance 
conditions are reviewed on an annual 
basis, and are chosen to be aligned 
with the long-term success of  
the business.
The intention is that measures will be 
one or more of TSR, total return/NAV 
growth, EPS growth, relative total 
property return or return on capital.
For 2017 , awards will be based
 — 50 per cent on relative TSR
 — 50 per cent on total return (NAV 
growth plus dividends)
If the Committee considers that the 
level of vesting based on the extent to 
which the performance conditions 
have been satisﬁed is not a fair 
reﬂection of underlying ﬁnancial 
performance, the Committee may 
adjust the level of vesting (upwards or 
downwards) accordingly. For the 
current performance measures this 
applies to the TSR portion only.
Entry vesting is 25 per cent  
of maximum.
All employee share plans  
To align interests of employees 
with intu’s performance.
Executive Directors may participate in 
HMRC approved share incentive plans 
on the same basis as all employees.
Participants can contribute up to 
the relevant HMRC limit.
None.
Legacy share awards
Payments can also be made to Executive Directors under the legacy share option plan and equivalent jointly owned equity arrangements, which were the 
predecessor arrangements to the current PSP and were approved by shareholders in 1999. Under this plan, market value share option grants were made, 
with vesting based on EPS growth. It is not intended that this plan will be used to grant any future awards to the Executive Directors.

Chief Executive 
Matthew Roberts 
Chief Financial Officer
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the annual report, the 
Directors’ remuneration report and  
the ﬁnancial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors  
to prepare ﬁnancial statements for  
each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the 
Directors have prepared the Group and 
Company ﬁnancial statements in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’s) as adopted 
by the European Union. Under company 
law the Directors must not approve the 
ﬁnancial statements unless they are 
satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and 
the Company and of the proﬁt or loss of 
the Group and Company for that period. 
In preparing these ﬁnancial statements, 
the Directors are required to: 
(a)  select suitable accounting policies  
and then apply them consistently 
(b)  make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent 
(c)  state whether applicable IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union have 
been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained  
in the ﬁnancial statements 
(d)  prepare the ﬁnancial statements on 
the going concern basis, unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business 
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose  
with reasonable accuracy at any time  
the ﬁnancial position of the Company  
and the Group and enable them to ensure 
that the ﬁnancial statements and the

Report on the audit of the financial statements 
Opinion 
In our opinion, intu properties plc’s Group financial statements and Company financial statements (the “financial statements”): 
— give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the Company's affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group's 
profit and the Group's and the Company's cash flows for the year then ended; 
— have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Company's 
financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
— have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report, which comprise: the Group and Company balance 
sheets as at 31 December 2017; the Group consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive  
income, the Group and Company statements of cash flows, and the Group and Company statements of changes in equity for  
the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies. 
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee. 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section 
of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
Independence 
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. 
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not 
provided to the Group or the Company. 
Other than those disclosed in note 8 to the financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the Group or the 
Company in the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017. 
Our audit approach 
Context 
During the year to 31 December 2017, there have been no significant changes to business operations, investment property market 
yields, or to accounting standards relevant to the Group. On 6 December 2017, Hammerson plc made an all-share offer to acquire 
the entire share capital of the Company. The most significant transactional activity was in relation to the acquisition and subsequent 
disposal of a 50% interest in Madrid Xanadú and the agreement to dispose of a 50% interest in intu Chapelfield. Our audit approach  
is largely consistent with the prior year. 
Overview 
 — Overall Group materiality: £107.9m (2016: £103.6m), based on 1% of Total Assets. 
— Overall Company materiality: £38.8m (2016: £39.2m), based on 1% of Total Assets. 
— The Group and Company financial statements are produced by the Group’s central finance department using  
a single, consolidated general ledger, and the whole business was subject to the same audit scope. 
— Valuation of investment and development property. 
— intu Costa del Sol development property. 
— Acquisition of Madrid Xanadú and subsequent 50% disposal. 
— intu Chapelfield – Held for sale (50% disposal).

Financial statements 
The scope of our audit 
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the Group and the industry in which it operates, 
and considered the risk of acts by the Group which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud. We designed 
audit procedures at Group level to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to 
fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, 
forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. We focused on laws and regulations that could give rise to a 
material misstatement in the Group and Company financial statements, including, but not limited to, the Companies Act 2006  
and the UK tax legislation as applicable to a REIT. Our tests included, but were not limited to, review of the financial statement 
disclosures to underlying supporting documentation, review of correspondence with the regulators, enquiries of management,  
and review of internal audit reports in so far as they related to the financial statements. There are inherent limitations in the audit 
procedures described above and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions 
reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it.p 
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk 
of management override of internal controls, including testing journals and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the 
Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation  
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the 
results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by 
our audit. 
Key audit matter  How our audit addressed the key audit matter 
Valuation of Investment and Development Property 
Refer to page 71 (Audit committee report), pages 114 to 115 
(Accounting policies), page 112 (significant use of estimates  
and assumptions) and note 14 to the financial statements. 
The existence of significant estimation uncertainty, coupled with  
the fact that only a small percentage difference in individual property 
valuations, when aggregated, could result in a material change,  
warrants specific audit focus in this area. 
The Group’s Investment and Development Properties are shopping 
centres and development projects and comprise the majority of the 
assets in the Group balance sheet, their carrying value amounting to 
£9.18 billion. 
The valuation of the Group’s property portfolio is inherently subjective 
due to, among other factors, the individual nature of each property, its 
location and the expected future rental revenues for that particular 
property. Moreover, in 2017 there were relatively few relevant UK 
shopping centre transactions against which to compare yield 
assessments. 
The valuations were carried out by third party valuers, CBRE, Knight 
Frank, Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle (the “Valuers”). 
The Valuers were engaged by the Directors, and performed their work  
in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (“RICS”) 
Valuation – Global Standards 2017.  
The Valuers used by the Group are well-known firms, with considerable 
experience of the market in which the Group operates. 
Investment Property – In determining a property’s valuation the 
Valuers take into account property specific current information such  
as the current tenancy agreements and rental income attached to the 
asset. They then apply other assumptions such as yield and current  
 
Assessing the Valuers’ expertise and objectivity 
We assessed the Valuers’ qualifications and expertise and read their 
terms of engagement with the Group to determine whether there  
were any matters that might have affected their objectivity or may  
have imposed scope limitations upon their work. We also considered 
other engagements which might exist between the Group and the 
Valuers. We found no evidence to suggest that the objectivity of any 
Valuer in their performance of the valuations was compromised. 
Data provided to the Valuers – Investment Property 
We carried out procedures, on a sample basis, to test whether property 
specific current information supplied to the Valuers by management 
reflected the underlying property records held by the Group and which 
have been tested during our audit. 
Assumptions and estimates used by the Valuers – Investment Property 
We read the valuation reports for all properties and attended meetings 
with each of the Valuers. Our testing also involved the use of our internal 
real estate valuation experts who are qualified chartered surveyors.  
We confirmed that the valuation approach for each property was in 
accordance with RICS and suitable for use in determining the carrying 
value in the Group balance sheet. 
Our work focused on the largest properties in the portfolio and those 
properties where the assumptions used and/or year-on-year capital 
value movement suggested a possible outlier versus market data for  
the shopping centre sector. We compared the investment yields used  
by the Valuers to an estimated range of expected yields, determined  
via reference to published benchmarks. Whilst there was little directly

market rent, which are influenced by prevailing market yields and 
comparable market transactions, to arrive at the final valuation. Due  
to the unique nature of each shopping centre, the assumptions to  
be applied are determined having regard to the individual property 
characteristics at a granular, unit-by-unit level, as well as considering  
the qualities of the shopping centre as a whole. 
Development Property – Development properties are valued using  
the residual appraisal method (i.e. by estimating the fair value of  
the completed project using the income capitalisation method less 
estimated costs to completion including a market based profit margin 
providing a return on development risk). 
 
comparable transactional based evidence, the disposals of 50% interests 
in intu Chapelfield and Madrid Xanadú, which transacted at amounts 
close to prior valuations, provided support for the investment yields 
being used. 
We also considered the reasonableness of other assumptions that are 
not so readily comparable to published benchmarks, such as Estimated 
Rental Value, void rates and rent-free periods. Finally, we evaluated 
year-on-year movements in capital value with reference to published 
benchmarks. Where assumptions were outside the expected range or 
were otherwise deemed unusual, and/or there were unexpected 
movements, we undertook further investigations and, when necessary, 
held further discussions with the Valuers. 
It was evident from our interaction with management and the Valuers 
and our review of the valuation reports that close attention had been 
paid to each property’s individual characteristics at a granular, unit-by-
unit level, as well as considering the overall quality, geographic location 
and desirability of the asset as a whole. 
Development Property 
In 2017, the principal development property was intu Costa del Sol.  
In relation to this property the Group used external expert reports to 
assist them in arriving at estimated rental cashflows (used for income 
capitalisation) and construction costs assumptions for the development 
appraisal. We carried out procedures, on a sample basis, to test whether 
this property specific information supplied to the Valuers by the Group 
was reasonable and in line with the external expert reports. We also 
considered the reasonableness of market assumptions such as 
investment yields and market based profit margin, involving our  
internal real estate valuation experts. 
Overall findings 
Our procedures indicated that the estimates and assumptions used were 
appropriate in the context of the Group’s investment and development 
property portfolio and reflected recent market transactions and the 
market circumstances as at year end. 
intu Costa del Sol development 
Refer to page 71 (Audit committee report), pages 114 to 115 
(Accounting policies), page 112 (significant use of estimates and 
assumptions) and note 14 to the financial statements. 
Land at Costa del Sol (‘the project’), which was previously held  
at cost as a close approximation of fair value, has been valued at  
31 December 2017 on a development appraisal basis using an 
assumption of obtaining final planning permissions for the project.  
Further, upon achievement of planning permission, intu’s development 
partner, Eurofund, is due an allocation of equity as a consideration for 
services provided in relation to this development project. This has now 
been recognised as an equity settled share-based payment crediting 
equity of the Group. On settlement of the transaction, the credit to 
equity is expected to be transferred to non-controlling interests. 
 
In respect of the assumption in relation to the receipt of the final 
planning permission, we reviewed the approved general planning 
permission as well as legal advice obtained by the Group, which sets  
out the status of planning permissions. Based on this legal advice, 
discussions held with management and the Valuers, we concur that 
planning status is now sufficiently advanced for a development  
appraisal valuation methodology to be appropriate. 
In respect of the equity allocation, we reviewed supporting evidence 
setting out arrangements with Eurofund. As it will be settled in equity of 
a subsidiary of the Group it is deemed appropriate that the transaction is 
treated as an equity settled share-based transaction under IFRS 2, 
‘Share-based payments’. Given the Group currently owns 100% of the 
equity of the subsidiary, it is appropriate to not recognise non-controlling 
interests in the current financial year. 
Acquisition of Madrid Xanadú and subsequent 50% disposal 
Refer to page 71 (Audit committee report), pages 113 and 116 
(Accounting policies), page 112 (significant areas of judgement)  
and notes 16, 33 and 34 to the financial statements. 
On 10 March 2017, intu acquired the Madrid Xanadú shopping  
centre from Ivanhoe Cambridge Inc. The acquisition was accounted  
for as a business combination. 
 
With respect to the acquisition, we inspected the purchase agreements 
and assessed whether the classification as a business combination and 
treatment of the various aspects of the transaction were in accordance 
with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’. 
We carried out procedures to assess the fair value of the consideration 
and of the assets and liabilities being acquired, the most significant being 
the investment property – for which we reviewed the Valuers’ report 
valuing the property on the date of acquisition involving our internal real 
estate valuation experts.

Key audit matter  How our audit addressed the key audit matter 
On 26 May 2017, intu exchanged contracts with TH Real Estate, on 
behalf of its European Cities Fund, to form a 50/50 joint venture in 
relation to Madrid Xanadú. On 31 July 2017, following receipt of the 
regulatory approvals, the transaction completed. 
 
With respect to the disposal, we read the sale and purchase agreement 
and other documents related to the sale to determine whether it was 
appropriate to account for Madrid Xanadú as a joint venture. No issues 
arose from these procedures – the shareholders’ agreement grants each 
party an equal number of board members all with equal voting rights 
and, because all decisions about the relevant activities of the business 
require the consent of both parties, Madrid Xanadú was deemed to be 
subject to joint control. We also considered the financial statement 
disclosures in respect of the initial acquisition and the subsequent part 
disposal and concluded that they are in accordance with applicable 
accounting standards (IFRS 3 ‘Business combinations’ and IFRS 12 
‘Disclosure of interests in other entities’). 
intu Chapelfield – Held for sale (50% disposal) 
Refer to page 71 (Audit committee report), page 116 (Accounting 
policies), page 112 (significant areas of judgement) and note 35 to the 
financial statements. 
In November 2017, intu announced the disposal of a 50% interest in  
intu Chapelfield creating a joint venture with LaSalle Investment 
Management (on behalf of Greater Manchester Pension Fund and  
West Yorkshire Pension Fund – ‘the purchaser’). 
As at 31 December 2017, contracts had been exchanged, but the 
completion of the transaction was subject to EU merger clearance.  
The assets and liabilities relating to intu Chapelfield have therefore  
been classified as ‘Held for sale’. 
 
We have inspected the agreement entered into with the purchaser  
and note the completion was subject to the necessary EU merger 
clearance which has subsequently been received on 11 January 2018. 
The classification of 100% of the disposal group as ‘Held for sale’ in  
the 31 December 2017 Group Balance Sheet is consistent with the 
requirements of IFRS 5 ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations’. 
We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the Company to communicate in our report. 
How we tailored the audit scope 
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company, the accounting processes and controls, 
and the industry in which they operate. 
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
Although the Group has some interests in shopping centre operations outside the UK and the Group is structured as two operating 
segments, it operates a single reporting process with a centralised accounting function, therefore the whole business was subject to 
the same audit scope. The Group and Company financial statements are produced using numbers which are maintained on a single, 
consolidated trial balance, by the Group’s finance department. The majority of the underlying accounting records are maintained on 
the Group’s single general ledger. 
For Manchester Arndale, Cribbs Causeway, Centaurus Retail Park and St David’s, Cardiff rental income and property expense 
numbers are submitted quarterly by external property managers to the Group’s finance department, who then review and enter  
the numbers onto the Group’s general ledger. We perform tests of controls over the review of the quarterly submissions and entry 
onto the Group’s general ledger, and tests of details over the numbers within those submissions. 
Quarterly submissions are also submitted to the Group’s finance department for intu Asturias, Puerto Venecia and Madrid Xanadú, 
by the intu Spain finance team. We carry out controls testing over these submissions in the same manner as for the UK submissions 
as above. We instructed the PwC Spain audit team to perform specified substantive procedures on the submission packs prepared 
by intu Spain, and held regular discussions with PwC Spain throughout the planning and execution phases of the audit. We assessed 
the findings of the work performed by them in order to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained 
as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole. 
Materiality 
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.  
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of 
our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, 
both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: 
 Group financial statements Company financial statements 
 Overall materiality Specific materiality Overall materiality 
Materiality level £107.9m (2016: £103.6m). £9.8m (2016: £9.7m). £38.8m (2016: £39.2m). 
How we determined it 1% of Total Assets. 5% of Underlying Earnings Before 
Tax and Associates. 
1% of Total Assets. 
Rationale for benchmark applied In arriving at this judgement we 
have had regard to the carrying 
value of the Group’s assets, 
acknowledging that the primary 
measurement attribute of the 
Group is the carrying value of 
investment property. This 
represents a consistent year-on-year 
basis for determining materiality. 
We have applied this lower 
materiality to line items that make 
up underlying earnings before tax 
and associates, plus other finance 
costs, on the basis that they merit 
more detailed audit work than the 
overall materiality level would 
require, given heightened focus 
from users of the accounts. We 
have used underlying earnings 
before tax and associates as a more 
consistent benchmark, which is not 
impacted by valuation movements. 
In arriving at this judgement we 
have had regard to the carrying 
value of the Company’s assets, 
acknowledging that the primary 
measurement attribute of the 
Company is the carrying value  
of its investment in subsidiaries.  
This represents a consistent  
year-on-year basis for determining 
materiality. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £10.8 million 
(Group audit) (2016: £10.3 million) and £3.8m (Company audit) (2016: £3.9m) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, 
in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. 
Going concern 
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows: 
Reporting obligation Outcome 
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention to in respect of  
the Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the Directors considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements and 
the Directors’ identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and the Company’s ability  
to continue as a going concern over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval  
of the financial statements. 
We have nothing material to add or to  
draw attention to. However, because  
not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee 
as to the Group’s and Company’s ability  
to continue as a going concern. 
We are required to report if the Directors’ statement relating to Going Concern in accordance with 
Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit. 
We have nothing to report. 
Reporting on other information  
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ 
report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this 
report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,  
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, 
we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or  
a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a  
material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on  
these responsibilities. 
With respect to the Strategic Report, Directors’ Report and Corporate Governance Statement, we also considered whether the 
disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 (CA06), 
ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as 
described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated). 
  
102 intu properties plc  Annual report 2017

Financial statements 
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements. (CA06) 
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06) 
Corporate Governance Statement 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Corporate Governance 
Statement (on pages 60 to 96) about internal controls and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes  
and about share capital structures in compliance with rules 7.2.5 and 7.2.6 of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules 
sourcebook of the FCA (“DTR”) is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable 
legal requirements. (CA06) 
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we did not identify any material misstatements in this information. (CA06) 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Corporate Governance 
Statement (on pages 60 to 96) with respect to the Company’s corporate governance code and practices and about its 
administrative, management and supervisory bodies and their committees complies with rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3 and 7.2.7 of the  
DTR. (CA06) 
We have nothing to report arising from our responsibility to report if a corporate governance statement has not been prepared  
by the Company. (CA06) 
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or 
liquidity of the Group 
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding: 
— The Directors’ confirmation on pages 38 and 39 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. 
— The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated. 
— The Directors’ explanation on page 70 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over  
what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they  
have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. 
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially 
less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process supporting their 
statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code  
(the “Code”); and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the Group and 
Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules) 
Other Code Provisions 
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when: 
— The statement given by the Directors, on page 96, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced  
and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s and Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and Company obtained in 
the course of performing our audit. 
— The section of the Annual Report on pages 71 to 75 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee. 
— The Directors’ statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a 
relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors. 
Directors’ Remuneration 
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. (CA06)

Financial statements 104 
Independent auditors’ report to the  
members of intu properties plc continued 
intu properties plc Annual report 2017 
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities set out on page 96, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation  
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative  
but to do so. 
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance  
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually  
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.  
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report. 
Use of this report 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
Other required reporting 
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
— we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or 
— adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or 
— certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
— the Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement  
with the accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Appointment 
On its formation, we were appointed as auditors of Liberty International plc (the Company's predecessor) for the year ended  
31 December 1999 and subsequent financial periods. Our predecessor firm were auditors of the pre-existing Group, prior to group 
restructurings and renamings, for the period ended 31 December 1980 and subsequent financial periods. Considering this, the 
period of total uninterrupted engagement with the Group is at least 37 years, covering the period ended 31 December 1980 to  
the year ended 31 December 2017.

Notes to the financial statements 
 
intu properties plc Annual report 2017 
1 Accounting convention and basis of preparation 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (IFRS), interpretations issued by 
the International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations 
Committee and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention as modified by the 
revaluation of property, available-for-sale investments and 
certain other assets and liabilities that have been measured  
at fair value. A summary of the significant accounting policies 
applied is set out in note 2. 
These accounting policies are consistent with those applied  
in the last annual financial statements, as amended when 
relevant to reflect the adoption of new standards, amendments 
and interpretations which became effective in the year.  
These amendments have resulted in changes to financial 
statement disclosures.  
A number of standards and amendments to standards have 
been issued but are not yet effective for the current year.  
The most significant of these are set out below: 
— IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective from 1 January 2018) 
– The standard applies to classification and measurement  
of financial assets and financial liabilities, impairment 
provisioning and hedge accounting. The Group has 
completed its impact assessment of the standard in which 
the main areas of impact have been identified as impairment 
provisioning in respect of trade receivables and other 
financial assets as well as the accounting treatment on  
the derecognition of other investments. The impairment 
provisioning approach has been refined in accordance  
with the new accounting standard to reflect the expected 
collection of trade receivables; however, no material 
quantitative differences have been identified from the 
impairment provisioning in accordance with the previous 
accounting standard. In respect of other investments, the 
Group will make an irrevocable election to recognise 
movements in other investments through other 
comprehensive income, consistent with current accounting 
treatment. Under IFRS 9 on sale of other investments, any 
cumulative gains or losses are not reclassified to the income 
statement, but are transferred from other comprehensive 
income to retained earnings. No other changes to existing 
accounting treatments are required 
— IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective 
from 1 January 2018) – The standard is applicable to service 
charge income and facilities management income, but 
excludes lease rental income arising from contracts with  
the Group's tenants. The Group has completed its impact 
assessment of the standard and assessed all significant 
revenue streams from which there were no changes to 
existing accounting treatments. The Group will continue  
to assess new transactions as they arise or as immaterial 
revenue streams become material 
— IFRS 16 Leases (effective 1 January 2019) – This standard 
does not significantly affect the current accounting for rental 
income earned. The Group holds a number of small operating 
leases as lessee which are affected by this standard; however, 
these are not material to the financial statements  
– significant estimates and judgements 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with the 
Group’s accounting policies requires management to make 
judgements and use estimates that affect the reported amounts 
of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the 
reporting period. Although these judgements and estimates are 
based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event 
or action, the actual result ultimately may differ from those 
judgements and estimates. 
– significant use of estimates and assumptions 
Valuation of investment and development property – See 
investment and development property accounting policy  
in note 2 as well as note 14 for details on estimates and 
assumptions used in the valuation process and sensitivities. 
Valuation of derivative financial instruments – See derivative 
financial instruments accounting policy in note 2 as well  
as note 28 for details on sensitivities of estimates and  
assumptions used. 
– significant areas of judgement 
Accounting for acquisitions – Management uses significant 
judgement to determine whether an acquisition of property 
should be accounted for as an asset acquisition or a business 
combination. See business combinations accounting policy in 
note 2 as well as further detail on judgements made in note 33. 
Assessing control over joint arrangements – Management uses 
significant judgement to assess control of joint arrangements 
(eg part disposals of subsidiaries). See basis of consolidation in 
note 2 as well as further detail on judgements made in note 34. 
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale – 
Management uses significant judgement to determine whether 
an asset in the process of being disposed of (including part 
disposals) should be classified as an asset held for sale. See 
assets held for sale accounting policy in note 2 as well as  
further detail on judgements made in note 35. 
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the strategic report on pages 6 to 59. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the financial review on 
pages 48 to 53. In addition, note 28 includes the Group’s risk 
management objectives, details of its financial instruments  
and hedging activities, its exposure to liquidity risk and details  
of its capital structure.

1 Accounting convention and basis of preparation 
(continued) 
The Group prepares regular forecasts and projections which 
include sensitivity analysis taking into account a number of 
downside risks to the forecast including reasonably possible 
changes in trading performance and asset values and assesses 
the potential impact of these on the Group’s liquidity position 
and available resources. 
In preparing the most recent projections, factors taken into 
account include £278.2 million of cash (including the Group’s 
share of cash in joint ventures of £50.2 million) and £406.9 
million of undrawn facilities at 31 December 2017. The Group’s 
weighted-average debt maturity of 6.6 years and the relatively 
long-term and stable nature of the cash flows receivable under 
tenant leases were also factored into the forecasts.  
After reviewing the most recent projections and the sensitivity 
analysis, the Directors consider it appropriate to continue to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
Group’s financial statements. 
2 Accounting policies – Group and Company 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial information includes the Company 
and its subsidiaries and their interests in joint arrangements  
and associates. 
All intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains  
on transactions between Group companies are eliminated  
on consolidation. 
– subsidiaries 
A subsidiary is an entity which the Company controls. Control 
exists when the Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability 
to affect those returns through its power over the investee. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which 
control is transferred to the Group and are de-consolidated  
from the date that control ceases. 
The Company’s investment in Group companies is carried at 
cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
– joint arrangements 
A joint arrangement is an arrangement over which two or  
more parties have joint control. Joint control is the contractually 
agreed sharing of control of an arrangement where decisions 
about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of 
the parties sharing joint control. 
A joint operation is a joint arrangement where the parties that 
have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, 
and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. 
The Group’s interest in a joint operation is accounted for by 
consolidating the Group’s share of the assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses on a line-by-line basis. 
A joint venture is a joint arrangement where the parties that 
have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net 
assets of the arrangement. 
The Group’s interest in a joint venture is accounted for using  
the equity method as described below. 
– associates 
An associate is an entity over which the Company, either directly 
or indirectly, is in a position to exercise significant influence. 
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial 
and operating policies of the entity but is not control or joint 
control of those policies.  
The Group’s interest in an associate is accounted for using the 
equity method as described below. 
– the equity method 
Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint 
ventures and associates are initially recognised at cost and 
adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the  
post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in other 
comprehensive income. Loan balances relating to long-term 
funding from Group companies to joint ventures and associates 
are presented on the face of the balance sheet as part of  
the investment. 
– non-controlling interest 
A non-controlling interest is the equity in a subsidiary not 
attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company. Non-
controlling interests are presented within equity, separately 
from the amounts attributable to owners of the Company. 
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive 
income is attributed to owners of the Company and to non-
controlling interests in the appropriate proportions. 
Foreign currencies 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the  
Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which it operates. The consolidated 
financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is 
the Group’s presentational currency. 
The assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated into 
pounds sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the reporting 
date and their income statement and cash flows are translated 
at the average rate for the period. Exchange differences arising 
are recorded in other comprehensive income. 
At entity level, transactions in currencies other than an entity’s 
functional currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing 
at the transaction dates. Foreign exchange gains and losses 
resulting from settlement of these transactions and from 
retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated  
in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement 
except if they relate to hedging of net investments in a foreign 
operation or for loans to foreign subsidiary entities considered  
to be part of the net investment in those entities, in which case 
these amounts are recorded in other comprehensive income.

2 Accounting policies – Group and Company (continued) 
Revenue recognition 
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can 
be reliably measured and it is probable that future economic 
benefits will flow to the Group. 
Rental income receivable is recognised on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the lease. 
Contingent rents, being those lease payments that are 
dependent on unknown future events, the most significant 
being incremental rents linked to tenant revenues or increases 
arising on rent reviews, are recorded as income in the periods  
in which they are earned. In respect of rents linked to tenant 
revenues, where information is not available, management  
uses estimates based on knowledge of the tenant and past  
data. Rent reviews are recognised as income from the date of 
the rent review, based on management’s estimates. Estimates 
are derived from knowledge of market rents for comparable 
properties determined on an individual property basis and 
updated for progress of negotiations. 
Directly attributable lease incentives are recognised within 
rental income on the same basis as the underlying lease income. 
Service charge income, facilities management income and 
management fees are recognised on an accruals basis in line 
with the service being provided. 
Dividend income 
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive 
payment has been established. 
Share-based payments 
The cost of granting share options and other share-based 
remuneration is recognised through the income statement with 
reference to the fair value of the equity instrument, assessed at 
the date of grant. This cost is charged to the income statement 
over the vesting period of the awards. All awards are accounted 
for as equity settled with the credit entry being taken directly to 
equity. For awards with non-market related criteria, the charge 
is reversed if it is expected that the performance criteria will  
not be met. 
For share options an option pricing model is used applying 
assumptions around expected yields, forfeiture rates, exercise 
price and volatility. Where the share awards have non-market 
related performance criteria the Group has used the Black-
Scholes option valuation model to establish the relevant  
fair values. Where the share awards have a market-related 
performance criteria the Group has used the Monte Carlo 
simulation valuation model to establish the relevant fair values. 
Investments held in the Company’s own shares in connection 
with employee share plans and other share-based payment 
arrangements are accounted for as treasury shares. For more 
detail see treasury shares accounting policy. 
Interest income 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the 
principal outstanding and the effective interest rate. 
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are those items that in the Directors’ view are 
required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size, nature 
or incidence. Underlying earnings is considered to be a key 
measure in understanding the Group’s financial performance, 
and excludes exceptional items. Underlying earnings are 
explained further in the financial review on page 48 and 
reconciled in note 12(c). 
Taxation 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income 
for the year and any adjustment in respect of prior years. It is 
calculated using rates applicable at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method 
providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the 
amounts used for tax purposes. 
Temporary differences are not provided on: goodwill not 
deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets or 
liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and 
differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent 
that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date  
and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset  
is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that 
management believe it is probable that future taxable profit  
will be available against which the temporary differences  
can be utilised. 
Tax is included in the income statement except when it relates 
to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income or 
equity, in which case the related tax is also recognised directly  
in other comprehensive income or equity. 
Investment and development property 
Investment and development property is owned or leased  
by the Group and held for long-term rental income  
and capital appreciation. 
The Group has elected to use the fair value model. Properties 
are initially recognised at cost and subsequently revalued at the 
balance sheet date to fair value as determined by professionally 
qualified external valuers on the basis of market value with the 
exception of certain development land where an assessment  
of fair value may be made internally. External valuations are 
received for significant development land once required 
planning permissions are obtained. Valuations conform with  
the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Valuation – 
Global Standards 2017. 
The main estimates and assumptions underlying the valuations 
are described in note 14.

115
Financial statements 
2 Accounting policies – Group and Company (continued) 
Properties held under leases are stated gross of the recognised 
finance lease liability. 
The cost of investment and development property includes 
capitalised interest and other directly attributable outgoings 
incurred during development. Interest is capitalised on the  
basis of the average interest rate on the relevant debt 
outstanding. Interest ceases to be capitalised on the date  
of practical completion. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of 
investment and development property are recognised 
in the income statement. 
Depreciation is not provided in respect of investment and 
development property. 
Gains or losses arising on the sale of investment and 
development property are recognised when the significant risks 
and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. 
The gain or loss recognised is the proceeds received less the 
carrying value of the property and costs directly associated 
with the sale. 
Leases 
Leases are classified as a finance or operating lease according  
to the substance of the transaction. A lease that transfers 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee 
is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are normally 
classified as operating leases. 
– Group as lessee 
Leases of investment property are accounted for as finance 
leases and recognised as an asset and an obligation to pay 
future minimum lease payments. The investment property  
asset is included in the balance sheet at fair value, gross of  
the recognised finance lease liability. Contingent rents are 
recognised as they accrue. 
Other finance lease assets are capitalised at the lower of  
the fair value of the leased asset or the present value of the 
minimum lease payments and depreciated over the shorter  
of the lease term and the useful life of the asset. 
Lease payments are allocated between the liability and finance 
charges so as to achieve a constant financing rate. 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
– Group as lessor 
Investment properties are leased to tenants under operating 
leases, with rental income being recognised on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term. For more detail see the revenue 
recognition accounting policy. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on business combinations is carried at cost  
less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is assessed for 
impairment on an annual basis. 
Plant and equipment 
Plant and equipment consists of vehicles, fixtures, fittings  
and other equipment. Plant and equipment is stated at cost  
less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated 
impairment losses. 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-
line basis over an asset’s estimated useful life up to a maximum 
of five years. 
Other investments 
Available-for-sale investments, being investments intended to 
be held for an indefinite period, are initially and subsequently 
measured at fair value. For listed investments, fair value is the 
current bid market value at the reporting date. For unlisted 
investments where there is no active market, fair value is 
assessed using an appropriate methodology. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are included  
in other comprehensive income, except to the extent that  
losses are considered to represent a permanent impairment,  
in which case they are recognised in the income statement. 
Upon disposal, accumulated fair value adjustments are 
reclassified from other comprehensive income to the  
income statement. 
Impairment of assets 
The Group’s assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to 
determine whether events or changes in circumstances exist 
that indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
If such an indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is 
estimated. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s 
fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. An impairment 
loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by 
which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are 
grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately 
identifiable cash flows. 
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews whether there is 
any indication that an impairment loss recognised in previous 
periods may have decreased. If such an indication exists the 
asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss 
recognised in prior periods is reversed if, and only if, there has 
been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s 
recoverable amount. In this case the asset’s carrying amount  
is increased to its recoverable amount but not exceeding the 
carrying amount that would have been determined had no 
impairment loss been recognised. The reversal of an impairment 
loss is recognised in the income statement. No impairment 
reversals are permitted to be recognised on goodwill. 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
The Directors exercise judgement as to the collectability of 
trade receivables and determine if it is appropriate to impair 
these assets. Factors such as days past due, credit status  
of the counterparty and historical evidence of collection  
are considered.

Notes to the financial statements continued 
 
intu properties plc Annual report 2017 
2 Accounting policies – Group and Company (continued) 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits with 
banks, whether restricted or unrestricted, and other short-term 
liquid investments with original maturities of three months  
or less. 
Trade payables 
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
Pensions 
The costs of defined contribution schemes and contributions  
to personal plans are charged to the income statement in the 
year in which they are incurred. The Group has no defined 
benefit schemes. 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at their net proceeds on issue 
and subsequently carried at amortised cost with any transaction 
costs, premiums or discounts recognised over the contractual 
life using the effective interest method. This excludes certain 
financial instruments such as convertible bonds as detailed in 
note 26. 
In the event of early repayment, all unamortised transaction 
costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Convertible bonds 
Convertible bonds are assessed on issue, as to whether they 
should be classified as a financial liability, as equity or as a 
compound financial instrument with both debt and equity 
components. This assessment is based on the terms of the bond 
and in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments 
Presentation. Each bond is assessed separately and the  
detailed accounting treatment of each is given in note 26. 
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage 
exposure to interest rate risk. They are initially recognised on  
the trade date at fair value and subsequently re-measured at  
fair value. In assessing fair value the Group uses its judgement  
to select suitable valuation techniques and make assumptions 
which are mainly based on market conditions existing at the 
balance sheet date. The fair value of interest rate swaps is 
calculated by discounting estimated future cash flows based  
on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market 
interest rates for similar instruments at the measurement date. 
These values are tested for reasonableness based upon broker 
or counterparty quotes. 
Amounts paid under interest rate swaps, both on obligations  
as they fall due and on early settlement, are recognised in the 
income statement as finance costs. Fair value movements  
on revaluation of derivative financial instruments are shown 
in the income statement through changes in fair value  
of financial instruments. 
The Group does not currently apply hedge accounting to its 
interest rate swaps. 
Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs 
directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares are 
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 
Dividends 
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable.  
In the case of interim dividends to owners, this is the date of 
payment. In the case of final dividends, this is when declared  
by shareholders at the annual general meeting. 
Treasury shares 
Investments held in the Company’s own shares are deducted 
from equity at cost. Where such shares are subsequently sold, 
any consideration received is recognised directly in equity. 
Current/non-current classification 
Current assets include assets held primarily for trading 
purposes, cash and cash equivalents, and assets expected to be 
realised in, or intended for sale or consumption within one year 
of the reporting date. All other assets are classified as non-
current assets. 
Current liabilities include liabilities held primarily for trading 
purposes, associated with assets held for sale and expected to 
be settled within one year from the reporting date. All other 
liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities. 
Business combinations 
Business combinations are accounted for in accordance with 
IFRS 3 Business Combinations using the acquisition method of 
accounting. The consideration for the acquisition of a subsidiary 
is the total of the fair values of the assets transferred, the 
liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. 
The consideration includes the fair value of any asset or liability 
resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Costs 
associated with the acquisition are expensed as incurred. 
Identifiable assets and liabilities assumed in a business 
combination are measured initially at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. 
Goodwill arising on an acquisition is the excess of the 
consideration over the fair value of the identifiable assets and 
liabilities acquired. Where the fair value of the identifiable assets 
and liabilities acquired exceeds the consideration this difference 
is recognised in the income statement at the date of  
the acquisition. 
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale 
Non-current assets and corresponding disposal groups are 
classified as held for sale when their carrying amount is to be 
recovered principally through a sale which is considered highly 
probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and 
fair value less costs to sell. Assets and liabilities are separately 
grouped and presented on single lines in the balance sheet.

3 Segmental reporting  
Operating segments are determined based on the strategic and operational management of the Group. The Group is primarily  
a shopping centre-focused business and has two reportable operating segments being the UK and Spain. Although certain areas  
of business performance are reviewed and monitored on a centre-by-centre basis, the operating segments are consistent with  
the strategic and operational management of the Group by the Executive Committee (the chief operating decision makers  
of the Group). 
As mentioned in the financial review, management review and monitor the business primarily on a proportionately consolidated 
basis. As such, the segmental analysis has been prepared on a proportionately consolidated basis. 
The key driver of underlying earnings which is used to measure performance is net rental income. An analysis of net rental income  
is provided below:

(c) Underlying earnings per share 
Underlying earnings per share is a non-GAAP measure but has been presented as it is considered to be a key measure of the  
Group’s recurring performance and an indication of the extent to which dividend payments are supported by underlying operations 
(see underlying profit statement on page 169). It excludes property and derivative movements, exceptional items and related tax. 
The key difference from EPRA earnings, an industry standard comparable measure, relates to adjustments in respect of exceptional 
items where EPRA is prescriptive about the adjustments that can be made. Underlying earnings is defined as an alternative 
performance measure in the financial review on page 48. A reconciliation to EPRA earnings per share is provided within the  
other information section.

NAV per share (diluted, adjusted) is a non-GAAP measure but has been presented as it is considered to be a key measure of the 
Group’s performance. The key difference from EPRA NAV per share, an industry standard comparable measure, is the exclusion of 
interest rate swaps not currently used for economic hedges of debt as, in our view, this better allows management to review and 
monitor the Group’s performance. NAV (diluted, adjusted) is defined as an alternative performance measure in the financial review 
on page 48. A reconciliation to EPRA NAV per share is provided within the other information section.

14 Investment and development property (continued) 
Transfers into and transfers out of the fair value hierarchy levels are recognised on the date of the event or change in circumstances 
that caused the transfer. There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 for investment properties during the year. 
The Group has only one class of investment and development property asset. All the Group’s significant investment and 
development property relates to prime shopping centres which are of a similar nature and share characteristics and risks. 
Valuation process 
It is the Group’s policy to engage independent external valuers to determine the market value of its investment and development 
property at both 30 June and 31 December. The Group provides information to the valuers, including current lease and tenant data 
along with asset-specific business plans. The valuers use this and other inputs including market transactions for similar properties to 
produce valuations (see valuation methodology below). These valuations and the assumptions they have made are then discussed 
and reviewed with the Group’s asset management team and Directors. 
The Group engages independent valuation experts to undertake the Group’s property valuations. A summary of the valuers and the 
value of property assets they have been engaged to value is presented below:

2016 
£m 
Cushman & Wakefield 4,609.6 4,564.4 
CBRE 2,420.8 2,352.9

Jones Lang LaSalle 197.7 – 
Assets not valued externally held at cost 16.3 80.6 
 9,208.4 9,241.8 
In addition to the above, investment properties in the Group’s joint ventures were valued by CBRE, Cushman & Wakefield,  
Knight Frank and Jones Lang LaSalle. 
Assets not valued externally held at cost relate to certain development land. These amounts have been reviewed internally and it 
has been concluded that the cost is the appropriate carrying value and so no valuation adjustment is needed. As the developments 
advance these will be valued by independent external valuers. 
In respect of the intu Costa del Sol development site near Málaga, Spain, as the General Plan of Torremolinos was approved in 
the year, with the remaining consents expected in the coming months, the Group obtained an independent external valuation at 
31 December 2017 as cost is no longer an appropriate approximation of fair value. The valuation is based on the assumption that 
planning approval is in place at the valuation date. 
Valuation fees are a fixed amount agreed between the Group and the valuers in advance of the valuation and are not linked to the 
valuation output.  
Valuation methodology 
The fair value of the Group’s investment and development property at 31 December 2017 was determined by independent  
external valuers at that date other than certain development land as detailed above. The valuations are in accordance with the 
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Valuation – Global Standards 2017 and were arrived at by reference to market 
transactions for similar properties and rent profiles. Fair values for investment properties are calculated using the present value 
income approach. The main assumptions underlying the valuations are in relation to rent profile and yields as discussed below. 
The key driver of the property valuations is the terms of the leases in place at the valuation date. These determine the majority of 
the cash flow profile of the property for a number of years and therefore form the base of the valuation. The valuation assumes 
adjustments from these rental values in place at the valuation date to current market rent at the time of the next rent review 
(where a typical lease allows only for upward adjustment) and as leases expire and are replaced by new leases. The current market 
level of rent is assessed based on evidence provided by the most recent relevant leasing transactions and negotiations. This is based 
on evidence available at the date of valuation and does not assume future increases in market rent. 
The nominal equivalent yield is applied as a discount rate to the rental cash flows which, after taking into account other input 
assumptions such as vacancies and costs, generates the market value of the property. The nominal equivalent yield applied is 
assessed by reference to market transactions for similar properties and takes into account, amongst other things, any risks 
associated with the rent uplift assumptions.

14 Investment and development property (continued) 
In respect of development valuations, deductions are then made for anticipated costs, including an allowance for developer’s profit 
and any other assumptions before arriving at a valuation. 
Annual property income as disclosed in the following table reflects current annualised gross income. 
The net initial yield is calculated as the current net income over the gross market value of the asset and is used as a sense check and 
to compare against market transactions for similar properties. 
Full definitions of nominal equivalent yield, annual property income and net initial yield are provided in the glossary. 
The valuation output, inputs and assumptions are reviewed to ensure that they are in line with those of market participants. 
A significant change in the nominal equivalent yield of investment property in isolation would result in a significant change in the 
value of investment and development property. A decrease in nominal equivalent yield of 50 basis points would result in an increase 
in the total market value of £1,055.5 million (31 December 2016: £1,062.9 million), while a 50 basis point increase would result in  
a decrease in the total market value of £806.5 million (31 December 2016: £834.9 million). Additionally, development property is 
sensitive to income, cost and developer’s profit assumptions included in the valuations. 
The tables below provide details of the assumptions used in the valuation of the core portfolio and key unobservable inputs:

The impairment reversal in the year and charge in prior year are principally the result of property valuation movements seen in the 
relevant subsidiaries. The valuation of investment and development property is a significant estimate as referenced in note 1. 
Impairment is assessed by comparing the carrying value against the underlying assets and liabilities of the respective subsidiaries. 
Details of related undertakings are provided in note 38.

17 Joint operations 
The Group’s interests in Cribbs Causeway and Manchester Arndale are accounted for as joint operations. The Group holds 50 per 
cent beneficial interests in the relevant freehold or leasehold of these properties. Each joint arrangement is governed by a Trust 
Deed giving each party rights to income and obligations for expenses in respect of their beneficial interest in the property. The 
management of the property is established under the Trust Deed as being undertaken by an entity jointly controlled by the 
beneficial owners of the property. This entity does not have the right to a share of the income or expenditure from the property, 
other than the receipt of a management fee. Therefore these interests are accounted for as joint operations. The principal place  
of business of both joint operations is England.

Investment in associates comprises a 32.4 per cent holding in the ordinary shares of Prozone Intu Properties Limited (‘Prozone’), a 
listed Indian shopping centre developer, and a 26.8 per cent holding in the ordinary shares of Empire Mall Private Limited (‘Empire’). 
Both companies are incorporated in India. 
As required by IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, the equity method of accounting is applied in accounting  
for the Group’s investments in Prozone and Empire. The results for the year to 30 September have been used as 31 December 
information is not available in time for these financial statements. Those results are adjusted to be in line with the Group’s 
accounting policies and include the most recent property valuations, determined at 30 September 2017, by independent 
professionally qualified external valuers in line with the valuation methodology described in note 14. 
The market price per share of Prozone at 31 December 2017 was INR72 (31 December 2016: INR35), valuing the Group’s interest  
at £41.1 million (31 December 2016: £20.3 million) compared to the carrying value of £45.1 million (31 December 2016: £45.5 
million). As the share price of Prozone is lower than its carrying value, a review of the carrying value has been undertaken. The net 
assets of Prozone principally comprise investment property which is held at fair value within the investment in associates line. As 
with other Group investment property, it is subject to independent valuation to fair value and that valuation reflects the future cash 
flows expected to be generated from those assets. As such the net asset carrying value recorded in the Group’s financial statements 
is deemed to be a reasonable approximation of the value in use of the business and so no adjustment to that carrying value is 
considered necessary.

Analysis of the Group’s net external debt is provided in the other information section. 
The Group substantially eliminates its interest rate exposure to floating rate debt through interest rate swaps as described in  
note 28. 
The market value of investment property secured, either directly or indirectly, as collateral against borrowings at 31 December 
2017 is £9,802.2 million including £1,001.0 million of investment property held within joint ventures (2016: £9,763.6 million 
including £731.9 million held within joint ventures). In most circumstances the Group can realise up to 50 per cent without 
restriction providing the Group continues to manage the asset. Realising an amount in excess of this would trigger a change of 
control and mandatory repayment of the facility. 
The fair values of fixed rate borrowings and CMBS are assessed based on quoted market prices, and as such are categorised as  
Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy (see note 28 for definition). The fair values of unlisted floating rate borrowings are equal to their 
carrying values.

26 Convertible bonds 
2.875 per cent convertible bonds (‘the 2.875 per cent bonds’) 
On 1 November 2016 Intu (Jersey) 2 Limited (the ‘Issuer’) issued £375.0 million 2.875 per cent Guaranteed Convertible Bonds due  
2022 at par, all of which remain outstanding at 31 December 2017. At 31 December 2017 the exchange price was £3.7506 per ordinary 
share. intu properties plc has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the due and punctual performance by the Issuer of all of its 
obligations (including payments) in respect of the 2.875 per cent bonds and the obligations of the Company, as guarantor, constitute 
direct, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Company. 
Subject to certain conditions, the 2.875 per cent bonds are convertible into preference shares of the Issuer which are automatically 
transferred to the Company in exchange for ordinary shares in the Company or (at the Company’s election) any combination of 
ordinary shares and cash. The 2.875 per cent bonds can be converted at any time from the date which is 180 days prior to the  
Final Maturity Date of 1 November 2022, to the 20th dealing date prior to the Final Maturity Date. 
The initial exchange price was £3.7506 per ordinary share, a conversion rate of approximately 26,662 ordinary shares for every 
£100,000 nominal of the 2.875 per cent bonds. Under the terms of the 2.875 per cent bonds, the exchange price is adjusted upon 
certain events including the payment of dividends by the Company over a certain threshold.  
The 2.875 per cent bonds may be redeemed at par at the Company’s option subject to the Company’s ordinary share price having 
traded at 30 per cent above the conversion price for a specified period, or at any time once 85 per cent by nominal value of the 
2.875 per cent bonds originally issued have been converted or cancelled. If not previously converted, redeemed or purchased  
and cancelled, the 2.875 per cent bonds will be redeemed at par on 1 November 2022. 
The 2.875 per cent bonds are designated as at fair value through profit or loss and so are presented on the balance sheet at  
fair value with all gains and losses taken to the income statement through the change in fair value of financial instruments line.  
At 31 December 2017, the fair value of the 2.875 per cent bonds was £377.3 million (2016: £362.4 million), with the change in  
fair value reflected in note 9. The 2.875 per cent bonds are listed on the Channel Islands Securities Exchange and the Open Market 
(Freiverkehr) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. 
During the year interest of £10.8 million (2016: £1.8 million) in respect of these bonds has been recognised within finance costs. 
In the Company’s balance sheet the bondholder option is held at its fair value of £28.3 million as a derivative financial instrument 
(2016: £0.5 million). 
2.5 per cent convertible bonds (‘the 2.5 per cent bonds’) 
On 4 October 2012 Intu (Jersey) Limited (the ‘Issuer’) issued £300.0 million 2.5 per cent Guaranteed Convertible Bonds due 2018 at 
par, £160.4 million of which remains outstanding at 31 December 2017. At 31 December 2017 the exchange price was £3.1164 per 
ordinary share. intu properties plc has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the due and punctual performance by the Issuer 
of all of its obligations (including payments) in respect of the 2.5 per cent bonds and the obligations of the Company, as guarantor, 
constitute direct, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Company. 
During the year the Group purchased and subsequently cancelled £139.6 million of 2.5 per cent bonds.

Subject to certain conditions, the 2.5 per cent bonds are convertible into preference shares of the Issuer which are automatically 
transferred to the Company in exchange for ordinary shares in the Company or (at the Company’s election) any combination of 
ordinary shares and cash. The 2.5 per cent bonds can be converted at any time from 14 November 2012 up to the 20th dealing  
day before the Final Maturity Date of 4 October 2018. 
The initial exchange price was £4.3752 per ordinary share, a conversion rate of approximately 22,856 ordinary shares for every 
£100,000 nominal of the 2.5 per cent bonds. Under the terms of the 2.5 per cent bonds, the exchange price is adjusted upon certain 
events including the payment of dividends by the Company. 
The 2.5 per cent bonds may be redeemed at par at the Company’s option subject to the Company’s ordinary share price having 
traded at 30 per cent above the conversion price for a specified period, or at any time once 85 per cent by nominal value of the  
2.5 per cent bonds originally issued have been converted or cancelled. If not previously converted, redeemed or purchased and 
cancelled, the 2.5 per cent bonds will be redeemed at par on 4 October 2018. 
The 2.5 per cent bonds are designated as at fair value through profit or loss and so are presented on the balance sheet at fair  
value with all gains and losses taken to the income statement through the change in fair value of financial instruments line.  
At 31 December 2017, the fair value of the 2.5 per cent bonds was £161.0 million (2016: £308.1 million), with the change in fair  
value reflected in note 9. The 2.5 per cent bonds are listed on the Professional Securities Market of the London Stock Exchange. 
During the year interest of £6.7 million (2016: £7.5 million) in respect of these bonds has been recognised within finance costs. 
In the Company’s balance sheet the bondholder option is held at its fair value of £4.9 million as a derivative financial instrument 
(2016: £13.9 million). 
27 Operating leases 
The Group earns rental income by leasing its investment properties to tenants under operating leases. 
In the UK the standard shopping centre lease is for a term of 10 to 15 years. Standard lease provisions include service charge 
payments, recovery of other direct costs and review every five years to market rent. Standard turnover based leases have a turnover 
percentage agreed with each lessee which is applied to a retail unit’s annual sales and any excess between the resulting turnover 
rent and the minimum rent is receivable by the Group.  
The future minimum lease amounts receivable by the Group under non-cancellable operating leases for continuing operations are 
as follows:

The income statement includes £19.0 million (2016: £18.0 million) recognised in respect of contingent rents calculated by reference 
to tenants’ turnover. 
28 Financial risk management 
The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks arising from the Group’s operations being principally market risk (including 
interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk), liquidity risk and credit risk. 
The majority of the Group’s financial risk management is carried out by the Group’s treasury department. The policies for managing 
each of these risks and their impact on the results for the year are summarised below. 
Market risk 
a) Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk comprises both cash flow and fair value risks. Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a 
financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value  
of financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates.

Financial statements 138 
Notes to the financial statements continued 
 
intu properties plc Annual report 2017 
28 Financial risk management (continued) 
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, 
whereas borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. Bank debt is typically issued at 
floating rates linked to LIBOR. Bond debt and other capital market debt is generally issued at fixed rates. 
It is Group policy, and often a requirement of the Group’s lenders, to eliminate substantially all exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
by using floating to fixed interest rate swaps in order to establish certainty over cash flows. Such swaps have the economic effect  
of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates. 
As a consequence, the Group is exposed to market price risk in respect of the fair value of its fixed rate interest rate swaps, as 
discussed in the financial review on pages 48 to 53. 
The table below shows the effects of interest rate swaps on the borrowings profile of the Group:

Net borrowings profile 4,369.8 235.4 3,916.2 550.5 
Interest rate protection  94.9%  87.7% 
1 Borrowings are stated at nominal value and exclude the Metrocentre compound financial instrument and finance leases. At 31 December 2017 they include the £233.8 million 
(2016: £10.0 million) drawn under the revolving credit facility (RCF) which incurs interest at a variable rate. Excluding the revolving credit facility, interest rate protection is  
100 per cent (2016: 87.9 per cent). 
Group policy is to target interest rate protection within the range of 75 per cent to 100 per cent. 
The weighted average rate for interest rate swaps currently effective is 1.71 per cent (2016: 2.35 per cent). 
Unallocated interest rate swaps are excluded from the above calculation. The nominal value of these swaps is £566.7 million  
(2016: £566.7 million). Their fair value of £235.4 million (2016: £253.2 million) is included as a liability in the balance sheet. 
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point increase in the level of interest rates would reduce the liability by £87.6 million  
(2016: £78.5 million) in the fair value of derivatives. The approximate impact of a 50 basis point reduction in the level of interest  
rates would increase the liability by £87.6 million (2016: £78.5 million) in the fair value of derivatives. In practice, a parallel shift in  
the yield curve is highly unlikely. However, the above sensitivity analysis is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from the 
changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve that may occur. Where the fixed rate derivative financial instruments are matched  
by floating rate debt, the overall effect on Group cash flow of such a movement would be very small. 
b) Foreign exchange risk 
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a functional 
currency other than pounds sterling. At 31 December 2017 the exposure is 10.6 per cent of net assets attributable to shareholders 
of the Group (31 December 2016: 7.2 per cent). Once the Eurofund future interest in the share capital of the intu Costa del Sol 
development company concludes, we expect this to reduce to 9.7 per cent, below the Group’s policy of a maximum of 10 per cent. 
The table summarises the Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk:

(2016: £39.8 million) to equity attributable to owners of the Group. The approximate impact of a 10 per cent depreciation in foreign 
exchange rates would be a negative movement of £48.8 million (2016: £32.5 million) to equity attributable to owners of the Group.

28 Financial risk management (continued) 
As part of the strategy to comply with the Group’s policy, the Group is able to borrow part of its RCF in euros, up to €100 million. 
The RCF borrowings denominated in euros have been designated as a hedging instrument (net investment hedge) against the 
Group’s net investment in Spain with the hedged risk being the changes in the euro/pounds sterling spot rate that will result in 
changes in the value of the Group’s net investments in Spain. At 31 December 2017, €100 million (2016: nil) was drawn in euros. 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is managed to ensure that the Group is able to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due. 
Liquidity analysis is conducted to ensure that sufficient headroom is available to meet the Group’s operational requirements and 
committed investments. The Group treasury policy aims to meet this objective by maintaining adequate cash, marketable securities 
and committed facilities. Undrawn borrowing facilities are detailed in note 24. The Group’s policy is to seek to optimise its exposure 
to liquidity risk by balancing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing risk. In effect the Group seeks to borrow for as long 
as possible at the lowest acceptable cost. 
Group policy is to maintain a weighted-average debt maturity of over five years. At 31 December 2017, the maturity profile of 
Group debt showed an average maturity of seven years (2016: seven years). The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its 
borrowings and seeks to avoid bunching of maturities through the regular replacement of facilities and by arranging a selection of 
maturity dates. Refinancing risk may be reduced by doing so prior to the contracted maturity date, effectively switching liquidity  
risk for market risk. 
The tables below set out the maturity analysis of the Group’s financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations 
to make payments of interest and to repay principal. Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate, the rates 
used are those implied by the par yield curve for the relevant currency. Where payment obligations are in foreign currencies, the 
spot exchange rate at the balance sheet date is used.

Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract. Credit risk arises 
primarily from trade receivables but also from the Group’s holdings of assets with counterparties such as cash deposits and 
derivative financial instruments. 
Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed; tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who 
continuously monitor and work with tenants, aiming wherever possible to identify and address risks prior to default. 
Prospective tenants are assessed via a review process, including obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial information,  
which is conducted internally. As a result deposits or guarantees may be obtained. The amount of deposits held as collateral  
at 31 December 2017 is £4.1 million (2016: £4.5 million). 
It is Group policy to calculate any impairment of receivables specifically on each contract. 
The ageing analysis of trade receivables is as follows:

Group 
2016 
£m 
Up to three months 23.1 20.8 
Three to six months 3.3 1.3 
Trade receivables 26.4 22.1 
At 31 December 2017 trade receivables are shown net of provisions totalling £4.5 million (2016: £4.2 million). 
The credit risk relating to cash deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by the Group’s treasury department. 
Relationships are maintained with a number of tier one institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group policy relating  
to limits on the credit ratings of counterparties (between BBB+ and AAA). 
Excessive credit risk concentration is avoided through adhering to authorised limits for all counterparties.

Classification of financial assets and liabilities  
The tables below set out the Group’s accounting classification of each class of financial assets and liabilities and their fair values  
at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016. 
The fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined from observable market prices or estimated using appropriate yield 
curves at 31 December each year by discounting the future contractual cash flows to the net present values. The determination of  
the fair values of borrowings is defined in note 24.

Fair value hierarchy 
Level 1: Valuation based on quoted market prices traded in active markets. 
Level 2: Valuation techniques are used, maximising the use of observable market data, either directly from market prices or derived 
from market prices. 
Level 3: Where one or more significant inputs to valuation are unobservable. Valuations at this level are more subjective and 
therefore more closely managed, including sensitivity analysis of inputs to valuation models. Such testing has not indicated that any 
material difference would arise due to a change in input variables. 
Transfers into and transfers out of the fair value hierarchy levels are recognised on the date of the event or change in circumstances 
that caused the transfer. There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 during the year. 
Valuation techniques for Level 2 hierarchy financial assets and liabilities are presented in the accounting policies.

Capital structure 
The Group seeks to enhance shareholder value both by investing in the business so as to improve the return on investment and by 
managing the capital structure. The capital of the Group consists of equity, debt and compound financial instruments. The Group 
aims to access both debt and equity capital markets with maximum efficiency and flexibility. 
The key ratios used to monitor the capital structure of the Group are the debt to assets ratio and interest cover. The Group’s  
stated medium to long-term preference is for the debt to assets ratio to be within the 40–50 per cent range and interest cover  
to be greater than 1.60x. At 31 December 2017 the debt to assets ratio remains within the preferred range and the interest cover  
ratio continues to be above the preferred level. 
As the Group’s debt is sometimes secured on its interests in joint ventures, these ratios are monitored for the Group including share 
of joint ventures. A reconciliation from the relevant amounts as presented to those including the Group’s share of joint ventures is 
included in the other information section.

29 Deferred tax 
Under IAS 12 Income Taxes, provision is made for the deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the revaluation of assets  
and liabilities at the corporate tax rate expected to apply to the Group at the time the temporary differences are expected to 
reverse. For those UK assets and liabilities benefitting from REIT exemption the relevant tax rate will be 0 per cent (2016: 0 per cent), 
and for other UK assets and liabilities the relevant rate will be 19 per cent if the temporary difference is expected to be realised 
before 1 April 2020 and 17 per cent if it is expected to be realised on or after 1 April 2020 (2016: 20 per cent before 1 April 2017,  
19 per cent before 1 April 2020 and 17 per cent thereafter). For Spanish assets and liabilities the relevant tax rate will be 25 per cent 
(2016: 25 per cent).

At 31 December 2017 24.6 – – (0.9) 23.7 
The net deferred tax provision of £23.7 million arises in respect of the revaluation of development property at intu Costa del Sol, 
partially offset by tax losses in the same company. 
At 31 December 2017, the Group had unrecognised deferred tax assets calculated at a tax rate of 17 per cent (2016: 17 per cent)  
of £43.1 million (2016: £39.7 million) for surplus UK revenue tax losses carried forward, £45.6 million (2016: £45.5 million) for 
temporary differences on derivative financial instruments, £0.5 million (2016: £0.6 million) for temporary differences on capital 
allowances and £5.8 million (2016: £3.4 million) for capital losses. 
On its sale in 2016, the deferred tax provision in respect of the Group’s investment in Equity One was reduced to nil. The revaluation 
of this investment was recognised in reserves and so the deferred tax movements related to it were also recognised in other 
comprehensive income. With the provision reduced to nil, the deferred tax asset on derivative financial instruments and other 
temporary differences could no longer be recognised, and £18.9 million was therefore released to the income statement. 
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 12 Income Taxes, the deferred tax asset has not been recognised on the Group’s balance 
sheet due to uncertainty over the level of profits that will be available in the non-REIT elements of the Group in future periods. 
The Company recognises no deferred tax asset or liability (2016: nil).

Accounting for acquisitions is a significant judgement as referenced in note 1. The Group individually assesses each acquisition to 
determine if it should be accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations. In respect  
of the below acquisitions, the Group has concluded the assets and liabilities acquired constitute a business. They include the 
shopping centre asset itself along with the employees and processes that operate the centre on a day-to-day basis. These inputs 
and processes in turn drive the operation of the centre and the related output for its beneficial owner. As a result, this acquisition  
is to be accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3. 
Acquisition during 2017 
On 10 March 2017 the Group acquired 100 per cent interests in three entities, which together own and manage Madrid Xanadú 
shopping centre, for total cash consideration of €517.3 million (£453.9 million). The cash flow statement outflow of £446.7 million 
reflects the £453.9 million less the unrestricted cash acquired of £7.2 million. Acquisition related costs of £1.3 million were incurred 
and recognised in the income statement in exceptional administration expenses during the year. 
The fair value of assets and liabilities acquired, at 100 per cent, are set out in the table below:

Total liabilities   (99.0) 
Net assets   372.8 
Fair value of consideration paid   453.9 
Goodwill on acquisition of business   81.1 
The fair value of the consideration is greater than the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired, resulting in goodwill of  
£81.1 million being recognised on acquisition. The goodwill balance is primarily attributable to the recognition of a deferred tax 
balance which is required to be recorded in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes but has not been taken into account as part  
of the purchase price as it is not expected to be realised. 
From the date of acquisition to the end of the year, the acquired subsidiaries and subsequent joint venture interest (see note 34) 
contributed £13.2 million of revenue and £3.1 million of profit to the Group. 
Had the entities been acquired on 1 January 2017, the Group would have reported revenue of £622.9 million and profit of £206.0 
million for the year.

Acquisition during 2016 
On 22 June 2016 the Group acquired the remaining 50 per cent of intu Merry Hill for total consideration of £409.7 million. Following 
this transaction intu Merry Hill has ceased to be accounted for as a joint venture and is now a subsidiary of the Group. The cash  
flow statement outflow of £405.5 million reflects the £409.7 million less the unrestricted cash acquired of £4.2 million. Acquisition 
related costs of £1.0 million were incurred and recognised in the income statement in exceptional administration expenses during 
the year. 
The fair value of assets and liabilities acquired, at 100 per cent, are set out in the table below:

Net assets   889.3

Gain on acquisition of business   34.6 
The fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired exceeded the fair value of the consideration and as a result a gain of £34.6 million 
was recognised in the income statement on acquisition. With a motivated seller, we were able as manager and owner of the other 
50 per cent interest to conclude the transaction at a value lower than the independent market value. 
The fair value of consideration paid included the cash consideration for the acquired 50 per cent interest of £409.7 million and the 
fair value of intu’s existing interest of £445.0 million. There were no material differences between the carrying value and fair value  
of intu’s existing joint venture interest at acquisition. 
From 22 June 2016, the date on which the acquired entities joined the Group as subsidiaries, they contributed £28.5 million to  
the revenue of the Group (acquired 50 per cent contribution: £14.2 million) and contributed £13.5 million of profit in the period. 
Had the entities been acquired on 1 January 2016, the Group would have reported revenue of £650.0 million and profit of £170.9 
million for the year.

On 31 July 2017 the Group sold 50 per cent of its interest in Xanadú Retail and Leisure S.L.U., a wholly owned subsidiary, to TH Real 
Estate for total consideration of €131.7 million (£117.9 million) before expenses of £1.0 million. Xanadú Retail and Leisure S.L.U. 
owns, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Madrid Xanadú. Following this transaction Madrid Xanadú has ceased to be accounted 
for as a subsidiary and is now a joint venture. Therefore the assets and liabilities of Madrid Xanadú are no longer recorded at 100 per 
cent in the Group’s balance sheet but the remaining 50 per cent interest is included in investment in joint ventures at an initial value 
of £117.1 million. As a result of this transaction the Group has recorded a loss on disposal of £1.0 million in the income statement. 
The cash flow statement inflow of £104.1 million represents the net consideration received of £116.9 million net of unrestricted 
cash in the business of £12.8 million. 
Assessing control over joint arrangements is a significant judgement as referenced in note 1. Based on the terms set out in the 
partnership agreement, the Group has classified its retained 50 per cent interest as a joint venture as key decisions require the 
consent of both partners. 
The assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries disposed of, at 100 per cent, are set out below:

Investment and development property   472.3

Disposals during 2016 
On 15 December 2016 the Group sold 100 per cent of its interest in Intu Bromley Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary, to Alaska 
Permanent Fund for initial consideration of £81.5 million before expenses of £1.3 million. Intu Bromley Limited holds a 64 per cent 
interest in intu Bromley. It was anticipated the Group would receive a cash payment of £0.8 million following final agreement of  
the completion balance sheet. As a result of this transaction the Group recorded a loss on disposal of £0.3 million in the income 
statement. The cash flow statement inflow of £80.5 million reflects the net consideration of £81.0 million net of cash in the  
business of £0.5 million. 
The assets and liabilities of the subsidiary disposed of, at 100 per cent, are set out below: 
   £m 
Assets

35 Assets classified as held for sale 
In November the Group announced the formation of a joint venture with LaSalle Investment Management (acting on behalf of 
Greater Manchester Pension Fund and West Yorkshire Pension Fund) for them to take ownership of 50 per cent of intu Chapelfield 
for initial net proceeds of £148.0 million. This transaction completed on 31 January 2018 following the receipt of EU merger 
approval. As a result, at 31 December 2017 in accordance with IFRS the Group has classified 100 per cent of intu Chapelfield  
(which is part of the UK operating segment) and all its related assets and liabilities as held for sale. Assessing non-current assets  
and disposal groups held for sale is a significant judgement as referenced in note 1. 
The assets and liabilities below are presented at their carrying amount. There are no material differences between their carrying 
amount and fair value less costs to sell.

Other entities 
Intu (SGS) Finance plc and Intu Metrocentre Finance plc are consolidated as subsidiaries in these financial statements but are not 
listed in the table above as the Group does not own the shares in these companies. These companies are vehicles set up on behalf  
of the Group for the sole purpose of issuing some of the Group’s listed debt. The Group’s obligations in respect of this debt via a 
back-to-back intercompany loan agreement between these companies and other Group companies, and security over investment 
property via a deed of charge between the security trustees and other Group companies, mean that the Group is deemed to have

(PDMR). 
During the year the Group’s joint ventures in Puerto Venecia, Zaragoza and intu Asturias sold shares in subsidiaries, previously  
wholly owned by the respective joint ventures, listed on the Spanish MaB to PDMR’s of the Group. The total value of the shares sold  
at fair value on the date of sale is €1.0 million and €0.9 million, representing 3 per cent and 2 per cent of outstanding share capital 
respectively. The sale of shares in these entities was required to comply with Spanish MaB free float listing requirements. The Group 
provided an interest-free loan to PDMR’s to enable them to purchase the shares. The loans are treated as a taxable benefit which 
accordingly is included in the above table.

40 Share-based payments 
The Group operates a number of share-based payment arrangements providing employee benefits and incentives. All schemes

awarded as determined at their grant date. The expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on 
Group estimates of the number of shares that are expected to vest. 
In 2017 the total share-based payment charge was £2.3 million (2016: £1.9 million). Details of share options outstanding under each

40 Share-based payments (continued) 
During the year the Group incurred a £49.4 million share related charge in relation to its Spanish development partner Eurofund’s 
future interests in the share capital of the intu Costa del Sol development company. The positive impact of this share related charge 
on equity attributable to owners of intu properties plc, a credit to retained earnings of £49.4 million, is expected to reverse once 
these arrangements are concluded, with the Eurofund interest to be included in non-controlling interests which will result in a 
reduction of net assets. 
A Share Option Scheme 
Options to subscribe for ordinary shares may be awarded under the intu properties plc approved Share Option Scheme and the  
intu properties plc unapproved Share Option Scheme. 
Except in the case of a ‘good’ leaver, options may not be exercised within three years of grant and before satisfaction or waiver of 
any applicable performance condition, and are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options become capable of 
exercise. The options automatically lapse if not exercised within 10 years of the date of grant. 
B Performance Share Plan (PSP) 
The Company operates a PSP for eligible employees at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
Awards may be made in the form of nil cost options, a conditional share award or a joint share ownership award and fixed-value 
zero-cost option, and eligible employees may be granted any combination of such awards subject to any individual limits. 
Vesting of PSP awards is based on Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and Absolute Total Return (TR) with performance measured 
one-third over three years, one-third over four years and one-third over five years. Half of the awards vest by reference to TR  
(25 per cent vesting for 6 per cent per annum return; full vesting for 10 per cent per annum; straight-line vesting in between). The 
remaining half of the awards vest by reference to TSR relative to the top-five UK-listed REITs (25 per cent return vesting for TSR in 
line with the third-rated company; full vesting for TSR in line with the top-rated company; straight-line vesting in between) subject 
to a Remuneration Committee-operated discretionary assessment of underlying financial performance. 
C Bonus Share Scheme (Bonus Scheme) 
Under the Company’s Bonus Scheme, deferred shares may be awarded as part of any bonus. 
Such awards comprise ‘Restricted’ shares and ‘Additional’ shares. Where awarded, Additional shares would be equal to 50 per cent 
of the Restricted shares and SIP shares (see below) combined. No Additional shares were outstanding at 1 January 2016 and no 
awards have been made in 2016 or 2017. The vesting of deferred share awards is not dependent on the achievement of any further 
performance conditions other than that participants remain employed by the Group for a specified time from the date of the award, 
typically two to three years in the case of Restricted shares and four years in the case of Additional shares. 
D Share incentive plan (SIP) 
The Company operates a SIP for all eligible employees, who may receive up to £3,600 worth of shares as part of their annual bonus 
arrangements. The SIP arrangements offer worthwhile tax advantages to employees and to the Company. 
The SIP Bonus shares can be released three years after the date of the award, provided the individual employee has remained in 
employment, but the shares must then be held in trust for a further two years in order to qualify for tax advantages. 
As part of the SIP arrangements, the Company also offers eligible employees the opportunity to participate in a ‘Partnership’ share 
scheme, under which employees can save up to £150 a month. The Group offers one free Matching share for every two Partnership 
shares purchased by the employee at the end of a 12-month saving period. Matching shares are forfeited if the employee leaves the 
Group within three years of the date of award, and qualify for tax advantages if they are held in the SIP for five years. 
E Save as you earn scheme (SAYE) 
The Company operates a SAYE for all eligible employees under which UK employees can enter into contracts to save currently up 
to a maximum of £500 per month with a bank or building society for a period of three or five years and use the proceeds from their 
savings accounts to purchase shares in the Company on the exercise of their options. The option price is usually the average mid-
market closing share price over the three consecutive dealing days preceding the invitation date, discounted by up to 20 per cent. 
Options may be exercised typically within six months following the end of the savings period.

F Joint Share Ownership Plan (JSOP) 
Eligible employees were invited to participate in the JSOP which forms part of the intu properties plc unapproved share option 
scheme and the PSP. Under the JSOP, shares are held jointly by the employee and the employee share ownership plan trustee with 
any increases in the share price and dividends paid on those shares being allocated between the joint owners in accordance with the 
terms of the scheme. 
Conditions for exercise (including satisfaction of the same performance condition), forfeiture and lapsing are as set out above for 
options or PSP generally. 
41 Pensions 
The Group operates defined contribution group pension plans for its staff. All contributions are invested in funds administered 
outside of the Group. 
The pension charge for the Group’s contributions to these arrangements is the amount paid which totalled £4.4 million for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 (2016: £3.6 million). 
42 Events after the reporting date 
In November 2017 the Group announced the formation of a joint venture with LaSalle Investment Management (acting on  
behalf of Greater Manchester Pension Fund and West Yorkshire Pension Fund) for them to take ownership of 50 per cent of  
intu Chapelfield for initial net proceeds of £148.0 million. This transaction completed on 31 January 2018 following the receipt  
of EU merger approval.

Covenants are tested on the Security Group, the principal assets of which are intu Lakeside, intu Braehead, intu Watford,  
intu Victoria Centre and intu Derby. During the year, intu Chapelfield was withdrawn from the Secured Group Structure. 
The structure has a tiered operating covenant regime giving the Group a significant degree of flexibility when the covenants are 
below certain levels. In higher tiers the level of flexibility is reduced. The Group retains operating control at loan to value below  
72.5 per cent and interest cover above 1.4x. No financial covenant default occurs unless the loan to value exceeds 80 per cent  
or the interest cover falls below 1.25x. 
The Trafford Centre Finance Limited 
There are no financial covenants on the intu Trafford Centre debt of £767.5 million at 31 December 2017. However, a debt service 
cover ratio is assessed quarterly and where this falls below specified levels restrictions come into force. The loan to 31 December 
2017 market value ratio is 32 per cent. No restrictions are in place at present.

EPRA performance measures (unaudited) 
 
intu properties plc Annual report 2017 
1 Summary 
The EPRA Best Practice Recommendations identify six key performance measures, including the EPRA cost ratios. The measures 
are deemed to be of importance for investors in European property companies and aim to encourage more consistent and 
widespread disclosure. The Group is supportive of this initiative but continues to disclose additional measures throughout this  
report which it believes are more appropriate to the Group’s current circumstances. 
In 2017, the Group retained its EPRA Gold Award for exceptional compliance with the EPRA Best Practice Recommendations. 
The EPRA measures are summarised below and detailed in the tables following: 
 Table 2017 2016

Recommendations award.

3 EPRA earnings 
EPRA earnings per share has been presented as recommended by EPRA which seeks to assist comparison between European 
property companies. However, we believe that our measure of underlying earnings per share, as presented in note 12(c), is more 
appropriate than the EPRA measure in the context of our business. The key difference relates to the adjustments in respect of 
exceptional items where EPRA is prescriptive about the adjustments that can be made limiting these to acquisition-related costs 
and costs incurred on termination of derivative financial instruments. A reconciliation of EPRA earnings per share to the Group’s 
measure of underlying earnings per share is provided below:

4 EPRA NAV 
(a) EPRA NAV 
EPRA NAV has been presented as recommended by EPRA which seeks to assist comparison between European property 
companies. However, we believe that our measure of NAV per share (diluted, adjusted), as presented in note 13(a), is more 
appropriate than the EPRA measure in the context of our business. The key difference relates to interest rate swaps not currently 
used for economic hedges of debt which are excluded in the Group’s definition of NAV per share (diluted, adjusted). The adjustment 
in respect of the non-controlling interest recoverable balance not recognised is due to historical accounting practices and is required, 
in our view, to give a more appropriate value of net assets attributable to equity owners of the Group. A reconciliation of EPRA NAV 
to the Group’s measure of NAV per share (diluted, adjusted) is provided below:
