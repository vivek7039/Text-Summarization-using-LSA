OVERVIEW    
Allied Minds plc (Allied Minds or the Company or the Group) is an IP commercialisation company focused on 
early stage company creation and development within the technology and life science sectors. With origination 
relationships spanning US federal laboratories, universities, and leading US corporations, Allied Minds sources, 
operates and funds a portfolio of companies to generate long-term value for its investors and stakeholders. Based 
in Boston, Allied Minds supports its businesses with capital, management, expertise and shared services.
A key strength of the Group lies in its ability to access a wide range of innovative scientific research and 
technology via its relationships with leading US research institutions and corporations, and the businesses and 
ecosystems built over the years. The Group focuses on maintaining strong connections with targeted institutions 
producing research output relevant to Allied Minds’ investment theses and areas of expertise, including but not 
limited to space, connectivity, data and machine learning, drug discovery, medtech, and medical wearables. The 
Group currently is comprised of 12 subsidiary businesses in the technology and life sciences sectors based upon 
a broad range of underlying innovative technologies ranging from semiconductors, wireless communications, 
and space-based sensors to medical devices and molecular compounds. 2

CHAIRMAN’S REPORT    
I am pleased to present this Annual Report to shareholders for the financial year ended 31 December 2017, 
which was a critical period in Allied Minds’ development.
In March 2017 the Board appointed Jill Smith as President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Jill’s extensive 
leadership experience, including most recently as CEO of DigitalGlobe where she led the business to growth 
and a successful IPO, is well-aligned with our overarching priorities at Allied Minds: to deliver shareholder returns 
by driving commercialisation and monetisations at our key subsidiaries, and building a growth engine of new 
investments. The substantial and decisive actions undertaken since her appointment position the Group well to 
deliver against these priorities.
In the first half of the year, the decision was made to rationalise the portfolio of subsidiary companies. This was 
completed after careful review of the capital requirements, competitive position and market opportunities facing 
each company. Since then, capital and management resources have been redirected to the most promising 
subsidiary businesses in the portfolio. Greater discipline is being exerted in the management and support of 
the portfolio, through more effective boards and greater accountability and transparency. The result is that our 
subsidiary businesses are operating with substantially greater focus, energy and urgency and are well-positioned 
to achieve the goals set.
After a year of focusing primarily on driving value from the existing portfolio, in 2018 we look forward to returning 
to opportunities to build and support new businesses. The same discipline brought to company operations is 
being applied to our new investment strategy. It is designed to seek out technology and innovations aligned to 
investment theses that are grounded in Allied Minds’ depth of experience and access, in particular with medical 
institutions and federal laboratories, and working in regulated industries and with the US Government.
Together with the Board, I am satisfied that as a result of actions undertaken in 2017 to rationalise the portfolio, 
improve capital allocation and operational discipline and bring renewed focus on commercialisation and 
monetisation, Allied Minds is in a stronger position today than it has ever been.
Non-Executive Director Rick Davis will retire and not seek re-election at the AGM to be held in May 2018 
after completing over seven years of service to the Company. We have greatly appreciated his dedication, 
experience, wealth of knowledge and insights he brought to Board deliberations over his years of service on the 
Board.
Finally, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continued support and our management team and staff for 
their hard work and commitment.

CEO’S REPORT    
Strategic Report
CEO’S REPORT
Shortly after my appointment in March 2017 we set out three key strategic priorities critical to enhancing our 
capital allocation discipline:
• Earlier and broader syndication of our subsidiaries, focusing on strategic investors, where we see scope for 
valuable validation and acceleration or de-risking of the path to commercialisation and monetisation;
• Strengthened leadership, governance and accountability at our subsidiary businesses, including changes in 
personnel where required, additional Board and advisory Board members, and clearer accountability for 
tangible milestone delivery; and
• A transition to thematic investing, focusing on theses and areas of competitive advantage, and on deeper 
relationships with a smaller number of research institutions aligned to these areas.
The actions undertaken across our investment, syndication and operating activities have been consistent with 
these priorities.
We completed subsidiary funding rounds in 2017 for HawkEye
360
, BridgeSat, Federated Wireless and 
Signature Medical that each included external strategic investors. As financial, strategic or commercial co-
investors, they offer both validation of the respective company’s business model and expand and/or de-risk the 
path to commercialisation.
We made good progress against a majority of the management objectives set for 2017, and I would like to 
recognise the teams for their accomplishments. Further, we strengthened leadership at several of our subsidiaries, 
including the appointment of two new CEOs, Tom Sparkman at Spin Transfer and Barry Matsumori at BridgeSat.
The addition of representatives from the strategic investors to the respective boards, and experienced non-
executive directors to others have enhanced governance and strategic insight.
In terms of new opportunities, we have focused our origination activities around theses or areas of competitive 
advantage, and sourcing on a more selective group of university and federal laboratories, and medical institutions 
with expertise in these areas, in addition to leveraging our own strong networks. As part of this enhanced focus, 
we are expanding the types of new investments we make, to consider both majority and minority investments at 
seed or Series A rounds where the opportunity is aligned to one of our theses and where we can leverage our 
experience and network.
Simon Davidson joined the team in June as Executive Vice President, Technology Investments, bringing extensive 
experience working with federal laboratories and government customers. He is driving focus on areas including 
space, connectivity and data, all of which leverage expertise and access derived from our current portfolio and 
team. Omar Amirana, MD, Senior Vice President, Life Sciences Investments, has focused on investment theses 
revolving around proprietary minimally-invasive solutions for procedures with a clear reimbursement path that 
reduce morbidity, mortality and costs. We are largely focused in areas where adoption can be dramatic such 
as interventional cardiology, electrophysiology, neuroradiology, pulmonology, and gastroenterology. 4

CEO’S REPORT (CONTINUED)  
(CONTINUED)
2017 was a year in which we focused on strengthening and repositioning the current portfolio. In 2018, we will 
continue to build on the strategic priorities identified with a view to focusing on two drivers of shareholder returns:
• Accelerate the path to commercialisation/monetisation at our top six companies, and nurture progress at our 
earlier stage companies; and
• Grow our new opportunity platform by increasing the number of high quality new investments.
Given the disruptive innovations and significant market opportunities our subsidiaries face and the steps we 
have taken to strengthen and focus operations, we believe that our portfolio holds the potential to deliver 
premium exit valuations and attractive returns to our shareholders. We believe each of our top six subsidiaries 
has strong sources of sustainable competitive advantage, including via patent portfolios which were markedly 
strengthened in 2017. The highly capable, experienced management teams have the necessary mix of technical 
and commercial skills, and have a clear line of sight to the critical goals and inflection points necessary to drive 
value and maximise exit optionality. Strategic, commercial and financial co-investors have validated the business 
plans and opportunities for those companies and provided invaluable support for the management teams.
I look forward to 2018 as a year in which we consolidate the hard work undertaken in 2017 and deliver further 
demonstrable progress against our objectives. I would like to thank our shareholders, our employees and our 
partners and customers for their ongoing support.

COMPANY OVERVIEW    
COMPANY 
OVERVIEW
 
THE OPPORTUNITY
The US is the world’s largest market for research and development (R&D) investment, with more than $125.0 billion 
in annual spending by the US federal government, resulting in thousands of US patent applications per annum. 
However, despite having established technology transfer processes designed to commercialise this intellectual 
property, only a relatively small number of patents per year are licensed, and only a small fraction progress to the 
next stage of development. Likewise, corporations have large areas of R&D output which may not align with their 
core strategy and target markets but could be refocused on other markets with cooperation from outside investors.
Allied Minds seeks to collaborate with targeted US federal research institutions, universities, medical institutions, 
and select corporations and entrepreneurs to identify early stage innovations and inventions that have the potential 
to transform markets, and to invest to build strong companies that can bring differentiated products and services 
to market. We seek to deliver attractive returns for our shareholders, as well as generate an additional source 
of funds for company creation and development, by realising superior exit valuations from those businesses that 
achieve commercialisation.
OUR STRATEGY AND CAPITAL ALLOCATION
Allied Minds sources, operates and funds a portfolio of subsidiary companies to generate long-term value for its 
investors and stakeholders, supporting its businesses with capital, management, expertise and shared services.
We seek to invest in companies at an early stage, including seed investment to build a company based on a 
technical breakthrough or invention. As such, our investments have significant upside potential, but also carry 
significant risk inherent in the early stage model. Allied Minds provides equity funding at the initial seed or Series 
A investment round and participates in follow-on investment rounds. Additionally, we provide hands-on support 
through the appropriate level of management, operating and governance support and expertise, and shared 
services over the life of the subsidiary to commercialisation and monetisation. A key component of the Company’s 
strategy is to maintain strict discipline in the allocation of financial and human capital to those businesses meeting 
the objectives or milestones set, and ceasing funds for those where the path to commercialisation is no longer 
attractive.
Allied Minds invests in technologies that have the potential to disrupt large markets and builds companies with 
a strong focus on those criteria that together best position them for successful commercialisation and ultimately 
an exit at a superior valuation. The company has defined six key success factors that, if present, can create the 
conditions for a superior exit valuation:
• Disruptive innovation solving an important problem (ideally with first mover advantage)
• Favourable market dynamics (large market and/or high growth rate)
• Sustainable competitive advantage (unique or superior solutions, with sustainable barriers to entry, potentially 
including IP)
• Route to widespread adoption (minimum barriers to adoption; known/available distribution channels)
• Capable management with aligned interest (right skill mix and accountability for delivery)
• Potential for competitive tension (operate to maximise exit optionality and nurture potential buyers) 11

COMPANY OVERVIEW (CONTINUED)  
Strategic Report
(CONTINUED)
Source
Since inception, Allied Minds has sought to deliver the commercial potential of IP developed in universities, 
federal laboratories, and medical institutions, by working with technology transfer offices (TTOs). It maintains 
relationships with several US Department of Defense laboratories and federal government agencies such as the 
Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Energy.
The Company typically receives certain access and licensing rights to inventions selected for investment. 
Additionally, the Company has established certain partnerships and alliances with US corporations, including 
Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) (via Allied- Bristol Life Sciences, LLC (ABLS)) and GE Ventures, which provide us 
with access to technology, expertise and capital. Finally, we leverage our own businesses and operators, as 
well as our network of partners and advisors to help identify emerging market and/or breakthrough technology 
opportunities. We prioritise those technologies or companies that benefit from the “network effect”, i.e. where 
we can leverage our market insight, operating expertise and network, often gained from those companies 
already in our portfolio, to benefit the early stage opportunity, or where it can deliver incremental value to our 
own companies.
Operate
We evaluate on an on-going basis the progress and potential of each of the Company’s businesses, and make 
strategy and funding decisions based on the achievement of key milestones. Together with management, the 
Company defines the critical milestones, or inflection points, for each subsidiary and measures tangible progress 
towards commercialisation and the key success factors for a successful monetisation event. Management is 
accountable for these milestones, which are developed into annual management objectives (or MBOs).
Allied Minds actively supports its businesses throughout their life-cycle. During the early stages, Allied Minds 
typically provides technical and executive leadership, as well as shared services support. At the appropriate time 
we will support a subsidiary business in hiring a full time CEO and other critical talent and in putting in place 
incentives to drive results. As businesses evolve, Allied Minds builds and leads the Board, recruits advisors and 
forms advisory Boards comprising of seasoned industry experts who act as mentors, while maintaining dedicated 
personnel to oversee progress.
It is a fact of life in early stage company creation and development that not all ideas or technologies will 
successfully transition to commercialisation. We carefully scrutinise our portfolio of subsidiary businesses with 
the objective of ensuring that we identify early signs that successful commercialisation and attractive returns on 
investment may not be obtainable. Where it becomes evident that a company does not have a clear path to 
commercial traction we seek to terminate early and with minimum sunk capital, while treating all parties involved 
fairly and with respect. Although our model assumes that not all of our investments will succeed, we expect to 
make sufficient successful investments to generate attractive returns across the portfolio as a whole because 
we enjoy competitive advantages via our origination platform and central operating expertise, and focus on 
investing in innovations that are disruptive to large and growing markets and maintaining large positions where 
appropriate.
Allied Minds has established scalable shared services capabilities designed to enable our businesses to focus 
on research, product development and commercialisation activities and at the same time benefit from strong, 
cost-effective operational and financial infrastructure and support. The administrative support provided includes 
payroll, IT support, legal, HR and fund-raising support, as well as hands-on operational advice. 12
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
COMPANY OVERVIEW (CONTINUED)  
Fund
As our companies meet the objectives identified for success, we seek to participate in subsequent capital raises 
to mitigate dilution, to the extent consistent with our goal to maximise risk adjusted returns for our shareholders 
and, taking into account competing uses of capital across our portfolio and pipeline. Co-investors in later rounds 
include financial, strategic and commercial partners. Where appropriate, we seek to include partners who 
validate the market opportunity and can provide support and/or commercial commitments to accelerate, expand 
and/or de-risk the path to commercialisation.
Portfolio composition
Allied Minds has identified six subsidiaries as defined earlier that we believe are well-positioned for 
commercialisation and have the potential to realise superior exit valuations.
These subsidiaries currently represent the substantial majority of Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value. 
Allied Minds’ ownership stakes range from 48.40% (Spin Transfer Technologies) to 98.15% (BridgeSat).
Outside these subsidiaries Allied Minds has two earlier stage investments (LuxCath and Signature Medical). 
These represent exciting opportunities in medtech, albeit with more work to be done to commercialise their 
technologies.
In addition Allied Minds operates an early stage drug development joint venture with Bristol Myers Squibb: Allied 
Bristol Life Sciences (ABLS). Currently ABLS has two drug candidates in initial feasibility studies and a third in 
lead optimisation.
Origination activities
Allied Minds focuses its origination activities on technologies or companies that are aligned with our theses 
on the future direction of market segments we are close to. Leveraging proprietary knowledge, expertise and 
networks – often gained from the companies already in our portfolio - we believe we have differentiated insight 
enabling us to identify new opportunities in dynamic markets, as well as market and operating experience 
and expertise that can deliver meaningful benefits to early stage companies. This is particularly true for market 
opportunities in regulated industries, or where target markets include government customers.
Areas where we have established ourselves as one of the leading operators, and where we believe there will be 
large or transformational market opportunities include: space/analytics; connectivity; data/machine learning; 
wearables; and minimally-invasive solutions where adoption can be dramatic such as interventional cardiology, 
electrophysiology, neuroradiology, pulmonology, and gastroenterology.
In order to fully participate in these emerging market opportunities, Allied Minds expects to take majority positions 
to build new companies and selectively take minority positions in already-formed companies. We will consider 
the latter where an opportunity is financially compelling in its own right and fits with an existing thesis or area of 
competitive advantage, and where participation is expected to also yield additional knowledge and expertise 
or strengthen our network in that area, thereby consolidating our competitive advantage. 13

COMPANY OVERVIEW (CONTINUED)  
Strategic Report
PARTNER NETWORK
The Group has well-established relationships with some of the most prestigious academic research institutions 
across the United States. Allied Minds aims to gain direct access to technologies at the forefront of research by 
working to deepen our relationships with selected institutions and selectively adding highly regarded research 
centres across the US. As described above, thematic investing demands a more selective approach to institutional 
relationships, matching origination efforts to those entities with expertise aligned to the Group’s investing 
theses. We anticipate focusing more on US government laboratories and other Federal Funded Research and 
Development Centers (FFRDCs), given our areas of interest.
Corporate partnerships provide an additional valuable source of new investments. This began with the formation 
of our ABLS partnership with BMS, and has continued with our strategic alliance with GE Ventures formed in 
September 2016. We continue to actively explore additional sources of world-class technology innovation. 14

SUBSIDIARY VALUATION    
SUBSIDIARY 
VALUATION
All of the Company’s subsidiary companies are currently majority owned and/or controlled and therefore fully 
consolidated in the Company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (IFRS). As a result, the Consolidated Statements of Financial 
Position incorporated within the Company’s consolidated financial statements do not include current valuations 
of the Company’s subsidiary companies.
At the close of each annual financial period, the Directors formally approve the value of all subsidiary businesses 
in the Group, which is used to derive the GSOAV. There can be no guarantee that the aforementioned valuation 
of the Group will be considered to be correct in light of the future performance of the various Group businesses, 
or that the Group would be able to realise proceeds in the amount of such valuations, or at all, in the event of a 
sale by it of any of its subsidiaries. These valuations assume there will be available funds for the subsidiaries to 
reach next stages of their development towards commercial success or an exit event.
The GSOAV was $395.6 million as of 19 March 2018 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication 
of this document), of which $375.3 million (or 94.9%) is attributed to the top six companies ($371.6 million 
or 89.4% as last reported). Of the total GSOAV, 95.9% is valued by reference to the valuation implied by the 
most recent third party funding round. Compared to $415.8 million when last reported, this reflects a decrease 
of $20.2 million, or 4.9%. This decrease is primarily attributed to the liquidation of several subsidiary businesses 
subsequent to current year end and write off of their value, namely Percipient Networks, Seamless Devices, and 
Whitewood Encryption as well as write downs in platform companies Allied Minds Federal Innovations, Inc. 
(AMFI) and Foreland Technologies Inc. (Foreland). This decrease was partially offset by an increase in value at 
BridgeSat and Federated Wireless demonstrated by the consummation of third-party fundraisings.
Ownership adjusted value represents Allied Minds’ interest in the equity value of each subsidiary and is calculated 
as follows: (Business Enterprise Value – Long Term Debt + Cash) x Allied Minds percentage ownership plus the 
value of debt provided by Allied Minds plc to each subsidiary business.

TOP SIX SUBSIDIARY BUSINESSES
Bridge Sat , i nc .
Overview
Formed in 2015, BridgeSat is seeking to develop an optical communications service for data transfer from LEO 
and GEO satellites to earth (and vice versa), and between satellites, at significantly lower cost and faster rates 
than current RF solutions. The technology underpinning BridgeSat’s offering was sourced originally from The 
Aerospace Corporation and Draper Laboratories. BridgeSat is based in Denver, Colorado.
Problem statement – RF cannot meet exponential growth in demand for satellite data downlink
LEO satellite data downlink demand is expected to grow over 125% annually through 2024, as a result of an 
expected three-fold increase in number of satellites by 2022 carrying a broader range of data-intensive sensors. 
The cost and speed characteristics of RF, together with increasingly scarce spectrum, make it difficult to support 
this increase in data downlink demand.
Proposed solution – optical-based data delivery service
BridgeSat is seeking to build an optical-based data delivery service that will enable data transfer to/from 
satellites at speeds of up to 10Gbps (roughly 10x the speed of current RF communications technologies) and 
significantly lower cost (up to 10x cheaper on a $/byte basis at speeds above 1Gbps). Other advantages 
include the fact that optical does not use spectrum, which is a scarce resource with competing demands; does 
not suffer spectrum interference issues; and is more secure since the narrow optical beam is difficult to jam.
BridgeSat’s optical communications system has three core elements. The first is the space terminal that is installed 
on customer satellites. The second is a network of optical ground stations that will receive data from BridgeSat 
space terminals and is planned to be compatible with those manufactured by other suppliers. The company 
estimates that a network of 10 ground stations is needed to meet the service requirements of LEO and GEO 
customers. The third is the Network Operations Centre (NOC), located in Colorado, required to operate the 
network and manage data delivery against customer service levels.
BridgeSat enjoys first mover advantages and is thought to be the only commercial entity currently building out a 
network of optical communications ground stations.
Business model and target markets
BridgeSat’s service contracts will vary based on volume of data and service levels.
BridgeSat’s first target market is the fast-growing LEO data downlink segment, currently estimated to be worth 
$1.5 billion annually. In addition it will target the GEO and inter-satellite data markets.

Federated WireleSS , i nc .
Overview
Based in Arlington, Virginia, Federated Wireless plans to offer a cloud-based SaaS service that unlocks spectrum 
previously unavailable to commercial users by enabling government and commercial users to securely share the 
same spectrum band. Founded in 2012, the company’s solution is based on technology developed with support 
from Virginia Tech University and the US Department of Defense (DoD).
Problem statement – the spectrum crunch
Demand for more spectrum to meet the growing needs of wireless broadband, IoT and next generation services 
while also ensuring the protection of critical missions performed by federal agencies is challenging existing 
allocation models. These include licensed spectrum, which can be high cost and inefficient, and unlicensed 
spectrum, such as Wi-Fi, which has no or very low cost but may be congested and unpredictable, and lacks 
carrier-grade technologies such as LTE. According to the FCC, “service quality is likely to suffer and prices are 
likely to rise” without new models that address the expected shortage of usable spectrum.
Proposed solution – shared spectrum model
Pioneered by Federated Wireless, spectrum sharing enables government and commercial users to securely share 
the same spectrum band.
In the US, the FCC initially plans to open up for shared use 150MHz of spectrum in the 3.5GHz band 
previously held by the Department of Defense, following an order creating the Citizens Broadband Radio Service 
(CBRS) that makes 3.5G available for mobile broadband and other commercial users. 150MHz of spectrum is 
equivalent to a large wireless carriers’ spectrum holdings. The cost to deploy the necessary equipment to utilise 
shared spectrum is approximately on par with that for wi-fi systems, but the technology is based on robust, carrier- 21

Strategic Report
grade LTE. The first commercial spectrum sharing services of the 3.5 GHz band are slated to be launched in 
2018, pending FCC certification.
Federated Wireless’ Technology
There are two key elements to the core Federated Wireless spectrum controller product. The Spectrum Allocation 
System (SAS) is cloud-based software that dynamically allocates available spectrum in the 3.5GHz band 
to registered users. Spectrum is allocated according to the three tier priorities determined by FCC rules and 
regulations. Access to the spectrum is gained via “access points” - equivalent to a wi-fi router - which are 
deployed close to the end user.
The second element is the ESC sensors that detects use by the incumbent (in the case of 3.5GHz the U.S. Navy) 
and secures priority access on an as needed basis. Federated Wireless is installing and will operate over one 
hundred ESC sensors along substantial stretches of the US coastlines. Dozens of ESC sensors are currently 
deployed at the time of writing.
Business model and target markets
There are five core markets for Federated Wireless’ spectrum sharing technology.
1. Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are expected to provide access by adding access points in highly 
populated areas to densify their existing networks, improve coverage and extend capacity and service 
quality.
2. Cable companies, also known as multiple system operators (MSOs), are expected to provide access by 
installing access points in homes and destinations to provide mobile offload.
3. Neutral hosts can harness shared spectrum by installing access points at private venues such as stadiums, 
campuses and other commercial properties to provide local networks at significantly reduced cost compared 
to current distributed antenna system technologies.
4.  Wireless broadband providers (also known as WISPs) can install access points in rural locations otherwise 
underserved by fixed line broadband.
5. Enterprise, industrial and other commercial customers can install access points to enable private LTE networks 
in factories and other venues, in support of IoT.
Overall, Federated Wireless estimates that the total addressable US market for 3.5GHz shared spectrum equates 
to more than 135 million access points, including 100 million home cable and broadband MSO installations; 
30 million enterprise installations; and 5 million in last mile access installations for rural homes. Not included 
is additional demand expected from MNOs for network densification and underserved travel and commercial 
hubs. Assuming FCC certification in 2018 and adoption rates equivalent to wi-fi, it is estimated that the US 
market could reach 5.4 million access points by 2022 (less than 4% of the total addressable US market).

 is based in Herndon, 
Virginia.
Problem statement – current space-based RF signals detection and mapping capabilities are limited
Wireless communications, using RF signals, are proliferating yet there is currently no commercial provider of 
RF detection, mapping and analytics with signal diversity and independent geolocation capabilities that can 
support sophisticated data analytic products. These capabilities have the potential to enhance government and 
commercial activities across a range of applications including spectrum mapping and interference management, 
maritime domain awareness and infrastructure management.
Proposed solution – RF signals detection, mapping and analytics from formation satellite constellations
HawkEye

 plans to operate clusters of 3 low earth orbit (LEO) small satellites flying in formation to provide 
independent data streams that can be used to accurately geo-locate diverse RF signals. Using proprietary 
algorithms, signals data will be used individually or in combination with multiple other data sources to deliver 
contextual, timely analysis and predictions related to sources of RF signals, such as ships and fishing vessels. 
For example maritime vessels engaged in illegal fishing may seek to evade detection by switching off their AIS 
(Automatic Identification System) and going “dark”. HawkEye

currently a $1.7 billion market, forecast to grow to $2.2 billion by 2024 (excluding defence and intelligence 
expenditure). In civil government the market is anticipated to include: anti-piracy and pollution; illegal, unreported 
and unregulated (IUU) fishing: and anti-illegal transshipment. Other representative markets include: spectrum 
mapping; emergency response and search and rescue; communications/spectrum interference detection; critical 
infrastructure awareness; and government mission support.

Overview
Precision Biopsy is a medical device and analytics company using spectral analysis to distinguish tissue 
characteristics in real-time, with the aim of improving diagnostics and therapies. Initially focused on prostate 
cancer, the technology is potentially applicable to other cancers. Precision Biopsy was formed in 2008 based 
on technology originally sourced from the University of Colorado. It is based in Aurora, Colorado. 24
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
PORTFOLIO REVIEW AND DEVELOPMENTS  (CONTINUED)  
Problem statement – poor diagnosis rates and invasive therapies for prostate cancer
The location of the prostate means that cancer tumours cannot be accurately imaged so biopsies are performed 
“blind”, with 12 to 14 cores sampled randomly. Poor diagnosis rates mean that cancer is missed nearly half 
of the time and patients are subjected to repeat treatments. Further, 90% of tissue cores are negative, resulting 
in unnecessary pathology costs of around $900 million annually in the US alone. Because tumours cannot 
be accurately mapped, treatments for prostate cancer are predominantly whole gland treatments, principally 
prostatectomy, carrying c. 85% side effects including sexual dysfunction and incontinence.
Proposed solution – “smart” diagnosis and therapy
Precision Biopsy’s ClariCore™ system uses spectral analysis to distinguish benign and cancerous tissue in real-
time during the biopsy procedure, guiding the urologist, and potentially improving diagnosis rates and reducing 
pathology costs. The same technology is anticipated to be leveraged to produce accurate 3D mappings of 
prostate cancer tumours, which in turn builds the foundation for focal therapy. Targeted therapy has the potential 
to replace certain prostatectomies, and potentially move treatment from the operating room to the clinic at 
significantly reduced cost.
Today’s standard of care involves a random biopsy of 12-14 cores under ultrasound. Where routine biopsies of 
high risk patients fail to diagnose the cancer, physicians typically prescribe an MR Fusion biopsy which involves 
an MRI scan (typically in the hospital) followed by the biopsy (typically in the urology office). An MRI scan is 
expensive and has an estimated 10mm error margin. ClariCore™ is estimated to have an error margin of 1mm, 
which is accurate enough for focal therapy, in which only the cancerous tissue is treated.
Target markets
In the US, Precision Biopsy’s ClariCore™ diagnostic product targets a c. $1.5 billion segment of the estimated 
$7 billion prostate cancer market, or approximately 1 million biopsies annually. Precision Biopsy believes an 
estimated 100,000 prostate cancer patients may be eligible for 3D mapping, worth c. $300 million annually in 
the US, plus an additional $500 million US market for an integrated focal therapy device. The European market 
is of a similar size to the US.

Sci Fluor l iFe ScienceS , i nc .
Overview
SciFluor is a drug development company focused on creating best in class compounds in the fields of ophthalmology, 
neuroscience and fibrosis. SciFluor’s lead clinical asset, SF0166, is a topical eye droplet treatment for Age-
related Macular Degeneration and Diabetic Macular Edema, both widely prevalent retinal diseases that lead 
to blindness if left untreated. The company has a pipeline of compounds in pre-clinical development. SciFluor is 
based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
The disclosure below focuses on SF0166.
Problem statement – treatment of AMD and DME requires regular injections to the back of the eye
AMD and DME require monthly injections to the back of the eye, causing patient discomfort and imposing 
significant costs on payors.
Proposed solution – topical eye droplet
SF0166 is a fluorinated compound administered via daily topical eye droplets. The patented fluorination process 
modifies a compound known to be safe and lends it qualities intended to enable passage to the back of the eye. 
In the second half of 2017 SciFluor concluded separate Phase I/II clinical trials for DME and Wet-AMD. The 
results of these trials, as interpreted by SciFluor’s Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), indicate that SF0166 is safe 
and well-tolerated by patients. In addition, the trials provided a preliminary indication that the drug is reaching 
the retina and having a biological effect. Of the 40 patients in the DME trial 53% were deemed responders 
as assessed by reduction in retinal thickness. In the Wet-AMD study 21% of the 42 patients were deemed 
responders, as assessed by reduction in retinal thickness, elimination or significant reduction of subretinal fluid 
and clinical judgement. In the view of SciFluor’s Board and SAB the results of these trials provide a clear basis 
to proceed to full Phase II trials for both indications. SciFluor is in the planning and design phase for these trials.
Target markets
20 million patients globally suffer from DME and 15 million suffer from Wet-AMD, with a further 150 million 
patients suffering from earlier stage Dry-AMD. In 2016 worldwide combined revenue for Lucentis and Eylea, 
the two leading injectable drugs treating these diseases, exceeded $8 billion. Ageing populations and the 
projected increased prevalence of diabetes are expected to drive future growth.

SPin t ranSFer t ecHnologieS , i nc . (SPin t ranSFer )
Overview
Spin Transfer is developing technology solutions that have the potential to materially enhance the endurance, speed 
and size characteristics of MRAM (magneto-resistive random access memory) – the emerging next generation 
memory technology. Spin Transfer believes these technologies hold the potential to unlock the widespread 
adoption of MRAM technology as a replacement for existing SRAM and DRAM. Based in Fremont, California, 
Spin Transfer was formed in 2006 and employs over 20 PhDs in fields including engineering, physics, materials 
sciences and mathematics.
Problem statement – current pervasive SRAM and DRAM technologies are reaching obsolescence
Current pervasive SRAM and DRAM memories deliver powerful size, speed and endurance performance, but 
have limitations in terms of volatility, i.e. they do not retain memory when power is cut, and have a high 
power consumption. Memory demand is growing, driven by more devices and more complex, data-intensive 
applications, including AI and VR, that require rapidly increasing amounts of memory to store data. At the same 
time, downward pressure on size and cost continues.
Proposed solution – universal technologies that enable DRAM-grade MRAM
Spin Transfer is developing 3 patented, universal technologies that hold the potential to enable MRAM (which 
is inherently non-volatile and low power) to meet or exceed the size, speed and endurance characteristics of 
SRAM and DRAM.
• Endurance Engine - circuitry designed to correct for inherent errors or non-idealities of MRAM, improving 
endurance by up to 6 orders of magnitude, taking current MRAM technologies from 10
8
 to 10
14
 compared 
to DRAM at up to 10
15
 or above. The Endurance Engine also improves cell size, speed, power consumption, 
density and retention. The Endurance Engine has parallels to innovations pioneered by SanDisk to correct for 
non-idealities in Flash memory leading to the widespread adoption of this technology. 27

PORTFOLIO REVIEW AND DEVELOPMENTS  (CONTINUED)  
Strategic Report
• Spin Polarizer (also known as PSC) – series of materials that can be layered onto a perpendicular magnetic 
tunnel junction (pMTJ – the core magnetics technology of MRAM) to improve switching speeds and increase 
efficiency by an estimated 30%, and reduce size by a corresponding amount.
• 3D multi-level cell (3D-MLC) – allows increases in densities to a level which, when combined with the Spin 
Polarizer and Endurance Engine, will allow MRAM to match or exceed the characteristics of DRAM.
Spin Transfer has more than 150 patents issued or pending in relation to these three technologies.
Target markets and business model
Through a phased roll-out of capabilities with partners, Spin Transfer expects first to target SRAM markets 
estimated at $500 million, and later DRAM with a total addressable market estimated to be worth $20 billion.
Spin Transfer plans to commercialise its technology through a combination of licensing agreements, potentially 
delineated by component and field of use, NRE-type agreements or sponsorship agreements, and other 
commercial partnerships. It does not possess a large scale manufacturing capability and would need to partner 
with a manufacturer at some stage to move beyond a licensing model if this were deemed desirable.
On a cost evaluation basis, the Endurance Engine is intended to decrease the overall silicon area (and hence 
cost) of a large (> 32 Megabit) MRAM memory. The Spin Polarizer adds an infinitesimal processing cost 
(fractions of a per cent) while greatly reducing silicon area. The 3D-MLC will add an as-yet undetermined 
processing cost that should also be significantly outweighed by the further silicon area reduction.

CORPORATE PARTNERSHIPS
aBlS, llc ABLS is a drug discovery and development company created in August 2014 through a partnership between 
Allied Minds and BMS. The company’s mission is to create novel drug candidates against serious diseases with 
large market potential. These include fibrosis, cardiovascular, immune-science, immuno-oncology and oncology, 
aligning to BMS’s strategic areas of focus. BMS has the option to acquire drug candidates from ABLS upon 
completion of the lead optimisation phase for a pre-agreed multiple of invested capital, with Allied Minds 
retaining rights to potential milestone and royalty payments.
ABLS sources novel mechanisms and initial lead molecules from Allied Minds’ network of institutional research 
partners and funds the initial feasibility study. Recently ABLS has in certain cases sought to de-risk projects by 
undertaking early work via a materials transfer agreement and an exclusive option, prior to forming a subsidiary 
and entering into an exclusive license.
If the drug does not pass the initial feasibility stage, funding is ceased and the subsidiary or project is closed with 
losses capped at the up to approximately $1 million of seed investment. If the drug passes the initial feasibility 
state it will enter into the lead optimisation phase to further advance the lead molecules, typically requiring further 
capital investment of up to $15.0 million. Funding for lead optimisation is provided by a combination of ABLS 
Capital, LLC (ABLS Capital) (80.0%) and BMS (20.0%). The lead optimisation phase studies are in part carried 
out at a BMS R&D Site in India, called Biocon-BMS Research Center (BBRC).
ABLS Capital was formed to provide the majority of the capital required to fund up to ten (10) ABLS subsidiaries 
though the lead optimisation phase. In April 2016 ABLS Capital secured commitments amounting to $80.0 million, 
including $40.0 million from Woodford Investment Management and $20.0 million from Invesco Perpetual. 
These funding commitments will be used to invest alongside the up to $20.0 million from BMS to fund these lead 
optimisation phases. 29

Strategic Report
The ABLS partnership aligns Allied Minds with a seasoned large pharmaceutical partner and creates a natural 
early stage (pre-clinical) acquirer of developing assets, potentially de-risking the drug development process for 
Allied Minds and providing attractive risk adjusted returns.
ABLS II, LLC
ABLS II was formed in June 2015 to undertake pre-clinical discovery and development of molecules against 
a novel target (Prolyl tRNA Synthetase) for treatment of fibrotic diseases. Harvard University researchers had 
earlier identified the mechanism of halofuginone (a natural product with anti-fibrotic properties) as an inhibitor 
of Prolyl tRNA Synthetase. ABLS II’s objective is to discover and develop halofuginone analogues with novel IP, 
better safety and superior efficacy. ABLS II has synthesised various molecules and is evaluating them for safety 
and efficacy. In May 2016 ABLS announced that ABLS II had successfully passed feasibility and in August 
ABLS II successfully raised $15.0 million of funding from ABLS Capital and BMS to fund the Lead Optimisation 
phase. The work is underway at BBRC with several proprietary molecules synthesised. However, the current 
lead molecules have not yet improved the therapeutics index (TI) using the industry standard Bleomycin model of 
Fibrotic diseases. Selected lead molecules are being evaluated in another disease model of Duchenne Muscular 
Dystrophy (DMD).
ABLS IV, LLC
ABLS IV was formed in October 2017 to enter into an alliance with Weill Cornell Medicine and an exclusive 
licensing agreement with Cornell University to conduct initial feasibility studies in relation to a novel class of 
inhibitors of immunoproteasomes. The class of inhibitors under development is targeted at a specific sub-unit of 
the immunoproteasome playing a critical role in inflammation and autoimmune diseases, including lupus and 
rheumatoid arthritis, with the potential to develop safer treatments with better efficacy. The market for unmet 
medical needs in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases is estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars. Initial 
Feasibility Phase is underway at BBRC.
Strategic a lliance WitH ge V entureS
Created in September 2016 to jointly identify and invest in technologies from Allied Minds’ and GE Ventures’ 
combined technology and innovation pipelines. Through this agreement, Allied Minds has an exclusive right 
of first refusal to license certain technologies, chosen by GE, for the spin-out and commercialisation of that 
technology.
Consistent with our focus on thematic investing, our efforts with GE Ventures have been focused on discovering the 
overlap of our strategic themes with commercialisation candidates from GE Ventures. Through this joint discovery 
process between Allied Minds and GE Ventures’ technology licensing group, multiple promising candidates for 
eventual spin-out have been reviewed. While we have not yet identified a candidate that meets each of our 
investment criteria and objectives, we continue to seek an opportunity for Allied Minds to form new entities based 
on the cutting-edge technologies developed by one of the world’s leaders in technology innovation. The strategic 
alliance with GE will expire by its terms in September 2018 unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties.

l ux c atH , llc LuxCath is developing a proprietary ablation catheter technology to enable live, optical interrogation of heart 
tissue during cardiac ablation, applying fluorescence to allow a cardiologist to assess on a real-time basis the 
impact of ablation therapy on targeted heart tissue. Current procedures are typically executed on a “blind”  30

PORTFOLIO REVIEW AND DEVELOPMENTS  (CONTINUED)  
basis with the cardiologists unable to visually assess whether there is tissue contact before commencing ablation 
and unable to determine whether ablation has successfully killed target tissue, or left gaps between lesions 
which could lead to recurrence. LuxCath’s technology can be applicable to all cardiac ablation procedures 
and is focused on atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation as its initial target market. It aims to improve clinical outcomes 
while reducing procedure times, fluoroscopy exposure, costs, and clinical recurrences. AF is the most common 
cardiac arrhythmia in the US, affecting more than two million people and projected to affect 15.9 million in the 
year 2050, half of whom will be over 80 years old. AF has been implicated as a significant cause of strokes, 
thromboembolic events, and heart failure, costing the US healthcare system billions of dollars annually.
During 2017 LuxCath began developing a proprietary catheter into which its optical tissue interrogation 
technology will be integrated. A prototype integrated device is expected to be delivered and tested in 2018. The 
prototype will have the capability to interrogate cardiac tissue radially (not only in a straight line), enabling more 
comprehensive lesion assessment. Subject to testing, LuxCath expects to move the integrated device to patient 
trials. LuxCath has recruited a highly qualified Scientific Advisory Board comprising leading electrophysiologists 
at Mount Sinai Health System (New York), Massachusetts General Hospital, Beaumont Health (Michigan), 
Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute at St. David’s Medical Center and L’Institut de Rythmologie et Modelisation 
Cardiaque (Bordeaux, France).
Signature Medical , i nc .
Signature Medical is developing smart wearable devices to evaluate and monitor patients remotely and on a 
real time basis. Its lead AcoustiCare™ device is designed for patients with heart failure and other indications.
While acoustic signature analysis represents an excellent and well-founded approach to cardiac evaluation and 
monitoring, AcoustiCare
TM
 and other products under development by Signature Medical, differ from other sensor-
based wearables based on proprietary artificial intelligence coupled with cloud-based audio technology. Most 
existing technologies are based on measurement of rhythm, movement or impedance.
AcoustiCare
TM
 is being developed with the objective of providing a more effective and non-invasive heart 
monitoring and evaluation system for patients suffering from heart failure and other indications. Remote, cloud-
based monitoring of data transmitted by the device offers patients the potential for earlier and more targeted 
intervention, with the benefit to the healthcare system of improving clinical outcomes, reducing hospital re-
admissions and material associated cost. Heart failure recurrence represents an enormous under-served market 
opportunity and ranks among the most prevalent and costly chronic diseases. It is the number one cause of 
hospitalisation among US adults over the age of 65 and consumes 1-2% of all healthcare expenditures in 
developed countries. Heart failure re-admission rates alone are estimated to be approximately 25% within 30 
days of hospital discharge at a cost of approximately $5 billion in the US annually.
During 2017, Signature Medical completed a $2.5 million Series A preferred financing round, including 
participation by Riot Ventures, an early stage investment fund focused on emerging technology, and Bose 
Corporation, a global leader in audio innovation. The company has begun work on building an AcoustiCare
TM
 
prototype, integrating a proprietary algorithm capable of assessing cardiac function, and expects to collect 
acoustic data to train and validate the algorithm and build its IP position. Signature Medical has formed an expert 
Scientific Advisory Board comprising of heart failure thought leaders at renowned institutions including University 
of California, San Francisco Brigham & Women’s Hospital and the Cardiovascular Research Foundation in New 
York City. 31

DISCONTINUED SUBSIDIARIES
Consistent with the Allied Minds’ model, where a project has failed to deliver sufficient additional proof points for 
ultimate commercialisation and financial return, no longer supports on-going development and commercialisation 
activity, and cannot be successfully redirected to an alternative commercial path, Allied Minds will look to cease 
operations and terminate the project.
In April 2017, Allied Minds announced that it would cease operations at the following subsidiaries, having 
determined that the path to commercialisation was not sufficiently clear and that capital and management 
resource should be redirected to more promising areas of the portfolio and pipeline: Biotectix; Cephalogics; 
CryoXtract; Novare Pharmaceuticals; Optio Labs; RF Biocidics; SoundCure; and Tinnitus Treatment Solutions. 
The related net restructuring cost for the period was $7.3 million, which included $4.7 million of non-cash 
charges for impairment of tangible and intangible assets and inventory write-offs and is net of $1.1 million in net 
proceeds from the sale of assets.
Also in 2017, ABLS I and ABLS III ceased operations and were dissolved following Board determination that 
they had not successfully completed initial feasibility studies. Vatic Materials was closed following unsatisfactory 
due diligence outcomes.
Post period-end the Group sold the assets of Percipient Networks to WatchGuard Technologies, and ceased 
operations and dissolved each of Whitewood Encryption and Seamless Devices. 32

 Non-controlling interests (35,337) (32,609)
Revenue increased by $2.3 million, to $5.0 million in 2017 (2016: $2.7 million). This increase is mainly 
attributable to the higher NRE revenue at Federated Wireless and HawkEye
360
. Cost of revenue was lower by 
$0.4 million at $5.2 million (2016: $5.6 million), reflecting prior year higher cost from write offs of inventory 
at two liquidated subsidiaries.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased by $0.3 million, to $55.2 million, for the 
year ended 31 December 2017 (2016: $55.5 million), largely due to savings from the restructuring and 
discontinued funding of subsidiaries during the year of $8.9 million. These savings were offset by an increase in 
spending at certain companies nearing commercialisation within the Group.
R&D expenses decreased by $6.3 million to $49.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2017 (2016: 
$55.3 million). Similarly to SG&A expenses, the decrease in R&D cost was largely due to savings from the 
restructuring and discontinued funding of subsidiaries during the year of $7.3 million. These savings were offset, 
in part, by the acceleration of activities at companies supported by third party financing rounds in 2016 and 
2017, such as BridgeSat and HawkEye
360
.
Finance cost, net decreased by $8.8 million to $6.5 million in 2017 (2016: $15.3 million) reflecting to the 
fair value accounting adjustment of the subsidiary preferred shares liability balance of $6.8 million (2016: 
$17.6 million), and interest income, net of interest expense, of $0.3 million (2016: $1.0 million).
As a result of the above discussed factors, total comprehensive loss decreased by $17.6 million to $111.1 million 
for the year ended 31 December 2017 (2016: $128.7 million). Total comprehensive loss for the year attributed 
to the equity holders of the Group was $75.8 million (2016: $96.1 million) and $35.3 million (2016: 
$32.6 million) was attributable to the owners of non-controlling interests. 33

• Intangible assets as of 31 December 2017 decreased by $1.7 million to $1.1 million (2016: $2.8 million) 
mainly as a result of amortisation expense of $0.3 million and impairment charges of $1.7 million, offset by 
additions of $0.3 million in acquired licenses and software assets;
• Other investments, non-current decreased to nil (2016: $2.7 million) reflecting the maturity of investment in 
fixed income government and corporate securities into current assets;
Current assets
• Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $51.1 million to $158.1 million at 31 December 2017 from 
$209.2 million at 31 December 2016. The decrease is mainly attributed to $90.8 million of net cash 
used in operations, offset by $35.4 million of cash from financing activities mainly from subsidiary financing 
rounds, and $4.3 million cash from investing activities mainly reflecting the conversion of fixed income 
security investments into cash and cash equivalents;
• Other investments, current decreased to $11.1 million (2016: $14.2 million) as those securities matured 
into cash and cash equivalents, reflecting the investment of excess cash into fixed income government and 
corporate securities that have maturities shorter than twelve months;
• Inventories decreased by $2.6 million to nil as at 31 December 2017 (2016: $2.6 million) reflecting mainly 
the obsolescence charges at discontinued subsidiaries of $2.5 million;
• Trade and other receivables increased by $9.7 million to $15.6 million at 31 December 2017 (2016: 
$5.9 million) as a result of an increase of $6.4 million mainly from advance payments to contract manufacturers 
plus a net increase of $3.3 million in trade receivables; 34

FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)  
Current liabilities
• Subsidiary preferred shares increased by $40.7 million to $181.6 million as of 31 December 2017 (2016: 
$140.9 million) as a result of net proceeds from subsidiary preferred rounds of $33.9 million at BridgeSat, 
Federated Wireless, HawkEye
360
 and Signature Medical in 2017. The IAS 39 fair value adjustment for the 
year of $6.8 million additionally contributed to the increase in the subsidiary preferred shares liability;
• Deferred revenue increased to $4.3 million as of 31 December 2017 (2016: $0.5 million) primarily due to 
$3.7 million of customer deposits on contracts mainly at BridgeSat and HawkEye
360
;
Equity
• Share capital and premium increased by $1.6 million to a combined $162.3 million at 31 December 2017 
(2016: $160.7 million) primarily due to exercises of stock options under the U.S. Stock Option Plan. The 
increase in accumulated deficit of $65.0 million to $354.4 million (2016: $289.4 million) mainly reflected 
the net comprehensive loss attributable to equity holders of the Group for the year of $75.8 million (2016: 
$96.1 million). This increase is offset by the effect from dissolution of subsidiaries of $4.7 million (2016: 
nil) and the share-based compensation expense charge for the year of $6.1 million (2016: $5.9 million).

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
RISK MANAGEMENT    
RISK MANAGEMENT
 
The execution of the Group’s strategy is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. A key focus for the Board 
is to formally identify the principal risks facing the Group and develop a robust and effective framework to ensure 
that the risks are both well understood and appropriate for the Company’s risk appetite to achieve the stated 
corporate goals. This process needs to address both risks arising from the internal operations of the Group and 
those arising from the business environment in which it operates. It is possible that one or more of these identified 
risks could impact the Group in a similar timeframe which may compound their effects.
With our focus on early stage company creation and development, the Group inherently faces significant risks 
and challenges. The overall aim of the risk management policy is to achieve an effective balancing of risk and 
reward, although ultimately no strategy can provide an absolute assurance against loss.
The Board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and/or liquidity. The major risks and uncertainties 
identified by the Board are set out below along with the consequences and mitigation strategy of each risk.
1. The science and technology being developed or commercialised by the Group’s businesses may fail 
and/or the Group’s businesses may not be able to develop their innovations and intellectual property into 
commercially viable products or technologies. There is also a risk that some of the subsidiary businesses may 
fail or not succeed as anticipated, whether as a result of technical, product, market or other risks, resulting in 
an impairment of the Group’s value.
Impact: The failure of any of the Group’s subsidiary businesses would impact the Group’s value. A failure of one 
of the major subsidiary businesses could also impact on the perception of the Group as a builder of high value 
businesses and possibly make additional fund raising at the Group or subsidiary level more difficult.
Mitigation:
• Before making any investment, extensive due diligence is carried out by the Group which covers all the major 
business risks including market size, strategy, adoption and intellectual property.
• The initial seed round investment is typically quite small with additional investment only being made on 
successful completion of milestones.
• A disciplined approach to capital allocation is pursued such that proof of concept has to be achieved before 
substantial capital is committed.
• Members of the Group’s management team who carry out the initial due diligence may initially manage the 
subsidiary in its incubation phase and will typically serve as directors, thus staying with the project to help 
ensure consistency of management.
• Dedicated leadership with deep industry or sector knowledge, and relevant technical and/or leadership 
experience, is recruited as appropriate, and the Group ensures that each subsidiary has independent 
directors and/or other advisors, as appropriate for the relevant stage of development.
• During incubation stage, we closely monitor milestone developments and should a project fail to achieve 
sufficient progress, we terminate the investments.
• Each subsidiary business holds quarterly board of director meetings, with participation from the Group’s 
management and/or investment team, along with the senior management team of such subsidiary business. 37
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)  
Strategic Report
(CONTINUED)
• The shared services model provides significant administrative support to the subsidiary businesses whilst the 
budgetary and financial controls ensure good governance.
• Within the Group there is significant management expertise which can be called upon to support each of the 
subsidiary businesses where necessary.
• The Group actively uses third party advisors and consultants, specific to the particular domain in which a 
subsidiary business operates, to assist on market strategy and direction.
2. The Group expects to continue to incur substantial expenditure in further research and development, product 
development, marketing and other operational activities of its businesses. There is no guarantee that the 
Group or any of its individual subsidiaries will become profitable prior to the achievement of a subsidiary 
sale or other liquidity event, and, even if the Group or any of its individual subsidiaries does become 
profitable, such profitability may not be sustainable. The Group may not be able to sell its ownership interests 
in subsidiary businesses during any specific time frame or otherwise on desirable terms, if at all.
Impact: The strategic aim of the business is to generate profits for its shareholders through early stage company 
creation and development within the technology and life science sectors, to generate long-term value. Such 
value is expected to be delivered through the commercialisation and monetisation of these businesses, including 
through generation of revenue and profits, and through sales of subsidiary businesses or other liquidity events. 
The timing and size of these potential inflows is uncertain and should liquidity events not be forthcoming, or in 
the event that they are achieved but at values significantly less than the amount of capital invested, then it would 
be difficult to sustain the current levels of investment in the subsidiary businesses and continue to make new 
investments. This will lead to reduced activity across the Group. In turn this could make raising additional capital 
at the Group level difficult and it could ultimately lead to the failure of the Group as a whole.
Mitigation:
• The Group retains significant cash balances in order to support its cash flow requirements, including to support 
the cash requirements for each subsidiary and for corporate resources, as well as invest in new businesses.
• The Group has close relationships with a wide group of investors, including its shareholder base to ensure 
it can continue to access the capital markets, and continues to identify and develop strategic and financial 
relationships for co-investing in the Group’s subsidiary businesses.
• Senior management continually seek to create additional strategic relationships for the Group, and each 
subsidiary continually seeks to engage in strategic relationships relevant to their respective markets and to 
maintain current information on and awareness of potential monetisation strategies.
3. If a significant number of the Group’s relationships with US universities and federal government institutions 
were to break down or be terminated or expire, then the Group would lose any rights that it has to act as a 
private sector partner in the commercialisation of intellectual property being generated by such universities, 
other research intensive institutions or US federal research institutions.
Impact: Termination of certain of the Group’s existing relationships would impact the quantity and potential 
quality of the Company’s deal flow. This may in turn prevent the Company from completing promising new 
deals and reduce its opportunity to create new subsidiaries. This could potentially have an adverse effect on the 
Group’s long term prospects and performance. 38
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)  
Mitigation:
• The Group continues to strengthen its partner network. The Group seeks to ensure that it has a diversity of 
relationships to ensure that no one university or US government laboratory has inordinate influence on our 
prospects. At the same time we seek to develop deep relationships with select research institutions and 
corporate partners, as well as build out a network of industry-specific relationships, in order to strengthen the 
quality and quantity of new deal opportunities.
• The risk of losing deal flow through the termination of relationships is greatly lessened by the wide portfolio 
and geographic spread of our partners.
• The Group is fostering new relationships with strategic corporate partners to expand and strengthen its 
partner network and pipeline for opportunities.
4. A majority of the Group’s intellectual property relates to technologies originated in the course of research 
conducted in, and initially funded by, US universities or other federally-funded research institutions. Although 
the Group has been granted exclusive licenses to use this intellectual property, there are certain limitations 
inherent in these licenses, for example as required by the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980.
Impact: There are certain circumstances where the US government has rights to utilise the underlying intellectual 
property without any economic benefit flowing back to the Group. In the event this were to happen, this could 
impact the financial return to the Group on its investment in the applicable subsidiary businesses.
Mitigation:
• To the Board’s knowledge, while these so called “march in” rights exist, the US government has never had 
cause to use them.
• The Group seeks to develop dual use capabilities for the technology it licenses and generally tends to avoid 
use cases directly applicable to government use.
• This risk is also mitigated through employing experienced technology transfer experts supported by our legal 
team to assess risks that may arise out of this eventuality.
5. The Group, including certain of the subsidiary businesses, currently has in place cooperative research and 
development agreements with certain US Department of Defense laboratories and other federally funded 
government institutions. Certain regulatory measures apply to these agreements which restrict the export of 
information and material that may be used for military or intelligence applications by a non-US person, and 
compliance with these regulatory measures may be complex and limit commercial alternatives.
Impact: If the Group were to breach restrictions on the use of certain licensed technologies, particularly those 
derived from federally funded research facilities, this could materially impact upon the Group’s ability to license 
additional intellectual property from these establishments. In certain circumstances it may also lead to the 
termination of existing licenses. In the event that this were to happen, this could materially affect a number of the 
Group’s businesses and potentially harm the reputation and standing of the Group and cause the termination of 
certain important relationships with federally funded research institutions. 39

Mitigation:
• Prior to licensing any technology under these agreements, the Group’s management seeks to identify the 
commercial and other alternatives available for products and services associated with such technology and 
innovations, and to ensure that there are sufficient markets available to justify the capital investment.
• Prior to the commercialisation process, the Group’s management seeks to obtain all the necessary clearances 
from applicable regulatory bodies to ensure that the export of products based upon the licensed IP is strictly 
in accordance with government guidelines.
• The Group employs a number of individuals with experience in working with various government agencies.
• Senior management is fully cognisant of the regulations and sensitivities in relation to this issue and in 
particular with International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) which regulate the use of technologies for 
export, and has numerous mitigating actions available should issues arise.
6. The Group operates in complex and specialised business domains and requires highly qualified and 
experienced management to implement its strategy successfully. All of the operations of the Group and its 
subsidiary businesses are located in the United States, which is a highly competitive employment market. 
Furthermore, given the relatively small size of the senior management at the corporate level, the Group is 
reliant on a small number of key individuals.
Impact: There is a risk that the Group may lose key personnel, or fail to attract or retain new personnel. The 
loss of key personnel would have an adverse impact on the ability of the Group to continue to grow and may 
negatively affect the Group’s competitive advantage.
Mitigation:
• The Board annually seeks external expertise to assess the competitiveness of the compensation packages 
of its senior management, and to ensure that the structure of compensation is designed to properly incent 
performance and retention.
• Senior management continually monitor and assess compensation levels to ensure the Group remains 
competitive in the employment market.
• While staff turnover has historically been low and the Group continues to attract highly qualified individuals, 
management encourages development and inclusion through coaching and mentoring programmes.
7. A large proportion of the overall value of the Group’s businesses may be concentrated in a small proportion 
of the Group’s businesses. If one or more of the intellectual property rights relevant to a valuable business 
were terminated, this would have a material adverse impact on the overall value of the Group’s businesses.
Impact: The termination of critical IP licenses would materially impact the value of the subsidiary business and 
have a consequent effect on the value of the overall Group. 40
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)  
Mitigation:
• In each subsidiary, the management is specifically directed to pursue a policy of generating and patenting 
additional intellectual property to both provide additional protection and create direct IP ownership for the 
subsidiary business.
• Where possible, the Group seeks to negotiate intellectual property ownership rights in any research and 
development agreement it enters into with a network partner, such that the Group becomes a part owner of 
the underlying IP.
• The Group has a diversified portfolio of subsidiary businesses. The value of any one of its subsidiaries relative 
to the aggregate value of the Group is closely monitored to ensure that the concentration of risk of any one 
subsidiary is not disproportionate.
8. Clinical studies and other trials to assess the commercial viability of a product are typically expensive, 
complex and time-consuming, and have uncertain outcomes. If the Company fails to complete or experiences 
delays in completing trials for any of its product candidates, it may not be able to obtain regulatory approval 
or commercialise its product candidates on a timely basis, or at all.
Impact: Significant delays in any of the clinical studies to support the appropriate regulatory approvals could 
significantly impact the amount of capital required for the subsidiary business to achieve final regulatory approval, 
which in turn may impact the value of such subsidiary. A critical failure in any stage of a clinical testing programme 
would probably necessitate a termination of the project and a loss of the Group’s investment.
Mitigation:
• The Group has dedicated internal resources within each subsidiary business to establish and monitor each 
of the clinical programmes in order to try and maximise successful outcomes.
• During the evaluation and due diligence phase prior to the initial investment, focus is placed on an analysis 
of the risks of the clinical phase of development.
• Prior to the launch of any clinical trials it will be normal for a dedicated management team (and an advisory 
team to include key opinion leaders (KOLs)) to be hired, and experience with the management of clinical 
programmes would be a prerequisite qualification.
• In the event of the outsourcing of these trials, care and attention is given to assure the quality of the Contract 
Research Organization (CRO) vendors used to perform the work.
9. The US Investment Company Act of 1940 regulates companies which are engaged primarily in the business 
of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities. Securities issued by companies other 
than consolidated partner companies are generally considered ‘‘investment securities’’ for purposes of the 
Investment Company Act, unless other circumstances exist which actively involve the company holding such 
interests in the management of the underlying company. 41
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)  
Strategic Report
Impact: If the Company is deemed to be an ‘‘investment company’’ subject to regulation under the Investment 
Company Act, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for the Group to continue its business as 
contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on its business. If anything were to happen which 
would cause the Company to be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, 
requirements imposed by the Investment Company Act, including limitations on capital structure, ability to transact 
business with subsidiaries and ability to compensate key employees, could make it impractical for it to continue 
its business as currently conducted.
Mitigation:
• The Company intends to monitor and conduct its operations so that it will not be deemed to be an investment 
company under the Investment Company Act.
• The Company seeks to build value by forming majority-owned or primarily controlled subsidiary companies; it 
is not engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and 
does not own or propose to acquire investment securities above prescribed thresholds under the Investment 
Company Act.
• Currently the Company holds more than 50% of the voting securities of each of its subsidiary companies 
(other than Spin Transfer Technologies, where it owns 48.40%), and intends to continue to try to structure 
its new businesses in such a way as to hold majority of the voting securities in its operating subsidiaries, or 
otherwise obtain and maintain primary control.
• In addition to ownership levels, the Company seeks to obtain and maintain primary control of its subsidiary 
businesses through a combination of the following:
 o Rights to elect representatives to the board of directors, with ability to exercise influence over the 
subsidiary’s business strategy, operating plans, budgets and key corporate decisions;
 o Legal rights, such as access to information (books and records) and financial statements, liquidation 
preferences, registrations rights, rights of first refusal, pre-emptive rights and co-sale rights;
 o Protective provisions, such as rights to block certain subsidiary actions; and
 o Active involvement in the management of the subsidiary, such as shared service support, business 
development introductions, co-locating, and key management recruiting.
10.The Group expects to remain viable through December 2020 given its current cash and financial position. 
However, if the Group is unable to raise capital, generate sufficient revenue, appropriately manage expenses, 
or exit any of its existing Group businesses prior to the end of such period, then the Group’s business, 
financial condition, results of operations, prospects and future viability could be adversely affected.
Impact: Lack of capital could restrict the Group’s ability to further fund, develop and commercialise its existing 
businesses and prevent the Group from investing in attractive new opportunities. In turn, this could ultimately lead 
to failure of individual subsidiaries and loss of investment as well as failure of the Group as a whole. 42
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)  
Mitigation:
• The Group maintains close relationships with its shareholder base, strategic partners, and a wide group of 
investors to ensure it continuous access to the capital markets.
• The Group has historically had a strong financial position, including prior to its initial public offering (IPO), 
and holds significant control over the Company’s investments and how subsidiary company working capital 
requirements are met.
• The Company strives to maintain majority ownership and/or control over all of the subsidiary companies, so 
that it can seek to influence optimal capital allocation, use of cash, and fund-raising strategy.
• The Company has built a valuable portfolio of subsidiary businesses since its inception.
• The Company continuously and critically reviews the progress of its subsidiaries against pre-set milestones 
to ensure its financial capital and human resource is properly allocated to the more promising areas of its 
portfolio to help strengthen and accelerate the Group’s path to monetisation.
BREXIT
On 23 June 2016, the UK electorate voted to leave the European Union in a so-called “Brexit” referendum. The 
full consequences of the decision to leave the European Union will not be known for some time. The uncertainty 
surrounding the implementation and effect of Brexit has caused and is likely to continue to cause increased 
economic volatility.
It is expected that companies based in the UK and with significant UK and EU operational focus will be the most 
directly impacted by Brexit. All of the Group’s subsidiary businesses are based in the US, and substantially all of 
the business and operations of the Group are conducted in the US. However, the Group has raised significant 
capital in the UK and may need to raise additional capital in the UK in the future to support the growth and 
development of its subsidiaries. The uncertainty caused by Brexit may result in the Group being unable to obtain 
additional capital on a timely basis on commercially acceptable terms.
In addition, Brexit exposes the Group to increased foreign currency risk. Foreign exchange risk is an exposure for 
the Group as it derives substantially all of its revenue in US dollars and the Group’s businesses borrow, account 
in, and are valued in, US dollars, but its shares trade in amounts denominated in pounds sterling. Any capital 
raised by the Group in the UK would be denominated in pounds sterling, but would be allocated to subsidiary 
businesses which operate in the US and whose functional currency is US dollars.
If the Group requires and fails to obtain sufficient capital on acceptable terms, it may be forced to curtail or 
abandon its planned growth activity and to forego further investment in developing certain of its current businesses, 
and otherwise be subject to a material adverse impact on the Group’s business and financial condition. 43

STRATEGIC REPORT
The Group’s Strategic Report can be found on pages 3 to 43, and includes information as to the Group’s 
activities in the field of research and development, and as to the likely future development of the Group. Financial 
key performance indicators can be found on pages 17 to 18.
The Strategic Report contains forward-looking statements with respect to the business of Allied Minds. These 
statements reflect the Board’s current view, are subject to a number of material known and unknown events, risks 
and uncertainties, and could change in the future. Factors that could cause or contribute to such changes include, 
but are not limited to, general economic climate and trading conditions, as well as specific factors relating to the 
financial or commercial prospects or performance of the Group’s individual subsidiary companies, the ability to 
consummate expected transactions, and the ability to identify promising new technologies invented by university 
or Federal laboratory partners.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group through its operations is exposed to a number of risks. The Group’s risk management objectives 
and policies are described on pages 36 to 43 and in the Corporate Governance Report on page 64. Further 
information on the Group’s financial risk management objectives and policies, including those in relation to 
credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, is provided in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements, along 
with further information on the Group’s use of financial instruments. The pages referenced in this paragraph are 
incorporated into this Directors’ Report by reference.
SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS
The Group has not entered into any significant agreements which may be impacted by a change of control 
following a takeover bid.
SHARE CAPITAL
Details of the structure of the Company’s share capital and the rights attaching to the Company’s shares are set 
out in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Other than the minimum share ownership policy adopted 
by the Board in April 2016 with respect to Executive Directors, there are no specific restrictions on the holding 
of securities or on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general provisions of the Company’s 
Articles of Association (Articles) and prevailing legislation. None of the ordinary shares carry any special rights 
with regard to control of the Company and there are no restrictions on voting rights.
In connection with the strategic alliance entered into with GE Ventures in September 2016, GE Ventures received 
an option to participate in any future capital raise by the Company for at least 6% of the total raise, subject to 
current pre-emption rights, applicable authorisations and applicable laws and regulations.
At the last Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 1 June 2017 (2017 AGM), authority was given to 
the Directors pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Companies Act to allot unissued relevant securities in the 
Company up to a maximum amount equivalent to approximately one-third of the issued ordinary share capital 
on 24 April 2017 at any time up to the earlier of the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting (AGM) of 
the Company and 1 September 2018. In addition, at the 2017 AGM, the Directors were also given authority 
effective for the same period as the aforementioned authority to allot relevant securities in the Company up to a 
maximum of approximately two-thirds of the total ordinary share capital in issue on 24 April 2017 in connection  49

49
with an offer by way of a fully preemptive rights issue. The Directors propose to renew both of these authorities 
at the Company’s next AGM to be held on 23 May 2018. The authorities being sought are in accordance with 
guidance issued by the Investment Association.
A special resolution passed at the 2017 AGM granted authority to the Directors to allot equity securities in the 
Company for cash, without regard to the pre-emption provisions of the Companies Act, both: (i) up to a maximum 
of approximately two-thirds of the total ordinary share capital in issue on 24 April 2017 in connection with a 
fully preemptive rights issue; and (ii) up to a maximum of approximately 5% of the aggregate nominal value of 
the shares in issue on 24 April 2017. A further special resolution passed at the 2017 AGM granted authority 
to the Directors to allot equity securities in the Company for cash, without regard to the pre-emption provisions of 
the Companies Act, up to a maximum of approximately 5% of the aggregate nominal value of the shares in issue 
on 24 April 2017, to be used only for the purposes of financing (or refinancing, if the authority is to be used 
within six months after the original transaction) a transaction which the Directors determine to be an acquisition 
or other capital investment of a kind contemplated by the Pre-emption Group’s Statement of Principles. These 
authorities are exercisable at any time up to the earlier of the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company and 
1 September 2018. None of these authorities were used during 2017. The Directors will seek to renew these 
authorities for a similar period at the next AGM to be held on 23 May 2018. Further details of such authorities 
are set forth in the Notice of AGM circulated with this Report and Accounts.
The Directors intend to adhere to the provisions in the Pre-emption Group’s Statement of Principles, as updated 
in March 2015, and not to allot shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis:
• in excess of an amount equal to 5% of the total issued ordinary share capital of the Company (excluding 
treasury shares); or
• in excess of an amount equal to 7.5% of the total issued ordinary share capital of the Company (excluding 
treasury shares) within a rolling three-year period, without prior consultation with shareholders,
in each case, other than in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment which is announced 
contemporaneously with the allotment or which has taken place in the preceding six-month period and is 
disclosed in the announcement of the allotment.
Under the Companies Act, the Company has the power to purchase its own shares in accordance with Part 
18, Chapter 5 of the Companies Act. At the 2017 AGM, a special resolution was passed which granted 
the Directors authority to make market purchases of the Company’s shares pursuant to these provisions of the 
Companies Act up to a maximum of approximately 10% of the Company’s issued share capital on 24 April 
2017 provided that the authority granted set a minimum and maximum price at which purchases can be made 
and is exercisable at any time up to the earlier of the conclusion of the next AGM and 1 September 2018. This 
authority has not been used during the year and therefore the outstanding authority is 23,424,624. The Directors 
will seek to renew the authority within similar parameters and for a similar period at the next AGM to be held 
on 23 May 2018.

• The Group ceased operations and dissolved each of Whitewood Encryption and Seamless Devices 
subsequent to year end.
VIABILITY STATEMENT
While the financial statements and accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis, section C.2.2 of 
the 2016 revision of the UK Corporate Governance Code (Code) requires the Directors to make a statement 
in the Annual Report with regard to the viability of the Group, including explaining how they have assessed the 
prospects of the Group, the period of time for which they have made the assessment, and why they consider that 
period to be appropriate. Accordingly, the Directors conducted this assessment over the three years to December 
2020, taking into account the Group’s current position, investment strategy, and the principal risks detailed in the 
Strategic Report. The three year period is on the assumption that further external funding is provided to the Group 
either in the form of proceeds from subsidiary exit events or further parent company fund raises. In the event that  52
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
DIRECTORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)  
further external funding is not obtained, the Directors have mitigating actions available such as lowering the 
deployment of capital. The Directors believe that a three-year assessment is most appropriate as it aligns with the 
Group’s normal and well-established budgeting process. In making their assessment, the Directors considered a 
wide range of information, including present and future economic conditions, future projections of profitability, 
cash flows and capital requirements and the Group’s ability to raise further capital from external fundings.
The Group’s annual budgeting process builds into a robust three-year plan, which is the period the Directors 
consider as an appropriate period to be covered by the viability statement. This plan forms the basis for strategic 
decisions across the Group. The consolidated plan is reviewed and approved annually by the Directors at the 
beginning of the year. The plan is then deployed down to the subsidiary businesses and used to set performance 
metrics and objectives (MBOs). Progress against the original plan is reviewed quarterly by the Directors, and 
adjustments to the plan can be made if needed to address new risks or take advantage of new opportunities.
In summary, the Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over the three year period to December 2020. 
They were comforted by the Group’s strong financial position, its ability to raise or borrow capital, its long-
term investment objectives, the stability of the business model, the Group’s control over its investments and how 
working capital requirements are met. Based on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year 
period to December 2020.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITOR
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval of this Annual Report confirms that:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is 
unaware; and
• the Director has taken all steps that he or she ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself or 
herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that 
information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the 
Companies Act.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The Annual General Meeting (AGM) will be held at 11 a.m. BST on 23 May 2018 at the offices of DLA Piper 
UK LLP, 3 Noble Street, London EC2V 7EE, United Kingdom. The Notice of AGM circulated with this Report and 
Accounts contains a full explanation of the business to be conducted at that meeting. This includes a resolution 
to re-appoint KPMG LLP as the Company’s auditors.
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts and the Group and parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent Company financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law, they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with  53
   
DIRECTORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)  
Management & Governance
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
53
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union (EU) and applicable law 
and have elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent Company and of their profit or loss for that 
period. In preparing each of the Group and parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant and reliable;
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU;
• assess the Group and parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern; and
• use the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the 
parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the parent Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the parent Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. The Directors are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and 
have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, 
Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that 
law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT OF THE DIRECTORS IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group and the parent 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face. 54
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
DIRECTORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)  
We consider the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy.

COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
The Directors are committed to a high standard of corporate governance and compliance with the best practice 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code (Code) which was issued by the Financial Reporting Council in 2010 
and revised in April 2016. The Code is available at the Financial Reporting Council website at www.frc.org.uk. 
During the twelve months ended 31 December 2017, the Directors consider that the Company has been in 
compliance with the provisions set out in the Code with the following exception:
• Contrary to provision D.1.3 of the Code, certain Non-Executive Directors hold restricted stock units (RSUs) 
that vest over time. These RSUs were granted to the Non-Executive Directors in 2015, 2016 and 2017, and 
do not have performance conditions. The Board does not believe that ownership of these RSUs impacts the 
independence of the Non-Executive Directors.
Further explanation as to how the provisions set out in the Code have been applied by the Company is provided 
in the following statement, the Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Audit Committee Report and the Strategic 
Report.
THE BOARD
Role and Responsibilities of the Board
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the overall management of the Group as a whole, providing 
entrepreneurial leadership within a framework of controls for assessing and managing risk; defining, challenging 
and interrogating the Group’s strategic aims and direction; maintaining the policy and decision-making framework 
in which such strategic aims are implemented; ensuring that the necessary financial and human resources are 
in place to meet strategic aims; monitoring performance against key financial and non-financial indicators; 
succession planning; overseeing the system of risk management; setting values and standards in governance 
matters and monitoring policies and performance on corporate social responsibility. The Directors are also 
responsible for ensuring that obligations to shareholders and other stakeholders are understood and met and a 
satisfactory dialogue with shareholders is maintained. All Directors are equally accountable to the Company’s 
shareholders for the proper stewardship of its affairs and the long-term success of the Group.
The responsibility of the Directors is collective, taking into account their respective roles as Executive Directors and 
Non-Executive Directors. The Executive Directors are directly responsible for running the business operations and 
the Non-Executive Directors are responsible for constructively challenging proposals on strategy, scrutinising the 
performance of management, determining levels of remuneration and for succession planning for the Executive 
Directors. The Non-Executive Directors must also satisfy themselves on the integrity of financial information and 
that financial controls and systems of risk management are robust.
The Board reviews strategic issues on a regular basis and exercises control over the performance of the Group 
by agreeing on budgetary targets and monitoring performance against those targets. The Board has overall 
responsibility for the Group’s system of internal controls and risk management, as described on pages 63 to 64. 
Any decisions made by the Board on policies and strategy to be adopted by the Group or changes to current 
policies and strategy are made following presentations by the Executive Directors and a detailed process of 
review and challenge by the Board. Once made, the Executive Directors are fully empowered to implement 
those decisions.
Except for a formal schedule of matters which are reserved for decision and approval by the Board, the Board 
has delegated the day-to-day management of the Group to the Chief Executive Officer who is supported by the  56
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT (CONTINUED)  
Executive Directors and other members of the senior management team. The schedule of matters reserved for 
Board decision and approval are those significant to the Group as a whole due to their strategic, financial or 
reputational implications.
This schedule is reviewed and updated regularly and currently includes those matters set forth below:
• Approval and monitoring of the Group’s strategic aims and objectives, and approval of the annual operating 
budget.
• Strategic acquisitions by the Group.
• Major disposals of the Group’s assets or subsidiaries.
• Changes to the Group’s capital structure, the issue of any securities and material borrowing of the Group.
• Approval of the annual report and half-year results statement, accounting policies and practices or any matter 
having a material impact on future financial performance of the Group.
• Ensuring a sound system of internal control and risk management.
• Approval of all circulars, prospectuses and other documents issued to shareholders governed by the FCA’s 
Listing Rules, Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules or the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers.
• Approving Board appointments and removals, and approving policies relating to directors’ remuneration.
• The division of responsibility between the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer.
• Approval of terms of reference and membership of Board Committees.
• Considering and, where appropriate, approving directors’ conflicts of interest.
• Approval, subject to shareholder approval, of the appointment and remuneration of the auditors.
• Major changes in employee share schemes.
• Insurance and litigation.
The schedule of matters reserved to the Board is available on request from the Company Secretary or within the 
Investors section of the Group’s website at www.alliedminds.com.
The Board delegates specific responsibilities to certain Committees that assist the Board in carrying out its 
functions and ensure independent oversight of internal control and risk management. The three principal Board 
Committees (Audit, Remuneration and Nomination) play an essential role in supporting the Board in fulfilling its 
responsibilities and ensuring that the highest standards of corporate governance are maintained throughout the 
Group. Each Committee has its own terms of reference which set out the specific matters for which delegated 
authority has been given by the Board. The initial terms of reference for each of the Committees, which are 
fully compliant with the provisions of the Code and which reflect both best practice and the recommendations 
arising from the external evaluation process undergone by the Board and its Committees in connection with the 
Company’s IPO, were adopted by the Board during 2014. These were reviewed and updated in November 
2017, and will be reviewed annually on an ongoing basis and updated where necessary. All of these are  57

Board Size and Composition
As at 31 December 2017, there were six Directors on the Board: the Non-Executive Chairman, one Executive 
Director and four Non-Executive Directors. During the year, changes to the composition of the Board were:
• The appointment of Jill Smith as an Executive Director in March 2017 upon her appointment as Chief 
Executive Officer.
• The resignation of Chris Silva as an Executive Director in March 2017 in connection with his resignation as 
Chief Executive Officer.
• The appointment of Harry Rein as a Non-Executive Director in November 2017.
The biographies of all of the Directors are provided on pages 44 to 46.
The Company’s policy relating to the terms of appointment and the remuneration of both Executive and Non-
Executive Directors is detailed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 70 to 103.
The size and composition of the Board is regularly reviewed by the Board, and in particular the Nomination 
Committee, to ensure there is an appropriate and diverse mix of skills and experience on the Board.
The Company’s Articles of Association allow appointment of Directors by ordinary resolution and require all 
Directors to submit themselves for re-election by the shareholders at the Company’s AGM following their first 
appointment and thereafter at each AGM in respect of which they have held office for the two preceding AGMs 
and did not retire at either of them. In addition, each director who has held office with the Company for a 
continuous period of nine years or more must retire and offer themselves up for re-election at every AGM.
However, the Company has determined to continue its past practice, and all Directors will submit themselves for 
annual re-election by shareholders at the AGM of the Company to be held on 23 May 2018, with the exception 
of Rick Davis who is retiring from the Board after seven years of service to the Company. The Board recommends 
to shareholders the reappointment of all Directors retiring at the meeting and offering themselves for re-election on 
the basis that independent performance reviews demonstrated that they each contribute effectively to the Board 
and continue to display the appropriate level of commitment in their respective roles.
Diversity
The Board is committed to a culture that attracts and retains talented people to deliver outstanding performance 
and further enhance the success of the Company. In that culture, diversity across a range of criteria is valued, 
primarily in relation to skills, knowledge and experience and also in other criteria such as gender and ethnicity. 
The Company will give careful consideration to issues of overall Board balance and diversity in making new 
appointments to the Board and, in identifying suitable candidates, the Nomination Committee will seek candidates 
from a range of backgrounds, with the final decision being based on merit against objective criteria. In addition, 
the terms of reference of the Nomination Committee include a requirement for the Committee to consider diversity, 
including gender, in evaluating the composition of the Board and in identifying suitable candidates for Board 
appointments. A breakdown of employee gender showing the percentage of persons who were Directors of the 
Company and senior managers during the period covered by this Annual Report can be found on page 69. 58
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT (CONTINUED)  
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors provide a wide range of skills and experience to the Group. They bring their own 
senior level of experience in each of their respective fields, robust opinions and an independent judgement on 
issues of strategy, performance, risk and people. They are well-placed to constructively challenge and scrutinise 
the performance of management at Board and Committee meetings. The Code sets out the circumstances that 
should be relevant to the Board in determining whether each Non-Executive Director is independent. The Board 
considers Non-Executive Director independence on an annual basis as part of each Non-Executive Director’s 
performance evaluation. Having undertaken this review and with due regard to provision B.1.1 of the Code, 
the Board has concluded this year that all of the Non-Executive Directors are considered by the Board to be 
independent of management and free of any relationship or circumstance which could materially influence or 
interfere with, or affect, or appear to affect, the exercise of their independent judgement.
Non-Executive Directors are required to obtain the approval of the Chairman before taking on any further 
appointments and the Chairman and Executive Director require the approval of the Board before adding to their 
commitments. In all cases, the Directors must ensure that their external appointments do not involve excessive time 
commitment or cause a conflict of interest.
The Roles of Chairman and Chief Executive
Peter Dolan is the current Non-Executive Chairman. The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and 
the Chief Executive Officer is clearly established, set out in writing and agreed by the Board. The Chairman is 
responsible for the leadership and conduct of the Board, the conduct of the Group’s affairs and strategy and for 
ensuring effective communication with shareholders. The Chairman facilitates the full and effective contribution of 
Non-Executive Directors at Board and Committee meetings, ensures that they are kept well informed and ensures 
a constructive relationship between the Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors. The Chairman also 
ensures that the Board Committees carry out their duties, including reporting back to the Board either orally or 
in writing following their meetings at the next Board meeting. The Chairman was deemed to be independent of 
management upon his appointment to the role.
The role of the current Chief Executive Officer, Jill Smith, is to lead the delivery of the strategy and the executive 
management of the Group and its operating businesses. She is responsible, amongst other things, for the 
development and implementation of strategy and processes which enable the Group to meet the requirements 
of shareholders, for delivering the operating plans and budgets for the Group’s businesses, monitoring business 
performance against key performance indicators (KPIs) and reporting on these to the Board and for providing 
the appropriate environment to recruit, engage, retain and develop the high quality personnel needed to deliver 
the Group’s strategy.
Senior Independent Director
Rick Davis is the current Senior Independent Director. A key responsibility of the Senior Independent Director is to 
be available to shareholders in the event that they may feel it inappropriate to relay views through the Chairman 
or Chief Executive Officer. In addition, the Senior Independent Director serves as an intermediary between the 
rest of the Board and the Chairman where necessary and takes the lead when the Non-Executive Directors assess 
the Chairman’s performance and when the appointment of a new Chairman is considered. Further, the Senior 
Independent Director will lead the Board in its deliberations on any matters on which the Chairman is conflicted. 
Kevin Sharer, who was appointed to the Board in June 2015, will succeed Rick Davis as Senior Independent 
Director when Rick retires from the Board at the AGM of the Company to be held on 23 May 2018. 59

Board Support
The Company Secretary is responsible to the Board for ensuring Board procedures are followed, applicable rules 
and regulations are complied with and that the Board is advised on governance matters and relevant regulatory 
matters. All Directors have access to the impartial advice and services of the Company Secretary. There is 
also an agreed procedure for directors to take independent professional advice at the Company’s expense. In 
accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and a contractual Deed of Indemnity, directors have 
been granted an indemnity issued by the Company to the extent permitted by law in respect of liabilities incurred 
to third parties as a result of their office. The indemnity would not provide any coverage where a director is 
proved to have acted fraudulently or with willful misconduct. The Company has also arranged appropriate 
insurance coverage in respect of legal action against its directors and officers.
Board Meetings and Decisions
The Board meets regularly during the year, as well as when required by business need. The Board had eight 
scheduled Board meetings in 2017. During their term of service, each of the Directors were present at the 
meetings during the year as set out in the table on page 46. The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors also 
met without the presence of the Executive Directors four times during the year.
The schedule of Board and Committee meetings each year is, so far as is possible, determined before the 
commencement of that year and all Directors or, if appropriate, all Committee members are expected to attend 
each meeting. Supplementary meetings of the Board and/or the Committees are held as and when necessary. 
Each member of the Board receives detailed Board packs, including an agenda based upon the schedule 
of matters reserved for its approval, appropriate reports and briefing papers in advance of each scheduled 
meeting. If a director is unable to attend a meeting due to exceptional circumstances, he or she will still receive 
the supporting papers and is expected to discuss any matters he or she wishes to raise with the Chairman in 
advance of the meeting. The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary 
work together to ensure that the Directors receive relevant information to enable them to discharge their duties 
and that such information is accurate, timely and clear. This information includes quarterly management accounts 
containing analysis of performance against budget and other forecasts. Additional information is provided as 
appropriate or if requested. At each meeting, the Board receives information, reports and presentations from the 
Chief Executive Officer and, by invitation, other members of senior management as required. This ensures that 
all Directors are aware of, and are in a position to monitor effectively, the overall performance of the Group, its 
development and implementation of strategy and its management of risk.
Any matter requiring a decision by the Board is supported by a paper analysing the relevant aspects of the 
proposal including costs, benefits, potential risks involved and proposed executive management action and 
recommendations.
The majority of Board meetings are held at the Group’s offices in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, which gives 
members of the Company’s senior management team, as well as the senior managers of the subsidiaries, the 
opportunity to formally present to the Board on business development and new investment opportunities. This 
assists the Board in gaining a deeper understanding of the breadth, stage of development and diversity of the 
Group’s subsidiaries. Meetings between the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors, both with and without the 
presence of the Chief Executive Officer, are also held as the need arises.
Directors’ Conflicts of Interest
Each director has a statutory duty under the Companies Act to avoid a situation in which he or she has or can 
have a direct or indirect interest that conflicts or may potentially conflict with the interests of the Company.  60
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT (CONTINUED)  
This duty is in addition to the continuing duty that a director owes to the Company to disclose to the Board 
any transaction or arrangement under consideration by the Company in which he or she is interested. The 
Company’s Articles of Association permit the Board to authorise conflicts or potential conflicts of interest. The 
Board has established procedures for managing and, where appropriate, authorising any such conflicts or 
potential conflicts of interest. It is a recurring agenda item at all Board meetings and this gives the directors the 
opportunity to raise at the beginning of every Board meeting, any actual of potential conflict of interests that 
they may have on the matters to be discussed, or to update the Board on any change to a previous conflict of 
interest already declared. In deciding whether to authorise any conflict, the directors must have regard to their 
general duties under the Companies Act and their overriding obligation to act in a way they consider, in good 
faith, will be most likely to promote the Company’s success. In addition, the directors are able to impose limits or 
conditions when giving authorisation to a conflict or potential conflict of interest if they think this is appropriate. 
The authorisation of any conflict matter, and the terms of any authorisation, may be reviewed by the Board at any 
time. The Board believes that the procedures established to deal with conflicts of interest are operating effectively.
Induction, Awareness and Development
A comprehensive induction process is in place for new directors. The programme is tailored to the needs of each 
individual director and agreed with him or her so that he or she can gain a better understanding of the Group 
and its businesses. This will generally include an overview of the Group and its businesses, structure, functions 
and strategic aims; site visits to the Group’s head office in Boston, Massachusetts, USA; and, upon request, 
site visits to a number of the Group’s subsidiary companies, which will include meeting with such companies’ 
management and a presentation from them on their businesses. In addition, the Company facilitates sessions as 
appropriate with the Group’s advisers, in particular its joint corporate brokers, Credit Suisse International and 
Numis Securities Limited, as well as with appropriate governance specialists, to ensure that any new directors 
are fully aware of and understand their responsibilities and obligations as a director of a listed company and 
of the governance framework within which they must operate. A new director may also seek to meet major 
shareholders.
In order to ensure that the Directors continue to further their understanding of the issues facing the Group, the 
Board is also exposed to the early-stage opportunities in which the Group has invested through presentations 
at Board meetings by relevant members of the Group’s staff. In addition, other members of senior management 
present to the Board to enhance the Board’s awareness of how the Group operates on a day-to-day basis 
and how such functions operate so as to assist in the execution of the Group’s core strategy of systematically 
developing an IP commercialisation company focused on venture creation and early stage investments within the 
technology and life science sectors, which sources, operates and funds a portfolio of subsidiary businesses to 
generate long-term value for its investors and stakeholders.
As a further aspect of their ongoing development, each Director also receives feedback on his or her performance 
following the Board’s performance evaluation in each year and, through the Company Secretary, access is 
facilitated to relevant training and development opportunities including those relevant to the Non-Executive 
Directors’ membership on the Board’s Committees.
Board Effectiveness and Performance Evaluation
A performance evaluation of the Board and its Committees is carried out annually to ensure that they continue 
to be effective and that each of the Directors demonstrates commitment to his or her respective role and has 
sufficient time to meet his or her commitment to the Company. The Board conducts an internally facilitated Board 
evaluation led by the Chairman, assisted by the Company Secretary, and covering the effectiveness of the Board 
as a whole, its individual Directors and its Committees. This review includes each of the Board and Committee  61
   
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT (CONTINUED)  
Management & Governance
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
61
members completing a detailed and tailored survey and one-to-one discussions between the Chairman and 
each of the individual Directors. A summary of the results of the review, together with the Chairman and 
Company Secretary’s observations and recommendations, are prepared and shared with members of the Board. 
In addition to the above, the Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, appraise the 
Chairman’s performance, following which the Senior Independent Director provides feedback to the Chairman. 
The performance of each of the Directors on the Board is reviewed by the Chairman and the operational 
performance of the other Executive Directors is reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer as part of the annual 
appraisal process. In addition to the aforementioned annual reviews, the performance of Executive Directors is 
reviewed by the Board on an ongoing basis, as deemed necessary, in the absence of the Executive Director 
under review.
During the 2017 financial year, the Board assessed its own effectiveness through an internal Board evaluation 
process. This process was based on: a review of documentation including Board and Committee terms of reference, 
the completion of a survey to Directors comprising quantitative and qualitative questions; and discussions with 
all Board members and a number of stakeholders who regularly interact with the Board, including the Company 
Secretary.
The results were analysed by the Chairman and the Company Secretary, and a detailed discussion was 
facilitated with the Board to outline the observations and recommendations. Overall it was concluded that the 
Board continues to work effectively. The changes to the Board composition in 2015, 2016 and 2017 have 
resulted in a well-balanced Board with a range of skills and experience. The Board did not recommend any 
changes it considered necessary.
COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD
The composition of the three Committees of the Board and the attendance of the members throughout the year 
is set out in the table on page 46. The terms of reference of each Committee are available on request from the 
Company Secretary or within the Investors section of the Group’s website at www.alliedminds.com.
Remuneration and Audit Committees
Separate reports on the role, composition, responsibilities and operation of the Remuneration Committee and the 
Audit Committee are set out on pages 101 to 102, and pages 104 to 107, respectively, and are incorporated 
by reference into this Corporate Governance Report.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee leads the process for Board appointments, re-election and succession of directors 
and the Chairman. Its key objective is to ensure that the Board comprises individuals with the necessary skills, 
knowledge and experience to ensure that it is effective in discharging its duties. It is responsible for making 
recommendations to the Board and its Committees concerning the composition and skills of the Board including 
any changes considered necessary in the identification and nomination of new directors, the reappointment 
of existing directors and the appointment of members to the Board’s Committees. It also assesses the roles of 
the existing directors in office to ensure there continues to be a balanced Board in terms of skills, knowledge, 
experience and diversity. In addition, the Nomination Committee reviews the senior leadership needs of the 
Group to enable it to compete effectively in the marketplace. The Nomination Committee also advises the 
Board on succession planning for Executive Director appointments, although the Board itself is responsible for 
succession generally. 62
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT (CONTINUED)  
The Committee is chaired by Rick Davis and its other members as at 31 December 2017 were Jeff Rohr and Kevin 
Sharer, being a majority of independent Non-Executive Directors as prescribed by the Code. The Nomination 
Committee meets as and when required or requested by the Board and met three times during 2017 to review 
the structure, size and composition of the Board, following which it discussed the conclusions with the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive Officer. Messrs. Rohr and Sharer were present at all meetings during the year, and Mr. 
Davis missed two meetings due to unexpected scheduling conflicts.
Before selecting new appointees to the Board, the Nomination Committee shall consider the balance, skill, 
knowledge, independence, diversity (including gender) and experience on the Board to ensure that a suitable 
balance is maintained. The Committee shall adopt a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment 
of new directors to the Board. Consideration shall always be given as to whether identified candidates have 
sufficient time available to devote to the role. When searching for appropriate candidates, the Committee shall 
give consideration to using an external search company, but may also consider candidates who are proposed 
by existing Board members or employees of the Group. When the Committee has found a suitable candidate, 
the Chairman of the Committee will make a proposal to the whole Board. The appointment of a candidate is the 
responsibility of the whole Board following recommendation from the Committee. The Committee did not use the 
services of an external search company in 2017.
As part of its annual duties in 2017, the Committee and the full Board fulfilled its duties which resulted in the 
appointment of Jill Smith as an Executive Director in March 2017, and the appointment of Harry Rein as a Non-
Executive Officer in November 2017. The Committee did not use an external search firm to identify and recruit 
Mr. Rein, as he was known to members of the Board as a result of his prior business experience leading several 
venture capital firms, including GE Ventures, and his service on several public and private company boards. In 
the year ahead, the Nomination Committee will continue to assess the Board’s size and composition and how 
it may be enhanced.
Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director Succession
Over the past few years, the Company has been taking steps taken to enhance its Non-Executive Director 
representation on the Board, which included the appointment of Jill Smith in January 2016. Ms. Smith’s extensive 
leadership experience at a number of public and private technology companies was seen as a perfect complement 
to the life science and other leadership experience possessed by Messrs. Dolan and Sharer.
When the Board determined to accept the resignation of Mr. Silva in March 2017, the Company was well 
placed to accelerate an orderly CEO succession and transition plan. The Board, with full participation of all the 
Chairman of the Board and all other Non-Executive Directors, spent time considering the future strategic direction 
of the Group and, with input from advisors to the Group, compiled a CEO role profile. The profile contained a 
brief of the requirements and the desired skill-set that a potential successor would need. This brief emphasised the 
importance that the Board and Committee placed on the CEO being a great business leader and commercial 
operator.
The Board quickly determined that Ms. Smith’s experience and skills, and most importantly, her track record of 
successful commercialisation and operating experience, made her well-qualified for the CEO role. Ms. Smith 
interviewed with each of the Non-Executive Directors and certain advisors to the Group, and outlined her 
preliminary strategy for the Group. Each Non-Executive Director made it clear that they supported Ms. Smith’s 
appointment, and then Ms. Smith met with Mr. Sharer to agree on a remuneration proposal. The Nomination 
Committee then recommended that Ms. Smith be appointed as interim Chief Executive Officer and Executive 
Director, with effect from 10 March 2017. 63

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

The Board was unanimous in supporting the appointment of Jill Smith as interim Chief Executive Officer. It was 
felt that her service as a Non-Executive Director and knowledge of the Company and its business, taken together 
with her extensive international leadership and operating experience and track record of delivering commercial 
success, would bring the right experience and skills to the role at an important point in Allied Minds’ development.
On 26 May 2017, Ms. Smith accepted the Board’s offer to transition to serve as “permanent” Chief Executive 
Officer and President. The revised terms of Ms. Smith’s employment, including base salary, annual incentive 
bonus awards, equity grants and other terms of remuneration are detailed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
on pages 70 to 103. The terms of Ms. Smith’s service contract and remuneration are in accordance with the 
Remuneration Policy, subject to the considerations set forth in the approach to remuneration recruitment set forth 
in this Annual Report.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board fully recognises the importance of the guidance contained in Guidance on Risk Management, Internal 
Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting (Financial Reporting Council). The Group’s internal controls 
and risk management systems, which are Group wide, were in place during the whole of 2017, were reviewed 
by the Board and Audit Committee and were considered to be effective throughout the year ended 31 December 
2017 and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts.
The Board and Audit Committee are responsible for establishing and monitoring internal control systems and 
for reviewing the effectiveness of these systems. The Board views the effective operation of a rigorous system of 
internal control as critical to the success of the Group; however, it recognises that such systems are designed to 
manage rather than eliminate risk of failure and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. The key elements of the Group’s internal control system, all of which have been 
in place during the financial year and up to the date these financial statements were approved, are as follows:
Control Environment and Procedures
The Group has a clear organisational structure with defined responsibilities and accountabilities. It adopts the 
highest values surrounding quality, integrity and ethics, and these values are documented and communicated 
clearly throughout the whole organisation.
Detailed written policies and procedures have been established covering key operating and compliance risk 
areas. These are reviewed and updated at least once a year. The effectiveness of the systems of internal control 
is reviewed at least annually by the Board. The Board considers that the controls have been effective for the year 
ended 31 December 2017.
Identification and Evaluation of Risks
The Board actively identifies and evaluates the risks inherent in the business, and ensures that appropriate controls 
and procedures are in place to manage these risks. The Board obtains an update regarding the subsidiary 
businesses on a regular basis, and reviews the performance of the Group and its subsidiaries on a quarterly 
basis, although performance of specific investments may be reviewed more frequently if deemed appropriate. 
The Board also obtains a risk management report from members of senior management on a regular basis. The 
key risks and uncertainties faced by the Group, as well as the relevant mitigations, are set out on pages 36 to 
43. 64
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT (CONTINUED)  
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The operations of the Group and the implementation of its objectives and strategy are subject to a number of 
key risks and uncertainties. Risks are formally reviewed by the Board and Audit Committee at least annually and 
appropriate procedures are put in place to monitor and, to the extent possible, mitigate these risks. Were more 
than one of the risks to occur together, the overall impact on the Group may be compounded. A summary of the 
key risks affecting the Group and the steps taken to manage these is set out on pages 36 to 43.
Information and Financial Reporting Systems
The Group evaluates and manages significant risks associated with the process for preparing consolidated 
accounts by having in place systems and controls that ensure adequate accounting records are maintained and 
transactions are recorded accurately and fairly to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with IFRS. The Board approves the annual operating budgets and each quarter receives details of actual 
performance measured against the budget.
RELATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS
The Company is committed to a continuous dialogue with shareholders as it believes that this is essential to ensure 
a greater understanding of and confidence amongst its shareholders in the medium and longer term strategy of 
the Group. It is the responsibility of the Board as a whole to ensure that a satisfactory dialogue does take place.
The Board’s primary shareholder contact is through each of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The 
Senior Independent Director and other Directors, as appropriate, make themselves available for contact with 
major shareholders and other stakeholders in order to understand their issues and concerns. The Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer met with major shareholders, IP commercialisation sector brokers and analysts, and other 
stakeholders, on numerous occasions throughout the year in order to discuss the Company and its business.
The Company uses the AGM as an opportunity to communicate with its shareholders. Notice of the AGM, 
which will be held at 11 a.m. BST on 23 May 2018 at the offices of DLA Piper UK LLP, 3 Noble Street, London 
EC2V 7EE, United Kingdom, is enclosed with this Report and Accounts. In accordance with the Code, the 
Notice of AGM is sent to shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting. Details of the resolutions 
and the explanatory notes thereto are included with the Notice. To ensure compliance with the Code, the Board 
proposes separate resolutions for each issue and proxy forms which allows shareholders who are unable to 
attend the AGM to vote on each resolution. The results of all proxy voting shall be published on the Group’s 
website after the meeting and at the meeting itself to those shareholders who attend. Shareholders who attend 
the AGM will have the opportunity to ask questions and the Chairman and the Executive Directors are expected 
to be available to take questions.
The Group’s website at www.alliedminds.com is the primary source of information on the Group. The website 
includes an overview of the activities of the Group, details of its subsidiary companies and its key university and 
federal government partnerships, and details of all recent Group and subsidiary business announcements.
POLITICAL EXPENDITURE
It is the Board’s policy not to incur political expenditure or otherwise make cash contributions to political parties 
and it has no intention of changing that policy. 65

POLICY STATEMENT
Allied Minds aims to conduct its business in a socially responsible manner, to contribute to the communities in 
which it operates and to respect the needs of its employees and all of its stakeholders.
The Group is committed to growing the business while ensuring a safe environment for employees as well as 
minimising the overall impact on the environment.
Allied Minds endeavours to conduct its business in accordance with established best practice, to be a 
responsible employer and to adopt values and standards designed to help guide staff in their conduct and 
business relationships.
GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS
Given the overall size of the Group, we consider the direct environmental impact of the Group as relatively 
low. However, we firmly recognise our responsibility to ensure that our business operates in an environmentally 
responsible and sustainable manner. The Group complies with all current regulations on emissions including 
GHG emissions, where such regulation exists in our markets.
Though the Group’s day-to-day operational activities have a relatively limited impact on the environment, we do 
recognise that the more significant impact occurs indirectly through the nature and operations of the companies 
that we choose to support with human and financial capital.
The Group therefore considers it important to establish and nurture businesses that comply with existing applicable 
environmental, ethical and social legislation. It is also important that these businesses can demonstrate that an 
appropriate strategy is in place to meet future applicable legislative and regulatory requirements and that these 
businesses can operate to specific industry standards, striving for best practice.
The section below includes our mandatory reporting of GHG emissions. The reporting period is the same as the 
Group’s financial year.
Organisation Boundary and Scope of Emissions
We have reported on all of the emission sources required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013. These sources fall with the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
An operational control approach has been used in order to define our organisational boundary. This is the basis 
for determining the Scope 1 and 2 emissions for which the Group is responsible.
Methodology
For the Group’s reporting, the Group has employed the services of a specialist adviser, Verco, to quantify and 
verify the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions associated with the Group’s operations.
The following methodology was applied by Verco in the preparation and presentation of this data:
• the Greenhouse Gas Protocol published by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the 
World Resources Institute (WBCSD/WRI GHG Protocol);
• application of appropriate emission factors to the Group’s activities to calculate GHG emissions; 67
   
SUSTAINABILITY (CONTINUED)  
Management & Governance
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
67
• scope 2 reporting methods – application of location-based and market-based emission factors for electricity 
supplies;
• inclusion of all the applicable Kyoto gases, expressed in carbon dioxide equivalents, or CO2e; and
• presentation of gross emissions as the Group does not purchase carbon credits (or equivalents).
Absolute Emissions
The total Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from the Group’s operations in the year ending 31 December 2017 
were:
• 907.9 tonnes of CO
2
 equivalent (tCO
2
e) using a ‘location-based’ emission factor methodology for Scope 
2 emissions; and
• 912.4 tonnes of CO
2
 equivalent (tCO
2
e) using a ‘market-based’ emission factor methodology for Scope 2 
emissions.
This is the second year of reporting for the Group so we can now show a comparison between 2017 and 
2016. There have been a number of changes to the Group’s operations since 2016 with the closing of some 
business entities but also the opening of new entities.
Overall, there has been a drop in total emissions. There was a small increase in scope 1 emissions, but there 
was a decrease in scope 2 emissions (both location-based and market-based).
Intensity Ratio
As well as reporting the absolute emissions, the Group’s GHG emissions are reported below on the metrics of 
tonnes of CO
2
 equivalent per employee and tonnes of CO
2
 equivalent per square foot of the occupied areas. For 
some of the companies, floor area was not known therefore they are not included in the kg per square footage 
of office space intensity metric. These are the most appropriate metrics given that the majority of emissions result 
from the operation of the Group’s offices and the day-to-day activities of the employees.
Target and Baselines
Given the comparatively low GHG impact of the Group’s operations, the Group’s objective is to maintain or 
reduce its GHG emissions per employee and per square foot of office space each year and will report each 
year whether it has been successful in this regard.
For 2017, the intensity metrics have decreased from 0.012 tCO
2
e per ft
2
 to 0.010 tCO
2
e per ft
2
 using the 
location-based method and decreased from 0.013 tCO
2
e per ft
2
 to 0.010 tCO
2
e per ft
2
 using the market-based 
method. The main source of this is due to reduction in occupied space and a reduction in total emissions. 68

Understanding the Indirect Environmental Impacts of Our Business Activities
The Group’s day-to-day operational activities have a limited impact on the environment. We do, however, 
recognise that the more significant impact occurs indirectly, through the investment decisions we make and the 
operation of the companies we choose to invest in. The Group therefore considers it important to establish and 
invest in businesses that comply with existing applicable environmental, ethical and social legislation. It is also 
important that these businesses can demonstrate that an appropriate strategy is in place to meet future applicable 
legislative and regulatory requirements and that these businesses can operate to specific industry standards, 
striving for best practice.
OUR BUSINESS ETHICS AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
The Group seeks to conduct all of its operating and business activities in an honest, ethical and socially responsible 
manner. We are committed to acting professionally, fairly and with integrity in all our business dealings and 
relationships wherever we operate, and for its directors and staff to have due regard to the interest of all of its 
stakeholders including investors, university and government partners, employees, suppliers and the businesses in 
which the Group invests.
We take a zero tolerance approach to bribery and corruption and implement and enforce effective systems 
to counter bribery. The Group is bound by the laws of the UK, including the Bribery Act 2010, and has 
implemented policies and procedures to address such laws, as well as the laws in each jurisdiction where the 
Group operates, including the US.
The Group’s management and employees are fundamental to our success and as a result we are committed to 
encouraging the ongoing development of our staff with the aim of maximising the Group’s overall performance. 
Emphasis is placed on staff development through work-based learning, with senior members of staff acting as 
coaches and mentors. Allied Minds has continued to employ regular all-staff update meetings as the main source 
of employee communication.
EMPLOYEE DIVERSITY AND EMPLOYMENT POLICIES
The Group seeks to operate as a responsible employer and has adopted standards which promote corporate 
values designed to help and guide employees in their conduct and business relationships. The Group seeks to 
comply with all laws, regulations and rules applicable to its business and to conduct the business in line with 
applicable established best practice. The Group’s policy is one of equal opportunity in the selection, training, 
career development and promotion of employees, regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnic origin, 
religion and whether disabled or otherwise. The Group had 184 employees as at 31 December 2017. A 
breakdown of employees by gender as at 31 December 2017 can be seen in the illustrations below. Allied 
Minds supports the rights of all people as set out in the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and ensures 
that all transactions the Group enters into uphold these principles.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT     
STATEMENT BY CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
I am pleased to present, on behalf of the Board, the Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 
2017. Our Remuneration Policy, which was approved by shareholders at our 2016 AGM, was applied in 
2017. During 2017, the Remuneration Committee continued to review all of the elements of remuneration for 
Executive Directors and senior management to assess whether the Remuneration Policy approved at the 2016 
AGM was meeting its design objectives. Based on this review and the application of the Remuneration Policy, 
the Remuneration Committee resolved that no further changes were necessary or appropriate, and the current 
Remuneration Policy will remain in effect.
The Work of the Remuneration Committee
The Committee met on six occasions during the year. Mr. Rohr was present at all meetings during the year, 
Mr. Davis missed two meetings due to unexpected scheduling conflicts, and I missed one meeting due to 
an unexpected scheduling conflict. I met several times during the year with the Chief Executive Officer and 
other members of senior management in order to review all elements of remuneration and their operation. The 
Committee also received professional advice from Korn Ferry where appropriate.
A key objective of this review was to ensure the Remuneration Policy remained appropriate for a UK listed 
company, whilst also ensuring that it was designed to continue to attract and retain US-based management and 
employees of the highest calibre. The programme is weighted toward rewarding entrepreneurial achievement 
and the creation of shareholder value over time. During the year, the key activities carried out by the Committee 
were:
• Conducted a review of all elements of remuneration for Executive Directors and senior management, including 
in connection with the Chief Executive Officer transition;
• Reviewed feedback received from major shareholders and shareholder advisory services in connection with 
the adoption and implementation of the revised Remuneration Policy in 2016;
• In connection with the annual review of the Remuneration Policy, the Remuneration Committee resolved that 
no further changes were necessary or appropriate, and the current Remuneration Policy will remain in effect;
• Reviewed the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) to ensure that it continues to advance the Committee’s policy to 
provide a competitive, performance-linked, long-term incentive mechanism to align the interests of management 
and shareholders;
• Determined the cash incentive bonus awards for the Executive Officers for the last financial year;
• Determined base salaries of the Executive Directors, for the period starting 1 January 2018;
• Issued LTIP awards on 15 May 2017 (annual grants), 20 June 2017 (new hire grants) and 6 November 
2017 (new hire grants);
• Reviewed progress against 2015, 2016 and 2017 LTIP award performance targets for the last financial 
year;
• Established 2015, 2016 and 2017 LTIP award performance targets for the current financial year; and 71
   
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED)  
Management & Governance
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
71
• Reviewed the remuneration reporting regulations in connection with the review of the Group’s Remuneration 
Policy and preparation of the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Objectives of the Remuneration Policy
Pursuant to the current Remuneration Policy, the Committee focuses on simple and transparent market competitive 
remuneration and incentive schemes. The current Remuneration Policy is designed to:
• attract, retain and motivate high calibre US-based senior management, and to focus them on the delivery of 
the Company’s long-term strategic and business objectives;
• promote a strong, fair and sustainable performance culture;
• incentivise growth and the achievement of milestones;
• align the interests of Executive Directors and members of the senior management team with those of 
shareholders through equity ownership; and
• be simple to understand and implement, and designed taking into account best practice guidelines for UK 
listed companies.
The key components of remuneration are set out in detail within the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders 
at the 2016 AGM.
Performance and Reward for 2017
As detailed in the Annual Report on Remuneration, the Committee determined to provide cash incentive bonus 
awards and LTIP awards to the Executive Directors that reflected the level of performance and achievement in 
2017.
Shareholder Feedback
The Committee recognises that building a close relationship with shareholders can complement the work of the 
Committee in developing the Remuneration Policy. During 2017, we received feedback from major shareholders 
and shareholder advisory services with respect to our remuneration programme. One of our overarching aims 
has been to implement the Remuneration Policy which closely aligns the interests of our senior executives and 
our shareholders.
We continue to appreciate any feedback shareholders may have.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED)  
What is in this report?
The Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out the Remuneration Policy for the Company on pages 74 to 84, 
and describes the implementation of that Remuneration Policy. It has been prepared in accordance with the 
Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, as amended. The 
Remuneration Policy was developed taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
2016, the Listing Rules and shareholders’ executive remuneration guidelines. The Remuneration Policy for the 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors was put to a binding shareholder vote at the 2016 AGM and approved 
by shareholders. The Remuneration Policy took formal effect from that date, and remains in effect.
The Statement by Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on pages 70 to 71, together with the Annual Report 
on Remuneration on pages 85 to 103, will be subject to an advisory vote at the AGM.
Remuneration Policy Overview
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for determining remuneration for the Executive Directors, and 
monitoring the level and structure of remuneration for senior management. The Committee’s terms of reference 
are available on the Company’s website.
The Committee designed this Remuneration Policy with close regard to market practice in other UK listed 
companies so as to ensure that the arrangements are appropriately competitive and structured in line with best 
practice. However, the Remuneration Policy also retains some of the key elements which helped to drive the 
Group’s success prior to IPO, and other customary service arrangements and incentive elements for US-based 
management and employees.
Allied Minds’ success depends in part on the talent of its management and employees. The Company has 
a highly skilled workforce, with significant expertise throughout the Group across a range of science and 
technology disciplines, as well as a highly experienced management team. Allied Minds seeks to ensure that 
its management team and its employees and consultants working within the Group’s individual businesses are 
fairly and appropriately rewarded and incentivised. The Company seeks to achieve this through a combination 
of competitive levels of remuneration that is appropriate to the scale of responsibility and performance of the 
employee or consultant, and incentives tied directly to increasing shareholder value.
The Group operates in the highly competitive US market, and attraction and retention of individual talent is 
important to success of the Group’s businesses. Allied Minds deploys a careful and considered approach to 
remuneration with the objective of attracting, motivating and retaining individuals of the necessary calibre. It is 
important to note that each national market for talent is different, making cross-border comparisons very difficult. 
In addition to general standard of living costs, there are large differences with respect to taxes, pensions, 
provision of cars, and medical plans and costs, among many others.
The Company believes that it is important that remuneration is weighted toward rewarding entrepreneurial 
achievement and the creation of shareholder value over time as its employees work toward the commercialisation 
of scientific and technological innovations. Accordingly, Allied Minds has established share incentive plans with 
the aim of incentivising and rewarding employees and Directors to achieve long term shareholder value. The 
Directors believe the share incentive arrangements at the level of the subsidiary businesses, as well as the overall 
Group, are an important factor in the promotion of shareholder value creation. 73

The aim of the Remuneration Policy is to attract, retain and motivate high calibre senior management and 
employees, and to focus them on the delivery of the Company’s long-term strategic and business objectives, to 
promote a strong and sustainable performance culture, incentivise growth and the achievement of milestones, 
and to align the interests of Executive Directors and senior management team with those of shareholders through 
equity ownership. In promoting these objectives the Remuneration Policy aims to be simple in design, transparent 
and understandable both to participants and shareholders, and has been structured so as to adhere to the 
principles of good corporate governance and appropriate risk management. 74
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED)  
REMUNERATION POLICY (PAGES 74 TO 84)
The Remuneration Policy for the Executive and Non-Executive Directors was approved by shareholders at the 
2016 AGM. The Remuneration Policy took formal effect from that date. The Remuneration Committee will 
consider the Remuneration Policy annually to ensure that it continues to align with the Company’s strategic 
objectives; however, it is intended that the Remuneration Policy will apply for three years from the 2016 AGM. 
If, during that timeframe, any amendments need to be made to the Remuneration Policy, it will be presented to 
the shareholders to be voted on.
How the Views of Shareholders and Employees are Taken into Account
The Committee does not formally consult directly with employees on executive pay but does receive periodic 
updates in relation to salary and bonus reviews across the Company. As set out in the Remuneration Policy table 
below, in setting remuneration for the Executive Directors, the Committee takes note of the overall approach to 
reward for employees in the Company and salary increases will ordinarily be considered in light of those of the 
wider workforce. Thus, the Committee is satisfied that the decisions made in relation to Executive Directors’ pay 
are made with an appropriate understanding of the wider workforce.
Any feedback received from time to time from shareholders will be considered as part of the Committee’s annual 
review of the Remuneration Policy. The Committee will seek to engage with shareholders and their representative 
bodies when it is proposed that any material changes are to be made to the Remuneration Policy. The voting 
outcomes from the 2016 AGM are available on page 103.
The Future Remuneration Policy Table for Executive Directors
The total remuneration package is structured so that variable elements (annual bonus and long-term incentives) 
make up a significant proportion of the package, with the emphasis on variable pay focused on long-term 
incentives. The tables below summarise the key aspects of the Company’s Remuneration Policy for Executive 
Directors. 75

its ability to recruit and retain 
Executive Directors. Salaries 
are set to achieve this 
objective.
The Committee wishes to 
ensure that fixed costs are 
minimised and that total 
actual payments to executives 
will be driven to a more 
significant extent through the 
operation of the performance 
related elements of the 
package.
As described in this 
Remuneration Policy, the 
performance elements of 
total reward are directly 
linked to the achievement 
of the Company’s strategic 
objectives.
An Executive Director’s basic 
salary is considered by the 
Committee on appointment 
and normally reviewed once 
per year or when there is a 
significant change to role or 
responsibility.
When making a 
determination as to the 
appropriate remuneration, 
the Committee, where it is 
relevant, benchmarks the 
remuneration against the 
Company’s peer groups.
For the purpose of 
benchmarking salaries and 
other remuneration, the 
principal peer grouping used 
by the Company consists 
of companies within similar 
industry sectors which are 
either US or UK listed with a 
range of capitalisations.
The results of benchmarking 
will, however only be one of 
a number of factors taken into 
account by the Remuneration 
Committee and which will 
include:
•  scale, scope and 
responsibility of the role;
•  skills and experience of 
the individual;
•  retention risk;
•  base salary of other 
employees; and
•  economic environment.
There is no prescribed 
maximum annual salary. The 
Committee seeks to ensure 
that the salaries conform to 
its strategy, whilst remaining 
competitive against similar 
roles within the relevant peer 
groups.
There are no performance 
conditions attached to the 
payment of salary although 
there are a number of 
performance-based factors 
both at the individual and 
Company level that influence 
the level of salaries provided 
to Executive Directors 
for annual performance 
appraisals. 76

Benefits The Committee’s intention is to 
provide a benefits package 
in line with US employment 
market practice.
The Company is required to 
provide this benefits package 
in order to be competitive 
and to maintain its ability to 
recruit and retain Executive 
Directors.
The Executive Directors may 
be entitled to the following 
benefits:
•  life insurance;
• disability insurance;
•  medical benefits and 
dental care;
•  a car allowance; and
•  an annual payment to 
cover personal legal and 
tax advice.
Executive Directors may 
also participate in any 
all-employee share plans 
that may be operated by 
the Group from time to time 
on the same terms as other 
employees.
Additional benefits, which 
may include relocation 
expenses, housing allowance 
or other benefits-in-kind, 
may be provided in certain 
circumstances if considered 
appropriate and reasonable 
by the Committee, including 
as may be required on 
recruitment.
The cost of benefits provided 
changes in accordance 
with market conditions and 
will, therefore, determine 
the maximum amount that 
would be paid in the form of 
benefits. There is therefore no 
overall maximum opportunity 
under this component of the 
Remuneration Policy.
There are no performance 
conditions attached to the 
payment of benefits. 77

Cash Incentive 
Bonus Awards
The cash incentive bonus 
award, taken together with 
base salary, is required in 
order to be competitive and 
to maintain the ability to 
recruit and retain Executive 
Directors. Cash incentive 
bonus awards are set to 
achieve this objective.
As described in this 
Remuneration Policy, the 
performance elements of 
cash incentive bonus awards 
and total reward are directly 
linked to the achievement 
of the Company’s strategic 
objectives.
The Committee and senior 
management review the 
Group’s management by 
objectives (MBOs) annually 
prior to the start of each 
financial year to ensure 
the detailed performance 
measures and weightings are 
appropriate and continue to 
support the business strategy.
Annual MBOs, including 
financial, operational, 
technical and other 
performance targets and their 
weightings for the upcoming 
year are set at or around the 
start of each financial year.
An Executive Director’s cash 
incentive bonus award is 
considered by the Committee 
upon completion of each 
financial year. The decision 
to provide any cash incentive 
bonus award and the amount 
and terms of any such award, 
are determined solely by 
the level of achievement 
against the MBOs set by the 
Committee at the start of the 
financial year.
There are no caps on the 
amount of bonus which may 
be paid. However, each year 
the Committee determines 
the maximum opportunity for 
each Executive Director.
When making a 
determination as to the 
appropriate maximum bonus, 
the Committee, where it is 
relevant, benchmarks the 
remuneration against the 
Company’s peer groups.
For the purpose of 
benchmarking cash incentive 
bonus awards and other 
remuneration, the principal 
peer grouping used by 
the Company consists of 
companies within similar 
industry sectors which are 
either US or UK listed with a 
range of capitalisations.
As noted in “Operation”, 
the decision to provide any 
cash incentive bonus award 
and the amount and terms 
of any such award, are 
determined solely by the level 
of achievement against the 
MBOs set by the Committee 
at the start of the financial 
year.
The Committee may consider 
any and all performance 
criteria in setting the annual 
MBOs to be used in the 
determination to provide an 
award, and may generally 
consider:
•  the general performance 
of the Group, including 
financial, operational, 
technical and other 
performance targets; and
•  the individual 
performance of the 
Executive Director.
Weighting will be primarily 
towards Group, and not 
individual, MBO performance 
for Executive Directors.
Performance will typically be 
measured over one year. 78

Pension It is the Committee’s intention 
to provide pension benefits 
in line with US employment 
market practice.
The Company is not required 
to provide pension benefits 
in order to be competitive 
and to ensure its ability to 
recruit and retain Executive 
Directors.
No element of the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration is 
pensionable. The Group 
does not operate any pension 
scheme or other scheme 
providing retirement or 
similar benefits. The Group 
does not contribute to any 
personal pension schemes for 
employees.
However, the Company 
offers a retirement plan in 
accordance with subsection 
401(k) of the Internal Revenue 
Code (401(k) Plan) in which 
Executive Directors may make 
voluntary pre-tax contributions 
toward their own retirement. 
The Company does not make 
any payments or contributions 
to such 401(k) Plan.
None. None. 79

Allied Minds 
Long Term 
Incentive Plan 
(LTIP)
The LTIP provides 
a competitive, 
performance-linked 
long-term incentive 
mechanism that will:
•  attract, retain 
and motivate 
individuals with the 
required personal 
attributes, skills and 
experience;
•  provide a real 
incentive to 
achieve the 
Company’s long-
term strategic 
objectives; and
•  align the interests 
of management 
and shareholders.
The LTIP is reviewed 
annually at or around 
the start of each 
financial year to 
ensure the detailed 
performance measures 
and weightings are 
appropriate and 
continue to support the 
business strategy.
Financial and/or non-
financial performance 
targets are set at or 
around the start of each 
financial year.
Awards under the LTIP 
to Executive Directors 
will normally take 
the form of restricted 
share units (RSUs) (a 
form of conditional 
share award) in 
respect of shares in 
Allied Minds (although 
instruments with similar 
economic effect may 
be used if considered 
appropriate.)
Calculations of the 
achievement of 
the vesting targets 
are reviewed and 
approved by the 
Committee.
Awards are subject 
to cancellation or 
clawback provisions 
under which in the 
event of a material 
correction of any 
accounts of the 
Company used to 
assess satisfaction 
of any performance 
conditions, or in the 
event of a participant’s 
gross misconduct, 
awards may be 
reduced, adjusted 
or cancelled as 
determined by the 
Committee. Clawback 
applies for the two 
year period following 
vesting.
Under the terms of the 
LTIP, the maximum value 
of ordinary shares over 
which awards under 
the LTIP may be granted 
to a participant in any 
financial year of the 
Company may not 
generally exceed 300% 
of base salary for that 
financial year, unless 
circumstances arise 
which the Committee 
believe justify granting 
an award outside this 
limit. The Committee 
would only envisage 
overriding the 300% 
limit in exceptional 
circumstances such 
as where there was a 
need to do so to attract 
a new executive.
Notwithstanding 
the maximum value 
permitted under the 
terms of the LTIP, each 
year the Committee 
determines the 
maximum opportunity 
for each Executive 
Director.
When making a 
determination as to the 
appropriate maximum 
LTIP award, the 
Committee where it is 
relevant, benchmarks 
the remuneration 
against the Company’s 
peer groups.
For the purpose of 
benchmarking LTIP 
awards and other 
remuneration, the 
principal peer grouping 
used by the Company 
consists of companies 
within similar industry 
sectors which are either 
US or UK listed with a 
range of capitalisations.
Specific performance targets may vary from year 
to year in accordance with priorities support the 
business strategy.
In respect of the LTIP awards made in 2014 and 
2015, vesting is dependent upon performance 
metrics measured as follows:
•  60% of each award will be subject to 
performance conditions based on the 
Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) 
performance in respect of a three-year 
period; and
•  40% of each award will be subject to 
performance conditions based on a basket 
of shareholder value metrics, including, but 
not limited to:
(i) the increase in quality of pipeline intellectual 
property reviewed; (ii) the increase in quality 
of the partnership pipeline; and (iii) subsidiary 
level performance (assessed by reference to such 
matters as external funding raised, corporate 
collaborations, product co-development and 
proof of principal commercial pilots and 
revenues). Performance will be assessed on 
these measures on a scorecard basis over a 
three-year period.
At the end of the three-year period, performance 
against the relevant measures will be calculated 
to determine the number of ordinary shares 
capable of vesting. For the 2014 awards, 50% 
of the award will then vest at that time. The 
remaining 50% will vest in two equal tranches in 
years 4 and 5 subject to the relevant participant 
still being employed within the Group at the 
relevant vesting date. For the 2015 awards, 
100% of the award will vest at the end of the 
three-year period.
The level of vesting for threshold performance for 
the 2015 awards is 33.33% of the maximum. 
The level of vesting for target performance is 
66.67% of the maximum.
Starting in 2016, the Committee expects 
to make annual awards under the LTIP with 
100% of each award subject to performance 
conditions based on the Company’s relative total 
shareholder return (rTSR) performance in respect 
of a three-year period. The Group TSR will be 
measured relative to the FTSE 250, the S&P 
500, and a peer group of four publicly-traded 
companies.
The level of vesting for threshold performance is 
16.67% of the maximum. The level of vesting for 
target performance is 66.67% of the maximum. 80

Allied Minds 
Phantom Plan
The Committee’s intention 
is to reward participants 
for a successful subsidiary 
company liquidity event. 
The Committee recognises 
that successful subsidiary 
company liquidity events 
are a key strategic objective 
of the Group and its 
shareholders, and believes 
that the Phantom Plan is 
designed to align the interests 
of the Executive Directors and 
management of Allied Minds 
with such objective.
The Phantom Plan is a 
performance-based, cash 
settled bonus plan for 
Allied Minds’ Executive 
Directors and management. 
The Plan is triggered by 
a successful subsidiary 
liquidity event, including 
(i) a subsidiary IPO, (ii) the 
sale of all or substantially all 
of a subsidiary company’s 
assets, (iii) the sale of at least 
two-thirds of the outstanding 
shares of a subsidiary 
company’s voting equity, (iv) 
the merger or consolidation 
of a subsidiary company 
with or into another entity, or 
(v) a subsidiary company’s 
liquidation. Upon a liquidity 
event, Allied Minds will 
deduct the amount it 
invested in such subsidiary 
company and deduct the 
accrued interest in respect 
of such investment, and will 
then allocate 10% of the 
remaining net proceeds to 
the Phantom Plan account 
for allocation among the 
participants.
Participation in the Phantom 
Plan is evidenced by “units.”
Vesting of units is determined 
at the time of grant of the 
units.
The maximum aggregate 
number of units that may be 
awarded under the Phantom 
Plan is 200,000 units.
Upon a liquidity event Allied 
Minds will distribute 80% of 
the Phantom Plan account 
to the participants based 
on their pro rata share of all 
vested units on the date of the 
applicable liquidation event, 
and the remaining 20% of 
the Phantom Plan account will 
be distributed to participants 
at the discretion of the 
Committee.
No amounts accrue under 
the Phantom Plan, and no 
amounts are distributed to 
participants, until and unless 
a successful subsidiary 
company liquidity event 
occurs, and the cash 
generated in such liquidity 
event exceeds the amount 
Allied Minds invested in 
such subsidiary company, 
plus accrued interest and 
expenses in respect of 
such investment. No other 
performance metrics apply. 81

Non-Executive 
Directors’ Fees
The Company’s intention 
is to set fees at a level 
necessary to attract and 
retain experienced and skilled 
Non-Executive Directors with 
the necessary experience and 
expertise to advise and assist 
in establishing and monitoring 
the strategic objectives of the 
Company. Fees also reflect 
the time commitment and 
responsibilities of the roles.
An additional fee is paid 
for Chairmanship of a 
Board Committee and to the 
Chairman of the Board.
Non-Executive Directors have 
specific terms of engagement 
provided in formal letters 
of appointment. Their 
remuneration is determined 
by the Board, taking into 
account recommendations 
from the Remuneration 
Committee, within the 
limits set by the Articles of 
Association and based on 
equivalent roles in FTSE 250 
companies and the peer 
groups used for Executive 
Directors. The fees for 
Non-Executive Directors 
are reviewed annually and 
fixed for the fiscal year. The 
Non-Executive Directors are 
appointed for a three year 
term, subject to annual re-
election by the shareholders, 
at the Company’s AGM.
Non-Executive Directors 
do not receive any cash 
incentive bonus and do not 
participate in any Company 
pension scheme.
The Non-Executive Directors 
are eligible for RSU awards 
under the LTIP. Awards to 
the Non-Executive Directors 
will be subject to time-based 
vesting provisions, and will 
not be subject to performance 
metrics. Each Non-Executive 
Director is also entitled to 
reimbursement of reasonable 
and properly documented 
expenses incurred in 
performing the duties of their 
office.
The fees paid take account 
of responsibilities in acting 
as Chairman of the Board, 
Chairman of a Board 
Committee or as Senior 
Independent Director.
The fees paid to the 
Chairman shall only be 
payable where the Chairman 
is a Non-Executive Director. 
Given the US-based nature 
of the Group’s business, 
and the need to attract and 
retain independent directors 
with significant US business 
and leadership experience, 
the fees include an equity 
component, based upon a 
recommendation from Korn 
Ferry.
The Committee is satisfied 
that the level of fees 
conform to its strategy, 
whilst remaining competitive 
against similar roles within the 
relevant peer groups. Careful 
consideration has been given 
as to whether including an 
equity component would 
affect the independence of 
the Non-Executive Directors, 
and the conclusion was 
reached that it would not, 
given the level of the awards 
and the fact that they are not 
performance-related.
There are no performance 
conditions attached to the 
payment of fees or the vesting 
under the awards granted 
under the LTIP. 82
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED)  
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office, 
notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Remuneration Policy set out in the tables on the previous pages, 
where the terms of the payment were agreed either: (i) before the policy came into effect, or (ii) at a time when 
the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment 
was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company. For these purposes “payments” 
include the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the 
terms of the payment are “agreed” at the time the award is granted. Details of any such payments will be set out 
in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.
Differences Between the Remuneration Policy and That Applied to Employees Generally
The components of remuneration set out on the previous pages for Executive Directors are also generally applied 
to the Group’s senior management team and differ only in vesting terms, values and award maxima. The 
basic benefits package is typically available to all US employees at the Group level following completion of 
a probationary period. Overall, there is more emphasis on variable pay for the Executive Directors and senior 
management, but all US employees at the Group level are eligible for discretionary cash incentive bonus 
awards. In addition, the Company is committed to fostering alignment with shareholders through widespread 
share ownership, and thus all US employees at the Group level are eligible to participate in the LTIP. The 
Group has also implemented equity incentive plans within its subsidiaries in order to incentivise employees 
within the subsidiary businesses. Generally, the employees of the subsidiary businesses do not participate in 
any of the Group level incentive plans. The Chief Executive Officer of each of our most significant subsidiaries 
may participate in the LTIP, but the levels of such awards under the LTIP are not expected to be a significant 
percentage of their total compensation.
Schemes or Arrangements Under Which Allocations or Awards are no Longer Being Made
In addition to the Executive Directors’ remuneration arrangements set forth in the Remuneration Policy, the Group 
previously maintained the Allied Minds Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan (US Stock Plan). The Company 
does not intend to make any further grants under the US Stock Plan. The interests of the Executive Directors in 
outstanding options under the US Stock Plan are shown in the statement of directors’ shareholding and share 
interest on page 92 of this Annual Report.
The exercise price of the options is equivalent to the fair market value of Common Stock of Allied Minds, Inc. 
(now Allied Minds, LLC) as at the date of grant of the options and all outstanding options have already vested 
and become exercisable. 83

Approach to Recruitment Remuneration
The Committee will apply the Remuneration Policy for any new Executive Director recruited to the Board in 
respect of all elements of forward-looking remuneration. The maximum level of variable remuneration under 
the cash incentive bonus awards and LTIP that may be awarded will be within the usual maximums set out in 
the Remuneration Policy, subject to the exceptions permitted under the LTIP. The Committee retains flexibility to 
provide benefits in kind, pensions and other allowances, such as relocation, education and tax equalisation, 
required in order to recruit the intended candidate.
The Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to buy out remuneration arrangements 
forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In doing so, the Committee will seek to structure buyout awards on a 
comparable basis to awards forfeited, taking into account relevant factors including any performance conditions 
attached to these awards, the form in which they were granted (e.g. cash or shares) and the timeframe of awards. 
It is intended that the value awarded would be no higher than the expected value of the forfeited awards. The 
Committee would seek as far as possible to make such buyout awards under the Company’s existing share plans 
but, if necessary, may rely on the Listing Rules exemption which allows for the grant of awards to facilitate, in 
exceptional circumstances, the recruitment of a Director.
Similarly, the Remuneration Policy for a new Chairman or new Non-Executive Directors would be to apply the 
same remuneration elements as applicable to existing Non-Executive Directors under the Remuneration Policy.
In addition to the above principles, the following additional considerations may be applied as appropriate 
depending on the circumstances:
• In the case of internal promotion, any existing performance-related elements arising from an individual’s 
previous role will continue to be honoured under the Remuneration Policy, even if they may not otherwise be 
consistent with the Remuneration Policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled.
• In the case of promotion to Executive Director following an acquisition or other business combination, the 
Committee may permit equity-based incentive arrangements to continue in force if they can be “rolled-up” 
into awards over Allied Minds’ shares provided the performance and vesting conditions are considered 
appropriate.
• In the case of the recruitment of an executive at a time of the year when it would be inappropriate or not 
possible to provide an LTIP award for that year (for instance due to price sensitive information or if there is 
insufficient time to assess performance), the quantum in respect of the months employed during the year may 
be transferred to and amalgamated with the subsequent year’s award if considered reasonable to do so by 
the Committee.
The Committee will include details of the implementation of the Remuneration Policy in respect of any such 
recruitment to the Board in its future Annual Reports on Remuneration.
Letters of Appointment
Each of Rick Davis, Peter Dolan and Jeff Rohr had Non-Executive Director letters of appointment that commenced 
May 2014, which were updated and renewed in August 2017. Kevin Sharer and Harry Rein have Non-
Executive Director letters of appointment that commenced June 2015 and November 2017, respectively. Each 
of the letters of appointment are for an initial fixed term of three years, which are reviewed and may be extended, 
and are terminable on one months’ notice by either party. The letters of appointment for the Non-Executive 
Directors do not provide for any compensation on termination. 84
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED)  
At 10 March 2017, Jill Smith’s Non-Executive Director letter of appointment previously entered into in January 
2016 was terminated, and she entered into a new Executive Director letter of appointment. The letter of 
appointment immediately terminates upon the termination of her appointment as the Chief Executive Officer of 
the Company. The letter of appointment does not provide for any compensation on termination.
The letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office. In accordance with 
the Code, all Directors submit themselves for election at the first AGM since their appointment to the Board, and 
for annual re-election by shareholders at each AGM.
Remuneration Policy on Payment for Loss of Office
The Directors believe the payments owed upon loss of office detailed below are customary and appropriate to 
attract and retain US-based senior management of the highest calibre.
The Committee reserves the right to make payments where they are made in good faith in discharge of an existing 
obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation) or by way of settlement or compromise of 
any claim arising in connection with the termination of a Director’s office or employment where they are in the 
best interests of Allied Minds and its shareholders and reflecting the directors’ contractual and legal rights.
Impact of Loss of Office on Awards under LTIP
Participants who cease to be employees, directors or service providers to the Group will normally forfeit any 
unvested awards.
However, if a participant leaves as a result of death, disability, dismissal other than for cause or any other 
reason determined by the Committee, awards will vest on the normal vesting date on a pro-rata basis taking into 
account performance and the period of time during the applicable performance measurement period in which 
the participant continuously provided services. The Committee may in its discretion determine that there are 
exceptional circumstances justifying vesting to a greater or lesser extent.
Impact of Change of Control on Awards under LTIP
If there is a change of control of the Company, the number of ordinary shares over which awards will vest will 
be calculated on the basis of the extent to which the performance criteria applicable to those awards have been 
satisfied as at the date of the change of control. The resulting number of shares will then be reduced on a pro 
rata basis to reflect the reduced period between the date the award was made and the date of the change of 
control, unless the Committee decides otherwise. In exceptional circumstances, the Committee may recommend 
full vesting. This discretion to accelerate vesting upon a change of control is included in the LTIP to meet the 
expectations of a US-based workforce.
Statement of Consideration of Employment Conditions Elsewhere in the Company
In considering changes to the remuneration of the Executive Directors, the Committee is mindful of pay and 
conditions in the wider Group. Whilst the Group operates a range of bonus plans appropriate to its various 
businesses, the main drivers of these subsidiary plans, in common with the cash incentive bonus awards to 
Executive Directors, are the achievement of company milestones, and other company and individual objectives. 
The Committee has not expressly sought the views of employees and no remuneration comparison measurements 
were used when drawing up the Remuneration Policy. Through the Board, however, the Committee is regularly 
updated as to employees’ views on remuneration generally.
In the event that an employee is promoted to the Board, that individual would be allowed to retain any pre-
existing incentive entitlement that had not vested at that time. 85

legal and tax advice.
 (3)  Equities based payments in 2016 include the value of LTIP awards granted to the Executive Directors in 2014 which vested in June 2017 
based upon performance conditions met as of 31 December 2016. As noted on pages 89 and 90, the Remuneration Committee made an 
assessment that these awards vested at 94.33% of the maximum number of shares under the award. The 2016 value has been calculated using 
the 94.33% level of vesting, and the share price at 31 December 2016 (net of settlement price).
   Equities based payments in 2017 include the value of LTIP awards granted to the Executive Directors in 2015 which are expected to vest in 
May 2018 based upon performance conditions met as of 31 December 2017. As noted on pages 90 and 91, the Remuneration Committee 
has made a preliminary assessment that these awards will vest at 33.00% of the maximum number of shares under the award. The 2017 value 
has been calculated using the expected 33.00% level of vesting, and the share price at 31 December 2017 (net of settlement price).
   Equities based payments also include the value of LTIP awards granted to the Non-Executive Directors that vested in 2016 and 2017 (based 
on the value on the date the awards vested and the shares were granted).
 (4)  Ms. Smith was appointed as interim Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director as of 10 March 2017. On 26 May 2017, Ms. Smith 
transitioned to serve as “permanent” Chief Executive Officer and President.
 (5)  Mr. Silva resigned as Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director as of 10 March 2017. Details of the effect of his resignation on 
outstanding payments and benefits are given on pages 98 to 100.
 (6) Mr. Rein was appointed as a Non-Executive Director in November 2017.

Individual Elements of Remuneration
Base Salary and Cash Incentive Bonus Awards during 2017
The Remuneration Committee engaged Korn Ferry to conduct a compensation benchmarking study for the 
Company’s senior management in conjunction with the Company’s year-end compensation process, including 
an analysis of the traditional elements of executive pay (base salary, annual cash incentive bonus, long-term 
equity incentives and total direct compensation). Korn Ferry utilised a variety of information sources to evaluate 
the market for executive compensation, including an analysis of eight publicly-traded companies, and other Korn 
Ferry survey data. For the purpose of benchmarking salaries and other remuneration the principal peer grouping 
used by the Company consisted of listed companies within similar industry sectors with a range of capitalisation.
Based upon the results of the benchmarking study and the strong Company performance in 2016, the Remuneration 
Committee recommended to the Board the following for 2017:
• For Chris Silva, an increase in base salary from $515,000 to $600,000, and in increase of maximum cash 
incentive bonus award from 150% of base salary to 187.5% of base salary (125% at target), in both cases 
to address the continued peer benchmarking results that placed the CEO below the median;
• For Jill Smith, during the period that she served as “interim” Chief Executive Officer, she was paid a base 
salary of $100,000 per month, and she was not be eligible for any cash incentive bonus awards, LTIP 
awards, or any other incentive or equity schemes; and
• For Jill Smith, commencing on 26 May 2017 when she transitioned to serve as “permanent” Chief Executive 
Officer and President, her base salary was set at $600,000, and her maximum cash incentive bonus award 
was set at 225% of base salary (150% at target), to be pro-rated for her number of days of service as 
“permanent” CEO during 2017.
The Remuneration Committee designed the increase in base salary and potential increase in cash incentive 
bonus award to reflect its policy of moving the Executive Director compensation, in connection with target 
performance, towards the median of the peer group. The Remuneration Committee also designed the potential 
increases to emphasise the variable component of compensation, by allocating more of the potential increase to 
the cash incentive bonus award and not base salary.
As described in the Remuneration Policy, the Remuneration Committee and senior management review the 
Group’s management by objectives (MBOs) annually prior to the start of each financial year to ensure the detailed 
performance measures and weightings are appropriate and continue to align with business strategy. Annual 
MBOs, including financial, operational, technical and other performance targets and their weightings for the 
upcoming year are set at or around the start of each financial year. An Executive Director’s cash incentive bonus 
award is considered by the Remuneration Committee upon completion of each financial year. The decision to 
provide any cash incentive bonus award and the amount and terms of any such award, are determined solely by 
the level of achievement against the MBOs set by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the financial year. 
In keeping with the emphasis on the variable component of compensation and strong management incentives, 
the Remuneration Committee set the threshold for cash incentive bonus awards at nil. 87

The Remuneration Committee determined that the MBO percentage achievement for 2017 was 131.0% of 
target percentage. The Remuneration Committee determined such achievement in accordance with the MBOs 
set at the beginning of 2017, and refined in April 2017, and did not exercise any material discretion. As noted 
above, the target cash incentive bonus award for the Chief Executive Officer was set at 150% of base salary for 
2017, with maximum award set at 225% of base salary. Based upon the MBO achievement, the cash incentive 
bonus award to the Chief Executive Officer was set at 196.5% of base salary, and pro-rated for her number of 
days of service as “permanent” CEO during 2017, resulting in a 2017 cash incentive bonus of $707,400. 88

At 20 June 2017, the annual LTIP award above was granted to the Chief Executive Officer. The total value of 
the award has been calculated using the closing share price of 144p on such date. The level of award was 
determined by the Committee after giving due consideration to the 2016 Korn Ferry compensation benchmarking 
study which concluded that the target amount of the award ($1,200,000), or 200% of base salary, would 
position the CEO at or below the median for the peer group for total compensation during 2017. The maximum 
value of such award which could be received by Ms. Smith is 300% of base salary. Vesting of the LTIP award is 
dependent upon performance metrics measured over the three years to 30 April 2020, details of which are set 
out in the Remuneration Policy table on page 79 of the Report. The level of vesting for threshold performance is 
16.67% of the maximum. The level of vesting for target performance is 66.67% of the maximum.
At 20 June 2017, Ms. Smith was also granted a new hire LTIP award. The total value of the award has been 
calculated using the closing share price of 144p on such date. The level of award was determined by the 
Committee after giving due consideration to the level of long-term incentive required to successfully recruit Ms. 
Smith to the permanent role, and the Company’s remuneration policy and approach to recruitment. The level 
of vesting for threshold performance is 0.00% of the maximum. The level of vesting for target performance is  89
   
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED)  
Management & Governance
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

100.00% of the maximum. Vesting of the LTIP award is dependent upon performance metrics measured over the 
three years from her start date to 13 March 2020, details of which are set forth below:
• Three or more monetisation events;
• More than 50% of fund raises for portfolio companies will include co-investors with expertise in the business 
of the portfolio company;
• The Company will have achieved the capacity to build more than five new businesses in each of the three 
years ending at the end of calendar year 2020; and
• The Company’s positioning in Federal Laboratories has been strengthened.
At 15 May 2017, the LTIP awards above were granted to the Non-Executive Directors including Messrs. Davis, 
Dolan, Rohr and Sharer. The total value of the award has been calculated using the closing share price of 144p 
on such date. At 6 November 2017, the LTIP award above was granted to the Mr. Rein in connection with his 
appointment as a Non-Executive Director. The total value of the award has been calculated using the closing 
share price of 186p on such date. The level of award for such Non-Executive Directors was determined by 
the Committee after giving due consideration to the 2016 Korn Ferry compensation benchmarking study which 
recommended such awards in light of the US-based nature of the Group’s business, and the need to attract and 
retain independent directors with significant US business and leadership experience. Vesting of the LTIP award is 
based upon time of service, with each award vesting in three equal installments over a three year period. There 
are no performance conditions attached to the vesting under the awards granted under the LTIP.
Long Term Incentive Plan Vesting during 2017 (audited information)
Non-Executive Director Awards
LTIP awards granted to the Non-Executive Directors in June 2015 and May 2016 partially vested in 2016 and 
2017. Vesting of the Non-Executive Director LTIP awards is based upon time of service, with each award vesting 
in three equal installments over a three year period. There are no performance conditions attached to the vesting 
under the awards granted under the LTIP to the Non-Executive Directors. As a result of such vesting in 2016, 
2,723 ordinary shares were allotted and issued to Mr. Dolan, and 1,815 ordinary shares were allotted and 
issued to each of Messrs. Davis, Rohr and Sharer. As a result of such vesting in 2017, 7,868 ordinary shares 
were allotted and issued to Mr. Dolan, and 5,245 ordinary shares were allotted and issued to each of Messrs. 
Davis, Rohr and Sharer.
Executive Director Awards - 2014
No LTIP awards granted to Executive Directors vested during 2016. However, the performance period for LTIP 
awards made to Executive Directors during 2014 ended on 31 December 2016, and such awards partially 
vested in June 2017 based upon the performance metrics set forth below.
In respect of the LTIP awards made to Executive Directors during 2014, vesting was dependent upon performance 
metrics measured as follows:
• 60% of each award was subject to performance conditions based on the Company’s total shareholder return 
(TSR) performance in respect of a three-year period, as follows:
 o threshold vesting (33.33% of maximum) for achievement of a 10% annualised TSR, 90
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED)  
 o target vesting (66.67% of maximum) for achievement of a 15% annualised TSR, and
 o maximum vesting for achievement of a 20% annualised TSR; and
• 40% of each award was subject to performance conditions based on a basket of shareholder value metrics 
(SVM), including, but not limited to:
 o the increase in quality of pipeline intellectual property reviewed,
 o the increase in quality of the partnership pipeline, and
 o subsidiary level performance (assessed by reference to such matters as external funding raised, corporate 
collaborations, product co-development and proof of principal commercial pilots and revenues).
In June 2017, performance against the relevant measures was calculated to finally determine the number of 
ordinary shares capable of vesting, and the potential award vested at that time.
The Company’s annualised TSR for the measurement period was 33.99%, which consisted of an increase from 
190.0p at the Company’s IPO in June 2014 to a 30-day trailing open/close average on 31 December 2016 
of 399.2p. Thus, the TSR condition exceeded the maximum TSR and 60.00% (out of a possible 60.00%) of the 
maximum number of shares under the award vested in June 2017.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed Company performance in each of January 2015, 2016 and 2017 to 
assess the level of achievement under the SVM condition, and awarded a preliminary score of 4.0 (maximum) 
for 2014, 3.0 (target) for 2015, and 3.3 (above target) for 2016. The Remuneration Committee made its final 
assessment in June 2017, and the SVM condition averaged 3.433 over the measurement period, and 34.33% 
(out of a possible 40.00%) of the maximum number of shares under the award vested in June 2017.
Taken together, 94.33% of the maximum number of shares under the 2014 LTIP awards became eligible for 
vesting in June 2017. Under the terms of these awards, 50% of the eligible award would be vested and allotted 
in June 2017, and the remaining 50% over the following two years, but because Mr. Silva was terminated 
without cause, 100% of his eligible award (94.33%) vested and the shares were allotted in June 2017.
Executive Director Awards - 2015
The performance period for LTIP awards made to Executive Directors during 2015 ended on 31 December 
2017, and such awards are expected to partially vest in May 2018 based upon the performance metrics set 
forth below.
In respect of the LTIP awards made to Executive Directors during 2015, vesting is dependent upon performance 
metrics measured as follows:
• 60% of each award will be subject to performance conditions based on the Company’s total shareholder 
return (TSR) performance in respect of a three-year period, as follows:
 o threshold vesting (33.33% of maximum) for achievement of a 10% annualised TSR,
 o target vesting (66.67% of maximum) for achievement of a 15% annualised TSR, and
 o maximum vesting for achievement of a 20% annualised TSR; and 91
   
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED)

• 40% of each award will be subject to performance conditions based on a basket of shareholder value 
metrics (SVM), including, but not limited to:
 o the increase in quality of pipeline intellectual property reviewed,
 o the increase in quality of the partnership pipeline, and
 o subsidiary level performance (assessed by reference to such matters as external funding raised, corporate 
collaborations, product co-development and proof of principal commercial pilots and revenues).
In May 2018, performance against the relevant measures will be calculated to finally determine the number of 
ordinary shares capable of vesting, and the potential award will then vest at that time.
The Company’s annualised TSR for the measurement period was negative, which consisted of a decrease from 
a 30-day trailing open/close average on 31 December 2014 of 313.5p, to a 30-day trailing open/close 
average on 31 December 2017 of 155.8p. Thus, the TSR condition was below the threshold TSR and 0.00% 
(out of a possible 60.00%) of the maximum number of shares under the award are expected to vest in May 
2018.
The Remuneration Committee has undertaken a preliminary assessment of Company performance in each of 
January 2016, 2017 and 2018 to assess the level of achievement under the SVM condition, and awarded a 
preliminary score of 3.0 (target) for 2015, 3.3 (above target) for 2016, and 3.6 (above target) for 2017. The 
Remuneration Committee will make its final assessment in May 2018, but based upon the preliminary assessment, 
the SVM condition averaged 3.3 over the measurement period, and 33.00% (out of a possible 40.00%) of the 
maximum number of shares under the award would be on this basis expected to vest in May 2018.
Taken together, and based on the preliminary assessment, 33.00% of the maximum number of shares under the 
award are expected to be eligible for vesting in May 2018.
US Stock Plan Awards Made During 2017 (audited information)
The Company did not make any grants under the US Stock Plan in 2017, and does not intend to make any 
further grants. The interests of the Executive Directors in outstanding options under the US Stock Plan are shown 
in the statement of directors’ shareholding and share interest on page 92 of this Annual Report.
Payments to Past Directors (audited information)
No payments to past Directors were made during the last financial year.
Loss of Office Payments (audited information)
During 2017, an aggregate of $595,828 of loss of office payments were made to Mr. Silva as a result of 
his resignation as Chief Executive Officer on 10 March 2017, which included (i) payment in lieu of annual 
incentive award in the amount of $100,676, (ii) payment in lieu of base salary in the amount of $483,334, and 
(iii) payment in lieu of COBRA (health care) expense in the amount of $11,818. The Board used its discretion 
to treat Mr. Silva’s resignation as a termination without cause (good leaver). Further details of the effect of his 
resignation and the calculation of payments and benefits are given on pages 98 to 100. 92

Total Pension Entitlements (audited information)
No payments for pension entitlements were made to Directors during the last financial year. The Company offers 
a retirement plan in accordance with subsection 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (401(k) Plan) in which 
Executive Directors may make voluntary pre-tax contributions toward their own retirement. The Company does 
not make any payments or contributions to such 401(k) Plan.
Statement of Directors’ Shareholding and Share Interests (audited information)
Share ownership plays a key role in the alignment of our executives with the interests of shareholders. In April 
2016, the Remuneration Committee adopted a share ownership policy for Executive Directors. The policy 
requires Executive Directors to acquire and maintain a minimum ownership level of ordinary shares in the 
capital of the Company, thereby helping to align their interests with those of shareholders. The Committee has 
set the current requirements at share value of 400% of base salary for Executive Officers. The Committee has 
not set a timeframe during which Executive Officers are required to accumulate their share ownership level. At 
31 December 2017, the Executive Director had not acquired enough shares to meet this requirement. The table 
below sets out the number of shares held by Directors as at 31 December 2017, and the Company is not aware 
of any changes through 19 March 2018.

2014 and 2013, the percentage of maximum is not applicable because the Company did not have any cap on cash incentive bonus award 
payments in those financial years. As a percentage of base salary, the award was 65.7% in 2013, 125.0% in 2014 and 105.0% in 2015. 
For 2016, the maximum cash incentive bonus award for Executive Officers was 150% of base salary.
 (2)  No equity-based awards vested under the LTIP during 2016, 2015, 2014 or 2013. However, the performance period for LTIP awards made 
to Executive Directors during 2014 ended on 31 December 2016, and such awards are expected to partially vest in May 2017. As noted 
above, 94.33% of the maximum number of shares under the 2014 LTIP award became eligible for vesting in June 2017. As noted above, 
33.00% of the maximum number of shares under the 2015 LTIP award are expected to be eligible for vesting in May 2018.
 (3)  Equity-based payments include awards under the US Stock Plan. All equity awards, including stock options and restricted stock, under the US 
Stock Plan became vested and fully exercisable, or vested and fully transferable, in connection with the IPO. 95

Base Salary and Benefits
Effective from 1 January 2018, the base salary of the current Executive Director will be:
 Base Salary Increase % Increase
Jill Smith $600,000 0 0.0%
The Committee considers that, as part of a competitive overall package, base salaries should be within a 
market-competitive range, which is considered to be at or up to median level compared with the Company’s 
peer groups. As noted above, based upon the results of the peer benchmarking study, the strong Company 
performance in 2016, and the achievement of Company and individual goals, the Board recommended Ms.  96

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED)  
Smith’s base salary remain constant at $600,000. This compares to an average increase of 3.9% base salary 
increase that was implemented across the Group to US employees.
The benefits package during 2017 will continue to be in line with US employment market practice and the 
Remuneration Policy.
Cash Incentive Bonus Awards
The Remuneration Committee expects to implement the following to the cash incentive bonus awards, which is 
permitted under the Remuneration Policy. During 2017, the maximum cash incentive bonus award opportunity 
for each Executive Director was set at 225% of base salary upon Ms. Smith’s transition to permanent Chief 
Executive Officer. Under the Remuneration Policy, each year the Remuneration Committee will determine the 
maximum opportunity for each Executive Director. The maximum opportunity for each Executive Director in 2018 
will remain constant and may be up to 225% of base salary.
The Executive Director’s cash incentive bonus awards shall be considered by the Remuneration Committee upon 
completion of the financial year. The decision to provide any cash incentive bonus award and the amount 
and terms of any such award, are determined solely by the level of achievement against the MBOs set by the 
Committee at the start of the financial year. The annual MBOs, including financial, operational, technical and 
other performance targets and their weightings for the upcoming year were set at the start of 2018, as follows:

Long Term Incentive Plan
The Remuneration Committee expects to implement the following changes to the LTIP awards in 2018, which are 
permitted under the current Remuneration Policy. Prior to 2016, there was no cap on the amount of LTIP award to  97
   
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED)

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
97
be made to Executive Directors, other than the cap of 300% of base salary per financial year as specified in the 
LTIP. Under the current Remuneration Policy, each year the Committee will determine the maximum opportunity 
for each Executive Director. The maximum opportunity for each Executive Director in 2018 shall be up to 300% 
of base salary.
In 2016 and 2017, the Committee made awards under the LTIP with 100% of each award subject to performance 
conditions based on the Company’s relative total shareholder return (rTSR) performance in respect of a three-
year period. The Group TSR will be measured relative to the FTSE 250, the S&P 500, and a peer group of four 
publicly-traded companies. The level of vesting for threshold performance is 16.67% of the maximum. The level 
of vesting for target performance is 66.67% of the maximum.
With respect to any LTIP awards granted to Executive Directors in 2018, the Committee expects to continue the 
same rTSR performance vesting terms, except that the Group TSR will be measured relative to the FTSE All Shares 
Index and a peer group of five publicly-traded companies, which metrics were deemed by the Remuneration 
Committee, based upon advice from Korn Ferry, to be more specifically relevant to the performance of the 
Company’s shares.
Details of the expected vesting of the 2015 awards are given on pages 90 to 91.
Service Contract and Letter of Appointment (New CEO)
At 10 March 2017, the new interim Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director (Jill Smith) entered into a 
service contract. The employment arrangement was “at-will”, which means that either Ms. Smith or Allied Minds 
could terminate the employment arrangement at any time, with or without cause and with or without prior notice. 
During the period that Ms. Smith served as “interim” Chief Executive Officer, she was paid a base salary of 
$100,000 per month, and she was not eligible for any cash incentive bonus awards, LTIP awards, or any other 
incentive or equity schemes.
On 26 May 2017, Ms. Smith accepted the Board’s offer to transition to serve as “permanent” Chief Executive 
Officer and President. The terms of Ms. Smith’s service contract and remuneration are in accordance with the 
Remuneration Policy, subject to the considerations set forth in the approach to remuneration recruitment set forth 
in this Annual Report.
Ms. Smith has a service contract that commenced on 26 May 2017 and shall continue until terminated by either 
of Allied Minds or the Executive Director.
The Executive Director’s contract does not provide for extended notice periods or compensation in the event 
of a change of control. However, as noted above, the rules of the LTIP provide that, in the event of a change 
of control, awards would vest to the extent determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account the 
extent to which the performance conditions are satisfied at the date of such event.
If the Executive Director’s employment is terminated by Allied Minds for “Cause”, she shall only be entitled 
to amounts that are accrued or owing but not yet paid and reimbursement of any properly incurred business 
expenses but excluding any bonus payments or other compensation provided pursuant to Allied Minds’ incentive 
compensation plan (such amounts, the “Standard Benefit”).
If the Executive Director terminates the service contract for “Good Reason” or Allied Minds terminates the service 
contract without Cause, the Executive Director shall be entitled to:
• payment of twelve (12) months’ base salary in accordance with regular payroll; 98
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED)  
• an annual incentive award equal to the product of: (A) the Executive Directors bonus for the prior year; and 
(B) a fraction based on the number of days in which the Executive Director was employed during that year;
• payment of the portion of the premiums paid by the Company at the time of such termination under COBRA 
for medical, dental, hospitalisation and other employee welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements 
covered by COBRA, for a period of twelve (12) months for her and each of her eligible dependents; and
• payment of the Standard Benefit.
In the event of death or disability, similar payments will be made as those payable as a termination for Good 
Reason save that the payment of base salary shall only continue for 90 days after the death of the Executive 
Director and/or until the commencement of long term disability payments in the case of termination due to 
disability.
If the Executive Director terminates her employment with Allied Minds without Good Reason (and not because of 
her death or due to disability), the Executive Director shall be entitled solely to payment of the Standard Benefit.
At 10 March 2017, Ms. Smith’s Non-Executive Director letter of appointment was terminated, and she entered 
into a new Executive Director letter of appointment. The letter of appointment immediately terminates upon the 
termination of her appointment as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The letter of appointment does 
not provide for any compensation on termination.
On 9 May 2016, in her capacity as a Non-Executive Director, Ms. Smith received a grant of 10,290 RSUs 
under the Company’s LTIP. The RSUs vest annually over a three-year period, with the first vesting date scheduled 
to occur on 9 May 2017. Under the terms of the RSUs, vesting is time-based and occurs so long as Ms. Smith 
continues to be a Director of the Company. Notwithstanding the terms of such RSUs, Ms. Smith surrendered the 
awards in light of her appointment Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director because such RSUs do not 
contain performance vesting conditions, and therefore are not in compliance with the Remuneration Policy.
The service contract and letter of appointment are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office. 
In accordance with the Code, Ms. Smith will submit herself for election at the AGM, and for annual re-election 
by shareholders at each AGM.
Service Contract and Post Period Loss of Office Payments (Former CEO)
At 31 December 2016, the former Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director (Chris Silva) had a service 
contract that commenced in May 2014. With effect from 10 March 2017, Mr. Silva resigned as Chief 
Executive Officer and as an Executive Director of the Company.
The Remuneration Committee approved the arrangements below which are in line with the Company’s 
Remuneration Policy approved by the Company’s shareholders at the 2016 AGM. 99
   
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED)

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

Payments and Benefits
Mr. Silva will be entitled to:
• An annual incentive award for 2017, which shall be a lump sum payment of $100,676, which is equal to 
the product of: (A) $532,560 (his average annual bonus for the three full years preceding his resignation) 
and (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days he was employed by the Company during 
2017 and the denominator of which is the number of days in such year. During 2017, loss of office 
payments in lieu of annual incentive award was made in the amount of $100,676.
• Continued payment of his base salary at the rate of $600,000 per year for a period of twenty-four (24) 
months. During 2017, loss of office payments in lieu of base salary was made in the amount of $483,334.
• Participation at the Company’s expense under COBRA for six months for him and each of his eligible 
dependents in all medical, dental, hospitalisation and other employee welfare benefit plans, programs and 
arrangements covered by COBRA. During 2017, loss of office payments in lieu of COBRA expense was 
made in the amount of $11,818.
• Life and disability insurance cover at the Company’s expense for six months. During 2017, no payments for 
loss of office in lieu of life and disability insurance expense were made.
Incentive Arrangements
Mr. Silva has outstanding restricted share unit awards (RSUs) granted under the Company’s Long Term Incentive 
Plan, outstanding share options (Options) granted under the Allied Minds Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan, and 
outstanding awards in the form of units (Phantom Units) granted under the Allied Minds Phantom Plan (Phantom 
Plan). The RSUs and Options are settled in ordinary shares in the Company (Shares) and the Phantom Units are 
settled in cash.
In accordance with the terms of such awards and the Company’s Remuneration Policy:
• The RSUs will continue to vest subject to achievement of the relevant performance criteria and, to the extent 
that they vest, Mr. Silva will be entitled to a pro rata number of Shares taking into account the time which 
Mr. Silva has worked in the period over which the performance criteria are measured. The Remuneration 
Committee has exercised its discretion to determine that the pro-rating shall be by reference to the number of 
days worked from the beginning of the relevant measurement period, rather than from the date of grant of the 
relevant RSU. As of 19 March 2018, Mr. Silva has outstanding RSUs to acquire an aggregate of 365,100 
Shares at maximum vesting.
• The Options are fully vested. Following the Remuneration Committee determination to extend the period for 
exercise of the Options from three to twelve months following termination, Mr. Silva had until 10 March 
2018 to exercise such Options, failing which they lapsed. As of 19 March 2018, Mr. Silva has no 
outstanding Options.
• The Phantom Units are also fully vested. Settlement of Phantom Units under the Phantom Plan is triggered by a 
successful subsidiary liquidity event (Liquidity Event). Mr. Silva remains entitled to a proportion of the payment 
he would have received on a Liquidity Event had he remained an employee. That proportion is 90% if the 
Liquidity Event occurs within 9 months of his resignation date, 75% if 10-18 months from his resignation date; 
50% if 19-27 months from his resignation date; 25% if 28-36 months from his resignation date, and 0% if 
later than 36 months from his resignation date. As of 19 March 2018, Mr. Silva has 8,857 Phantom Units. 100

Limits on the Number of Shares Used to Satisfy Share Awards (dilution limits)
All of the Group’s incentive schemes that contain an element that may be satisfied in Allied Minds plc shares 
incorporate provisions that in any ten-year period (ending on the relevant date of grant), the maximum number 
of the shares that may be issued or issuable under all such schemes shall not exceed 10% of the issued ordinary 
share capital of the Company from time to time (excluding shares issued pursuant to awards granted prior to IPO 
under the US Stock Plan).
The Committee regularly monitors the position and prior to the making of any share-based award, considers the 
effect of potential vesting of outstanding awards to ensure that the Company remains within these limits. Any 
awards which are required to be satisfied by market purchased shares are excluded from such calculations. No 
treasury shares were held or utilised in the year ended 31 December 2017.

The Committee carries out these duties for the Company, major subsidiary undertakings and the Group as a 
whole, as appropriate.
ACTIVITIES DURING THE YEAR
The Committee’s activities for the year ended 31 December 2017 included the responsibilities set forth above, 
as well as the items set forth below:
Financial Reporting
• Reviewed and approved the appropriate audit plan, before the start of the annual audit cycle;
• Reviewed and provided comments and recommendations in respect of the financial statements in the half-
yearly report for the period ended 30 June 2017, and the financial statements in the Annual Report and

• Considered significant matters, risk areas, and areas of judgement in relation to the Group’s financial 
statements taking into account the areas highlighted by the external auditors in their presentations to the 
Committee, and challenged where necessary.
The Committee is satisfied with the integrity of the financial statements of the Company in all material aspects, 
including the application of significant accounting policies, the methods used to account for significant transactions, 
use of judgements and estimates made by management, including those made in deriving the fair value of the 
subsidiary undertakings, and the quality and completeness of the disclosures in the financial statements of the 
Company.
The Committee is satisfied that this Annual Report as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides 
the information necessary for a reasonable shareholder to assess the Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy.
Internal Controls and Risk Management Systems

judgements on an ongoing basis as to the Financial Position, Prospects and Procedures (FPPP) of the Company 
following the adopted risk approach; and

to raise those concerns, and ensure staff that they should be able to raise genuine concerns without fear of 
reprisals, even if they turn out to be mistaken. 106

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT (CONTINUED)  
FINANCIAL REPORTING PANEL
As part of the thematic review of companies’ reporting, the Financial Reporting Panel reviewed our 31 December 
2016 accounts and disclosures relating to significant accounting adjustments and sources of estimation uncertainty. 
The panel confirmed that it had no substantive issues to raise in relation to their review. The panel noted that it 
was considering identifying our disclosures relating to subsidiary preferred share liability as an example of better 
practices around explaining when ranges of outcomes cannot be quantified and disclosing sensitivities. No 
changes were suggested or required to be made in our 31 December 2017 accounts as result of this review. 
This thematic review provides no assurance that our report and accounts are correct in all material respects and 
the Financial Reporting Council’s role is not to verify the information provided but to consider compliance with 
reporting requirements.
SIGNIFICANT AREAS REPORTED TO THE BOARD
Valuation of Group Subsidiaries
At the close of each annual financial period, the Directors formally approve the value of all subsidiary businesses 
in the Group, which is used to derive the Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value (GSOAV). This Group 
Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value is a sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation of all the subsidiaries that make up 
the Group.
The Audit Committee discusses with management and the auditors the appropriateness of the adopted 
methodology and approach in deriving the GSOAV. Further details of the Group valuation methodology are 
outlined in note 11 on pages 151 to 152. For valuations based on recent third party funding rounds, the 
relatively low number of investors participating in some of those rounds may be an indication of risk that a recent 
funding round used as basis for valuation is not sufficiently at arm’s length to ensure an independent market 
valuation representative of fair value. Although the fair values of the Group’s investments in subsidiaries are not 
included in the Group’s Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, additional disclosures are provided in the 
notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This is a significant performance metric for the Group.
Financial Instruments – Subsidiary Preferred Shares
Certain of the Group’s subsidiaries have outstanding preferred shares which have been classified as subsidiary 
preferred shares in current liabilities as the subsidiaries have a contractual obligation to deliver cash or other 
assets to the holders under certain future liquidity events, and/or a requirement to deliver an uncertain number of 
common shares upon conversion. Significant judgement is used in determining the classification of these financial 
instruments in terms of liability or equity and significant estimates are made when determining the appropriate 
valuation methodology and deriving the estimated fair value of the subsidiary preferred shares. As such, they 
present a significant risk for the financial statements.
Revenue
Group subsidiaries enter into various revenue contracts with customers. Certain of these contracts require the use 
of significant key estimates and judgements when determining the appropriate accounting treatment of key terms 
in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. In particular, judgements arise in relation to allocation 
of fair values between multiple elements within contracts and recognition on delivery or over a period of time. As 
such, they present a significant risk or error for the financial statements. 107

EXTERNAL AUDIT
• Reviewed and approved the scope of the external audit procedures over the half-yearly report for the period 
ended 30 June 2017, and the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017;
• Discussed with management and agreed upon the terms of the engagement of the external auditors and the 
auditors’ remuneration for audit and non-audit services. In assessing independence, the Audit Committee 
received the auditor’s presentation and confirmation that in its professional judgment, KPMG LLP is independent 
within the meaning of regulatory and professional requirements and the objectivity of the partner and audit staff 
is not impaired. The Committee was satisfied that throughout the year that the objectivity and independence 
of KPMG LLP was not in any way impaired by the non-audit services they provided to the Group during the 
year, by the amounts of non-audit fees, or by any other factors;
• Assessed the independence, objectivity and qualifications of KPMG LLP as the external auditor and evaluated 
the quality and effectiveness of the audit procedures. In doing so, the Committee reviewed the audit plan 
and monitored performance against the plan, reviewed the periodic reports of KPMG LLP to the Committee 
that highlighted key areas of focus during the audit and the applied audit approach, and obtained feedback 
from the finance department in respect to quality and status of KPMG LLP work in the course of the audit. The 
Committee concluded that the audit process during the year was effective; and
• Reviewed and discussed the principal areas of financial reporting risk, as highlighted above, and reported 
to the Board.
KPMG LLP has been the external auditor of the Group since the first audit of the consolidated financial statements 
of Allied Minds plc in 2014. Mr. Charles le Strange Meakin has been the audit partner throughout this period. 
The total fees to KPMG LLP for the year ended 31 December 2017 were $0.7 million (see note 5 of the 
consolidated financial statements). The Audit Committee has considered the recent European Union audit reforms 
in terms of tendering and auditor’s tenure. Given that the Group listed on the London Stock Exchange during 
2014 and became a public interest entity (PIE), the next anticipated requirement to tender audit will be for the 
2024 calendar year. As such, the Company is complying with the Statutory Audit Services Order.
INTERNAL AUDIT
Given the size and composition of the Group, taking into account relevant significant matters, risk areas, areas of 
judgement in relation to the Group’s financial statements, and the centralised internal controls system in respect to 
the Group’s financial reporting process, the Board did not consider it necessary to have an internal audit function 
during the year. The Board will keep this decision under annual review.

Statement of Financial Position, Consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Equity, Consolidated Statement of Cash 
Flows, Company Balance Sheet, Company Statement 
of Changes in Equity, Company Statement of Cash 
flows and the related notes, including the accounting 
policies in note 1.
In our opinion:
–  the financial statements give a true and fair view 
of the state of the Group’s and of the parent 
Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and 
of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
–  the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU);
–  the parent Company financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006; and
the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) 
and applicable law. Our responsibilities are described 
below. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our 
opinion. Our audit opinion is consistent with our report 
to the audit committee.
We were appointed as auditor by the shareholders 
on 10 July 2014. The period of total uninterrupted 
engagement is for the four financial years ended 
31 December 2017. We have fulfilled our ethical 
responsibilities under, and we remain independent of 
the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements 
including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed 
public interest entities. No non-audit services prohibited 
by that standard were provided.

2. KEY AUDIT MATTERS: OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of 
the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the 
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. We summarise below the 
key audit matters in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with 
our key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results from 
those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the 
context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters.
The risk Our response
Disclosure of Group 
Subsidiary Ownership 
Adjusted Value
($395.6m; 2016: $416.2m)
Refer to page 106 (Audit 
Committee Report), and 
pages 151 to 152 (financial 
disclosures).
Disclosure quality: The group has 23 subsidiaries that 
are consolidated in the group accounts. The financial 
statements do include additional disclosure in relation 
to the Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value 
(GSOAV), as the Directors have determined that it 
is appropriate to voluntarily present this alternative 
performance measure, as supplementary information. 
The policy adopted by the Group is detailed in note 11. 
The group’s subsidiaries are, for the most part, still at the 
development stage and the majority do not yet generate 
revenues. This has therefore been determined to be a 
significant risk for our audit for the following reasons:
–  as a result of the Group policy not to formally revalue 
each subsidiary at each accounting period end there 
is significant judgement required to assess if there 
has been an indication of a decrease in the value of 
a subsidiary, therefore requiring a valuation;
–  where there is a valuation driven by Discounted 
Cash Flow (DCF), the inherent uncertainty involved 
in forecasting the trading of such companies and the 
significant level of judgement required to determine 
the assumptions used in the DCFs such as discount 
rate, revenue and EBIT forecasts and probability of 
success and the valuations are sensitive to changes 
in these assumptions. DCF valuation are prepared by 
an external expert on behalf of the company;
–  where there is a valuation which utilises a Probability- 
Weighted Expected Return Model (PWERM) analysis 
there is significant judgement in relation to both the 
scenarios chosen as well as the weighting of those 
scenarios;
–  for valuations based on recent third party funding 
rounds, the relatively low number of investors 
partaking in funding rounds means that there is a 
risk that recent investment on which valuation is 
based are not sufficiently at arm’s length to ensure an 
independent market valuation representative of fair 
value and;
–  the significance of the Group Subsidiary Ownership 
Adjusted Value disclosures in the group accounts to 
the users of the financial statements.
Our procedures included:
–  GSOAV Methodology choice: assessing the 
appropriateness of the valuation model used for 
each subsidiary based on the specific circumstances 
relevant to each company such as the stage of 
development, proximity to funding round, the industry 
in which it operates and also the likely exit date or 
commercialisation date and assessed for consistency 
with the approach taken in the prior year, 
understanding and challenging changes made.
–  Historical comparisons: Where it had been 
determined that no formal valuation will be prepared 
in the current year we assessed the appropriateness 
of this conclusion by critically assessing the 
performance of the related subsidiaries compared 
to prior year forecasts to identify indications of 
a decrease in the value of the company. We 
challenged the explanations received in respect of 
the relative valuations year on year in the context 
of the progression of the entity towards achieving 
milestones set and in relation to wider industry trends 
in the period.
–  Funding assessment: Where valuations are based 
on the implied value from the most recent third party 
we evaluated the independence of the funding 
rounds on which the valuation was based by looking 
at the number of external investors included within the 
funding round, the significance of their investments 
and whether they are sufficiently independent from 
the Group to form a basis for the valuation. 110

TO THE MEMBERS OF ALLIED MINDS PLC (CONTINUED)  
HEAD_0 1st line release 
The risk Our response
–  Our valuation expertise: Where valuations had 
been prepared by an external expert on behalf of 
the company we used our own valuation specialists 
to assist us in evaluating the assumptions and 
methodologies used in the valuations. We assessed 
the expertise and independence of the external 
experts. We critically assessed the appropriateness 
of the assumptions underlying the forecasts, including 
assumptions over projected revenue including 
forecast product commercialisation or license date 
and royalty rates where applicable and operating 
costs and EBIT margin terminal values and the 
probability of success factors where applicable. 
In doing this we used our knowledge of each 
subsidiary and its industry with reference to both 
internal management information and externally 
derived data and benchmarks, including market size 
data, royalty rates and competitor analyses based 
on information from public material.
–  Benchmarking assumptions: We critically assessed 
the appropriateness of the discount rates applied, 
against the assumptions used in the prior year, with 
specific focus (where applicable) on: the company 
specific risk premium (including appropriateness of 
the probability of success where applicable); the 
control premium; and the venture capital rates of 
return utilised. We considered against the stage of 
development of the company where capital rates of 
return are utilised and the specific scenarios of the 
company in respect of the control premium
–  Assessing transparency: We assessed whether 
the group’s disclosures were consistent with the 
valuations performed and whether the group’s 
disclosures adequately highlighted the uncertainty 
inherent in the valuations.
Our results
–  We found the Disclosure of Group Subsidiary 
Ownership Adjusted Value to be acceptable. 111

Financial instruments - 
preferred shares classification 
and valuation
($181.6m; 2016: $140.9m)
Refer to page 106 (Audit 
Committee Report), pages 
124 and 125 (accounting 
policy) and pages 156 to 160 
(financial disclosures).
Accounting treatment and subjective valuation: The 
group finances its operations and subsidiaries partly 
through financial instruments such as preferred shares. 
There is a significant level of judgement in determining 
whether the instruments should be classified as debt 
or equity and, when classified as debt, whether there 
are any embedded derivatives that require separation 
and would prevent the designation of the entire hybrid 
contract at fair value through profit or loss. The fair 
value is derived using the option pricing model which 
involves a significant level of judgement around the key 
assumptions, such as subsidiary values (either the implied 
value from a third party funding round, a valuation 
based on a DCF and/or PWERM analysis or asset 
based valuation – see relevant sections in “Disclosure of 
Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value”), volatility, 
expected time to the conversion event, forecast exit dates 
and scenarios and applicable probability weighting.
Our procedures included:
–  Accounting analysis: We critically assessed the 
conclusions reached by the group in relation to the 
debt versus equity classification of the issued financial 
instruments by considering the key terms and features 
of the contracts through applying and interpreting 
relevant accounting standards; Where the group 
designated the entire hybrid contract at fair value 
through profit or loss, we evaluated whether certain 
embedded derivatives required separate accounting 
by critically assessing the key terms and features of 
those derivatives.
–  Subjective valuation: The value of the subsidiary 
which is a key input into the option pricing model 
to give the value per share is either based on a 
third party funding round or on a DCF/PWERM 
analysis and therefore the procedures performed are 
detailed in ‘our responses’ to the ‘disclosure of group 
subsidiary ownership adjusted value’.
–  Our valuation expertise: We used our own valuation 
specialists to assist us in critically assessing other key 
inputs utilised within the option pricing model. We 
use comparable company data to critically assess the 
volatility assumption. Internal data such as strategic 
plans, forecasts and budgets and actual results are 
utilised for inputs such as exit dates and scenarios and 
probability of exit scenarios. Procedures performed 
include comparing to prior periods for consistency, 
understanding key changes and critically assessing 
current progress against milestones set and assessing 
where there is an impact on the forecast exit date 
and assessing whether the assumptions used are 
consistent with the strategic plans.
–  Assessing transparency: Assessing whether 
the group’s disclosures were consistent with the 
valuations performed and whether the group’s 
disclosures adequately highlighted the uncertainty 
inherent in the valuations.
Our results
–  We found the accounting treatment and valuation of 
preference shares to be acceptable.
Revenue recognition
($5.0m; 2016: $2.7m)
Refer to page 106 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 
130 (accounting policy) and 
pages 134 to 135 (financial 
disclosures).
Accounting treatment: Revenue recognition involves a 
significant level of judgment due to the non-standard nature 
of some of the contracts that make up the revenue streams 
of the group and the judgement required in assessing the 
implication of the terms of bespoke agreements in relation 
to the appropriate revenue recognition policy such as the 
allocation of consideration to each component of the 
contract, the timing of recognition of the revenue and the 
accounting for the associated costs.
Our procedures included:
–  Accounting analysis: Challenging the Group’s 
accounting treatment against applicable accounting 
standards for key revenue streams by inspecting the 
significant revenue contracts and critically assessing 
whether the key terms were in line with the Group’s 
assessment with a focus on the recognition of revenue 
over time and allocation of consideration to each 
component.
–  Assessing transparency: Assessing the adequacy 
of the Group’s disclosures in relation to the revenue 
recognition accounting policies adopted.
Our results
–  We found the revenue recognition to be acceptable. 112

Valuation of investments in the 
Parent Company
($173.5m; 2016: $158.4m)
Refer to page 173 (accounting 
policy) and page 174 (financial 
disclosures).
Low risk, High value:
The carrying amount of the parent company’s investments 
in the subsidiary companies represents 100% (2016: 
100%) of the company’s total assets. Its recoverability is 
not at a high risk of significant misstatement or subject to 
significant judgement. However, due to its materiality in 
the context of the parent company financial statements, 
this is considered to be the area that had the greatest 
effect on our overall parent company audit.
Our procedures included:
–  Comparing valuations: comparing the carrying 
amount of the investment to the market capitalisation 
of the Group, as Allied Minds Limited contains all of 
the group’s trading operations.
Our results
–  We found the group’s judgement that there is no 
indicator of impairment to be appropriate.
3. OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY AND AN 
OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Materiality for the group financial statements as a 
whole was set at $1.0m (2016: $1.0m), determined 
with reference to a benchmark of total expenses (being 
general and administrative expenses and research 
and development expenses) of which it represents 
1.0% (2016: 1.0%). Total expenses is considered to 
be one of the principal considerations for the members 
of the company in assessing the financial performance 
of the group, since the group’s activities are currently 
principally in relation to expenditure on developing 
forms of intellectual property which can be exploited 
commercially to generate income and growth in the 
future.
Materiality for the parent company financial statements 
as a whole was set at $0.9m (2016: $0.9m), 
determined with reference to a benchmark of total 
assets, of which it represents 0.9% (2016: 0.9%).
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any 
corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements 
exceeding $50k, in addition to other identified 
misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative 
grounds.
Of the group’s 2 (2016: 3) reporting components, we 
subjected 2 (2016: 3) to full scope audits for group 
purposes.
The components within the scope of our work accounted 
for the percentages illustrated opposite.
The Group team approved the component materiality 
of $900k, having regard to the mix of size and risk 
profile of the Group across the components. The 
work, including the audit of the parent company, was 
performed by the Group team.

7. RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES
Directors’ Responsibilities
As explained more fully in their statement set out on pages 52 to 54, the directors are responsible for: the 
preparation of the financial statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal 
control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and parent Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease operations, or 
have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s Responsibilities
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or other irregularities (see below), or error, and to issue our 
opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud, other irregularities or error and are considered material if, individually or in 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis 
of the financial statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.
Irregularities – Ability to Detect
We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the 
financial statements from our sector experience and through discussion with the directors.
We had regard to laws and regulations in areas that directly affect the financial statements including financial 
reporting (including related company legislation) and taxation legislation. We considered the extent of compliance 
with those laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.
We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of 
non-compliance throughout the audit.
As with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of irregularities, as these may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. 116

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
For the year ended 31 December 2017    
HEAD_0 1st line release 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
(1) ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Preparation
Allied Minds plc (“Allied Minds” or the “Company”) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The 
Annual Report and Accounts of Allied Minds and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”) are presented 
for the year ended 31 December 2017. The group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and 
its subsidiaries and include the Group’s interest in associates using the equity method of accounting. The Group 
financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with the International 
Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting Standards, and Interpretations (collectively “IFRS”) issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) as adopted by the European Union (“adopted IFRSs”). 
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods 
presented in these consolidated financial statements.
Basis of Measurement
The consolidated financial statements, with exception of financial instruments, have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis.
Use of Judgments and Estimates
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgments, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are 
reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively. The effects on the amounts 
recognised in the consolidated financial statements, or on other alternative performance measures, is included 
in the following notes:
• Note 4 – revenue recognition: when determining the correct amount of revenue to be recognised. This 
includes making certain estimates and judgements when determining the appropriate accounting treatment of 
key customer contract terms in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. In particular judgment 
is required to determine the timing of revenue recognition (on delivery or over a period of time). The Directors 
also make estimates of the fair values of each component of a contract to be able to allocate the overall 
consideration to each component based on the relative fair value method.
• Note 11 and 18 – portfolio and subsidiary preferred shares valuations: when determining the appropriate 
valuation methodology and deriving the estimated fair value of subsidiary undertakings and subsidiary 
preferred shares. This includes making certain estimates of the future earnings potential of the subsidiary 
businesses, appropriate discount rate and earnings multiple to be applied, marketability and other industry 
and company specific risk factors.
• Note 18 – subsidiary preferred shares liability classification: when determining the classification of financial 
instruments in terms of liability or equity. These judgements include an assessment whether the financial 
instrument include any embedded derivative features, whether they include a contractual obligations upon 
the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with 
another party, and whether that obligation will be settled by the Company’s exchanging a fixed amount of 
cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments. Further information about these 
critical judgments and estimates is included below under Financial Instruments. 122

HEAD_0 1st line release  
Changes in Accounting Policies
No other new standards, interpretations and amendments effective for the first time from 1 January 2017 have 
had a material effect on the Group’s financial statements.
Going Concern
The Directors have prepared trading and cash flow forecasts for the Group covering the period to 31 December 
2020. Despite the fact that the Group is currently loss making and is likely to continue to be so, at least in the 
short term, after making enquiries and considering the impact of risks and opportunities on expected cash flows, 
and given the fact that the Group has $169.1 million of available funds in the form of cash and fixed income 
securities as at 31 December 2017, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
cash to continue in operational existence for the period to 31 December 2020. For this reason, they have 
adopted the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Basis of Consolidation
Allied Minds plc was formed on 15 April 2014 and the consolidated financial statements for each of the years 
ended 31 December 2017 and 2016 comprises the financial statements of Allied Minds plc and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries
The financial information of the subsidiaries is prepared for the same reporting period as the parent Company, 
using consistent accounting policies. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an 
entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability 
to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in 
the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. 
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even 
if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.
Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity 
transactions. Where the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the assets and liabilities are derecognised along 
with any related NCI and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. 
Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.
Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and 
operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20 and 50 percent 
of the voting power of another entity.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method (equity accounted investees) and are initially recognised 
at cost. The Group’s investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment 
losses. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total comprehensive income and 
equity movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence commences until the date 
that significant influence ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted 
investee, the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except 
to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an 
investee. 123

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Transactions Eliminated on Consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group 
transactions, are eliminated. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are 
eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are 
eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Acquisitions and Disposals of Non-controlling Interests
Non-controlling interests (‘‘NCI’’) are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net 
assets at the acquisition date. Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control 
are accounted for as equity transactions.
Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted 
for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result 
of such transactions. The adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the 
net assets of the subsidiary. Any difference between the price paid or received and the amount by which non-
controlling interests are adjusted is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent.
Functional and Presentation Currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of most of 
the entities in the Group. All amounts have been rounded to the nearest thousand unless otherwise indicated.
Foreign Currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the 
foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling 
at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive loss. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign 
exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on 
consolidation, are translated to the Group’s presentational currency (US dollar) at foreign exchange rates ruling 
at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate 
for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. 
Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are reported as an item of other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve or non- controlling interest, as the case may 
be. When a foreign operation is disposed of, such that control, joint control or significant influence (as the case 
may be) is lost, the entire accumulated amount in the Translation reserve, net of amounts previously attributed to 
non-controlling interests, is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the Group 
disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while still retaining control, 
the relevant proportion of the accumulated amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests. When the Group 
disposes of only part of its investment in a subsidiary or an associate that includes a foreign operation while still 
retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to 
profit or loss. 124

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less.
Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on 
the specific identification or weighted-average method. The cost of inventories includes expenditure incurred 
in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their 
existing location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an 
appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of 
completion and selling expenses.
Financial Instruments
Financial Assets
The Group initially recognises loans and receivables and deposits on the date that they are originated. All other 
financial assets are recognised initially on the trade date at which the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, 
or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a 
net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: cash and cash equivalents, trade and other 
receivables, security and other deposits, other investments. Fixed income securities are recognised at fair value 
through profit and loss. The remaining categories are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method.
Other investments comprise fixed income debt securities, including government agency and corporate bonds, 
are stated at amortised cost less impairment. It is the Group policy to hold these investments until a maximum 
maturity of three years.
Financial Liabilities
The Group initially recognises debt securities issued and subordinated liabilities on the date that they are 
originated. All other financial liabilities are recognised initially on the trade date at which the Group becomes a 
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.
The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the following categories: trade and other payables and 
loans. Such financial liabilities are recognised at fair value through profit and loss plus any directly attributable 
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition these financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. 125
Financial Statements
   
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)  
HEAD_0 1st line release 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Warrants are accounted for as financial liabilities and recorded at fair value.
The Group’s financial liabilities include subsidiary preferred shares some of which incorporate embedded 
derivatives. In accordance with IAS 39.11 the Group has elected not to bifurcate the embedded derivative 
but fair value the entire instrument at each reporting date. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Financial Instruments Issued by the Group
Following the adoption of IAS 32, financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the 
extent that they meet the following two conditions:
• they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange 
financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to 
the Group; and
• where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-
derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments 
or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company’s exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial 
assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the financial instrument is classified as a financial liability. Where the 
instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in the financial 
information for share capital and merger reserve account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Where a financial instrument that contains both equity and financial liability components exists, these components 
are separated and accounted for individually under the above policy.
Share Capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. The Group considers its capital to comprise share capital, share 
premium, merger reserve, translation reserve, and accumulated deficit.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Assets under construction 
represent machinery and equipment to be used in operations, R&D activities, or to be leased to customers once 
completed.
When parts of an item of property and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate 
items (major components) of property and equipment. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method 
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets:
Computers and electronics 3 years
Furniture and fixtures  5 years
Machinery and equipment 5 -20 years
Under construction  Not depreciated until transferred into use
Leasehold improvements Shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at least annually and adjusted if appropriate. 126

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)  
HEAD_0 1st line release 
Intangible Assets
Licenses (or Options to License) and Purchased In Process Research & Development
Licenses or options to license represent licenses or such options provided by universities, federal laboratories, 
and scientists in exchange for an equity ownership in the entities or cash. Purchased in process research & 
development (‘‘IPR&D’’) represents time and expertise already invested by the scientist and provided in exchange 
for an equity interest in the entity. Licenses or options to license and purchased IPR&D are valued based on the 
amount of cash directly paid to acquire those assets or based on the amount of cash contributed by Allied Minds, 
at inception of the subsidiary, and the proportionate amount of equity ascribed to Allied Minds. The licenses 
or options to license and purchased IPR&D are capitalised only when they meet the criteria for capitalisation, 
namely separately identifiable and measurable and it is probable that economic benefit will flow to the entity.
Capitalised Development Costs
Research and development costs include charges from universities based on sponsored research agreements 
(“SRAs”) that the subsidiaries of Allied Minds enter into with universities. Under these agreements, the universities 
perform research on the technology that is being licensed to the subsidiaries. Research and development costs 
also include charges from independent research and development contractors, contract research organisations 
(“CROs”), and other research institutions.
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Development expenditure is capitalised 
only if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially 
feasible, future economic benefits are probable, the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete 
development and to use or sell the asset, and if the Group can measure reliably the expenditure attributable to 
the intangible asset during its development. The point at which technical feasibility is determined to have been 
reached is when regulatory approval has been received, where applicable. Management determines that 
commercial viability has been reached when a clear market and pricing point have been identified, which may 
coincide with achieving recurring sales. Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of 
new or substantially improved products or processes. The expenditure considered for capitalisation includes the 
cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overhead costs. Otherwise, the development 
expenditure is recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, development expenditure 
is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Software
Software intangible assets that are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Finite-lived intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, from the date 
that they are available for use. Intangible assets which are not yet available for use (and therefore not amortised) 
are tested for impairment at least annually.
Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive loss on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful 
life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. Other intangible assets 
are amortised from the date they are available for use. Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are 
reviewed at least annually and adjusted if appropriate. 127
Financial Statements

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
The estimated useful lives of the Group’s intangible assets are as follows:
Licences and Options to License Over the remaining life of the underlying patents
Purchased IPR&D    Over the remaining life of the underlying patents, once commercial 
viability has been achieved
Development cost   Over the remaining life of the underlying technology
Software      2 years
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current Income Tax
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates 
enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous 
years.
Deferred Income Tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax assets are 
recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax assets are 
reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax 
benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they 
reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and 
assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax 
entities where the Group intends to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and 
liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
Deferred taxes are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in 
equity or in other comprehensive income.
Impairment
Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
Non-financial assets consist of property and equipment and intangible assets, including licences, purchased 
IPR&D, capitalised development cost, with finite lives and such intangible assets which are not yet available for 
use.
The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property and equipment and finite-lived intangibles at each 
reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the 
asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Intangible assets which are not yet available for use are tested annually 
for impairment. 128
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)  
HEAD_0 1st line release 
For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows 
from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cash-generating units 
(‘‘CGUs’’).
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. 
Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.
An impairment loss is recognised in profit and loss if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its 
recoverable amount. Impairment losses are allocated to reduce the carrying amounts of assets in a CGU on a 
pro rata basis.
Impairment of Financial Assets
Financial assets not classified as at fair value through profit or loss are assessed at each reporting date to 
determine whether there is objective evidence of impairment.
Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired includes:
• default or delinquency by a debtor;
• restructuring of an amount due to the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;
• indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy;
• adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers or issuers;
• the disappearance of an active market for a security; or
• observable data indicating that there is measurable decrease in expected cash flows from a group of 
financial assets.
Financial Assets Measured at Amortised Cost
The Group considers evidence of impairment for these assets at both an individual asset and a collective level. 
All individually significant assets are individually assessed for impairment. Those found not to be impaired are 
then collectively assessed for any impairment that has been incurred but not yet individually identified. Assets that 
are not individually significant are collectively assessed for impairment. Collective assessment is carried out by 
grouping together assets with similar risk characteristics.
In assessing collective impairment, the Group uses historical information on the timing of recoveries and the 
amount of loss incurred, and makes an adjustment if current economic and credit conditions are such that the 
actual losses are likely to be greater or lesser than suggested by historical trends.
An impairment loss is calculated as the difference between an asset’s carrying amount and the present value of the 
estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Losses are recognised in profit 
or loss and reflected in an allowance account. When the Group considers that there are no realistic prospects of 
recovery of the asset, the relevant amounts are written off. If the amount of impairment loss subsequently decreases 
and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, then the 
previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss. 129

Share-based Payments
Share-based payment arrangements in which the Group or its subsidiaries receive goods or services as consideration 
for their own equity instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions, regardless 
of how the equity instruments are obtained by the Group or its subsidiaries. Grants of equity instruments under 
the subsidiary stock option incentive plans are accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated accounts of the 
parent and are reflected in equity as a credit to Non-Controlling Interest.
The grant date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee 
expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally 
entitled to the awards. The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option pricing valuation model, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised 
as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market 
vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based 
on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting 
date. For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based 
payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and 
actual outcomes.
Employee Benefits
Short-term Employee Benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related 
service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a present 
legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the 
obligation can be estimated reliably.
Defined Contribution Plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into 
a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions 
to defined contribution plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the periods during which related 
services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash 
refund or a reduction in future payments is available.
Phantom Plan
The Phantom Plan is a cash settled bonus plan. Expense is accrued when it is determined that it is probable that 
a payment will be made and when the amount can be reasonably estimated.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as 
a result of a past event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits 
will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows 
at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability. 130

Revenue Recognition
Sale of Goods
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, 
recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated 
reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods and the amount of revenue can be 
measured reliably.
The transfer of significant risks and rewards of ownership usually occurs when products are shipped and the 
customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss.
Rendering of Services
The Group recognises revenue from rendering of services at the time services are provided to the customer and 
the Group has no additional performance obligation to the customer.
Government Grants
Grants received are recognised as revenue when the related work is performed and the qualifying research and 
development costs are incurred.
License Revenue
The Group recognises revenue from fees associated with licensing of its technologies to third parties in the form 
of license fees and royalties on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement 
and when the Company’s right to receive payment is established, provided that it is probable that the economic 
benefits will flow to the Company and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Finance Income and Finance Costs
Finance income mainly comprises interest income on funds invested and foreign exchange gains. Finance costs 
mainly comprise loan interest expense and foreign exchange losses. Interest income and interest payable are 
recognised as they accrue in profit or loss, using the effective interest method.
Fair Value Measurements
A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both 
financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as 
possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the 
valuation techniques as follows:
• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
• Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 131
Financial Statements
   
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)  
HEAD_0 1st line release 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised in different levels of the 
fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value 
hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.
The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during 
which the change has occurred.
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, deposits, accounts payable, accrued 
expenses and other current liabilities in the Group’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Position approximates 
their fair value because of the short maturities of these instruments.
Operating Leases
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of 
the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term 
of the lease.
Operating Segments
Allied Minds determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided to 
the executive management team, the body which is considered to be Allied Minds’ Chief Operating Decision 
Maker (‘‘CODM’’).
An operating segment is a component of Allied Minds that engages in business activities from which it may earn 
revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Allied 
Minds’ other components. The operating segment’s operating results are reviewed regularly by the CODM to 
make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment, to assess its performance, and for which discrete 
financial information is available.
(2) NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS NOT YET ADOPTED
A number of new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards are effective for annual 
periods beginning after 1 January 2018, and have not therefore been applied in preparing this consolidated 
financial information. Management has yet to complete an analysis of these new standards, interpretations and 
amendments to existing standards on the results of its operations, financial position, and disclosures. The Group 
intends to adopt these standards on their respective effective dates.
The following are amended or new standards and interpretations that may impact the Group. The Group is 
finalising the required disclosures, which includes an assessment of the impact of the new guidance on our 
financial position and results of operations. The adoption of the proposed changes is not expected to have a 
material effect on the financial statements unless otherwise indicated:
IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’ (effective 1 January 2018)
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, deals with recognition, measurement, classification and impairment and 
derecognition of financial assets, financial liabilities and some contracts to buy or sell non-financial items. This 
standard replaces IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and is required to be adopted 
from 1 January 2018. The Group has performed a preliminary assessment of the potential impact of adoption of 
IFRS 9 based on its positions at 31 December 2017 under IAS 39 and it does not expect the adoption of this 
guidance to have a material effect on its financial statements. 132
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)  
HEAD_0 1st line release 
Classification – Financial Assets
IFRS 9 contains a new classification and measurement approach for financial assets that reflects the business model 
in which assets are managed and their cash flow characteristics. IFRS 9 contains three principal classification 
categories for financial assets: measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income 
(“FVOCI”) and fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”). The standard eliminates the existing IAS 39 categories of 
held to maturity, loans and receivables, and available for sale. Under IFRS 9, derivatives embedded in contracts 
where the host is a financial asset in the scope of the standard are never bifurcated. Instead, the hybrid as a 
whole is assessed for classification.
Cash and cash equivalents: Represent basic cash balances in banks used to fund operations. These will be 
classified as assets at Amortised cost under the new standard;
Trade Receivables: Under IFRS 9 trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component have to 
be initially recognised at their transaction price rather than at FV. The Group initially recognises receivables and 
deposits on the date that they are originated at their transaction price, which is the same as their fair value. As 
such, Trade and other receivables will be classified as assets at Amortised cost under IFRS 9.
Security and other deposits: These generally represent security deposits paid by the Group to landlords as part 
of operating lease commitments. As the Company’s objective is that those deposits will be collected back, they 
will be classified as assets at Amortised Cost under IFRS 9.
Fixed income securities: At 31 December 2017, the Group had investments in the form of fixed income securities 
classified as assets designated as FVTPL with a fair value of $11.1 million that are held for supporting the short-
term liquidity needs of the Group. The changes in fair value year over year have been historically immaterial as 
these investments are in cash equivalent and short term position. Per the new guidance, the amounts presented 
in OCI are never reclassified to profit or loss even if such a gain or loss is realized by settling or repurchasing 
the financial instrument at fair value. However, the Company has the option to transfer the cumulative gain and 
loss within equity. Under IFRS 9, these investments will be designated as measured at FVOCI. Consequently, all 
fair value gains and losses will be reported in OCI and no impairment losses will be recognised in profit or loss. 
The Group’s preliminary assessment does not indicate any material impact from IFRS 9 on the Group’s financial 
position as of 31 December 2017 or the total comprehensive loss for the year then ended.
Investments in subsidiaries: Currently, all group subsidiaries are fully consolidated in the consolidated financial 
statements. The value of those investments is disclosed as an alternative performance measure, which was 
determined at $395.6 million as of 22 March 2018. In future, the Company’s position in those investments 
may be reduced to a point where the Company no longer exercises control over these entities and they are 
deconsolidated from the group accounts and presented separately as investments in equity securities on the 
consolidated statement of financial position. If these investments continue to then be held for the same long-term 
strategic purposes, per the application of IFRS 9, the Group may elect then to classify them as FVOCI or FVTPL. 
The Group has not yet made a decision in this regard. In the former case, all fair value gains and losses would 
be reported in other comprehensive income, no impairment losses would be recognised in profit or loss and no 
gains or losses would be reclassified to profit or loss on disposal. In the latter case, all fair value gains and losses 
would be recognised in profit or loss as they arise, increasing volatility in the Group’s profits.
Impairment – Financial Assets
IFRS 9 replaces the ‘incurred loss’ model in IAS 39 with a ‘forward looking expected credit loss’ (“ECL”) model. 
This will require considerable judgement about how changes in economic factors affect ECLs, which will be 
determined on a probability-weighted basis. 133
Financial Statements
   
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)  
HEAD_0 1st line release 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
The new impairment model will apply to debt instruments accounted for at amortised cost or at FVOCI, most 
loan commitments, financial guarantee contracts, contract assets under IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers and lease receivables under IAS 17 Leases or IFRS 16 Leases.
Under IFRS 9, loss allowances will be measured on either 12-month ECL on initial recognition and thereafter as 
long as there is no significant deterioration in credit risk; or lifetime ECL if there has been a significant increase 
in credit risk on an individual or collective basis. For trade receivables, a simplified approach may be applied 
whereby the lifetime ECL are always recognised. Based on the assessments undertaken to date, the group 
expects no additional impairment provision recognised as at 1 January 2018.
Classification – Financial Liabilities
Under IAS 39 all fair value changes of liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss are recognised 
in profit or loss, whereas under IFRS 9 these fair value changes are generally presented as follows:
• the amount of change in the fair value that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of the liability is 
presented in OCI; and
• the remaining amount of change in the fair value is presented in profit or loss.
The Group has designated the subsidiary preferred shares liability at FVTPL and the trade and other payables 
and loans at Amortised Cost under IFRS 9. The Group’s preliminary assessment did not indicate any material 
impact if IFRS 9’s requirements regarding the classification of financial liabilities were applied at 31 December 
2017.
IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ (effective 1 January 2018)
IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is 
recognised. It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction 
Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programs.
The standard outlines a comprehensive five-step revenue recognition model based on the principal that an entity 
should recognise revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled 
in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. The standard permits either a full retrospective or a 
modified retrospective approach for the adoption. The Group has completed an initial assessment of the potential 
impact on its consolidated financial statements and determined that this standard will not have a material impact 
on our financial position and results of operations. As of 1 January 2018, the Group’s implementation plan to 
adopt this new guidance is substantially complete. The Company intends to adopt this standard using a modified 
retrospective approach.
The majority of the Company’s subsidiaries are characterised by some early stage sales that are generally still 
considered an isolated number of sales. In 2017, the company has recognised $5.0 million in revenue. Out of 
the total revenue recognised in current year, 89% has been recorded by Federated Wireless, Inc., HawkEye
360
, 
Inc. and RF Biocidics, Inc. Management’s evaluation and adoption impact of IFRS 15 was performed based on 
the 5-step model and each signed revenue contract was considered unique and reviewed separately. For sale 
of products, revenue is currently recognised when the goods are delivered to the customers’ premises, which 
is taken to be the point in time at which the customer accepts the goods and the related risks and rewards of 
ownership transfer. While IAS 18 states that the revenue recognition criteria depends on each type of revenue, 
IFRS 15 implements a uniform method of recognising revenue based on the actual contract and performance 
obligation. The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or  134
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)  
HEAD_0 1st line release 
service transfers to a customer. Based on the Group’s assessment, the fair value and the stand-alone selling 
prices of the good rendered and services provided are broadly similar. Therefore, the Group does not expect 
the application of IFRS 15 to result in significant differences in the timing of revenue recognition for these good 
and services.
IFRS 16, ‘Leases’ (effective 1 January 2019)
IFRS 16 replaces existing leases guidance, including IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement 
contains a lease, SIC -15 Operating Leases – Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the substance of transactions 
involving the legal form of a lease. IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for 
lessees in a similar way to finance leases under IAS 17. A lessee recognises a right-of-use asset representing its 
right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. There 
are recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value items. Lessor accounting remains similar 
to the current standard-i.e: lessors continue to classify leases as finance or operating leases.
The Group has completed an initial assessment of the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements 
but has not yet completed its detailed assessment. So far, the most significant impact identified is that the Group 
will recognise new assets and liabilities for its operating leases of its rented office and laboratory space. As 
at 31 December 2017, the Group’s future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases 
amounted to $8.0 million, on an undiscounted basis (see note 21). The Group plans to apply IFRS 16 initially 
on 1 January 2019, using the modified retrospective approach. Therefore, the cumulative effect of adopting IFRS 
16 will be recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at 1 January 2019, with 
no restatement of comparative information.
Other new standards and interpretations yet to be adopted, for which the Company does not expect to have a 
material impact on its financial statements include:
Amendments to IFRS 2, ‘Share-based Payment’ to clarify classification and measurement (effective 1 January 
2018)
IFRIC Interpretation 22, Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration (effective 1 January 2018)

(4) OPERATING SEGMENTS
Basis for Segmentation
For management purposes, the Group’s principal operations are currently organised in two types of activities:
(i)  Early stage companies – subsidiary businesses that are in the early stage of their lifecycle characterised by 
incubation, research and development activities; and
(ii)  Later stage companies – subsidiary businesses that have substantially advanced with or completed their 
research and development activities, are closer in their lifecycle to commercialisation, and/or have a 
potential of realising material return on investment through a future liquidity event.
The Group no longer recognises commercial stage companies as a separate reportable segment. Instead, a 
Later stage companies reportable segment is established in the current year, as defined above.
The Group’s CODM reviews internal management reports on these segments at least quarterly in order to make 
decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance.
Other operations include the management function of the head office at the parent level of Allied Minds. 136

The cumulative amount of litigation settlements during 2017 was nil (2016: $1,750,000). In the prior year, this 
related to the settlement of a manufacturing commitment, which RF Biocidics held with a third party. The issue 
arose and was settled during 2016.
As a result of the restructuring plan from April 2017, the Company recognised a net restructuring charge for 
the period of $7.3 million, of which $4.7 million related to non-cash charges for impairment of tangible and 
intangible assets and inventory write-offs and is net of $1.1 million in net proceeds from the sale of assets.
The Group recorded an impairment charge on property and equipment of $0.6 million (2016: nil) and on 
intangible assets of $1.6 million (2016: nil) and wrote off certain tangible and intangible assets at the companies 
included in the plan.
Inventory write-offs as a result of the restructuring plan accounted for $2.5 million of the cost of sales for the 
period.

(6) SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
UK Long Term Incentive Plan
Under the UK Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”), awards over Ordinary Shares may be made to employees, 
officers and Directors, and other individuals providing services to the Company and its subsidiaries. Awards 
may be granted in the form of share options, share appreciation rights, restricted or unrestricted share awards, 
performance share awards, restricted share units, phantom-share awards and other share-based awards. Vesting 
is subject to the achievement of certain performance conditions and continued services of the participant.
Awards have been granted under the LTIP based on the following vesting criteria:
• awards subject to performance conditions based on the Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) 
performance or relative total shareholder return (rTSR) performance over a defined of time;
• awards subject to performance conditions based on a basket of shareholder value metrics (“SVM”). 
Performance is assessed on these measures on a scorecard basis over a defined period of time;
• awards that vest 100 per cent after a period of time subject to continued service condition only. 140

The Company issued awards under the LTIP during 2017 and 2016 in respect of a total of 7,466,235 and 
1,499,247 Ordinary Shares, respectively. A summary of stock option activity under the UK LTIP for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 and 2016, respectively, is shown below:

The share grants that vest upon the occurrence of a market condition (i.e. the TSR performance) and service 
condition were adjusted to current market price at the date of the grant to reflect the effect of the market condition 
on the non-vested shares’ value. The Company used a Monte Carlo simulation analysis utilising a Geometric 
Brownian Motion process with 50,000 simulations to value those shares. The model takes into account share 
price volatilities, risk-free rate and other covariance of comparable UK public companies and other market data 
to predict distribution of relative share performance. This is applied to the reward criteria to arrive at expected 
value of the TSR awards.
The share grants that vests only upon the occurrence of a non-market performance condition (i.e. the SVM 
grants) and service condition were valued at the fair value of the shares on the date of the grants and the 
vesting conditions are taken into account by subsequently adjusting the number of instruments included in the 
measurement of the transaction amount so that, ultimately, the amount of recognised share-based expense is 
based on the number of instruments that eventually vest.
The accounting charge does not necessarily represent the intended value of share-based payments made to 
recipients, which are determined by the Remuneration Committee according to established criteria. The share-
based payment charge for the fiscal year ended 31 December 2017 related to the UK LTIP was $7.6 million 
(2016: $5.9 million).
U.S. Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan
The U.S. Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan (the “U.S. Stock Plan”) was originally adopted by Allied Minds, Inc. 
(now Allied Minds, LLC) in 2008. The U.S. Stock Plan provides for the grant of share option awards, restricted 
share awards, and other awards to acquire common stock of Allied Minds, Inc. (now Allied Minds, LLC). All stock 
options granted to employees under this plan are equity settled, for a ten-year term. Pursuant to the Company’s 
IPO in 2014, Allied Minds plc adopted and assumed the rights and obligations of Allied Minds, Inc. (now Allied 
Minds, LLC) under this plan except that the obligation to issue Common Stock is replaced with an obligation to 
issue ordinary shares to satisfy awards granted under the U.S. Stock Plan. As of 19 June 2014, the maximum 
number of options reserved under the plan were issued and outstanding and as a result of the Company’s IPO 
in 2014, all issued and outstanding options vested on 19 June 2014. The Company does not intend to make 
any further grants under the U.S. Stock Plan. 141

Other Plans
Spin Transfer Technologies (“Spin Transfer”)
Stock compensation expense was approximately $724,000 and $1,129,000 for the year ended 31 December 
2017 and 2016, respectively. Deferred stock compensation expense under these grants was approximately 
$475,000 and $1,199,000 as of 31 December 2017 and 2016, respectively.
There were no new grants under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan in 2017. The fair value of the stock option grants 
awarded under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan is estimated as of the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton 
option valuation model that uses the following weighted average assumptions:
2017 2016
Expected option life (in years) — 6.10 
Expected stock price volatility — 40.99%
Risk-free interest rate — 1.21%
Expected dividend yield — — 
Grant date option fair value — $ 3.18
Share price at grant date — $ 7.77
Exercise price — $ 7.77
Expected volatility has been based on an evaluation of the historical volatility of the share price of publicly traded 
companies comparable to Spin Transfer, particularly over the historical period commensurate with the expected 
term. The expected term of the instruments has been based on historical experience and general option holder 
behavior. 142

Allied Minds Phantom Plan
In 2007, Allied Minds established a cash settled bonus plan for Allied Minds employees, also known as its 
Phantom Plan. In 2012, the board of directors adopted the Amended and Restated 2007 Phantom Plan. Under 
the terms of the Amended and Restated Plan, upon a liquidity event Allied Minds will allocate 10% of the value 
(after deduction of the amount invested by Allied Minds and accrued interest at a rate not exceeding 5% per 
annum) of the invested capital owned by Allied Minds of each operating company to the plan account. Upon 
a liquidity event, plan participants holding units will receive their proportionate share of the plan account. The 
allocated shares at all times remain the sole and exclusive property of Allied Minds and holders of units have 
no rights or interests in Allied Minds. No amount has been paid out to employees under the Phantom Stock Plan 
through 31 December 2017.
Allied Minds has not accrued any expense relating to the Phantom Plan as of 31 December 2017 or 2016. 
Management will record an expense relating to this plan when it is probable that a subsidiary will be sold and 
the amount of the payout is reasonably estimable.
Share-based Payment Expense
The Group recorded share-based payment expense related to stock options of approximately $7,562,000 
and $8,385,000 for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016, respectively. There was no income 
tax benefit recognised for share- based payment arrangements for the years ended 31 December 2017

statements.
In July 2017, Signature Medical completed a Series A round of financing issuing 13,241,526 Series A preferred 
shares for $2.5 million to Allied Minds and two new strategic investors. As a result, following the transaction,

In April 2016, Allied Minds completed the formation of ABLS Capital, LLC in partnership with existing shareholders 
of the Group. The members of ABLS Capital committed to up to $80.0 million for the development of drug 
discovery programs, of which 22.5% was committed by Allied Minds, and contributed an initial $2.0 million 
for 2.0 million Class B shares to fund the operations of the subsidiary. The purpose of this partnership is to fund 
80% of the lead optimisation phase of up to ten new drug candidates that pass initial feasibility studies funded

2014
In October 2014, Spin Transfer Technologies (“STT”) completed a Series A financing round as a result of which 
the Allied Minds’ ownership percentage in STT decreased from 56.13% to 48.40%. Whilst Allied Minds owns 
less than 50.00% of the voting share capital after the transaction and as of 31 December 2017, the company 
remains the largest single shareholder at 48.40% of the voting share capital, and retains control over the majority 
of the voting rights on the board of directors of STT. Under the terms of the STT organisational documents, the 
board of directors effectively controls the policies and management of STT, and in all instances, the board acts by 
majority vote. In addition, all material shareholder voting provisions of the STT organisational documents require 
a simple majority for approval, giving the Company substantial influence over the outcome of all actions which 
require a shareholder vote. As a result, following the transaction, Allied Minds continues to exercise effective 
control over STT and as such will continue to be fully consolidated within the group’s financial statements.

Portfolio Valuation
At the close of each annual financial period, the Directors formally approve the value of all subsidiary businesses 
in the Group, which is used to derive the ‘‘Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value’’. This Group Subsidiary 
Ownership Adjusted Value is a sum-of-the-parts (‘‘SOTP’’) valuation of all the subsidiaries that make up the Group. 
GSOAV is an alternative performance measure (“APM”) used by the Directors as a key performance indicator 
(“KPI”) to measure the performance of the Group. An APM is a numeric measure of the Group’s financial position 
that is not a GAAP measure. As the Group exercises control over all of its investments in subsidiary undertakings 
their activities are fully consolidated in the group accounts and the value of those investments is not separately 
disclosed in the statement of financial position. Only the value of non-controlling interests of certain subsidiaries 
reflecting the subsidiary preferred shares liability is disclosed separately in the statement of financial position, 
as further discussed in footnote 18. These valuations assume there will be available funds for the subsidiaries to 
reach next stages of their development towards commercial success or an exit event.
The Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value (‘‘GSOAV’’) was $395.6 million as of 22 March 2018 
(2016: $416.2 million). The decrease compared to prior year is primarily attributed to discontinued funding and 
wind-down of Percipient Networks, Seamless Devices and Whitewood Encryption, as well as write downs in 
platform companies AMFI and Foreland. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in value at BridgeSat 
and Federated Wireless demonstrated by the consummation of a third-party fundraising. 152
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)  
HEAD_0 1st line release 
Ownership adjusted value represents Allied Minds’ interest in the equity value of each subsidiary and is calculated 
as follows: lower of (Business Enterprise Value – Long Term Debt + Cash) x Allied Minds percentage ownership 
plus the value of debt provided by Allied Minds plc to each subsidiary business, or the subsidiary Business 
Enterprise Value. Allied Minds commits post seed funding to its subsidiaries in the form of loans.
Valuation Methodology
Each subsidiary company is regularly evaluated based on a range of inputs, including: company performance 
and progress towards development milestones; market and competitor analyses based on information from 
databases and public material; and interviews with scientists and physicians.
The Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value represents the sum-of-the-parts (‘‘SOTP’’) of, principally, net 
present value (‘‘NPV’’) or risk-adjusted net present value (‘‘rNPV’’) from discounted cash flow (‘‘DCF’’) valuations 
and valuations based on recent third party investment at the subsidiary level. A DCF valuation is used for the 
majority of Allied Minds subsidiaries. The DCF valuations are updated when the underlying assumptions for the 
valuations warrant a change. Generally, valuations are not increased unless warranted by or in anticipation of 
a financing transaction. Valuations are decreased in situations where the subsidiary is falling short of expected 
progress. Otherwise, the valuations are kept constant. When available, financing transactions are used as the 
basis for the subsidiary valuation. In limited instances other techniques such as based on asset values are utilised.
In the current year, the Group relied on funding transactions as the principal methodology to value all subsidiaries 
in the portfolio, except for LuxCath where the DCF valuation model was updated in the current year. Funding 
transactions used as basis for the subsidiary valuations were consummated in the current year, except for Allied 
Bristol Life Sciences (2014), Spin Transfer Technologies (2014), Precision Biopsy (2016), HawkEye
360
 (2016), 
and SciFluor Life Sciences (2015). In those cases, a DCF was used to substantiate the subsidiary valuation 
based on a prior funding round. Subsidiaries for which the ownership-adjusted value was based on a funding 
transaction accounted for 95.9% of total GSOAV in the current year (2016: 87.1%), and those based on DCF 
or other alternative methods accounted for 4.1% (2016: 13.9%).
For detail of the Net Present Value (“NPV”) method used in estimating the group valuations from discounted cash 
flows see footnote 18.

(17) ACQUISITION OF NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST (“NCI”)
For the two years ended 31 December 2017, the Group recognised the following changes in common and 
preferred stock ownership in subsidiaries resulting in changes to non-controlling interest:
• In April 2016, the Group completed the formation of ABLS Capital, LLC in partnership with existing 
shareholders of Allied Minds. The members of the LLC committed to up to $80 million for the development 
of up to 10 drug discovery programs, of which Allied Minds commits 22.5%, and contributed an initial 
$2 million funding for 2 million Class B shares. The purpose of this partnership is to fund 80% of the lead 
optimisation phase of up to ten new drug candidates that pass initial feasibility studies funded by ABLS. The 
remaining 20% of lead optimisation phase investment, or up to an additional $20 million, will be funded by 
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), pursuant to the terms of the partnership formed in 2014 through ABLS. 
Following the transaction, Allied Minds continues to exercise effective control over ABLS Capital and as such 
the subsidiary will continue to be fully consolidated within the group’s financial statements. 155
Financial Statements
   
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
  In August 2016, ABLS Capital raised $12 million of new equity in a Class B shares round pursuant to the 
initial commitment discussed to fund its portion of the ABLS II financing (see below). There is no change in the 
subsidiary’s governance structure as a result of the round. Following the transaction Allied Minds continues to 
exercise effective control over ABLS Capital and as such the subsidiary will continue to be fully consolidated 
within the group’s financial statements.
• In August 2016, ABLS II closed a Series A round of financing issuing 6,410,256 shares of Preferred Stock 
at issue price of $2.34 per share to ABLS Capital and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, raising approximately 
$15.0 million. The use of proceeds from the Series A round is intended primarily to fund further development 
of the lead optimisation program. Should this next lead optimisation phase prove successful, Bristol-Myers 
Squibb has the right to acquire Allied Minds’ interest in ABLS II at a pre-determined multiple of invested 
capital.
• In October 2017, Allied-Bristol Life Sciences (ABLS) launched its fourth project – ABLS IV, LLC, in a partnership 
with Cornell University. ABLS owns 100% of the common stock of ABLS IV. Following the transaction, Allied 
Minds continues to exercise effective control over ABLS and subsidiaries including ABLSI V and as such the 
subsidiary will continue to be fully consolidated within the group’s financial statements.
• During 2017, as a result of the restructuring earlier in the year, the company discontinued funding of eight 
subsidiaries, seven of which were legally dissolved and deconsolidated as of 31 December 2017.

(18) SUBSIDIARY PREFERRED SHARES
Certain of the Group’s subsidiaries have outstanding preferred shares which have been classified as a subsidiary 
preferred shares in current liabilities in accordance with IAS 39 as the subsidiaries have a contractual obligation 
to deliver cash or other assets to the holders under certain future liquidity events, and/or a requirement to deliver 
an uncertain number of common shares upon conversion. The preferred shares do not contain mandatory 
dividend rights. The preferred shares are convertible into common stock of the subsidiary at the option of the 
holder and mandatorily convertible into common stock of the subsidiary upon a qualified public offering at or 
above certain value and gross proceeds specified in the agreements or upon the vote of the holders of a majority 
of the subsidiary preferred shares. Under certain scenarios the number of common stock shares receivable on 
conversion will change. The Group has elected not to bifurcate the variable conversion feature as a derivative 
liability, but account for the entire instrument at fair value through the income statement.
The preferred shares are entitled to a vote with holders of common stock on an as converted basis. The holders 
of the preferred shares are entitled to a liquidation preference amount in the event of a liquidation or a deemed 
liquidation event of the respective subsidiary. The Group recognises the subsidiary preferred shares balance 
upon the receipt of cash financing, and records the change in its fair value for the respective reporting period 
through profit and loss. Preferred shares are not allocated shares of the subsidiary losses.

The fair value is derived using the option pricing model where the key inputs and assumptions include the 
subsidiary valuations, which are either based on the implied value from a third party funding round, on a Net 
Present Valuation method or asset based valuation, volatility, time to liquidity and risk free rate.
Net Present Valuation (‘‘NPV’’) method
NPV is a standard technique used in valuation and can be defined as the difference between the present value of 
the future cash flows from an investment and the amount of investment. Present value of the estimated cash flows 
is computed by discounting them at the required rate of return which includes an adjustment for risk. 158

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)  
HEAD_0 1st line release 
The following are important factors when determining fair value based on NPV:
• Estimated income generally consists of sales, co-development revenues, one-time payments and royalty 
payments on sales depending on the company, its business model and industry. These are estimated based 
on a variety of factors including: total addressable market; competitive factors; barriers to competition; 
pricing; typical standards for contract value; royalty rates; and likelihood of development of a product that 
is commercially viable.
• Costs and capital expenditures are estimated for each phase of development based on the companies’ 
information or according to industry standards. Costs are typically forecasted for cost of goods, SG&A 
(selling, general and administrative), research and development as well as a variety of other expenses. These 
are typically developed ‘‘from the ground up’’ for earlier years and for later years depicted as a factor or 
percentage of sales.
• The terminal or exit value represents the aggregate value of an entity at the end of the discrete forecast 
period. Terminal value may be estimated using the terminal multiple method, which inherently assumes 
that the business will be valued at the end of the projection period based on reference valuations. Under 
this methodology, the terminal value is typically calculated by applying one of two commonly accepted 
methodologies:
 — Multiple base terminal value: Use of an appropriate multiple to the relevant financial metric forecasted 
for the last projected year taking into consideration the ongoing growth potential of the business in the 
terminal year. Exit values included in the analysis are typically projected as a multiple of EBIT, EBITDA or 
Sales based on the final year results for the forecast period. Where available, a set of guideline public 
companies that are similar to the company to be used for comparative purposes and the multiple is 
derived from this set;
 — Gordon growth model based terminal value: Use of a formula that calculates the present value of cash 
flow in the terminal year growing into infinity at an ascribed terminal growth rate. The terminal growth 
rate is derived by estimating the long-term annual growth potential of the business at the terminal year.
• Selection of discount rates is based on part utilising American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 
(“AICPA”) practice standards varying by stage of development of the subsidiary as well as other risk factors 
and typically range from 20-45%.
• Where available NPV results are compared against peer companies and to valuations for similar companies.
Due to the early stage nature of the Group’s subsidiary companies, projections are particularly sensitive to certain 
key assumptions namely:
• Discount rate and in particular risk premium;
• The ability to predict the cost and timing of achieving technical and commercial viability;
• Projected revenue and operating costs in the post-product development phase of each company; and
• The size and share of addressable market for intellectual property, products and services developed. 159

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
In certain cases, the value of a subsidiary is determined using a market instead of income- based approach. 
Where there has been a third party funding round in the year this has been used as the implied value of the 
subsidiary, adjusted for indexation where this is deemed to be appropriate.
Whilst the Board considers the methodologies and assumptions adopted in the valuation are supportable, 
reasonable and robust, because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may differ 
significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investment existed and the 
differences could be significant.
The two principal methods the Group applies for allocation of value are the Probability-Weighted Expected 
Return Method (“PWERM”) and the Option Pricing Method (“OPM”).
The PWERM estimates the value of equity securities based on an analysis of various discrete future outcomes, 
such as an IPO, merger or sale, dissolution, or continued operation as a private enterprise until a later exit date. 
The equity value today is based on the probability-weighted present values of expected future investment returns, 
considering each of the possible outcomes available to the enterprise, as well as the rights of each security class.
The OPM treats common stock or derivatives thereof as call options on the enterprise’s value or overall equity 
value. The value of a security is based on the optionality over and above the value securities that are senior in 
the capital structure (e.g. preferred stock), considering the dilutive effects of subordinate securities. In the OPM, 
the exercise price is based on a comparison with the overall equity value rather than per-share value.

CryoXtract Instruments, LLC Promissory Note
In May 2012, CryoXtract Instruments, LLC signed a promissory note with a state financing authority in the amount 
of $800,000 to provide working capital for materials and fund salaries. The note fully matured in May 2017 
and bears interest of 6.5%. Payment of interest only is due in the first 18 months. As of 31 December 2013, 
CryoXtract had drawn the full balance of the note, of which $115,000 and $225,000 was repaid during 
2017 and 2016, respectively, down to nil as of 31 December 2017 (2016: $115,000). Interest expense 
incurred on the note was nil and $26,000 for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016, respectively.
As part of the consideration for the loan, CryoXtract had issued to the lender a warrant entitling the lender to 
purchase an aggregate of 65,310 membership units in the subsidiary’s ordinary shares, representing 0.01% of 
the total membership units. The fair value of the warrant issued of $35,000 was amortised over the life of the

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded is determined by using valuation techniques that 
maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific 
estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included 
in Level 2. Where the inputs for determining the fair value of financial instruments are not based on observable 
market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.
The Group has determined that the carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables 
and payables, security and other deposits, and customer deposits are a reasonable approximation of their fair 
values and are included in Level 2.
For assumptions used in the fair value measurement of the Group’s subsidiary preferred shares liability designated 
as Level 3, see footnote 18.
(23) CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence 
and to sustain future development of the business. Management monitors the level of capital deployed and 
available for deployment in subsidiary projects. The board of directors seeks to maintain a balance between 
the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of deployed capital and the advantages and security 
afforded by a sound capital position. 164

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

The Group’s executive management and board of directors have overall responsibility for establishment and 
oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The Group is exposed to certain risks through its normal 
course of operations. The Group’s main objective in using financial instruments is to promote the commercialisation 
of intellectual property through the raising and investing of funds for this purpose. The Group’s policies in 
calculating the nature, amount and timing of funding are determined by planned future investment activity. Due to 
the nature of activities and with the aim to maintain the investors’ funds secure and protected, the Group’s policy 
is to hold any excess funds in highly liquid and readily available financial instruments and reduce the exposure 
to other financial risks.
The Group has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to 
meet its contractual obligations. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Group to concentrations of credit 
risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, other investments in the form of fixed income securities, and 
trade and other receivables.
The Group held following balances:
AS OF 31 DECEMBER: 2017 
$’000
2016

Cash and cash equivalent 158,075 209,151 
Other investments 11,057 16,912 
Trade and other receivables 15,642 5,900 
184,774 231,963 
The Group maintains money market funds, certificates of deposits, and fixed income securities with financial 
institutions, which the Group believes are of high credit quality. Risk control assesses the credit quality of the 
customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors. Individual risk limits are set 
based on ratings in accordance with limits set by the board. The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored. 
The credit quality of financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired can be assessed by reference to credit 
ratings (if available) or to historical information about counterparty default rates.
Group policy is to maintain its funds in highly liquid deposit accounts with reputable financial institutions.
The aging of trade receivables that were not impaired was as follows:

Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its 
financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to 
managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities 
when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking 
damage to the Group’s reputation.
The Group seeks to manage liquidity risk, ensuring that sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable 
requirements.
The following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts are

Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices – such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity 
prices – will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market 
risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising 
the return. The Group maintains the exposure to market risk from such financial instruments to insignificant levels. 
The Group exposure to changes in interest rates is determined to be insignificant.
Capital Risk Management
The Group is funded by equity finance and long term borrowings. Total capital is calculated as ‘total equity’ as 
shown in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an 
optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the 
Group may issue new shares or borrow new debt. The Group has some external debt and no material externally 
imposed capital requirements. The Group’s share capital is set out in note 16.

Factors That May Affect Future Tax Expense
The Group is primarily subject to taxation in the US and UK. Additionally, the Group is exposed to state taxation 
in various jurisdictions throughout the US. Changes in corporate tax rates can change both the current tax 
expense (benefit) as well as the deferred tax expense (benefit). Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate to 
19% (effective 1 April 2017) and to 18% (effective 1 April 2020) were substantially enacted on 26 October 
2015. A further reduction to 17% (effective 1 April 2020) was substantially enacted on 6 September 2016. 
The maximum corporate tax rate in the US for the corresponding periods is 35%, which was reduced to 21% 
effective 1 January 2018.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted a comprehensive tax legislation, H.R.1, commonly 
referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the 
U.S. tax code, and it will take time for additional clarifying guidance and legislation to be issued, and this 
guidance will be required for the interpretation of these comprehensive changes. We are in the process of 
analyzing the potential aggregate current and future impacts of the Tax Act relative to the Company.
As of 31 December 2017, the Company has completed a preliminary analysis for the tax effects of the 
enactment of the Tax Act. In certain cases, specifically as follows, the Company has made a reasonable estimate 
of the effects on its existing deferred tax balances. The impact of the Tax Act may differ from this estimate, due 
to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, guidance that may 
be issued and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax Act.
The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The change in our future effective 
tax rate is not anticipated to have an effect on our cash tax until all of our U.S. federal net operating losses and 
credits have been utilised.
Unrecognised Deferred Tax Assets
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items, due to history of losses and no 
convincing evidence that future taxable profit will be available against which the Group can use the benefits 
therefrom, as well as due to potential permanent restrictions under IRS Section 382 rules:

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Deferred tax is measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the period when the temporary differences 
are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the 
statement of financial position date. The reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 20% (from 23%) was 
substantially enacted on 2 July 2013 and applied from 1 April 2015. However, the UK corporation tax rate 
initially reduced from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014. The change in the UK corporate tax rate did not materially 
impact the calculation of the deferred tax assets as these assets are generally exposed to tax in US jurisdiction.
There were no movements in deferred tax recognised in income or equity in 2017 or 2016 as the deferred tax 
asset was not recognised in any of those years.
As of 31 December 2017 the Company had United States federal net operating losses carry forwards (“NOLs”) 
of approximately $321.7 million (2016: $287.6 million) available to offset future taxable income, if any. These 
carry forwards start to expire in 2026 and are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue 
Service. The Company may be subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code as a 
result of changes in ownership. The Company’s preliminary analysis on the impact from Section 382 limitations 
suggests that there is unlikely to be a material restriction on NOLs. A detailed exercise is ongoing. Upon the 
completion of the study, there may or may not be limitations on the Company’s ability to utilize its current NOLs 
against future profits, although these are not expected to be material.

STATEMENTS

(1) ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Preparation and Measurement
The financial statements of the parent company have been prepared under the historical cost convention, 
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). 
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure 
requirements of the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”). A 
summary of the more important accounting policies which have been applied consistently throughout the year 
are set out below.
Functional and Presentation Currency
The functional currency of the parent company is British Pounds. The financial statements of the parent company 
are presented in US dollars.
Foreign Currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of the parent company at the 
foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling 
at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-
monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates 
ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
On translation of the Company financial statements from functional currency to presentational currency the assets 
and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rates. Profit and loss accounts are translated at the average 
rates of exchange during the year. Gains and losses arising on these translations are taken to reserves.
Investments
Investments are stated at historic cost less any provision for impairment in value and are held for long-term 
investment purposes. Provisions are based upon an assessment of events or changes in circumstances that 
indicate that an impairment has occurred such as the performance and/or prospects (including the financial 
prospects) of the investee company being significantly below the expectations on which the investment was 
based, a significant adverse change in the markets in which the investee company operates or a deterioration 
in general market conditions.
Intercompany Loans
All intercompany loans are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
Where intercompany loans are intended for use on a continuing basis in the Company’s activities and there is 
no intention of their settlement in the foreseeable future, they are presented as current assets.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less. 174
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
   
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)  
HEAD_0 1st line release  
Impairment
If there is an indication that an asset might be impaired, the Company will perform an impairment review. An 
asset is impaired if the recoverable amount, being the higher of net realisable value and value in use, is less 
than its carrying amount. Value in use is measured based on future discounted cash flows (“DCF”) attributable to 
the asset. In such cases, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to recoverable amount with a corresponding 
charge recognised in the profit and loss account.
Financial Instruments
Currently the Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments. Financial assets and financial liabilities 
are recognised and cease to be recognised on the basis of when the related titles pass to or from the Company.
Share-based Payments
Share-based payment arrangements in which the Company receives goods or services as consideration for its 
own equity instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions, regardless of how 
the equity instruments are obtained by the Company.
The grant date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee 
expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally 
entitled to the awards. The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option valuation model, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised 
as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market 
vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based 
on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting 
date. For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based 
payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and 
actual outcomes.
