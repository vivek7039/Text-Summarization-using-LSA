At our core, we are a successful

a diverse and diŽerentiated portfolio  
of great tasting brands that people love.
We make it our business to understand 
what our consumers want. 
Whether it’s our iconic IRN-BRU, 
launched in 1901 and still going  
strong today, our market leading 
RUBICON exotic fruit juice drinks,  
or our pure, clear Scottish spring water 
STRATHMORE, our brands oŽer people

Enhancing our portfolio, we also operate 
long-term successful partnerships, 
complementing our own range of 
products with global brands ROCKSTAR 
and SNAPPLE in the UK and beyond.
But we’re not just about soft drinks – 
with the addition of FUNKIN we have 
moved into the cocktail mixer segment, 
broadening and strengthening our 
portfolio with a unique and exciting 
market leading brand in a growing market.
Employing around 900 people  
across 10 UK locations, we are  
proud to be a sustainable business  
that listens to our consumers, builds 
lasting customer relationships, takes 
care of our employees, gives something 
back to our communities and works to 
minimise our environmental impact.

Strategic Report
A strong platform  
for the future
The announcement of a soft drinks 
sugar tax in the Chancellor’s budget  
in March 2016, and the devaluation of 
sterling following the UK’s referendum 
vote to leave the European Union in 
June, added additional external 
headwinds in a soft drinks market 
already impacted by price deﬂation. 
Despite these macro external inﬂuences, 
the business has retained a clear focus  
on the execution of its strategy and in 
particular on internal improvement actions. 
Financially, the business has delivered 
another solid performance with proﬁt 
before tax and exceptional items* of 
£42.4m, an increase of 2.7% on the prior 
year (£41.3m), and exits the year with  
a strong balance sheet.
We maintained our market share across 
the period and continued to invest in our 
brands, with the key brands, IRN-BRU 
and Rubicon, delivering good growth. 
Innovation has been a key strategic 
focus across the year and the launches 
of IRN-BRU XTRA and Rubicon Spring 
in particular, both no added sugar 
products, have proven successful. 
As consumer tastes and preferences 
continue to change, and the demand for 
great tasting, reduced sugar products 
increases, the recent announcement 
that 90% of our Company owned 
brands will contain less than 5g of total 
Over the past 12 months we have seen some extremely 
signiﬁcant events unfold across the UK and beyond.

sugars per 100ml by the autumn of 2017 
is an extremely positive demonstration 
of how the business is responding with 
both pace and commitment. 
Our key partnerships with Rockstar and 
Dr Pepper Snapple Group continued to 
progress, complementing our own 
portfolio both in the UK and increasingly 
on an international basis, where we have 
delivered further growth, extending our 
international footprint and our franchise 
territory agreements.
The Funkin business, acquired in 2015, 
continues to exceed our acquisition 
expectations, and we remain highly 
encouraged by the continued growth 
momentum of the Funkin brand  
and business.
Our drive for improvement across  
the business has not abated. We have 
continued to invest in our asset base, 
including the installation of a new  
glass ﬁlling line at Cumbernauld, and  
are in the process of adding new PET 
capability in our Milton Keynes facility.  
In addition, we have successfully 
completed a Company-wide business 
reorganisation that has both enhanced 
our organisational capability and 
reduced our overhead base.
We exit the year with a strong balance 
sheet, and are well placed to exploit growth 
opportunities as and when they arise.
Dividend
The Board is pleased to be in a position to 
maintain its commitment to a progressive 
dividend policy and recommend a ﬁnal 
dividend of 10.87p per share to give a 
total dividend for the full year of 14.40p 
per share, a full year increase of 8% on the 
prior year. The ﬁnal dividend is payable 
on 9 June 2017 to shareholders on the 
Register of Members at the close of 
business on 12 May 2017. The ex-dividend 
date is 11 May 2017.
Share repurchase programme 
Given the strength of the balance sheet 
and the cash generative nature of the 
business, the Board has decided to return 
up to £30m to shareholders via an 
on-market share repurchase programme. 
This programme is anticipated to 
commence in the spring of 2017 and 
complete within 24 months. The AGM in 
May 2017 will be requested to approve 
the renewal of the authority granted in 
June 2016 for the Board to repurchase  
up to 10% of the Company’s own shares. 
We do not believe that the repurchase 
programme will have any material impact 
on our ability to secure acquisition 
opportunities should these be identiﬁed.
People
The continued success of the business is 
testament to the commitment and skills 
of the whole team and I would like to 
take this opportunity to extend a thank 
you to each and every team member for 
their eŽorts across this year of change 
and reorganisation. 05

Business Model
We make
We pride ourselves on our eŽective manufacturing 
capabilities, producing high quality products across 
our well-invested and e§cient production sites, in 
Cumbernauld, Forfar and our new state of the art 
facility at Milton Keynes. From sourcing our raw 
materials across the globe, to designing our 
packaging materials, we strive for continuous 
improvements, keep safety at the forefront of all  
we do, and invest accordingly to ensure we produce 
the best tasting products as e§ciently as possible.
We move
With a ﬂeet of more than 100 vehicles, and long-
standing relationships with our key distribution 
partners, we strive to deliver a great service to  
all our customers, from the biggest food service 
customer to the smallest local shop. Operating 
across multiple routes to market, we have a well 
established and e§cient distribution network,  
with our Direct Store Delivery channel in particular 
setting us apart, by oŽering a tailored and personal 
service to thousands of independent retailers across 
the UK. 07

We are a growth driven, branded consumer goods 
business, delivering long-term sustainable value. 
We build great tasting brands that people love,  
oˆering them choice and enjoyment. 
Our business model is simple, eˆective and proﬁtable.
This simple but eŽective approach  
is supported by strong partnerships, 
talented people and responsible 
actions. Our business model has  
proven successful for more than  
140 years and continues to create

We market
Listening carefully to our consumers is paramount 
and by doing so we have developed a diverse and 
diŽerentiated brand portfolio of great tasting 
products to satisfy their needs and oŽer choice. 
And when it comes to marketing and building our 
brands we like to have some fun, appealing to our 
broad range of consumers, whether that’s through 
national TV campaigns, digital media, sponsorship 
or supporting local community events.
We sell
Building long lasting relationships with our 
customers across all our key markets is fundamental 
to our business. Whether it’s a multiple grocer, a 
wholesaler, a regional restaurant group or a local 
independent retailer, we work collaboratively with 
all our customers to understand their businesses 
and ﬁnd winning consumer propositions in a 
practical, fun and proﬁtable way.  08

Strategic Report
Chief Executive’s Review
We have delivered signiﬁcant business 
improvement across our brands, assets, 
infrastructure, organisation and our 
teams, to support the successful 
long-term development of the Company.
The unexpected and unwelcome 
announcement of a new punitive tax 
regime associated with the manufacture 
of soft drinks with added sugar had the 
potential to be a major business 
distraction. However, I am pleased to 
report that we have continued to place 
consumers at the heart of our business, 
not regulators, and have responded 
positively to changing consumer tastes 
and preferences across our portfolio. 
We will of course continue to work with 
the various government bodies involved 
in the new regime to ensure that this 
new regulatory environment is deployed 
appropriately and with as much 
common sense as possible.
In this reporting period:
 – We maintained overall market share 
in UK soft drinks with total Group 
revenue of £257.1m, an underlying* 
increase of 1.5% on the previous year.
 – Proﬁt before tax increased 4.4% on 
the prior year to £43.1m.
 – Statutory proﬁt before tax and 
exceptional items* increased 2.7%  
on the prior year to £42.4m.
 – Operating margin before exceptional 
items* improved 50bps to 16.8% 
following our continued tight  
cost control.
 – Our deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme 
was closed to future accrual further 
reducing our corporate risk proﬁle.
 – Beneﬁts from our Fit for the Future 
enabling programme began to ﬁlter 
through as planned, including 
signiﬁcantly better customer service, 
tighter inventory management and 
the implementation of a Company-
wide reorganisation.
 – Strong cash ﬂow resulted in a net 
cash position of £9.7m.
Soft drinks market performance
The UK soft drinks market has 
performed robustly across the last 12 
months, with growth of 1.2% in value and 
1.6% in volume. This total market position 
masks a higher degree of volatility than 
in prior years, both in terms of monthly 
market movements and individual 
sub-category performance.
As we previously forecast, deﬂation has 
eased across the latter part of the year. 
However, the more structural element  
of this deﬂation, related to the continued 
growth of the lower value water 
category, has continued to impact the 
total market. Stills experienced volume 
growth of just over 3% and value growth 
of 1%, with water growth continuing to 
be the driving force. In contrast, the 
carbonates sector experienced modest 
inﬂation, growing value by just over 1% 
versus a ﬂat volume position. 
Clarity of  
purpose
During the past 12 months our thirst for improvement 
has continued, despite the numerous external challenges 
that we have had to overcome. 09

Strategic Report
The past year has seen a number  
of material changes to the macro 
environment in which we operate  
– the soft drinks sugar tax, the UK’s 
decision to leave the EU, the devaluation 
of sterling and increased geopolitical 
volatility. However, perhaps most 
important to our business are the 
continuing development of UK 
consumer preferences in soft drinks, the 
further consolidation and development 
of our customer environment and  
ﬁnally, the advances across the digital 
communication landscape we operate 
in. We have continued to respond 
positively and with pace to these 
changes, focusing on the opportunities 
that arise.
Our long-standing reformulation and 
product development programme has 
seen our portfolio develop signiﬁcantly 
across the past year. In March 2017  
we announced our intention to meet 
consumers’ changing tastes and 
preferences with a number of further 
signiﬁcant portfolio developments.  
The successful development and  
launch of Rubicon Spring and IRN-BRU 
XTRA have contributed to our forward 
development plans, giving us the  
insight and conﬁdence to announce  
our intention that over 90% of Company 
owned brands will contain less than 5g 
of total sugars per 100ml by the autumn 
of 2017. This is a signiﬁcant and positive 
move which supports our consumer-
focused strategy, at the same time  
as reducing our overall exposure to 
regulatory changes.
During the course of the last ﬁnancial 
year our key brands have beneﬁted from 
continued investment and innovation. 
IRN-BRU and Rubicon in particular exit 
the full year with strong momentum 
based on positive brand fundamentals.
Strategy
In times of elevated uncertainty, clarity  
of purpose and consistency of approach 
yield the best outcome in our experience. 
We have remained consistent to our 
approach and principles across the past 
year, focusing on:
 – strongly diŽerentiated brands;
 – eŽective and ﬂexible operations;
 – innovation based on consumer 
understanding;
 – growth driven partnerships; and 
 – leveraging the strength and 
commitment of our teams.
In each of these areas we have  
invested eŽort and resources to  
drive improvement and thus increase 
competitiveness. Our innovation has 
been instrumental in building our 
portfolio into the lower and no sugar 
consumer space and our technical 
developments in this area are critical  
to our future success. Our investment  
in our assets and infrastructure has 
continued with the introduction of new 
glass ﬁlling capability at Cumbernauld 
and the announcement of our intention 
to extend PET capability to our Milton 
Keynes site. This gives us a ﬂexible 
platform to improve our service, control 
our costs and ensure we are capable  
of adapting our operations to meet  
the portfolio needs of the future.
Our core partnerships, with Rockstar 
and the Dr Pepper Snapple Group, have 
continued to develop across the period, 
with notable extensions to the territories 
covered under our Rockstar agreement. 
In September 2016 we signed a further 
exclusive extension with Rockstar for a 
further seven territories, including the 
Russian Federation. The Snapple brand 
has enjoyed growth of over 20% across 
2016/17, with signiﬁcant product 
innovation, packaging advancements

and further distribution growth in the 
UK and internationally. The expansion  
of these selective partnerships remains 
an important part of our long-term 
growth strategy.
We have enjoyed an excellent 
performance from our Funkin cocktail 
business building on the strong progress 
made last year, our ﬁrst year of 
ownership. The Funkin team has 
continued to deliver excellent 
opportunities to customers to access 
cocktail market growth with simplicity, 
authenticity and excitement. We 
anticipate continued growth for the 
Funkin business in the traditional 
on-trade environment and also from  
our planned launch into retail, with a 
new ready to mix cocktail product format 
which has exciting brand development 
and growth potential for the future. 
It has been a very busy, and at times 
unsettling, year for many of our 
colleagues as we have implemented 
signiﬁcant levels of change, culminating 
in a Company-wide reorganisation 
programme in the ﬁnal quarter. 
Following our prior year investment in 
assets and systems, the reorganisation 
has allowed us to streamline and 
improve our organisational structure, 
reducing employee numbers by around 
10% whilst improving operating 
eŽectiveness and ﬂexibility. I would like 
to thank all our teams across the 
business who have responded positively 
to the challenges we face and have now 
helped to create a stronger business, 
more capable of delivering against our 
long-term potential.
Summary
We have made considerable progress 
across the business over the last 12 
months and delivered a solid ﬁnancial 
performance in volatile and uncertain 
market conditions. The growth drivers  
of our core brands, innovation, 
partnerships, Funkin and International 
remain at the heart of our future plans. 
We are operating from a well-invested 
and sustainable asset base, with our new 
organisational structures established to 
support growth. We will continue to 
seek opportunities to grow shareholder 
value by utilising our full suite of options 
– our organic growth potential, our 
strong balance sheet, our core 
competencies and our strong culture 
– and I believe we are well placed to 
continue to deliver consistent long-term 
shareholder value.

NEW IRNBRU XTRA 
Launched in August 2016, IRN-BRU 
XTRA is the ﬁrst permanent new 
product from IRN-BRU in 35 years.
In the making for over a year, IRN-BRU 
XTRA includes even more of the 
IRN-BRU taste that consumers love  
but leaves out the sugar for a new 
ﬂavour experience.
Supported by an impactful outdoor 
marketing campaign, the equivalent  
of 20 million cans of IRN-BRU XTRA 
were sold in its ﬁrst 6 months.
NEW Rubicon Spring
Launched in the summer of 2016, 
Rubicon Spring is an exciting 
development for our Rubicon brand 
extending the brand reach. OŽering 
consumers a tasty, healthy and 
hydrating drink, in four great fruit 
ﬂavours, Rubicon Spring contains no 
added sugar and less than 15 calories  
in every bottle.
Supported by a national TV advertising 
campaign, Rubicon Spring has sold 
more than 7.6 million bottles since

The following is based on results for the 52 weeks  
ended 28 January 2017. Comparatives, unless otherwise 
stated, are for the 53 weeks ended 30 January 2016.
This is a positive set of results in a 
challenging environment and reﬂects 
the combined beneﬁts of strong brands, 
successful innovation and much 
improved customer service. It is 
particularly pleasing to recognise that 
we have put behind us the supply chain 
and system implementation challenges 
that constrained performance in 
2015/16. The strong second half, which 
recorded both top and bottom line 
growth, followed a period of soft drinks 
market volatility in the ﬁrst half and 
provides conﬁdence that we enter 
2017/18 with positive momentum.
Reported revenue declined (0.6)%,  
the result of a 53 week prior year 
comparator. Our underlying revenue* 
from the business improved 1.5%, driven 
by growth from innovation across two of 
our key brands (IRN-BRU and Rubicon) 
and an operating margin improvement 
beneﬁt from the impact of the 
organisational review that we 
announced in September 2016. 
The year was not without its challenges. 
The commercial environment, while 
always competitive, was particularly 
testing this year with customer range 
rationalisations and deﬂationary pricing 
pressures impacting the business, most 
evidently across Rockstar and our 
regional brands. These customer 
challenges were compounded by the 
reappearance of inﬂationary headwinds 
from the commodity and currency 
markets during the second half of 
2016/17. While the increased levels   27

of volatility and uncertainty were 
unhelpful, we took decisive management 
action which beneﬁted us in the second 
half, and we expect will continue to 
underpin our performance going forward.
On an underlying basis* our business 
delivered revenue growth (+1.5%),  
gross and operating margin* expansion 
(+10bps and +80bps respectively), 
increased proﬁt before tax and 
exceptional items (+7.1%) and improved 
overall free cash ﬂow (+£15.0m). We 
continue to drive for improved e§ciency 
in all aspects of the business, whether  
it is through zero-based budgeting, 
promotional evaluation or our 
programme of supply chain excellence. 
We believe this committed approach  
to growth, productivity and cash 
generation will drive further sustainable 
value creation for shareholders.
We have accomplished much in the year:
 – The investment in our Business 
Process Redesign programme is 
now entering its second year of 
operation and tangible progress in 
e§ciency and ﬂexibility is being 
made across the network. This is 
already delivering improved 
customer service and will provide a 
solid platform for future proﬁtability.
 – A Company-wide reorganisation 
was announced in September 2016. 
Our employee base reduces by 
around 100 at a one-oŽ cost of 
£3.3m and will generate ongoing 
savings in the region of c.£3m  
per annum. The majority of the 
employee changes have taken  
place and an element of the savings 
has been delivered in 2016/17.
 – Our Deﬁned Beneﬁt (“DB”) 
pension scheme was closed to 
future accrual during the year.  
We continue to oŽer our  
employees market-leading  
pension arrangements, however  
the DB closure to future accrual  
has provided us with signiﬁcant  
pension de-risking.
 – Our banking arrangements were 
successfully renegotiated in 
February 2017 to provide longer 
term more cost eŽective revolving 
credit facilities: £40m over 3 years 
and £20m over 5 years. 
 – We undertook a competitive 
tender process for our external 
audit mandate. As a result we will  
be recommending to shareholders  
at the AGM in May 2017 that we 
appoint Deloitte LLP as our Group 
external auditors for the year 
2017/18.
Segment performance
We have successfully maintained market 
share in a challenging market environment. 
Our core carbonates business has 
performed well, with both our IRN-BRU 
and Rubicon brands growing through  
a combination of innovation and 
distribution gains. Our portfolio 
carbonates, including Barr Flavours, 
Tizer and KA have been impacted  
by retailer range reduction activity.  
The Rockstar brand delivered lower 
revenues as we maintained our focus  
on margin and value in the face of 
competitor deep discounting and 
distribution reductions in several of  
the supermarkets. The second year  
of our Snapple partnership has seen 
considerable success both in the UK  
and internationally, with our new 
branding and reduced sugar oŽerings 
being well received by consumers.
Our stills and water business performed 
well, led by our new lower sugar Rubicon 
Light & Fruity range. Our continued 
focus on value over volume improved 
margins, however there were continued 
market-wide challenges in fruit juices 
and fruit drinks, with water remaining  
a very price competitive subcategory.
The international business has delivered 
double digit revenue growth* through 
brand development in our established 
core markets, new distributor 
arrangements in existing markets and 
the opening up of new markets. 
Our Funkin business has performed  
very strongly, with sales growth of 27% 
(reported within our “Other” segment). 
The key on-trade business has grown in 
each of its product segments (syrups, 
mixers and purees) and the Funkin team 
is on track to launch the ﬁrst Funkin 
branded consumer retail product in 
spring 2017. On the basis of the audited 
results, and the achievement of agreed 
ﬁnancial performance targets, there  
will be an associated cash “earn-out” 
payment in 2017/18 which has been  
fully provided for at the year end.
Margins
Modest price deﬂation impacted 
carbonates gross margins*, slightly 
down (30bps), however a combination 
of tight cost control and favourable  
mix limited the impact. Stills and water 
delivered gross margin improvement  
as growth was driven from the higher 
margin core brands and innovation. 
Operating expenses beneﬁted from  
a net £0.7m exceptional credit and a 
continued focus on cost control, supply 
chain e§ciencies and some early 
beneﬁts from the organisational  
review which has been successfully 
implemented slightly ahead of plan.
Financial performance beneﬁted from 
the stabilisation of our infrastructure 
and systems, the continued growth  
in both our international business and 
Funkin partially oŽset by negative 
movements on foreign exchange and 
the return to a 52 week year (2015/16 
– 53 weeks). Operating margin before 
exceptional items* increased from  
16.3% to 16.8%. 
Interest
Net ﬁnance charges, totalling £0.7m, 
largely comprise the notional interest  
on the pension deﬁcit. Debt interest 
charges continued to reduce, reﬂecting 
our improved debt proﬁle as we 
successfully paid down our debt and 
transitioned to a net cash position.

charge comprised:

Taxation
The tax charge of £7.5m is £0.5m higher 
than the prior year and represents an 
eŽective tax rate of 17.4%. This is an 
increase of 0.3% from the prior year and 
primarily reﬂects the impact of the 
reduction in the deferred tax rate from 
18% to 17% this year compared to the 
reduction from 20% to 18% included in 
the charge last year. 
Balance sheet and cash ﬂow
The Group’s balance sheet continues  
to strengthen, with net asset growth*  
of £1.7m to £181.8m over the 52 weeks 
ended 28 January 2017 despite a  
£14.5m increase in the pension deﬁcit 
under IAS19. 
The key balance sheet highlights can be 
summarised as:
 – Non-current assets increased slightly 
to £195.4m (up £2.6m) after several 
years of sustained investment in 
assets and infrastructure. We are now 
in the favourable position of having  
a modern, well-invested asset base 
capable of accommodating growth.
 – Inventories have increased by £1.7m, 
driven by the deliberate decision to 
secure favourable mango pricing 
following a good 2016 harvest by 
purchasing much of our 2017/18 
requirements in advance. Finished 
goods inventories are down in 
volume, value and days.
 – Trade payables have, as expected, 
increased substantially due to the 
timing of the year end and the 
phasing of monthly payment runs. 
Trade payables, at £15.8m, were up 
£7.4m on the prior year. 
 – Trade and other receivables were 
broadly ﬂat at £51.4m (2015/16: 
£52.7m). We continue to beneﬁt 
from good customer relationships 
and strong credit controls and, as a 
result, have modest aged debt and 
experienced no bad debts during 
the ﬁnancial year.
 – ROCE* improved from 18.8% in 
2015/16 to 20.2% in 2016/17 largely 
driven by working capital phasing.
The movement from a net debt position 
as at January 2016 (£11.3m) to a net cash 
position as at January 2017 (£9.7m) 
reﬂects the strong cash generative 
nature of our business, working capital

phasing and lower capital expenditure 
requirements as we come out of a 
period of sustained capital investment. 
In the year ahead we will continue to 
invest in the fabric of the business and 
to support our growth agenda. Capital 
expenditure* in 2017/18 is anticipated to 
be at a slightly higher level than in 
2016/17 primarily driven by the phasing 
of our new £10m PET bottling line at 
Milton Keynes. This expansionary capital 
will deliver logistics cost savings and 
provide production ﬂexibility to support 
our innovation pipeline.
A strong balance sheet and accessibility 
to cost eŽective and ﬂexible debt 
facilities provide optionality and ensure 
we have the ability and the agility to take 
advantage of any opportunities that may 
be identiﬁed. Our recently renegotiated 
banking facilities ensure that we have 
su§cient headroom at our disposal to 
meet expected future requirements.
The business remains highly cash 
generative. Operating cash ﬂow before 
movements in working capital has 
increased £2.1m to £53.3m. 
We believe that EBITDA* and Free Cash 
Flow* permit a more meaningful analysis 
of the underlying performance of the 
Group. EBITDA* increased to £51.7m (up 
2.4%), representing an EBITDA margin* 
of 20.1% and a strong cash generating 
performance, with EBITDA to free cash 
ﬂow conversion* of 83.6%.
The Group utilises its cash appropriately 
and with care. More than £12m was 
invested in long-term assets and almost 
£16m was distributed in dividends to  
our shareholders.  30
A.G. BARR p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report
Shares with a net value of £0.3m  
were disposed of on behalf of various 
employee beneﬁt trusts to satisfy the 
ongoing requirements of the Group’s 
employee share schemes.
Given the current net cash position, the 
relatively benign outlook for short-term 
interest rates and the expectation of 
continued strong free cash generation, 
no interest rate hedging activity has 
taken place during the year.
Exceptional items
We have undergone signiﬁcant 
reorganisation during 2016/17, the scale 
and nature of which made it appropriate 
that the related costs be recognised  
as exceptional items for reporting 
purposes. We believe that this permits  
a more meaningful analysis of the 
underlying performance of the Group.
A net credit of £0.7m pre-tax (£0.6m

UK referendum and exit from  
the European Union
The level of uncertainty and volatility in the 
external environment is unprecedented. 
Given the largely UK focus of our 
commercial activities, our current 
assessment is that the speciﬁc issue of 
the UK’s future exit from the European 
Union will not have a signiﬁcant impact 
on our business other than through  
its eŽects on foreign exchange. The 
current value of sterling has created an 
inﬂationary pressure on our commodity 
cost base, primarily Euro or US dollar 
denominated. We have a well developed 
risk management framework in place  
at both functional and corporate levels  
of the business and we will continue to 
closely monitor political and commercial 
developments and react accordingly  
to these. 
Post balance sheet events
Certain events and decisions have taken 
place between the ﬁnancial year end 
and the approval of these accounts that 
merit highlighting.
Debt ﬁnance
During the ﬁnancial year we entered into 
discussions on our longer term debt 
cover. These discussions concluded in 
February 2017, with the Board approving 
three revolving credit facilities over 
periods of 3 to 5 years with Royal Bank 
of Scotland plc, Bank of Scotland plc 
and HSBC Bank plc. These facilities 
provide £60m of sterling debt facilities 
to 2020, reducing to £20m for the 
period to 2022. Our long-term ﬁnancial 
modelling indicates signiﬁcant ﬁnancial 
headroom with these facilities in place.
Share repurchase programme
The Board has approved a share 
repurchase programme of up to £30m, 
as part of the Group’s approach to 
capital allocation and under the 
authority to repurchase up to 10% of its 
own shares granted at the AGM in June 
2016. This programme is anticipated to 
commence in the spring of 2017 and 
complete within 24 months. The AGM  
in May 2017 will be requested to approve 
the renewal of the authority for the 
Board to repurchase up to 10% of the 
Company’s own shares. We do not 
believe that the repurchase programme 
will have any material impact on our 
ability to secure acquisition opportunities 
should these be identiﬁed.
Asset sale
The disposal of our Walthamstow site 
(sale proceeds £3.8m; gain on sale 
£2.5m) was concluded in February 2017. 
We have entered into a short term lease 
of the premises as we ﬁnalise our 
long-term plans for direct customer 
deliveries in the area.
Pensions
The Group continues to operate two 
pension plans, the A.G. BARR p.l.c. 
(2005) Deﬁned Contribution Pension 
Scheme and the A.G. BARR p.l.c. (2008) 
Pension and Life Assurance Scheme. 
The latter is a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme 
based on ﬁnal salary, which also includes 
a deﬁned contribution section for 
pension provision to senior managers.
The deﬁned beneﬁt scheme (“the 
scheme”) has been closed to new 
entrants since 5 April 2002 (and to  
new executive entrants since 14 August 
2003). During the year, after employee 
consultation, and with the support of 
the Pension Trustee, the scheme was 
closed to future accrual. Despite these 
actions, the scheme deﬁcit continued to 
grow during the year as gilt yields and 
interest discount rates remained low. 
The deﬁcit (on an IAS19 valuation basis) 
increased from £12.9m at the end of 
2015/16 to £27.4m at the balance sheet 
date. The increase in the deﬁcit in the 
current ﬁnancial year is primarily as a 
result of a lower net discount rate being 
used to value the scheme’s liabilities in 
the year. The Company continues to 
work proactively with the Pension 
Trustee to de-risk the pension liabilities 
and secure the commitments to employee 
beneﬁts as part of the Group’s ongoing 
strategic risk management. The Group  
is comfortable that the overall pension 
deﬁcit is supportable.
Share price and market 
capitalisation
At 28 January 2017, the closing share 
price for A.G. BARR p.l.c. was £5.02,  
a reduction of 4.9% on the closing 
January 2016 position. The Group is a 
member of the FTSE 250, with a market 
capitalisation* of £586m at the year end.

Risk management
Identifying,  
evaluating and 
managing risk
Risk management approach
The Board is responsible for the Group’s risk management and internal control systems and for reviewing their eŽectiveness, 
supported by the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee. A risk management framework is in place which sets out the 
ongoing processes for the identiﬁcation, assessment and management of risks, and for their ongoing monitoring and review. 
The Board has deﬁned its risk appetite in a number of key areas for the business – this sets out the relative level of risk that the 
Group is prepared to seek or accept in the pursuit of its strategic objectives. The aim is to ensure that the risks taken by the 
Group fall within its deﬁned risk appetite.
EŽective risk management is essential to enable us to achieve our operational and strategic objectives and deliver long-term 
value creation. During the reporting period we have continued to focus on embedding a culture of risk management throughout 
the organisation which will contribute towards successful strategy execution. 
Robust risk assessment
The risk management framework sets out a systematic approach to risk management which is designed to identify risks to the 
business, regardless of source. Once identiﬁed, risks are assessed according to the likelihood and impact of the risk occurring 
and an appropriate risk response is determined in line with the Group’s risk appetite. Risks are re-assessed based on the 
strength of the mitigating controls implemented. The implementation of risk mitigation plans is subject to ongoing monitoring 
and review. A risk scoring matrix is used to ensure that a consistent approach is taken across the business at both a corporate 
and functional level. This risk assessment and review process is documented in the appropriate risk register. Risks are constantly 
reviewed on an ongoing basis; the Group’s risk register is formally reviewed by the Risk Committee quarterly and by the Board 
and the Audit Committee twice each year.
Risk control assurance
Internal audit work is undertaken by an independent organisation which develops an annual internal audit plan having reviewed 
the Group’s risk register and following discussions with the external auditors, management and members of the Audit Committee.
During the year the Audit Committee has reviewed reports covering the internal audit work. This has included assessment of 
the general control environment, identiﬁcation of any control weaknesses and quantiﬁcation of any associated risk, together 
with a review of the status of mitigating actions. The Audit Committee has also received reports from management in relation  
to speciﬁc risk items together with reports from external auditors, who consider controls to the extent necessary to form an 
opinion as to the truth and fairness of the ﬁnancial statements.
The Group’s internal control and risk management systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The report of the Audit Committee can be found on page 48. 32

Strategic Report
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Board has carried out a robust, systematic assessment of the principal risks facing the Group during the period, including 
those which would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. The principal risks as determined by 
the Board are listed in the table below, together with corresponding mitigating actions. This is not intended to be an exhaustive 
list of all risks and uncertainties that may arise. 
The UK’s decision to leave the European Union has created a volatile and uncertain economic environment. Like many other 
businesses, we are closely following developments in this area. We believe that it is still too early to quantify or determine with 
any certainty the impact on the Group of the UK leaving the European Union. However, given that the Group is a UK based 
group whose sales are predominantly made in the UK, our current assessment is that Brexit will not have a signiﬁcant impact  
on the Group, other than through its eŽect on foreign exchange rates to which it is exposed through the purchase of certain 
commodities. We will continue to monitor developments and adapt our strategy as the impact of the UK exit from the European 
Union becomes clear.

Changes in consumer  
preferences, perception 
or purchasing behaviour
Consumers may decide  
to purchase and consume 
alternative brands or 
spend less on soft drinks.
The Group oŽers a broad range of branded products across a  
range of ﬂavours, subcategories and markets which oŽer choice  
to the end consumer.
Changing consumer attitudes and behaviours are monitored  
on an ongoing basis and inform our brand plans and new  
product development.
Changing consumer 
attitudes towards sugar/
further government

on sugar
Consumers may decide  
to purchase and consume 
alternative brands or 
spend less on sugared  
soft drinks.
The Group oŽers a broad range of branded products, many of which 
are low sugar or sugar free. We announced on 1 March 2017 that we 
will accelerate our long-standing sugar reduction programme so that 
over 90% of our Company owned soft drinks portfolio by volume will 
contain less than 5g of total sugars per 100ml by the autumn of 2017. 
Our new product development activity is focused on development  
of lower calorie products and our marketing programmes incorporate 
our lower calorie choices.
We are working constructively with the government in relation to the 
proposed sugar tax, with the aim of ensuring the optimal outcome for 
the Group.

Adverse publicity in 
relation to the soft 
drinks industry, the 
Group or its brands
Adverse publicity in 
relation to the soft drinks 
industry, the Group or  
its brands could have  
an adverse impact on  
the Group’s reputation, 
consumer consumption 
patterns, sales and 
operating proﬁts.
Our risk management process is designed to identify and monitor 
events that may impact the Group as a result of adverse publicity  
and to ensure that controls are in place to manage these risks.
We liaise with relevant industry bodies who work with government 
and policy makers.
Nutritional information is shown on all of our products and we have 
signed up to the UK Government’s voluntary front-of-pack nutritional 
labelling scheme.
Processes are in place to ensure compliance with health and  
safety legislation and ethical working standards and these are 
regularly reviewed by the Board and management committee.  
Quality standards are well deﬁned, implemented and monitored.  
A Corporate Social Responsibility Committee is in place, with a  
clearly deﬁned and communicated Corporate Social Responsibility 
Policy. The Group maintains and develops ISO 9001 and 14001 
systems and BRC standards which are subject to annual external 
audits, with any non-conformances addressed in a timely manner.
Failure to maintain 
customer relationships 
or take account of 
changing market 
dynamics
Failure to maintain 
appropriate customer 
relationships or a reduction 
in the customer base could 
have an adverse impact  
on the Group’s sales and 
operating proﬁts.
The Group oŽers a broad range of brands that it manufactures  
and distributes through a variety of trade channels and customers. 
Performance is monitored closely by the Board and management 
committee by trade channel and customer as appropriate. This 
includes monitoring of metrics which review brand equity strength, 
ﬁnancial and operational performance.
The Group focuses on delivering high quality products and invests 
heavily in building brand equity. We work closely in partnership  
with our customers on an ongoing basis. Members of the senior 
management team meet with key customers throughout the year.
Inability to protect  
the Group’s intellectual 
property rights
Failure to protect  
the Group’s intellectual 
property rights could 
result in a loss of  
brand value.
The Group invests considerable eŽort in proactively protecting  
its intellectual property rights, for example through trademark  
and design registrations and vigorous legal enforcement as and  
when required.
Failure of the  
Group’s operational 
infrastructure
A catastrophic failure  
of the Group’s major 
production or distribution 
facilities could lead to a 
sustained loss in capacity 
or capability.
Assets within the Group are proactively managed and maintained. 
Risk assessments are carried out on a regular basis and appropriate 
actions taken. Robust business continuity plans are in place and are 
regularly tested. 34

Loss of continuity  
of supply of major  
raw materials
The loss of continuity  
of supply of major raw 
material ingredients and/or 
packaging materials could 
impact our ability to 
manufacture, with an 
adverse impact on the 
Group’s sales and 
operating proﬁts.
There is a robust supplier selection process in place. Supplier 
performance is monitored on an ongoing basis and audits are 
undertaken for major suppliers. Multiple sources of supply are sourced 
wherever possible. Commodity risks are managed by the procurement 
team and reviewed by the Treasury and Commodity Committee. 
Contingency measures are in place and are tested regularly.
Loss of product integrity A loss of product integrity 
in the manufacturing 
supply chain could lead  
to a product withdrawal  
or recall.
Appropriate risk assessments are carried out on a regular basis and 
robust quality controls and processes are in place to maintain the high 
quality of our products. Product recall procedures are tested regularly.
Failure of critical  
IT systems
A failure of critical IT 
systems could result  
in a loss of key systems, 
business interruption, lost 
sales or lost production.
IT assets within the Group are proactively managed and procedures 
exist that support rapid and clean recovery. Robust business 
continuity plans and contingency measures are in place and are 
regularly tested.
Financial risks The Group’s activities 
expose it to a variety  
of ﬁnancial risks which 
include market risk 
(including medium term 
movements in exchange 
rates, interest rate risk  
and commodity price risk), 
credit risk and liquidity risk.
Our underlying objective is to secure budgeted exchange rates and 
thereby reduce the volatility through our cost of goods. Financial  
risks are reviewed and managed by the Treasury and Commodity 
Committee, which seeks to minimise adverse eŽects on the Group’s 
ﬁnancial performance through hedging known currency exposures 
throughout the year.
The Group’s ﬁnance team reviews cash ﬂow forecasts throughout the 
year, with headroom against banking covenants assessed regularly. 
The ﬁnance team uses external tools to assess credit limits oŽered to 
customers, manages trade receivable balances vigilantly and takes 
prompt action on overdue accounts. The Group’s ﬁnancial control 
environment is subject to review by both internal and external audit. 
Internal audit’s focus is to work with and challenge management to 
ensure an appropriate control environment is maintained.

Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014, the directors have assessed the viability of the 
Company over a three year period to January 2020, taking account of the Group’s current position and the Group’s principal 
risks, as detailed in the Strategic Report. Based on this assessment, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period to January 2020.
In making this statement, the directors have considered the resilience of the Group in severe but plausible scenarios, taking 
account of its current position and prospects, the principal risks facing the business and how these are managed. This 
assessment has considered the potential impact of these risks on the Company’s business model, future performance, solvency 
and liquidity over the three year period. The following four principal risks were selected for enhanced stress testing: changing 
consumer preferences, loss of product integrity, major raw material supply disruption and the sugar tax. These are the principal 
risks assessed to have the highest probability of occurrence or the most severe impact; they were stress tested both individually 
and in combination, taking account of the Group’s current position, the Group’s experience of managing adverse conditions in 
the past and the mitigating actions available to the business. A reverse stress test was also performed, allowing the Board to 
assess scenarios and circumstances that would render its business model unviable and enabling the identiﬁcation of potential 
business vulnerabilities and the development of appropriate mitigating actions.
The Board selected the period of three years as an appropriate period for the Company’s viability statement for the following reasons:
 – the Company operates on a three year business cycle; and
 – management currently use three year forecasts as part of the business planning process and capital investment cycle.

Directors’ indemnity provisions
As at the date of this report, indemnities are in force between the Company and each of its directors under which the Company 
has agreed to indemnify each director, to the extent permitted by law, in respect of certain liabilities incurred as a result of 
carrying out their role as a director of the Company. The directors are also indemniﬁed against the costs of defending any 
criminal or civil proceedings or any claim in relation to the Company or brought by a regulator as they are incurred provided 
that where the defence is unsuccessful the director must repay those defence costs to the Company. The Company’s total 
liability under each indemnity is limited to £5.0m for each event giving rise to a claim under that indemnity. The indemnities are 
qualifying third party indemnity provisions for the purposes of the Companies Act 2006. In addition, the Company maintained  
a Directors’ and O§cers’ liability insurance policy throughout the ﬁnancial year and has renewed that policy.
As at the date of this report, indemnities are in force between the Company and each of the directors of the corporate trustee 
of the A.G. BARR p.l.c. (2008) Pension and Life Assurance Scheme under which the Company has agreed to indemnify each 
director, to the extent permitted by law, in respect of certain liabilities incurred in connection with the corporate trustee’s 
activities as a trustee of such scheme.
Research and development
The Group undertakes research and development activities in order to develop its range of new and existing products. 
Expenditure during the year on research and development amounted to £1.1m (2016: £1.1m).
Political donations and political expenditure
No Group company made any political donations or incurred any political expenditure in the year (2016: £nil).
Post balance sheet events
Relevant post balance sheet events requiring disclosure are included in note 33 to the accounts.
Employee involvement
The Group is committed to engaging employees at all levels regarding matters which aŽect them and the performance of  
the Group. This is achieved in a number of ways, including the use of regular brieﬁng procedures, which twice yearly include  
a report on trading results. Regular communication meetings are held to keep employees up to date with Group performance. 
Consultation meetings also take place when the Company is making decisions that are likely to aŽect employees’ interests, at 
which employee representatives’ views are taken into account. In addition to this, the Group’s intranet site provides up-to-date 
information regarding the Group’s activities.
All qualifying employees are entitled to join the Savings Related Share Option Scheme (“SAYE”) and the All-Employee Share 
Ownership Plan (“AESOP”). Details of these share schemes are provided below.
AESOP
The AESOP is HMRC approved and the executive directors participate in both sections of the scheme, which is open to all 
qualifying employees.
The partnership share element provides that for every three shares a participant purchases in the Company, up to a current 
maximum contribution of £150 per month, the Company will purchase one matching share. The matching shares purchased  
are held in trust in the name of the individual.
There are various rules as to the period of time that the shares must be held in trust but after ﬁve years the shares can be 
released tax free to the participant.
The free share element allows participants to receive shares to the value of a common percentage of their earnings, related to 
the performance of the Group. The maximum value of the annual award is currently £3,600 and the shares awarded are held in 
trust for ﬁve years. Under the terms of the AESOP rules, any award of free shares to employees is made by the Trustee of the 
AESOP subject to the Company’s consent. 
Under the terms of this scheme, unless they are a good leaver the matching shares will be forfeited if the participant leaves the 
employment of the Company within three years of the award. All partnership, matching and free shares must be removed from 
the trust if employment with the Company ceases. 40

SAYE
The SAYE is HMRC approved and is available to all qualifying employees, including executive directors. It is based on a five year 
savings contract which provides the participant with an option to purchase shares after five years at a discounted price fixed at 
the time the contract is taken out, or earlier as provided by the scheme rules. No performance conditions require to be met by 
any participant in order to exercise their option under the SAYE.
Employment of disabled persons
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered bearing in mind the qualifications and abilities of 
the applicants concerned. In the event of employees becoming disabled every effort is made to ensure that their employment 
will continue. The Group’s policy is that the training, career development and promotion of disabled persons are, as far as 
possible, identical to those of other employees.
Substantial shareholdings
As at 28 January 2017, the Company had been notified under Rule 5 of the Financial Conduct Authority’s Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules of the following interests in the Company’s ordinary share capital:

The position remains the same as at 28 March 2017 as it did at 28 January 2017.
Relations with shareholders
The Company has regular discussions with and briefings for analysts, investors and institutional shareholders. The Chief 
Executive and Finance Director normally meet with major shareholders twice annually in order to develop an understanding of 
their views and brief the next Board meeting on their discussions. All directors have the opportunity to attend these meetings. 
At the AGM, all shareholders, including private investors, have an opportunity to participate in questions and answers with the 
Board on matters relating to the Company’s operation and performance.
Share capital
As at 28 January 2017 the Company’s issued share capital comprised a single class of ordinary shares of 4 1/6 pence each.  
All of the Company’s issued ordinary shares are fully paid up and rank equally in all respects. The rights attaching to the  
shares are set out in the Articles. Note 28 to the financial statements contains details of the ordinary share capital.
On a show of hands at a general meeting of the Company every holder of ordinary shares present in person or by proxy and 
entitled to vote shall have one vote and, on a poll, every member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have 
one vote for every ordinary share held. The Notice of AGM gives full details of deadlines for exercising voting rights in relation  
to resolutions to be passed at the AGM. All proxy votes are counted and the numbers for, against or withheld in relation to  
each resolution are announced at the AGM and published on the Company’s website after the meeting. Subject to the relevant 
statutory provisions and the Articles, shareholders are entitled to a dividend where declared and paid out of profits available  
for such purposes.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the Company other than:
 – those which may from time to time be applicable under existing laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws); and
 – pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, whereby certain directors and employees of the Company 
require the approval of the Company to deal in the Company’s ordinary shares and are prohibited from dealing during 
closed periods.
At 28 January 2017 the Company had authority, pursuant to the shareholders’ resolution of 1 June 2016, to purchase up to 10% 
of its issued ordinary share capital. This authority will expire at the conclusion of the 2017 AGM. It is proposed that this authority 
be renewed at the 2017 AGM, as detailed in the Notice of AGM.

At 28 January 2017 Robert Barr Limited, as trustee of the General Employee Beneﬁt Trust, the Savings Related Beneﬁt Trust  
and the All-Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust (the “RBL Trustee”), held 0.88% of the issued share capital of the Company in 
trust for the beneﬁt of the executive directors and employees of the Group. As at 28 January 2017, Equiniti Share Plan Trustees 
Limited (the “AESOP Trustee”) held 1.23% of the issued share capital of the Company in trust for participants in the AESOP.
A dividend waiver is in place in respect of the RBL Trustee’s holdings under the Savings Related Beneﬁt Trust. A dividend waiver 
is in place in respect of shares held by the AESOP Trustee and the RBL Trustee under the AESOP which have not been 
appropriated to participants.
The voting rights in relation to the RBL Trustee’s shareholdings are exercised by the RBL Trustee, who may vote or abstain from 
voting the shares as it sees ﬁt in respect of shares which are unvested or have not been appropriated to employees.
Under the rules of the AESOP, eligible employees are entitled to acquire shares in the Company. Details of the AESOP are set 
out above. AESOP shares which have been appropriated to participants are held in trust for those participants by the AESOP 
Trustee. Voting rights in respect of shares which have been appropriated to participants are exercised by the AESOP Trustee on 
receipt of participants’ instructions. If a participant does not submit an instruction to the AESOP Trustee, no vote is registered  
in respect of those shares. In addition, the AESOP Trustee does not vote any unappropriated shares held under the AESOP as 
surplus assets.
The Executive Share Option Scheme (“ESOS”) was approved by shareholders at the 2010 AGM. Approved Long Term  
Incentive Plan (“ALTIP”) awards comprising both a tax-approved option granted under the ESOS and a Long Term Incentive  
Plan award have been granted to executive directors. ALTIP awards enable the participant and the Company to beneﬁt from 
HMRC tax-approved option tax treatment in respect of part of the award, without increasing the pre-tax value delivered to 
participants. Other than to enable the grant of ALTIP awards, the Company has not granted awards to executive directors  
under the ESOS. Details of the ALTIP awards granted to executive directors are set out on page 75.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities 
or on voting rights.
Change of control
As disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, under certain conditions the notice period for R.A. White, J.D. Kemp and 
A.L. Memmott may increase from one year to two years in the event of a takeover of or by the Company or a Company reconstruction.
All of the Company’s share incentive plans contain provisions relating to a change of control of the Company. The Company’s 
banking facilities may, at the discretion of the lender, be repayable upon a change of control.
Articles of association
The Company’s Articles may only be amended by a special resolution at a general meeting of shareholders. No amendments 
are proposed to be made to the existing Articles at the 2017 AGM.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Disclosures regarding greenhouse gas emissions required by The Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) 
Regulations 2013 are included in the Strategic Report on page 25. This information is incorporated by reference into this

Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position  
are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 01 to 35. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position  
and borrowing facilities are described in the financial review on pages 26 to 30.
After making the appropriate enquiries, the directors have concluded that the Group will be able to meet its financial obligations 
for the foreseeable future and therefore have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group overall have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future (being at least one year following the date of approval 
of this annual report) and, accordingly, consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The Company’s viability statement is set out on page 35 of the Strategic Report.
Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information to auditor
So far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by the Companies Act 2006) of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware. Each director has taken all steps that ought to be taken by a director to make themselves aware 
of and to establish that the auditor is aware of any relevant audit information.
Auditor
The Audit Committee has responsibility delegated from the Board for making recommendations on the appointment, 
reappointment, removal and remuneration of the external auditor.
Following a competitive tender for the external audit, KPMG LLP has indicated its intention to resign as auditor and Deloitte  
LLP will be appointed to fill the casual vacancy arising. A resolution to appoint Deloitte LLP as auditor of the Company and its 
subsidiaries, and to authorise the Audit Committee to fix their remuneration, will be proposed at the 2017 AGM.
Annual General Meeting
The Company’s AGM will be held at 11.00am on 31 May 2017 at the offices of Deloitte LLP, 110 Queen Street, Glasgow, G1 3BX. 
The Notice of the AGM is set out on pages 133 to 135 of this report. A description and explanation of the resolutions to be 
considered at the 2017 AGM is set out on pages 136 to 141 of this report.
Recommendation to shareholders
The Board considers that all the resolutions to be considered at the AGM are in the best interests of the Company and its 
shareholders as a whole and unanimously recommends that you vote in favour of them.

The Board
The Company is led by a strong and experienced board of directors (the “Board”) which brings a depth and diversity of 
expertise to the leadership of the Company. The Board has an appropriate balance of skills, experience and knowledge of the 
Group to enable it to discharge its responsibilities eŽectively. The Board currently has nine members, comprising four executive 
directors, the non-executive Chairman, three independent non-executive directors and one non-independent non-executive 
director. Biographical details of the directors are set out on pages 36 and 37.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate and there is a clear division of responsibilities between those roles. The 
Chairman leads the Board and ensures the eŽective engagement and contribution of all non-executive and executive directors. 
The Chairman also ensures that Board meetings are underpinned by a culture of openness and challenge, with su§cient time 
made available to debate issues arising. The Chief Executive has responsibility for all Group businesses and acts in accordance 
with the authority delegated from the Board. The senior independent non-executive director, M.A. Gri§ths, is available to 
shareholders if they have concerns which have not been resolved via the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive,  
or the other executive directors, or where communication through such channels would be inappropriate.
The Board considers that M.A. Gri§ths, P. Powell and D.J. Ritchie are independent for the purposes of provision B.1.1 of  
the UK Corporate Governance Code, issued by the Financial Reporting Council in September 2014 (the “Code”), and that the 
relationships and circumstances set out in that provision which may appear relevant to the determination of independence do 
not apply. The Board considers that, on appointment, the Chairman was independent for the purposes of provision A.3.1 of the 
Code. M.A. Gri§ths fulﬁlled the role of senior independent director during the year to 28 January 2017. In addition to his role as 
Chairman of the Company, J.R. Nicolson is a director of Stocks Spirits Group plc, director of North American Breweries Inc and 
director of PZ Cussons plc. The Board does not consider that J.R. Nicolson’s other commitments have any impact on his ability 
to discharge his duties as Chairman of the Company eŽectively.
The Articles require directors to retire and submit themselves for election at the ﬁrst annual general meeting following 
appointment and to retire no later than the third annual general meeting after the annual general meeting at which they were last 
elected or re-elected. However, in order to comply with the Code, all directors will submit themselves for re-election at the AGM.
Chairman’s Introduction
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present our Corporate Governance Report, which describes how  
the main principles of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code have been applied 
during the year. Information about the Board, its members and committees, and an 
overview of the Company’s system of internal controls are also included.
There were no changes to the Board during the year. Details of the Board’s 
composition are given on pages 36 and 37.

Corporate Governance Report continued
Details of directors’ remuneration and interests in shares of the Company are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on 
pages 51 to 76.
Role of the Board
The Board is responsible for the long term success of the Group, determines the strategic direction of the Group and reviews 
operating, ﬁnancial and risk performance. There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board, including approval of 
the Group’s annual business plan, the Group’s strategy, acquisitions, disposals and capital expenditure projects above certain 
thresholds, the ﬁnancial statements, the Company’s dividend policy, transactions involving the issue or purchase of Company 
shares, borrowing powers, appointments to the Board, alterations to the memorandum and articles of association, legal actions 
brought by or against the Group above certain thresholds, and the scope of delegations to Board committees, subsidiary 
boards and the management committee. Responsibility for the development of policy and strategy and operational 
management is delegated to the executive directors and a management committee, which as at the date of this report  
includes the executive directors and nine senior managers.
Board performance evaluation
Every year the performance and eŽectiveness of the Board, its committees and individual directors is evaluated. In line with the 
Code, during the year Independent Audit Limited (“Independent Audit”) conducted a formal, externally-facilitated review of the 
eŽectiveness of the Board and its committees. Independent Audit is an independent adviser with no other connection to the 
Company. The evaluation was conducted by the completion by all Board members of detailed and comprehensive written 
survey questionnaires. Independent Audit agreed the questionnaires with the Company Secretary and the Chairman. The Board 
questionnaire covered such themes as strategy and risk taking, leadership and accountability, how the Board works, Board 
culture, line of sight and risk management, with a similar degree of coverage for each of the committees. Independent Audit 
provided a full, written report based on the responses to the survey, which they discussed with the Chairman. The full report 
was shared with and discussed by the Board and each of the committees. Overall, the review found that the Board and its 
committees were functioning in an eŽective manner and performing satisfactorily, with no major issues identiﬁed. 
The non-executive directors, led by the senior independent director, carried out a performance evaluation of the Chairman, 
taking into account the views of the executive directors. The Chairman is pleased to conﬁrm that, following performance 
evaluation of the directors, all of the directors’ performances continue to be eŽective and all of the directors continue to 
demonstrate commitment to the role of director, including commitment of time for Board meetings and committee meetings 
and any other relevant duties.
Independent professional advice
Directors can obtain independent professional advice at the Company’s expense in the performance of their duties as directors. 
None of the directors obtained independent professional advice in the period under review. All directors have access to the advice 
and the services of the Company Secretary. The non-executive directors have access to senior management of the business.
Training and development
On appointment to the Board, directors are provided with a full, formal and tailored programme of induction, to familiarise  
them with the Group’s businesses, the risks and strategic challenges the Group faces, and the economic, competitive, legal  
and regulatory environment in which the Group operates. A programme of strategic and other reviews, together with the other 
training provided during the year, ensures that directors continually update their skills, their knowledge and familiarity with the 
Group’s businesses, and their awareness of sector, risk, regulatory, legal, ﬁnancial and other developments to enable them to 
fulﬁl eŽectively their role on the Board and committees of the Board.
Meetings and attendance
Board meetings are scheduled to be held seven times each year. Between these meetings, as required, additional Board 
meetings (and/or Board committee meetings) may be held to progress the Company’s business. A part of each Board  
meeting is dedicated to the discussion of speciﬁc strategy matters.
In advance of all Board meetings the directors are supplied with detailed and comprehensive papers covering the Group’s 
operating functions. Members of the management team attend and make presentations as appropriate at meetings of the 
Board. The Company Secretary is responsible to the Board for the timeliness and quality of information provided to it. The 
Chairman holds meetings with the non-executive directors during the year without the executive directors being present. 45

Conﬂicts of interest
The Articles allow the Board to authorise potential conﬂicts of interest that may arise from time to time, subject to certain 
conditions. The Company has established appropriate conﬂicts authorisation procedures, whereby actual or potential conﬂicts 
are regularly reviewed and authorisations sought as appropriate. During the year, no such conﬂicts arose and no such 
authorisations were sought.
Committees of the Board
The terms of reference of the principal committees of the Board – Audit, Remuneration and Nomination – have been approved 
by the Board and are available on the Company’s website, www.agbarr.co.uk.
Those terms of reference have been reviewed in the current year and are reviewed at least annually. The work carried out by the 
Nomination Committee in discharging its responsibilities is summarised below. The work carried out by the Audit Committee is 
described within the Audit Committee’s Report on pages 48 to 50. The work carried out by the Remuneration Committee is 
described within the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 51 to 76.
The Board has established a Market Disclosure Committee which comprises R.A. White, S. Lorimer and the Company Secretary. 
The Market Disclosure Committee meets only when required and is responsible for overseeing the disclosure of information by 
the Company to meet its obligations under the Market Abuse Regulation and the Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing Rules 
and Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules. 
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises J.R. Nicolson, W.R.G. Barr, M.A. Gri§ths, P. Powell and D.J. Ritchie. The Nomination 
Committee is chaired by J.R. Nicolson. The Nomination Committee leads the process for making appointments to the Board 
and ensures that there is a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new directors to the Board. The 
remit of the Nomination Committee also includes reviewing the composition of the Board through a full evaluation of the skills, 
knowledge and experience of directors and ensuring plans are in place for orderly succession for appointments to the Board. 
The Nomination Committee also makes recommendations to the Board on the membership of its committees.
The Nomination Committee is required, in accordance with its terms of reference, to meet at least once per year. The 
Nomination Committee met four times during the year and, amongst other matters, considered the recruitment of an additional 
non-executive director.  46

The Board recognises the importance of diversity to the success of the business and is ﬁrmly committed to giving due 
consideration to all aspects of diversity, including gender diversity. Appointments to the Board are made on merit, against 
objective criteria, and with due regard for the beneﬁts of diversity on the Board. Whilst no formal measurable objectives  
have been set for female representation at Board level, the Board remains committed to the principles of gender diversity.
The disclosure relating to gender diversity within the Company is included in the Strategic Report on page 25.
Treasury Committee
The Treasury Committee consists of R.A. White, S. Lorimer and senior members of the ﬁnance, legal and procurement 
departments. The Treasury Committee reviews purchase requirements in foreign currencies and implements strategies, 
including the use of foreign exchange hedges, in order to reduce the risk of foreign exchange exposure and provide certainty 
over the value of non-domestic purchases in the short to medium term. The Treasury Committee’s remit also includes the  
ability to utilise certain ﬁnancial instruments in order to hedge the Group’s exposure to interest rate ﬂuctuations.
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s internal control systems and annually reviews their eŽectiveness, including  
a review of ﬁnancial, operational, compliance and risk management controls. The implementation and maintenance of the risk 
management and internal control systems are the responsibility of the executive directors and other senior management.  
The systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and to provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board has reviewed the eŽectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems, including ﬁnancial, 
operational and compliance controls, in accordance with the Code for the period from 31 January 2016 to the date of approval 
of this annual report.
No signiﬁcant failings or weaknesses were identiﬁed from this review during the year. Had any failings or weaknesses been 
identiﬁed then the Board would have taken the action required to remedy them.
At the Audit Committee meeting on 18 January 2017, following a review and evaluation of the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems in place, the Audit Committee concluded that the Group has a sound system of risk management  
and internal controls in place.
The Board conﬁrms that there is an ongoing process, embedded in the Group’s integrated internal control systems, allowing  
for the identiﬁcation, evaluation and management of signiﬁcant risks, as well as a reporting process to the Board. This risk 
management process has been in place throughout the year ended 28 January 2017 and up to the date of the approval of this 
annual report. The Board has carried out a robust, systematic assessment of the principal risks facing the Group during the 
period, including those which would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. Information on  
the Group’s risk management framework is set out in the Strategic Report on pages 31 to 35.
The three main elements of the Group’s internal control system are as follows:
The Board
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s internal control systems and exercises this through an organisational 
structure with clearly deﬁned levels of responsibility and authority as well as appropriate reporting procedures.
The Board has a schedule of matters that are brought to it, or its duly authorised committees, for decision, aimed at maintaining 
eŽective control over strategic, ﬁnancial, operational and compliance issues.
This structure includes the Audit Committee which, with the Finance Director, reviews the eŽectiveness of the internal ﬁnancial 
and operating control environment.
Financial reporting
There is a comprehensive strategic planning, budgeting and forecasting system with an annual operating plan approved by  
the Board. Monthly ﬁnancial information, including trading results, cash ﬂow statement, statement of ﬁnancial position and 
indebtedness, is reported.
The Board and the management committee review their business and ﬁnancial performance against the prior year and against 
annual plans approved by the Board. 47
A.G. BARR p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Accounts Strategic Report Corporate Governance
Audits and reviews
The key internal risks identiﬁed in the Group are subject to regular audits or reviews by the internal auditors. This role is fulﬁlled 
by an external professional services ﬁrm which is independent from the Board and the Company.
The review of the internal auditors’ work by the Audit Committee and monitoring procedures in place ensure that the ﬁndings  
of the audits are acted upon and subsequent reviews conﬁrm compliance with any agreed action plans.
The Board conﬁrms that there has been an independent internal audit function in place for the year.
Share capital structure
The share capital structure of the Company is set out in the Directors’ Report.
UK Corporate Governance Code compliance
The Company is committed to the principles of corporate governance contained in the Code. A copy of the Code is available  
on the Financial Reporting Council’s website, www.frc.org.uk.
Each of the provisions of the Code has been reviewed and, where necessary, steps have been taken to ensure that the Company 
is in compliance with all of those provisions as at the date of this report.
The directors consider that the Company has complied throughout the year ended 28 January 2017 with the provisions of the 
Code, except as set out below.
During the year the Board comprised four executive directors, the non-executive Chairman and three independent non-
executive directors. In addition, W.R.G. Barr was a non-executive director during the year although he is not considered by the 
Board to be independent. Accordingly, during the year to 28 January 2017 the composition of the Board did not, at any time, 
comply with provision B.1.2 of the Code. The Board considers that, despite this non-compliance, the Board has an appropriate 
balance of skills, knowledge and experience to enable it to discharge its duties and responsibilities eŽectively. No concerns 
regarding the Board’s non-independent majority were raised as part of the Board performance evaluation carried out during 
the year and referred to above. 
Provision D.1.5 of the Code recommends that executive directors’ contracts contain a maximum notice period of one year. As 
disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, the service contracts with R.A. White, J.D. Kemp and A.L. Memmott provide 
for a notice period of 12 months except during the six months following either a takeover of or by the Company or a Company 
reconstruction. Under these conditions and certain circumstances the directors are entitled to a liquidated damages payment 
equal to the director’s basic salary at termination plus the value of all contractual beneﬁts for a two year period. Given the size 
of the Company and the sector dynamics at the time these directors were recruited, the Remuneration Committee considered 
this provision appropriate in order to attract and retain high calibre executive directors. As disclosed in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, this provision will continue to be honoured as a contractual commitment made to these directors; 
however this provision was not included in S. Lorimer’s service contract and will not be included in service contracts with  
other new executive directors appointed in future.
A copy of the ﬁnancial statements has been placed on the Company’s website, www.agbarr.co.uk. The maintenance and 
integrity of this website is the responsibility of the directors. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination 
of ﬁnancial statements may diŽer from legislation in other jurisdictions.

 – reviewed the non-audit services provided to the Group by the external auditor and monitored and assessed the 
independence of both the external and internal auditors; and
 – reviewed the performance of the Audit Committee and its terms of reference.
At the request of the Board, the Audit Committee also considered whether the Annual Report and Accounts for the year  
ended 28 January 2017, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary  
for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and performance, business model and strategy. Following review of 
management’s processes in this regard and consideration of the draft Annual Report and Accounts, the Audit Committee 
recommended to the Board that it could make the required disclosure as set out in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement  
on page 77.
Signiﬁcant areas
The signiﬁcant matters and key accounting judgements considered by the Audit Committee during the year were:
 – The carrying value of brand support accruals: judgement is required when ascertaining the level of accrual required in 
relation to promotions and brand support campaigns that span the year end, or where settlement has not been fully and 
ﬁnally settled by the year end, or which relate to prior years. During the year the Audit Committee received a report from 
the management team on the commercial investment process. It also received and considered reports from management 
on the level of accruals at the half year and at the year end. The Audit Committee was content that there were no issues 
arising. 
 – The valuation of inventory: the valuation of inventory is judgemental due to the volatile nature of raw material commodity 
prices and, as the Group uses standard costing, changes in production levels can lead to purchase price variances which 
require to be accounted for correctly. During the year the Audit Committee considered and was satisﬁed with reports from 
the internal auditor and management regarding the controls operating in relation to inventory management at the Milton 
Keynes site. The Audit Committee discussed and challenged management’s judgements in relation to inventory valuation 
and considered reports from the external auditor on this area and were satisﬁed that inventory valuations were reasonable.
Other areas
Other matters considered by the Audit Committee during the year were:
 – Exceptional items: the Audit Committee considered reports received from management in relation to the classiﬁcation and 
presentation of certain items as exceptional and was satisﬁed with the treatment and presentation of various items which 
arose during the year as exceptional, the majority of which related to the closure of the deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme to 
future accrual and the Company-wide reorganisation.
 – Deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme: during the year the Audit Committee considered and was satisﬁed with reports received 
from the Group’s external auditor and management relating to the accounting for the closure of the deﬁned beneﬁt pension 
scheme to future accrual.
 – The presentation of adjusted performance measures.
 – Accounting for the Funkin acquisition: during the year the Audit Committee considered and was satisﬁed with the 
Company’s approach to accounting for the Funkin acquisition.
The Audit Committee receives regular presentations from members of the senior management team. During the year, the  
Audit Committee has considered presentations from representatives of the management team on the Company’s franchise 
arrangements, the purchase to pay process and the Finance Service Centre. 
External audit
The Group’s external auditor is KPMG LLP. The Audit Committee reviews the external auditor’s performance, independence and 
objectivity annually. The Audit Committee ensures that procedures are in place to safeguard the external auditor’s independence 
and objectivity. The external auditor reports regularly to the Audit Committee on the actions that it has taken to comply with 
professional and regulatory requirements and current best practice in order to maintain its independence and objectivity.
The Group has a policy in place which ensures that the provision of non-audit services by the external auditor does not impair 
the auditor’s independence or objectivity. Where fees for any non-audit project are expected to exceed £50,000, the prior 
approval of the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Finance Director is required. Where fees for non-audit projects are  
in aggregate expected to exceed £150,000, the prior approval of the Audit Committee is required. This policy was complied 
with during the year. The Audit Committee has reviewed and amended this policy in preparation for the new EU regulation on 
non-audit services. The revised policy states that the external auditor should not be engaged in respect of services prohibited 
by the FRC’s Ethical Standard 2016. Any other non-trivial non-audit services provided must be pre-approved by the Audit 
Committee, unless the engagement is urgent, in which case the Finance Director can agree the work with the Chairman of  
the Audit Committee and report to the next Audit Committee meeting.  50
A.G. BARR p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate Governance
Details of the amounts paid to the external auditor during the year for audit and non-audit services are set out in note 3  
to the ﬁnancial statements. The ratio of fees for non-audit services to those for audit services for the year was 2.6:1. The  
Audit Committee considered the nature and level of non-audit services provided and was satisﬁed that the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditor were not aŽected by the non-audit work undertaken. A signiﬁcant proportion of the 
non-audit fees during the year were for pension advisory services, and the remainder related to the provision of tax advisory, 
tax compliance and corporate ﬁnance transaction services. The level of fees for non-audit services was considered by KPMG 
who concluded that they did not present a threat to KPMG’s independence.
KPMG Audit Plc was appointed as the Group’s external auditor in May 2009 following a competitive tender process. A 
resolution proposing the appointment of KPMG LLP, KPMG Audit Plc’s parent entity, as the Group’s external auditor was 
approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM. There are no contractual obligations which restrict the Audit Committee’s choice  
of external auditor. The senior statutory auditor rotates every ﬁve years to ensure independence; an audit partner rotation took 
place at the end of the 2013/14 ﬁnancial year and the Audit Committee took steps to ensure that a new appropriately qualiﬁed 
and independent senior statutory auditor became responsible for the audit of the Group’s ﬁnancial statements with eŽect from 
2014/15. The Audit Committee acknowledges the requirement under the Code to tender the external audit contract at least 
every ten years. Following the introduction of the new EU regulation on non-audit services, the Audit Committee has taken  
the opportunity to re-assess the role of various providers of such services to ensure full compliance with the new regulation  
in relation to the provision of such services going forward. As a consequence, during the year, the Audit Committee conducted  
a competitive tender process for the audit for 2017/18 onwards. Three audit ﬁrms (not including the incumbent auditor KPMG 
LLP) were invited to tender by the Audit Committee. Each ﬁrm prepared a formal written proposal which was considered by  
the Audit Committee. The proposed audit partners and key members of the audit teams of each of the tendering ﬁrms attended 
a meeting with the Chairman of the Audit Committee, the Finance Director and certain members of senior management where 
they presented their proposals and answered questions thereon. The Audit Committee considered the proposals and 
recommended the appointment of Deloitte LLP. The Board approved the Audit Committee’s preferred ﬁrm for recommendation 
to shareholders. The Company will seek shareholder approval of the appointment of Deloitte LLP at the Company’s 2017 AGM. 
The Company conﬁrms that it has complied with the provisions of the Competition and Markets Authority’s Statutory Audit 
Services Order in respect of the ﬁnancial year under review. 
The Audit Committee carried out a review of the eŽectiveness of the external audit process during the year. This review 
included an externally facilitated detailed and comprehensive evaluation of the Group’s external auditor by means of a written 
survey questionnaire completed by Audit Committee members and certain members of senior management, including the 
executive directors. The results of the evaluation were shared with the Group’s external auditor. The Audit Committee reviewed 
comprehensive papers from both management and the Group’s external auditor, which set out the planning and execution of 
the conduct of the audit. The Audit Committee held a meeting with the Group’s external auditor in the absence of management 
to discuss further. Following this review, the Audit Committee was satisﬁed with KPMG LLP’s performance during the year, that 
it was objective and independent, and that the external audit process was eŽective. 
Internal audit
At the beginning of each year, an internal control plan is developed by the internal auditor following meetings with directors  
and senior managers within the business and with reference to the signiﬁcant risks contained within the Group’s risk register and 
identiﬁed controls. The Audit Committee receives updates on progress against the internal control plan throughout the year.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Remuneration Committee – Chairman’s Statement
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 28 January 2017,  
which sets out the future Directors’ Remuneration Policy intended to take eŽect from the close of the 2017 AGM, and the 
Annual Report on Remuneration. Our previous Policy was approved by a binding vote at the 2014 AGM and became eŽective 
for three years from the close of that meeting. The future Policy will be subject to a binding vote and the Annual Report on 
Remuneration will be subject to an advisory vote at the 2017 AGM. 
I am delighted to report on the strong level of support received from shareholders, as evidenced by the voting outcome at the 2016 
AGM. The resolution seeking approval of the Annual Report on Remuneration was supported by over 99.8% of the votes cast.
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Remuneration Committee considers that the Company’s current remuneration framework continues to eŽectively support 
the delivery of our business strategy (as set out in the Strategic Report on pages 01 to 35) and the creation of shareholder 
value. Consequently, the Remuneration Committee has decided to make minor changes only to the Policy to take account  
of developments in best practice and to ensure that the Policy continues to provide su§cient ﬂexibility to support potential 
changes to business needs over the next three years. A summary of the minor changes to the Policy are set out on page 52.
2016/17 key decisions and pay outcomes
The Remuneration Committee remains committed to a responsible approach to executive pay and believes that variable pay 
should only be earned for achievement against stretching performance targets. As described in the Strategic Report, against 
challenging soft drinks market conditions, the Group delivered revenue for the year ended 28 January 2017 of £257.1m, a 
decrease of 0.6% on the prior year. The UK soft drinks market grew by 1.2% in value over the same period of time. Pre-tax proﬁt 
increased by 4.4% on the prior year. Against this background and taking into account executive directors’ performance against 
strategic objectives, an annual bonus of 23% was earned by R.A. White and S. Lorimer and an annual bonus of 18% was earned 
by J.D. Kemp and A.L. Memmott. Average EPS for the three years ended 28 January 2017 exceeded the average EPS for the 
three years preceding that period (both being adjusted for Consumer Price Index) by 15.6%. As a result, the Long Term Incentive 
Plan (“LTIP”) awards granted in June 2014 vested at 40.02%. Further details in relation to the annual bonus and LTIP vesting are 
included on pages 67 to 69.
Director remuneration for 2017/18
In line with the range of salary increases across the Group, an increase of 1.8% will be made to the executive directors’ base 
salaries with eŽect from 1 April 2017. An increase of 1.8% will also be made to the Chairman’s fee and the other non-executive 
directors’ basic fee with eŽect from 1 April 2017.
No changes are proposed to the annual bonus for the year ending 27 January 2018, with awards continuing to be subject to a 
combination of proﬁt before tax and strategic performance measures. Details of bonus award levels and performance measure 
weightings are provided on page 67. Performance targets for these bonus awards will be disclosed in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration for the year ending 27 January 2018.
No changes are proposed to the LTIP for the year ending 27 January 2018, with awards continuing to be subject to an EPS 
performance measure. EPS is a key performance indicator for the Company and shareholders, and remains a highly credible 
measure of long term performance. The EPS targets for the next LTIP awards are still to be determined given ongoing 
assessment of the anticipated impact of the new Soft Drinks Industry Levy which will inﬂuence EPS during the vesting period. 
Details of the LTIP awards, which will be subject to a maximum of 125% of salary, and the EPS targets will be disclosed at the 
time the LTIP awards are granted and in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration. The Remuneration Committee keeps long 
term performance metrics under review.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on the Company’s website, www.agbarr.co.uk.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy
This part of the report sets out the Company’s Directors’ Remuneration Policy which, subject to shareholder approval at the 
2017 AGM, shall take binding eŽect from the date of that meeting. The Policy for the executive directors has been determined 
by the Remuneration Committee. 
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy was ﬁrst approved at the 2014 AGM. No signiﬁcant changes have been made to the 
Remuneration Policy. Minor amendments have been made to ensure that the Remuneration Policy is appropriate for the next 
three years. In summary the changes made to the proposed Remuneration Policy as compared to the Remuneration Policy 
approved at the 2014 AGM are as follows:
Minimum shareholding guidelines: In line with best practice, the minimum shareholding guidelines are included in the 
Remuneration Policy. Shareholding guidelines were previously included in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Clawback: In line with best practice, clawback provisions in respect of annual bonus and LTIP awards are included in the 
Remuneration Policy. Clawback provisions were previously included in the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
Pension: The Company’s maximum contribution under the URBS for R.A. White has been redeﬁned for clarity. For the 
avoidance of doubt, the Company’s maximum contribution under the URBS for R.A. White is consistent with the maximum 
contribution under the Remuneration Policy approved at the 2014 AGM. 
Recruitment: The ability for the Company to pay appropriate relocation, travel and subsistence costs for newly appointed 
directors where necessary has been clariﬁed.

the Company.
Usually reviewed annually.
Salary levels are determined by the 
Remuneration Committee taking into 
account a range of factors including:
 – role, experience and individual 
performance;
 – pay for other employees in the 
Group;
 – prevailing market conditions; and
 – external benchmarks for similar 
roles at comparable companies.
Although there is no 
overall maximum, salary 
increases are normally 
reviewed in the context 
of the salary increases 
across the wider Group.
The Remuneration 
Committee may award 
salary increases above 
this level to take  
account of individual 
circumstances such as:
 – increase in scope and 
responsibility;
 – increase to reﬂect 
the executive 
director’s 
development and

Company.
Executive directors receive beneﬁts 
in line with market practice, which 
may include, for example, a car 
allowance or provision of a company 
car, a biennial health check, private 
medical insurance, life assurance and 
the ability to “buy” or “sell” holidays 
under the Company’s ﬂexible 
beneﬁts plan.
Other beneﬁts may be provided 
based on individual circumstances. 
These may include, for example, 
relocation and travel allowances.
Whilst the Remuneration 
Committee has not set  
an absolute maximum  
on the levels of beneﬁts 
executive directors 
receive, the value of the 
beneﬁt is at a level which 
the Remuneration 
Committee considers 
appropriate against the 
market and provides 
su§cient level of beneﬁt 
based on individual

targets which 
support the

Awards based on annual 
performance against key ﬁnancial 
and/or strategic targets and/or the 
delivery of personal objectives. 
Pay-out levels are determined  
by the Remuneration Committee 
after the year end based on 
performance against those targets.
The Remuneration Committee  
has discretion to amend the bonus 
pay-out if, in its judgement, any 
formulaic output does not produce  
a fair result for either the executive 
director or the Company, taking into 
account overall business performance.
For up to two years following the 
determination of a bonus pay-out, 
the Remuneration Committee has 
the right to recover some or all  
of the bonus pay-out in the event  
of a material misstatement of  
the Group’s ﬁnancial results or  
if the participant has been guilty  
of misconduct. 
Maximum bonus 
opportunity is 100%  
of base salary.
Targets are set annually 
reﬂecting the Company’s 
strategy and aligned with 
key ﬁnancial, strategic and/
or individual objectives.
Targets, whilst stretching, do 
not encourage inappropriate 
business risks to be taken.
At least 80% of the bonus is 
assessed against key ﬁnancial 
performance metrics of the 
business and the balance may 
be based on non-ﬁnancial 
strategic measures and/or 
individual performance.
Financial metrics
There is no minimum 
payment at threshold 
performance, up to 50%  
of the maximum potential 
for this element of the 
bonus will be paid out for 
on-target performance  
and all of the maximum 
potential will be paid out  
for maximum performance. 
Non-ﬁnancial or  
individual metrics
Payment of the non-ﬁnancial 
or individual metrics will 
apply on a scale between 
0% and 100% based on the 
Remuneration Committee’s 
assessment of the extent to 
which a non-ﬁnancial or 
individual performance 
metric has been met. 54

Long Term 
Incentive 
Plan 2014 
(“LTIP”)
Incentivises 
executive 
directors over 
the longer term 
and aligns their 
interests  
with those of 
shareholders.
Under the LTIP, awards of conditional 
shares, nil cost share options or other 
such form as has the same economic 
eŽect may be made with vesting 
dependent on the achievement of 
performance conditions set by the 
Remuneration Committee, normally 
over a three year performance period. 
Awards granted over shares may be 
settled in cash at the election of the 
Remuneration Committee.
As described on page 62, awards 
may also vest in “good leaver” 
circumstances or on the death  
of a participant or on a change  
of control.
The Remuneration Committee  
has the right to reduce unvested or 
unexercised awards and/or delay their 
vesting in the event of a material 
misstatement of the Group’s ﬁnancial 
results or if the participant has been 
guilty of misconduct.
For up to two years following  
the determination of the vesting 
outcome of an award, the 
Remuneration Committee has the 
right to cancel the award if it has not 
been exercised, or require repayment 
of some or all of the award in the 
event of a material misstatement  
of the Group’s ﬁnancial results or  
if the participant has been guilty  
of misconduct.
The Remuneration Committee may 
make a dividend equivalent payment 
(“Dividend Equivalents”) to reﬂect 
dividends that would have been paid 
over the period to vesting on shares 
that vest. This payment may be in the 
form of additional shares or a cash 
payment equal to the value of those 
additional shares.
The normal maximum 
award is 125% of annual 
base salary in respect  
of a ﬁnancial year. Under 
the share plan rules the 
overall maximum 
opportunity that may  
be granted in respect  
of a ﬁnancial year will  
be 200% of annual base 
salary. The normal 
maximum award limit  
will only be exceeded  
in exceptional 
circumstances involving 
the recruitment or 
retention of a senior 
employee. These limits 
do not include the value 
of shares subject to any 
tax-advantaged option 
granted as part of an 
ALTIP award. 
The vesting of awards is 
subject to the satisfaction  
of performance targets  
set by the Remuneration 
Committee.
The performance measures 
are reviewed regularly to 
ensure they remain relevant 
but will be based on key 
ﬁnancial and/or strategic 
and/or total shareholder 
return related measures.  
The relevant metrics and  
the respective weightings 
may vary each year based 
upon Company strategic 
priorities.
Performance measures  
and weightings will be set 
out in the Annual Report  
on Remuneration for the 
relevant ﬁnancial year.
For achievement of 
threshold performance  
20% of the maximum 
opportunity will vest.
There will usually be  
straight line vesting 
between threshold and 
maximum performance.
Where a tax-advantaged 
option is granted as part  
of an ALTIP award, the  
same performance 
conditions will apply to the 
tax-advantaged option as 
apply to the LTIP award.

The Remuneration Committee may 
at its discretion structure awards as 
Approved Long Term Incentive Plan 
(“ALTIP”) awards comprising both  
a HMRC tax-advantaged option 
granted under the Executive Share 
Option Scheme (“ESOS”) and an 
LTIP award. ALTIP awards enable the 
participant and Company to beneﬁt 
from HMRC tax-advantaged option 
tax treatment in respect of part of 
the award, without increasing the 
pre-tax value delivered to 
participants. ALTIP awards would  
be structured as a tax-advantaged 
option and a LTIP award, with the 
vesting of the LTIP award scaled 
back to take account of any gain 
made on exercise of the tax-
advantaged option.
Other than to enable the grant of 
ALTIP awards, the Company will not 
grant awards to executive directors

Executive directors are eligible to 
participate in the A.G. BARR p.l.c. 
(2008) Pension and Life Assurance 
Scheme (the “Scheme”), which 
comprises a deﬁned contribution 
section and a deﬁned beneﬁt 
section. The deﬁned beneﬁt  
section was closed to new  
entrants from 14 August 2003 and  
to future accrual from 1 May 2016.
Details of the entitlements accruing 
to the two executive directors who 
are deferred members of the deﬁned 
beneﬁt section are detailed in the 
table on page 70. The contributions 
paid to the deﬁned contribution 
section in respect of three executive 
directors are disclosed on pages 69 
and 70. Details of accruals under the 
URBS are disclosed on page 71.
Executive directors may participate 
in the A.G. BARR p.l.c. Unfunded 
Retirement Beneﬁt Scheme 
(“URBS”) with the agreement of the 
Company. The URBS was established 
to satisfy the Company’s contractual 
obligations to provide retirement 
beneﬁts for the beneﬁt of the 
executive directors where either the 
annual or lifetime allowance has been 
exceeded whilst those individuals 
were members of the Scheme. 
Beneﬁts will be receivable in  
certain circumstances, including  
on retirement, death, change  
of control or cessation of 
employment in accordance  
with the rules of the URBS.
In appropriate circumstances, 
executive directors may take  
a cash supplement instead of 
contributions into a pension plan.
R.A. White ceased his 
accrual under the 
deﬁned beneﬁt section 
on 5 April 2011. For R.A. 
White, the Company’s 
maximum contribution 
under the URBS is equal 
to 26% of salary plus any 
contractual entitlement  
in respect of a shortfall  
in R.A. White’s deferred 
pension revaluation as a 
consequence of Fixed 
Protection 2012.
The maximum combined 
Company contribution 
under the deﬁned 
contribution section and 
the URBS in respect of 
the remaining executive 
directors is 19% of salary 
(as deﬁned in the 
Scheme rules) rising  
to 26% of salary 
following the executive’s 
50th birthday.
The Remuneration 
Committee has 
discretion to vary the 
delivery mechanism for 
retirement beneﬁts, 
however the exercise  
of this discretion will  
not exceed the above 
limits for the provision  
of executive directors’ 
retirement beneﬁts.
The Company has closed 
the deﬁned beneﬁt 
section of the Scheme  
to new members but the 
two executive directors 
who are deferred 
members will continue  
to receive beneﬁts in 
accordance with the 
terms of the Scheme, 
subject to separately

The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Remuneration Committee.  
Fees are set at a level which reﬂects the skill, knowledge and experience of the individual, 
whilst taking into account appropriate market data.
The Board is responsible for setting the fees of the other non-executive directors. Fees 
may include a basic fee and additional fees for further responsibilities (for example, 
chairmanship of board committees and senior independent directorship). Fees are set 
taking into account several factors, including the size and complexity of the business, 
appropriate market data and the expected time commitment and contribution for the role.
Non-executive directors do not participate in any of the Company’s share schemes or 
bonus schemes nor do they receive any pension contributions. Non-executive directors 
may be eligible to receive beneﬁts such as the use of secretarial support, travel costs or 
other beneﬁts that may be appropriate.
Actual fee levels are disclosed in the Directors’ annual remuneration report for the relevant 
ﬁnancial year. 58

Explanation of performance metrics chosen and the target setting process
Performance measures are selected that are aligned to the Company’s strategy. Stretching performance targets are set each year for 
the annual bonus and LTIP awards. When setting these performance targets, the Remuneration Committee will take into account a 
number of diŽerent reference points, which may include the Company’s business plans and strategy and the market environment. 
Full payment or vesting will only occur for what the Remuneration Committee considers to be stretching performance. 
The annual bonus performance targets have been selected to provide an appropriate balance between incentivising directors to 
meet ﬁnancial targets for the year and achieving strategic and/or personal objectives. 
The LTIP performance targets reﬂect the Company’s strategic objectives and therefore the ﬁnancial and strategic decisions 
which ultimately determine the success of the Company. The LTIP performance measures may be based on key ﬁnancial and/or 
strategic and/or total shareholder return related measures. LTIP performance is currently based solely on Earnings Per Share, 
which is a key measure of the Company’s proﬁtability. 
The Remuneration Committee retains the ability to adjust or set diŽerent performance measures if events occur (such as a 
change in strategy, a material acquisition and/or a divestment of a Group business or a change in prevailing market conditions) 
which cause the Remuneration Committee to determine that the measures are no longer appropriate and that amendment is 
required so that they achieve their original purpose.
Awards and options may be adjusted in the event of a variation of share capital in accordance with the scheme rules.
Policy for the remuneration of employees generally
Remuneration arrangements are determined throughout the Group based on the same principle that reward should be 
achieved for delivery of the business strategy and should be su§cient to attract and retain high calibre talent.
Under the rules of the ESOS and the LTIP, certain managers are eligible to participate in the ESOS and the LTIP; however  
there has been no such participation to date and there is no current intention to invite managers to do so. The annual bonus 
arrangements for the senior management team are similar to those for the executive directors in that targets are set annually 
dependent on ﬁnancial and/or non-ﬁnancial performance metrics. The key principles of the remuneration philosophy are 
applied consistently across the Group below this level, taking account of the seniority of employees. 
Approach to recruitment remuneration
The policy aims to facilitate the appointment of individuals of su§cient calibre to lead the business and execute the strategy 
eŽectively for the beneﬁt of shareholders. When appointing a new director, the Remuneration Committee seeks to ensure that 
arrangements are in the best interests of the Company and in line with market practice.
The Remuneration Committee will take into consideration a number of relevant factors, which may include the calibre of the 
individual, the candidate’s existing remuneration package, and the speciﬁc circumstances of the individual including the 
jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited.
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued 59
A.G. BARR p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Accounts Strategic Report Corporate Governance
The Remuneration Committee will typically seek to align the remuneration package with the Company’s Remuneration Policy 
(as set out in the policy table). The maximum level of variable remuneration which may be granted (excluding buy-out awards 
referred to below) is 300% of salary (in line with this policy). Subject to this overall maximum variable remuneration, incentive 
awards will only be granted above the normal maximum annual award opportunities where the Remuneration Committee 
considers there to be a commercial rationale, which may include but is not limited to circumstances where an executive director 
is recruited at a time in the year when it would be inappropriate to provide a bonus and/or LTIP award for that year as there 
would not be su§cient time to assess performance. The quantum in respect of the months employed during the year may be 
transferred to the subsequent year so that reward is provided on a fair and appropriate basis. The Remuneration Committee  
will ensure that any such awards are linked to the achievement of appropriate and challenging performance targets and will be 
forfeited if performance or continued employment conditions are not achieved. The Remuneration Committee may also alter 
the performance measures, performance period and vesting period of the bonus and/or LTIP award, if the Remuneration 
Committee determines that the circumstances of the recruitment merit such alteration. The rationale would be clearly explained 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report following grant. The individual will move over time onto a remuneration package that is 
consistent with the normal maximum annual bonus and LTIP award opportunities set out in the policy table.
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to include other remuneration components or awards which are outside  
the speciﬁc terms of the policy (but subject to the limit on variable remuneration) to facilitate the hiring of candidates of an 
appropriate calibre, where the Remuneration Committee believes there is a need to do so in the best interests of the Company. 
The Remuneration Committee would ensure that awards within the 300% of salary variable remuneration limit are linked to the 
achievement of appropriate and challenging performance measures. The Remuneration Committee will not use this discretion 
to make a non-performance related incentive payment (for example a “golden hello”).
In some circumstances, the Remuneration Committee may make payments or awards to recognise or “buy-out” remuneration 
arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer. The Remuneration Committee will normally aim to do so broadly  
on a like-for-like basis, taking into account a number of relevant factors regarding the forfeited arrangements which may  
include the form of award, any performance conditions attached to the awards and the time at which they would have vested.  
These payments or awards are excluded from the maximum level of variable remuneration referred to above, however the 
Remuneration Committee’s intention is that the value awarded would be no higher than the expected value of the forfeited 
arrangements. Where considered appropriate, such payments or awards will be liable to “malus” and/or “clawback” on  
early departure.
Any share awards referred to in this section will be granted as far as possible under the Company’s existing share plans. If 
necessary, and subject to the limits referred to above, recruitment awards may be granted outside of these plans as currently 
permitted under the Listing Rules which allow for the grant of awards to facilitate, in exceptional circumstances, the recruitment 
of an executive director.
Where a position is fulﬁlled internally, any ongoing remuneration obligations or outstanding variable pay elements shall be 
allowed to continue according to the original terms.
Where necessary, the Company will pay appropriate relocation, travel and subsistence costs. The Remuneration Committee  
will seek to ensure that no more is paid than is necessary. 
Fees payable to a newly-appointed Chairman or non-executive director will be in line with the fee policy in place at the time  
of appointment. 60

Three scenarios have been illustrated for each executive director:
Fixed pay Annual Bonus LTIP
Minimum performance Fixed elements of 
remuneration – base salary, 
beneﬁts and pension only.
Base salary is the latest 
known salary (i.e. the salary 
eŽective from 1 April 2017) 
and the value for beneﬁts 
has been calculated as per 
the single ﬁgure table on 
page 64.
No bonus. No LTIP vesting.
Performance in line with 
expectations
50% of salary awarded  
for achieving target 
performance.
20% of maximum award 
vesting (i.e. 25% of salary  
for achieving target 
performance).
Maximum performance 100% of salary awarded  
for achieving maximum 
performance.
100% of maximum award 
vesting (i.e. 125% of salary  
for achieving maximum 
performance).
LTIP awards are included in the scenarios above at face value with no share price movement included. 
Service contracts
Executive directors’ contracts are on a rolling basis and may be terminated on 12 months’ notice by the Company or on  
6 months’ notice by the executive. Service contracts for new directors will generally be limited to 12 months’ notice by  
the Company. 
In line with the Remuneration Policy approved at the 2014 AGM, service contracts entered into prior to this date provide for  
a notice period of 12 months except during the six months following either a takeover of or by the Company or a Company 
reconstruction. Under these conditions and certain circumstances the executive directors are entitled to a liquidated damages 
payment equal to the executive director’s basic salary at termination plus the value of all contractual beneﬁts for a two year 
period. In the event this liquidated damages payment is triggered, the executive director will also be deemed to be a “good 
leaver” for the purposes of the Company’s share schemes. Given the size of the Company and the sector dynamics at the time 
the directors were recruited, the Remuneration Committee considered this provision appropriate in order to attract and retain 
high calibre executive directors. The Remuneration Committee is cognisant of the fact that these provisions do not reﬂect best 
practice. It has therefore previously considered the alternatives available to exit these contractual arrangements, including 
contractual buy-out. However, the Remuneration Committee concluded that it was not feasible to place a value on these rights, 
in order to remove them from the contracts, which would be acceptable to both parties. It therefore determined that the most 
appropriate approach would be to maintain the legacy provisions, however for all future appointments after the approval of the 
2014 Remuneration Policy these provisions have not and will not apply. S. Lorimer’s service contract does not therefore include 
the legacy provisions. 
Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial period of three years, subject to annual re-election by shareholders in 
accordance with the Code. Their appointments are terminable by either the Company or the directors themselves upon three 
months notice without compensation. 62
A.G. BARR p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate Governance
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Payments for loss of ošce
The principles on which the determination of payments for loss of o§ce will be approached are set out below:
Policy
Payment in lieu of notice Payments to executive directors upon termination of their service contracts will be equal  
to 12 months base salary or the highest annual rate earned by the executive during the 
preceding three years, whichever is higher (plus beneﬁts in kind and pension contributions 
at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee). 
Annual Bonus This will be at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee on an individual basis and  
the decision as to whether or not to award a bonus in full or in part will be dependent upon 
a number of factors, including the circumstances of the individual’s departure and their 
contribution to the business during the bonus period in question. Any bonus amounts paid 
will typically be pro-rated for time in service to termination and will, subject to performance, 
be paid at the usual time.
LTIP The extent to which any award under the LTIP will vest would be determined based on  
the leaver provisions contained within the LTIP rules. The Remuneration Committee shall 
determine when awards vest in accordance with those provisions. 
Awards will normally lapse if the participant leaves employment before vesting. However, 
awards may vest in “good leaver” circumstances, including death, disability, ill-health, injury, 
sale of the participant’s employer, or any other reason determined by the Remuneration 
Committee. Any “good leaver” awards will vest at the date of cessation of employment 
unless the Remuneration Committee decides they should vest at the normal vesting date.  
In either case, the extent to which an award vests will be determined by the Remuneration 
Committee taking into account the extent to which the performance conditions have been 
satisﬁed and, unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, the period of  
time that has elapsed from the date of grant to the date of cessation of employment. The 
Remuneration Committee may vest the award on any other basis if it believes there are 
exceptional circumstances which warrant that.
Options are exercisable for six months from leaving employment or six months from the 
normal vesting date as appropriate.
Change of control Awards under the LTIP will generally vest early on a takeover, merger or other corporate 
reorganisation. The Remuneration Committee will determine the level of vesting taking 
account of performance conditions and, unless the Remuneration Committee determines 
otherwise, pro-rating for time, where applicable. Alternatively, participants may be allowed  
or required to exchange their awards for awards over shares in the acquiring company.
Awards under all employee share schemes will be expected to vest on a change of control 
and those which have to meet speciﬁc requirements to beneﬁt from permitted tax beneﬁts 
will vest in accordance with those requirements.
Mitigation The executive directors’ service contracts do not provide for any reduction in payments for 
mitigation or for early payment. 
Other payments Payments may be made under the Company’s all employee share plans which are governed 
by HMRC tax-advantaged plan rules and which cover certain leaver provisions. There is no 
discretionary treatment of leavers under these plans. In appropriate circumstances, 
payments may also be made in respect of accrued holiday, outplacement and legal fees. 
Where a buy-out award is made under the Listing Rules then the leaver provisions would be determined at the time of the award. 63
A.G. BARR p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Accounts Strategic Report Corporate Governance
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make additional exit payments where such payments are made in good  
faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation) or by way of settlement 
or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of a director’s o§ce or employment. In doing so, the 
Remuneration Committee will recognise and balance the interests of shareholders and the departing executive director, as  
well as the interests of the remaining directors. 
Where the Remuneration Committee retains discretion it will be used to provide ﬂexibility in certain situations, taking into 
account the particular circumstances of the director’s departure and performance.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
The Remuneration Committee generally considers pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Company when 
considering the executive directors’ remuneration. When considering base salary increases, the Remuneration Committee 
reviews overall levels of base pay increases oŽered to other employees. Employees are not actively consulted on directors’ 
remuneration. The Company has regular contact with union bodies on matters of pay and remuneration for employees covered 
by collective bargaining or consultation arrangements. 
Existing contractual arrangements
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of o§ce outside 
the policy in this report:
 – where the terms of the payment were agreed before the policy came into eŽect;
 – where the terms of the payment were agreed at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, 
in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the payment was not in consideration of the individual becoming a director 
of the Company; or
 – to satisfy contractual commitments under legacy remuneration arrangements. 
For these purposes, the term “payments” includes the satisfaction of awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an 
award over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted. 
The Remuneration Committee may make minor changes to this policy which do not have a material advantage to directors,  
to aid in its operation or implementation, taking into account the interests of shareholders but without the need to seek 
shareholder approval. 
Statement of consideration of shareholder views
The Remuneration Committee is committed to an ongoing dialogue with shareholders and welcomes feedback on executive 
and non-executive directors’ remuneration.
Shareholder guidelines
In order to further align the executive directors’ long term interests with those of shareholders, the Remuneration Committee 
has updated its share ownership guidelines applicable from 2017/18. The guidelines require that, with eŽect from 2017/18, 
executive directors retain all shares acquired under Company sponsored share plans and retain half of any bonus pay-out after 
tax to purchase shares in the Company until the value of their shareholding is equal to 125% of gross basic salary. Until this 
shareholding is acquired, the executive directors may not, without Remuneration Committee approval, sell shares other than  
to ﬁnance any tax liabilities arising from the vesting of LTIP awards.
Payments in relation to existing remuneration arrangements
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and/or payments for loss of o§ce 
(including exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such payments) notwithstanding that they are not in  
line with the Remuneration Policy set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed: 
i. before the date of the 2014 AGM (the date the Company’s ﬁrst shareholder-approved Remuneration Policy came into eŽect);
ii. after the date of the 2014 AGM and before the Remuneration Policy set out above came into eŽect, provided that the terms 
of the payment were consistent with the shareholder-approved Remuneration Policy in force at the time they were agreed; or
iii. at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Remuneration 
Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a director of the Company. 
For these purposes “payments” includes the Remuneration Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in 
relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are “agreed” at the time the award is granted. 64

The ﬁgures in the single ﬁgure table above are derived from the following:
(a) Salary and fees The amount of salary/fees received in the year. A salary sacriﬁce arrangement is operated by  
the Company. Employees who join this arrangement no longer pay contributions to the pension 
schemes but receive a lower taxable salary. Directors’ salaries are shown gross of salary sacriﬁce 
pension contributions. 
(b) Beneﬁts The value of beneﬁts received in the year. These include car allowance, fuel beneﬁt, the value  
of SAYE options vesting in the year, and AESOP free and matching shares awarded in the year.
SAYE: option shares are valued at the market price of the option shares at the date of vesting less 
the option exercise price.
AESOP: free and matching shares are valued at market value at the date of award.
Details of the executive directors’ interests in the SAYE are set out on page 76.
(c) Bonus A description of the annual bonus in respect of the year and Group performance against which the 
bonus pay-out was determined is provided on page 67.
(d) Long term incentives The value of LTIP awards that vest in respect of the year. 
LTIP: the shares which will vest in respect of the year have been valued based on the average 
market value of the shares over the three month period ended 28 January 2017. The value  
of the shares which vested in respect of the prior year was the market value of the shares  
on the vesting date.
Details of the executive directors’ interests in the LTIP are set out on page 75.
(e) Pension The pension ﬁgure includes:
 – for individuals in the A.G. BARR p.l.c. (2008) Pension and Life Assurance Scheme (the 
“Scheme”) deﬁned contribution section, the Company’s contributions to the deﬁned 
contribution section, excluding any pension contributions made in respect of an individual 
under the Company’s salary sacriﬁce arrangement;
 – for individuals in the Scheme’s deﬁned beneﬁt section, the additional value achieved in the year 
calculated using the HMRC method (using a multiplier of 20); and
 – the value of the accrued liability for the year in respect of the Company’s contribution for each 
director participating in the URBS.
Further details of pension beneﬁts are set out on pages 69 to 71.

Annual bonus
The maximum annual bonus award opportunity for each executive director in respect of the year ended 28 January 2017  
was 100% of salary, with 80% of the bonus assessed against the achievement of proﬁt before tax, excluding exceptional items, 
compared against a set of proﬁt targets including a threshold and maximum level, and 20% based on non-ﬁnancial strategic 
measures. The executive directors earned a total of £241,000 as annual bonus for the year, representing 23% of R.A. White’s  
and S. Lorimer’s salary and 18% of J.D. Kemp’s and A.L. Memmott’s salary.
The target for the proportion of the annual bonus based on proﬁt before tax and performance against that target is set out  
in the table below. 50% of this element of the bonus could be earned for on-target performance with zero paid for threshold 
performance and a linear scale through to full payment of this element of the bonus for performance at or above the  
maximum target.

Non-ﬁnancial strategic measure targets were set around the Company’s key areas of strategic focus. For R.A. White, these 
targets focused on business reaction to the Soft Drinks Industry Levy, brand innovation and distribution, plus leading the 
signiﬁcant change programmes in the year. Following strong progress across these targets, the Remuneration Committee 
considered it appropriate to pay a bonus equal to 15% of salary to R.A. White. For the other executive directors, their non-
ﬁnancial strategic measure targets focused on areas including optimisation of the new Business Process Redesign systems 
launched in the second half of 2015, brand innovation, enhanced operational eŽectiveness, improved supply chain e§ciency 
and further development of the Group’s governance and reporting processes. The Remuneration Committee assessed progress 
against the strategic targets for each of the other executive directors and considered it appropriate to pay a bonus of 15% of 
salary to S. Lorimer and 10% of salary to J.D. Kemp and A.L. Memmott.
Annual bonus for 2017/18
For the 2017/18 ﬁnancial year, an element of the annual bonus (20% of basic salary) will continue to be assessed against 
strategic measures to align the reward structure with key strategic priorities and to encourage behaviours which facilitate 
proﬁtable growth and the future development of the business. The remainder of the annual bonus will continue to be assessed 
against growth in Group proﬁt before tax. Performance targets will be set at challenging levels in a similar manner to those  
of previous years, with 50% of this element of the annual bonus being earned for on-target performance. The actual 
performance targets are not disclosed as they are considered to be commercially sensitive at this time and should therefore 
remain conﬁdential to the Company. The Remuneration Committee will continue to disclose how the bonus earned relates to 
performance against the targets on a retrospective basis. No changes are proposed to the maximum annual bonus opportunity 
which will remain at 100% of salary.

closing share price is known when the incentive vests in June 2017. 
‡ With the exception of S. Lorimer, executive directors were granted ESOS awards in the form of market value options under the HMRC 
tax-e§cient section of the ESOS. These ESOS awards were subject to the same performance measures as the LTIP awards and therefore 
1,914 of the 4,784 ESOS awards granted will vest for each of the executive directors. If the ESOS awards are exercised at a gain then the LTIP 
awards will be scaled back to the same value to ensure that the total pre-tax value delivered to participants remains unchanged.

maximum award will vest for achieving threshold performance and 100% of the maximum award will vest for achieving 
maximum performance. There will be straight-line vesting between the points and no vesting below threshold performance.
The EPS targets for these LTIP awards are still to be determined given ongoing assessment of the anticipated impact of the new 
Soft Drinks Industry Levy which will inﬂuence EPS during the vesting period. Details of the LTIP awards and the EPS targets will 
be disclosed at the time the LTIP awards are granted and in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.
Awards made to the executive directors in 2017 will be subject to a maximum of 125% of salary. 
Total pension entitlements – audited information
Executive directors are all members of the A.G. BARR p.l.c. (2008) Pension and Life Assurance Scheme (the “Scheme”).  
The Scheme has a deﬁned beneﬁt section and a deﬁned contribution section. The deﬁned beneﬁt section was closed to  
new entrants from 14 August 2003 and to future accrual from 1 May 2016. R.A. White and A.L. Memmott are members of the  
deﬁned beneﬁt section. 
Company contributions (which exclude any pension contributions made in respect of an individual under the Company’s salary 
sacriﬁce arrangement) are detailed in the following table:

The URBS is the A.G. BARR p.l.c. Unfunded Retirement Beneﬁt Scheme for executive directors. Please see below for further details.
Details of the entitlements accruing to the two directors who are deferred members of the deﬁned beneﬁt section are detailed 
in the table below:
Accrued 
pension at 
28 January 2017 
£000
Normal 
Retirement Age
R.A. White 68 63*
A.L. Memmott 46 63*
* The normal retirement age speciﬁed in the Scheme rules for R.A. White and A.L. Memmott is age 63, however both are also entitled under 
the Scheme rules to retire at age 60 without an actuarial reduction to their pension beneﬁts and without any consent required. 
Early retirement can be taken at age 55 subject to Company consent. The accrued pension would be reduced relative to age 60 
to take account of its early payment. 
R.A. White ceased his accrual under the deﬁned beneﬁt plan on 5 April 2011. Under the terms of his service contract, R.A. White 
is entitled to re-valuation of his deferred beneﬁts in line with RPI until his normal retirement date. The rules of the Scheme 
provide for revaluation increases in deferment in line with CPI. R.A. White elected for Fixed Protection 2012 to protect his 
beneﬁts accrued under the Scheme. To enable R.A. White to continue to beneﬁt from Fixed Protection 2012, his deferred 
beneﬁts are revalued in line with CPI and, to the extent that RPI exceeds CPI in any year, a corresponding additional contribution 
is made to his URBS. In the year ended 28 January 2017 this has resulted in an additional accrual of £14,680 being included in 
R.A. White’s URBS for that year and forms part of the £130,000 URBS ﬁgure included in the pension table above. In addition, 
R.A. White will continue to be entitled to receive life assurance beneﬁts as if he were in pensionable service under the Scheme 
until his normal retirement date notwithstanding the termination of his employment with the Company, but only in 
circumstances where he is a “good leaver”. A.L. Memmott ceased his accrual under the deﬁned beneﬁt plan on 1 March 2008.  
His accrued beneﬁts retain a link to his ﬁnal pensionable salary. 
Dependants of the executive directors are eligible for dependants’ pensions and the payment of a lump sum in the event of 
death in service. Where the Scheme provides a pension on a deﬁned beneﬁt basis, ﬁnal pensionable salary is used to determine 
the director’s pension entitlement. Where beneﬁts are provided on a deﬁned contribution basis, the beneﬁts depend on the 
director’s accumulated fund. Lump sum life assurance cover is provided at four or eight times pensionable salary dependent 
upon the date of joining the Scheme.

During the year ended 28 January 2017, R.A. White, J.D. Kemp, A.L. Memmott and S. Lorimer participated in the A.G. BARR 
p.l.c. Unfunded Retirement Beneﬁt Scheme (“URBS”) with the agreement of the Company. The URBS was approved by the 
Remuneration Committee and is an unfunded employer ﬁnanced retirement beneﬁts scheme. It was established to satisfy  
the Company’s contractual obligations to provide retirement beneﬁts for the beneﬁt of the executive directors. 
The maximum Company contribution under the URBS in respect of R.A. White is 26% of his salary. 
The maximum combined Company contribution under the deﬁned contribution section of the Scheme and the URBS in respect 
of the remaining executive directors is 19% of salary or 26% of salary following the executive’s 50th birthday.
The URBS ﬁgure for the directors represents a Company contribution only.
An accrued liability of £1,317,323 (2015/16: £982,272) is included in the closing balance sheet for the URBS. The liability has been 
accrued in respect of the directors as follows:

The Remuneration Committee has updated its share ownership guidelines applicable from 2017/18 and these are disclosed  
in the Remuneration Policy on page 63. Prior to 2017/18, executive directors were required to retain all shares acquired under 
Company sponsored share plans until the value of their shareholding is equal to 100% of gross basic salary. At the year end,  
R.A. White, J.D. Kemp and A.L. Memmott met the 100% of gross basic salary requirement applicable for the year ended 
28 January 2017. S. Lorimer was appointed to the Board on 5 January 2015 and is to build up a shareholding equal to 100%

The following directors were members of the Remuneration Committee during the year: D.J. Ritchie (Chairman), W.R.G. Barr, 
M.A. Gri§ths, J.R. Nicolson and P. Powell.
The Remuneration Committee meets at least twice a year and is responsible for determining, within agreed terms of reference,

to the Board. 
During the year, the Remuneration Committee received advice from R.A. White (CEO) in respect of the remuneration of the 
other executive directors, who was not in attendance when his own remuneration was being discussed. The Remuneration 
Committee received assistance from J.A. Barr (Company Secretary), who acts as secretary to the Committee, and from other 
members of management, who may attend meetings by invitation, except when matters relating to their own remuneration are 
being discussed.

A.G. BARR p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and parent Company ﬁnancial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and parent Company ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year.  
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the  
EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent Company ﬁnancial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the directors must not approve the ﬁnancial statements unless they are satisﬁed that they give a true  
and fair view of the state of aŽairs of the Group and parent Company and of the consolidated proﬁt or loss for that period.  
In preparing each of the Group and parent Company ﬁnancial statements, the directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 – make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 – state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
 – prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group  
and the parent Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are su§cient to show and explain the parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the parent Company and 
enable them to ensure that its ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the parent Company and the Group and to prevent 
and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
A copy of the Group and parent Company ﬁnancial statements has been placed on the Company’s website, www.agbarr.co.uk. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may diŽer from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ statement pursuant to the disclosure and transparency rules
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are set out on pages 36 to 37 of this report, conﬁrm that, to the best  
of their knowledge:
 – the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities and ﬁnancial position of the Group and parent Company and of the consolidated proﬁt;
 – the Annual Report and Accounts includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description  
of the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group; and
 – they consider the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of A.G. BARR p.l.c. for the year ended 28 January 2017 set out on pages 81 to 128.  
In our opinion: 
 – the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 
28 January 2017 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended; 
 – the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
 – the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU  
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
 – the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and,  
as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2 Overview
Audit coverage:
100% of pbt before exceptionals
A summary of our approach:
 – Our audit covered 100% of the Group’s total revenue, profit before tax and total assets and 
was completed at Cumbernauld and in London.
Materiality:
3% pbt (before exceptionals)
 – Overall group materiality: £1.4m which represents 3% of profit before tax before exceptionals 
this year.
Signiﬁcant areas:
inventory and brand 
support accruals
 – The accounting for the brand support accruals is a judgemental area. 
 – Inventory is significant and raw materials are subject to price volatility so that is also a 
judgemental area.
 – There is no movement in the risk direction in either of these areas year on year. There has 
been no change in our assessment of significant risks year on year.
3 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect 
on our audit were as follows (unchanged from 2016):
The area of focus Our approach
Brand support discounts and costs accrual (£14.7 million,  
2016: £13.0 million): 
Refer to page 49 (Audit Committee Report), pages 88 and 94 
(accounting policy) and page 115 (financial disclosures) 
Risk direction:
(unchanged)
The group agrees sales discounts and other payments with 
certain of its customers and incurs costs in supporting and 
developing its brands. Accounting for such sales discounts  
and costs is judgmental where promotion and brand support 
campaigns either span the year end (where settlement has not 
been fully and finally agreed by the year end) or where prior 
year claims arise, as the year end accrual can depend on 
information not yet made available by the customer.
Our procedures in relation to accounting for brand  
support discounts and costs included testing the group’s 
authorisation controls over such discounts and costs and 
inspecting the detail of such discounts and costs. In addition 
we agreed samples of specific items within accruals at  
the year end to supporting documentation to assess the 
accuracy of brand support discounts and costs and to ensure 
they are reflected in the correct period; we agreed a sample 
of post year end claims relating to the period prior to the year 
end to accruals at the year end, to give us comfort over the 
completeness of the year end accrual; and we considered  
and challenged the judgements formed by management  
in relation to any prior year claims from customers that 
remained within accruals at the year end or claims prior to 
the year end where there may not be an accrual for costs. 79
A.G. BARR p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Accounts Strategic Report Corporate Governance
The area of focus Our approach
Valuation of inventories (£17.3 million): (2016: £15.6 million)
Refer to page 49 (Audit Committee Report), pages 92 and 94 
(accounting policy) and page 111 (financial disclosures)
Risk direction:
(unchanged)
Inventory is a significant balance and the group’s main raw 
materials are commodities which are subject to price volatility. 
As the group uses a standard cost as its basis of inventory 
valuation, changes in price and production levels lead to 
purchase price or manufacturing variances which, if not 
accounted for correctly, may lead to the valuation of 
inventories being misstated.
In this area, our procedures included testing of the controls in 
relation to purchases, comparing the valuation of inventories 
for a sample of items to supporting documentation (e.g., 
purchase invoices) and considering for reasonableness (by 
reference to historical data and commodity price movements) 
the variances arising from the group’s standard costing system 
and challenging management’s calculations as appropriate. 
In addition our procedures included testing whether the 
standard costs which form the basis of the inventory valuation 
were set appropriately (e.g., by comparing standard costs 
back to supporting purchase invoices and other supporting 
costings) and reflected normal production levels, having been 
adjusted appropriately for any capacity underutilisation; and 
agreeing the calculation of overheads absorbed into inventory 
to supporting analyses of production costs incurred during 
the time of production of year-end inventory. 
4 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
Materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was set at £1.4m (2016: £1.4m). Materiality is determined with reference to 
a benchmark of group profit before tax, normalised to exclude exceptional items. Materiality this year is based on profit before tax, 
normalized to exclude exceptional items, of £43.1 million, of which it represents 3% (2016: 3% of profit before tax). We have chosen 
profit before tax excluding exceptional items because it removes the non-recurring distorting impact of exceptional items.
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected misstatements identified exceeding £250,000 (2016: 
£250,000), in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. This level was selected 
and agreed with the Audit Committee as, given the nature and scale of operations, adjustments under this level were not deemed 
to be of specific interest to them. 
Audits for group reporting purposes were performed for all three components by the group audit team in Cumbernauld and in 
London. These audits covered 100% of group turnover, profit before tax and total assets. The audits performed for group reporting 
purposes were all performed to materiality levels set individually for each component and ranged from £10,000 to £1.1 million.

5 Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified 
In our opinion:
 – the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
 – the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year is consistent with the  
financial statements. 80

5 Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified continued
Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the course of the audit of the financial statements and from reading the 
Strategic report and the Directors’ report:
 – we have not identified material misstatements in those reports; and 
 – in our opinion, those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
6 We have nothing to report on the disclosures of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
 – the directors’ statement of risk factors that could affect financial performance on pages 31 to 34, concerning the principal 
risks, their management, and, based on that, the directors’ assessment and expectations of the group’s continuing in 
operation over the three years to 2020; or 
 – the disclosures in note 31 of the financial statements concerning the use of the going concern basis of accounting. 
7 We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have 
identified other information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the 
financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
 – we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy; or
 – the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
 – the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
 – certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
 – the directors’ statements, set out on pages 35 and 42, in relation to going concern and longer-term viability; and 
 – the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 43 to 47 relating to the company’s compliance with the eleven 
provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities. 
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 77, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. A description of the scope of an 
audit of financial statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This 
report is made solely to the company’s members as a body and is subject to important explanations and disclaimers regarding our 
responsibilities, published on our website at www.kpmg.com/uk/auditscopeukco2014a, which are incorporated into this report as 
if set out in full and should be read to provide an understanding of the purpose of this report, the work we have undertaken and 
the basis of our opinions.

1. Accounting policies
General information
A.G. BARR p.l.c. (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (together “the Group”) manufacture, distribute and sell soft drinks. 
The Group has manufacturing sites in the UK and sells mainly to customers in the UK with some international sales.
The Company is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated and domiciled  
in Scotland. The address of its registered office is Westfield House, 4 Mollins Road, Cumbernauld, G68 9HD.
The financial year represents the 52 weeks ended 28 January 2017 (prior financial year 53 weeks ended 30 January 2016).
Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. 
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated and parent Company financial statements of A.G. BARR p.l.c. have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union. They have been prepared under the 
historical cost accounting rules except for the derivative financial instruments and the assets of the Group pension scheme 
which are stated at fair value and the liabilities of the Group pension scheme which are valued using the projected unit credit 
method. The directors have adopted the going concern basis in preparing these accounts for the reasons set out in note 31.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving 
a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated 
financial statements are disclosed on page 94.
The directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under s408 of the Companies Act 2006 and have not presented 
an income statement for the Company.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
(a) New and amended standards adopted by the Group
The following revised IFRSs have been adopted in this consolidated financial information. The application of these revised IFRSs 
has not had any material impact on the amounts reported for the current and prior periods. 
 – Disclosure Initiative – Amendments to IAS 1
 – Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation (Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38)
 – Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012–2014 Cycle – IFRS 5, IFRS 7, IAS 19 and IAS 34
(b) New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 31 January 2016 
and not adopted early
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for future year ends, and have not 
been applied in preparing these financial statements. These standards and amendments are listed in the table below. Note this 
list is limited to those standards which are expected to impact the Group.

Changes in accounting policy and disclosures continued
(b) New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 31 January 2016 
and not adopted early continued
It is expected that IFRS 16 will materially affect the consolidated financial statements. As at the reporting date, the Group  
has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of £9.8m (refer to note 25), the vast majority of which relate to production 
equipment held at the Milton Keynes facility. Management have performed an analysis of these leases to assess the expected 
impact of IFRS 16. If IFRS 16 was implemented in the year to 28 January 2017, its effect would be to increase the net book value  
of property, plant and equipment by £9.6m, with a corresponding finance lease liability of £11.2m. The net impact on the income 
statement for the year ended 28 January 2017 would be immaterial. To date, £6.6m of operating lease rentals have been 
recognised in respect of the assessed leases. Under IFRS 16, £5.8m of depreciation would have been charged, plus a further 
£1.7m of interest charges. 
Consolidation – subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. The Company controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date over which control 
commences until the date on which control ceases.
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition 
of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the 
equity interests issued by the Group (and for acquisitions prior to 1 July 2009 costs directly attributable to the acquisition). 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at 
their fair values at the acquisition date. Currently, there are no non-controlling interests in any of the entities within the Group.
Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the fair value of non-controlling 
interest over the net identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the 
net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised as a credit in profit or loss.
Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Profits 
and losses resulting from intercompany transactions that are recognised in net assets are also eliminated. Accounting policies  
of subsidiaries are consistent with those adopted by the Group.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is the net invoiced sales value, after deducting promotional sales related discounts invoiced by customers, including 
brand support costs, and exclusive of value added tax of goods and services supplied to external customers during the year. 
Brand support costs are investments in customer promotional activities. Sales are recorded based on the price specified in the 
sales invoices, net of any agreed discounts and rebates.
Revenue is recognised when the goods have passed to the buyer and the amount can be measured reliably. Sales related 
discounts and rebates are calculated based on the expected amounts necessary to meet the claims of the Group’s customers  
in respect of these discounts and rebates. Brand support accruals are included in the statement of financial position in respect 
of these.
Segment reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues  
and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components  
and for which discrete financial information is available. Segment results that are reported to the management committee  
(as chief operating decision maker) include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those which can be allocated  
on a consistent basis.
Foreign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Functional and presentation currency items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured 
using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). The consolidated 
financial statements are presented in £ Sterling which is the Company’s functional and the Group’s presentation currency. 89
A.G. BARR p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Accounts Strategic Report Corporate Governance
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates  
of the transactions or valuation where items are remeasured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement 
of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement in the same line in which the transaction is recorded.
Exceptional items
As permitted by IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements, an item is treated as exceptional if it is considered unusual by its nature 
and scale and is of such significance that separate disclosure is required for the financial statements to be properly understood.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net 
identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included  
in intangible assets. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment charges. 
Impairment charges on goodwill are not reversed. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment 
testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit 
from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside of goodwill if the asset is separable or 
arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Brands
Separately acquired brands are recognised at cost at the date of purchase. Brands acquired in a business combination are 
recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Brands acquired separately or through a business combination are assessed at 
the date of acquisition as to whether they have an indefinite life. The assessment includes whether the brand name will continue 
to trade, and the expected lifetime of the brand. All brands acquired to date have been assessed as having an indefinite life  
as they are expected to continue to contribute to the long term future of the Group. The brands are reviewed annually for 
impairment, being carried at cost less accumulated impairment charges.
The fair value of a brand at the date of acquisition is based on the Relief from Royalties method, which is a valuation model 
based on discounted cash flows.
Customer relationships
Customer relationships acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. The customer 
relationships have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the 
straight-line method over the expected life of the customer relationship.
The closing balance in the current year represents the carrying value of the customer relationships acquired during the 
acquisitions of Groupe Rubicon Limited and Funkin Limited.
The fair value of the customer relationships at the acquisition date was based on the Multiple Excess Earnings Method (“MEEM”) 
which is a valuation model based on discounted cash flows. The useful lives of customer relationships are based on the churn 
rate of the acquired portfolio and are up to 10 years corresponding to a yearly amortisation of between 10% and 33%. The useful 
lives of all intangible assets are reviewed annually and amended, as required, on a prospective basis. 
Internally generated software development costs
Internally generated software development costs comprise of internal and third party consultancy costs incurred in relation to 
the Business Process Redesign project. Amortisation is charged from the date the software is available for use. This is calculated 
using the straight-line method over the expected useful life of the software, which is 10 years. 
Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings comprise mainly factories, distribution sites and offices. All property, plant and equipment is stated at 
historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairments. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable 
to the acquisition of the assets. The purchase price of an asset will include the fair value of the consideration paid to acquire the 
asset. Borrowing costs directly attributable to acquisition, construction and or production of assets that take a substantial time 
to complete are capitalised.  90

Notes to the Accounts continued
1. Accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment continued
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when  
it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be 
measured reliably.
The carrying amount of any replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income 
statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation is charged from the date that assets, other than land, are available for use. It is calculated 
using the straight-line method to allocate the cost to the residual values of the related assets using the following rates:
Buildings – 1% 
Leasehold buildings – Term of lease 
Plant, equipment and vehicles – 10% to 33%
Computer hardware – 20%
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each year end date. The carrying value 
of the property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
recoverable amount may be less than the carrying value. 
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than 
its estimated recoverable amount.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or where no future economic benefits are expected to 
arise from the continued use of the asset. 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the net proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised 
within administration costs in the income statement.
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. The Group has two heritable properties held under operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any 
incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified 
as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased 
property and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance 
charges, are included in other long term payables. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement 
over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each 
period. The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the 
asset and the lease term.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are 
subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment charge is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing 
value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that is based on 
current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates 
have not been adjusted.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable 
cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for 
possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. 91
A.G. BARR p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Accounts Strategic Report Corporate Governance
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the 
asset’s recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised although any reversal cannot result in a carrying amount 
that would exceed the carrying amount that would have been recognised, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been 
recognised in prior years.
Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and 
cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade payables.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. A provision for impairment of trade receivables 
is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the 
original terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the 
estimated cash flows. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of a bad debt provision account and the 
amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within administration costs. When a trade receivable becomes 
uncollectable it is written off against the bad debt provision.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment in the parent Company accounts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form 
an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose 
only of the cash flow statement.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured 
at their fair value. The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement. However, 
where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item 
being hedged.
At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items,  
as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also 
documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in 
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 16. Movements on the hedging 
reserve in shareholders’ equity are shown in the statement of changes in equity. The full fair value of a hedging derivative is 
classified as non-current when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months from the statement of 
financial position date and as current when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months from the statement 
of financial position date. 92

Accounts
Notes to the Accounts continued
1. Accounting policies continued
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are 
recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement 
within administration costs.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled through the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit 
or loss. The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of forward foreign currency contracts hedging overseas purchases is 
recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement within 
administration costs. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised within the income 
statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the 
ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completing production and selling expenses.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories 
and bringing them to their primary distribution location and condition. This includes direct labour costs and an appropriate 
share of overheads based on normal operating activity.
Company shares held by employee benefit trusts
Company shares are purchased on behalf of employee benefit trusts to satisfy the liability of various employee share schemes. 
The amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a charge in equity. Purchased 
shares are classified as Company shares held by employee benefit trusts, and presented as a deduction from retained earnings.
Current and deferred income tax
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is charged in the income statement except where it relates to tax on items recognised directly in equity, in which 
case it is charged to equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at 
the year end date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided in full using the liability method, providing for temporary differences between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts, in the consolidated financial statements.
The following temporary differences are not provided for:
 – the initial recognition of goodwill; and
 – differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Where the carrying value of an asset is to be recovered through both use and subsequent disposal, a single tax base is 
attributed to that asset resulting in a single temporary difference being recognised. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates 
and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the year end date and are expected to apply when the related 
deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to 
the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Employee benefits
Retirement benefit plans
The Group operates two pension schemes as detailed in note 27. The schemes are generally funded through payments to 
trustee-administered funds. The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
Defined contribution pension plans
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Obligations 
for contributions are recognised as an expense in the income statement as they fall due. The Group has no further payment 
obligations once the contributions have been paid. 93
A.G. BARR p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Accounts Strategic Report Corporate Governance
Defined benefit pension plans
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan. Typically defined benefit plans define an amount 
of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of 
service and compensation.
The liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value  
of plan assets less the fair value of the defined benefit obligation. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by 
independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using 
interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that 
have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to 
equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs. The gain or loss 
on a settlement is the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation being settled as determined on the 
date of settlement and the settlement price, including any plan assets transferred and any payments made directly by the 
Group in connection with the settlement.
The Group’s defined benefit plan was closed to future accrual on 1 May 2016. Refer to note 27.
Share-based compensation
The Group grants equity settled share-based payments to certain employees. These are measured at fair value (excluding the 
effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at the grant date. The fair value of the equity settled share-based payment 
determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the 
shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. Fair value is measured using 
the Black-Scholes pricing model.
The Group also provides employees with the ability to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares at a discount to the current 
market value through payroll.
The Group records as an expense the fair value of the discount on the shares purchased by the employee as a charge to the 
income statement and a credit to the share options reserve.
At each year end date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non 
market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with  
a corresponding adjustment to the share options reserve.
Profit-sharing and bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for various bonuses based on formulae that take into consideration the profit 
attributable to the Company’s shareholders after certain adjustments.
The Group recognises a provision where there is a contractual obligation or where there is a past practice that has created a 
constructive obligation.
Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as the result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be 
estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan which has been 
either announced or has commenced. Future operating costs are not provided for.
Dividend distributions
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the 
period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. 94

Key judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the statement of financial position date and the amounts reported for revenues 
and expenses during the year. Due to the nature of estimation, the actual outcomes may well differ from these estimates.
The principal estimates and judgements that have a significant effect on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are 
discussed below:
Valuation of inventory judgement
Inventory is a significant balance in the consolidated statement of financial position. The Group purchases commodities for use 
in the manufacture of soft drinks and these purchases are subject to price volatility. As the Group uses standard costing to value 
its inventory, management review price variances arising from the purchases of commodities to ensure that the closing 
inventory correctly reflects the costs incurred in bringing the inventory to its current state and location. 
Carrying value of brand support accruals judgement and estimation uncertainty 
The Group incurs significant costs in the support and development of the Group’s brands. Judgement is required in determining 
the level of closing accrual required at a year end for promotions and brand support campaigns that either span two financial 
years or where the costs have not been fully settled by the year end date. This includes sales related discounts which are 
included within revenue as disclosed in the revenue recognition policy above. At 28 January 2017 the closing brand support 
accrual was £14.7m (30 January 2016: £13.0m). 
In addition the following area of judgement had an effect on the carrying value of assets and liabilities:
Retirement benefit obligations estimation uncertainty
The determination of any defined benefit pension scheme surplus/obligation is based on assumptions determined with 
independent actuarial advice. The assumptions used include discount rate, inflation, pension increases, salary increases, the 
expected return on scheme assets and mortality assumptions. 
2.  Segment reporting
The Group’s management committee has been identified as the chief operating decision maker. The management committee 
reviews the Group’s internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources. The management committee has 
determined the operating segments based on these reports. 
The management committee considers the business from a product perspective. This has led to the operating segments 
identified in the table below: there has been no change to the segments during the year (after aggregation). The performance 
of the operating segments is assessed by reference to their gross profit before exceptional items. 
The operating segments disclosed have been aggregated by the nature of the products and the production processes that they 
share in addition to similar long-term average gross margins for the operating segments.

“Other” segments represent income from the sale of Funkin cocktail solutions, the sale of ice cream and other soft drink 
related items.
The gross profit from the segment reporting is stated before exceptional costs. There are no exceptional costs included within 
gross profit for either year presented.
The gross profit from the segment reporting is reconciled to the total profit before income tax, as shown in the consolidated 
income statement.

During the period, £0.4m of acquisition fees were incurred in relation to an unsuccessful acquisition. These costs included 
advisory and legal fees.
£0.5m of advisory costs have been incurred as part of a strategic review of the market threats posed by new and emerging 
digital trading models.
£0.6m of redundancy costs have been incurred, arising from a reorganisation of direct sales routes that was completed in the 
six months ended 30 July 2016. A further £2.7m of redundancy costs were incurred in the six months ended 28 January 2017, 
following the announcement of a Company restructuring in September 2016. 98

Following the announcement of the business restructuring and reorganisation, a further £0.6m of costs were incurred, being 
mainly recruitment costs, accrual for unpaid holiday entitlement, business development consultancy fees, legal fees and 
termination costs for employee vehicles and mobile phone contracts.
The Group’s defined benefit pension scheme closed to future accrual in May 2016. This resulted in a £7.0m curtailment gain. 
Offsetting the curtailment gain is a further £1.5m of costs incurred in relation to the closure of the defined benefit pension 
scheme. This includes the cost of £1.3m past service cost for one year’s additional service negotiated with the active members 
of the scheme and £0.2m of further costs relating to the closure of the scheme to future accrual.

The weighted average tax rate was 17.4% (2016: 17.1%).
The Chancellor announced in his Autumn Budget on 23 November 2016 that the main rate of corporation tax will be reduced to 
19% from 1 April 2017 and 17% from 1 April 2020 and the future charges will reduce accordingly. Finance No.2 Bill 2016 became 
substantively enacted on 23 November 2016. The deferred tax liability at 28 January 2017 has therefore been calculated having 
regard to the rate of 17% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
10 .  Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share have been calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to equity holders of the parent by the 
weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding shares held by the employee share scheme trusts.
2017 2016
Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company (£m) 35.6 34.3
Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 115,664,757 115,714,487
Basic earnings per share (pence) 30.78 29.63
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all 
potentially dilutive ordinary shares. These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than 
the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year. The number of shares calculated as above is 
compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.
2017 2016
Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company (£m) 35.6 34.3
Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 115,664,757 115,714,487

12. Acquisition of subsidiary
On 2 February 2015, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Funkin Limited (“Funkin”), a company which offers a broad 
range of premium cocktail solutions including fruit purées, cocktail mixers and syrups.
Consideration transferred
The following table summarises the acquisition-date fair value of each major class of consideration transferred:
£m
Cash paid in the year ended 30 January 2016 17.5
Contingent consideration payable in the year ending 27 January 2018 4.5
Total consideration 22.0
Contingent consideration
The Group has agreed to pay the former owners of Funkin a contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain 
financial targets by Funkin in the two years ending 28 January 2017.
The fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement of £4.5m was estimated by assessing the expected growth  
of Funkin over the two years trading post acquisition. No discount rate has been applied to the fair value estimate of the 
contingent consideration due to the short time period the effect of discounting has a negligible effect on the fair value.
Management believe that Funkin has achieved the financial targets and that the contingent consideration of £4.5m will be paid 
to the former owners before 29 July 2017. This will be subject to the audit of the Funkin statutory accounts for the year ended 
31 January 2017, and completion of the necessary legal documentation relating to the acquisition. 101

The acquisitions through business combinations for the year to 30 January 2016 represent the goodwill, brands and customer 
relationships obtained in the acquisition of Funkin Limited.
Software development costs were incurred in the year to 30 January 2016, which represented internally generated software 
development costs and third party consultancy costs incurred in relation to the Business Process Redesign project. This project 
introduced a more effective, modern and robust Enterprise Resource Planning software. This project was completed during the 
year to 30 January 2016.
The opening customer relationships balance represents intangible assets recognised on the acquisition of the Strathmore Water 
business and Groupe Rubicon Limited. The amortisation charge represents the spreading of the cost over the assets’ expected 
useful lives: the Strathmore customer relationships are fully amortised. The Rubicon asset has two years remaining and the 
Funkin asset has eight years remaining.
These periods have been reviewed at the statement of financial position date and remain appropriate.
The amortisation costs for the year ended 28 January 2017 have been included in the income statement as administration costs. 102

internally generated software development costs and third party consultancy costs incurred in relation to the Business Process 
Redesign project.
At 28 January 2017, the Group and the Company had entered into contractual commitments for the acquisition of intangible 
assets amounting to £nil (2016: £nil).
Impairment tests for goodwill and brands
For impairment testing, goodwill and brands are allocated to the cash-generating unit (“CGU”) representing the lowest level at 
which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.

Total 38.6 56.8 1.0 96.4
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations. These calculations use pre-tax cash flow 
projections based on financial budgets approved by management which cover a three year period. Cash flows beyond the three 
years are extrapolated using the growth rates and other key assumptions as stated below:

Strathmore operating unit 37.3 2.25 10.25 30.2 2.25 11.00
The budgeted gross margin is based on past performance and management's expectation of market development. The 
weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports. The discount rates used 
are pre-tax.
The discount rate reflects management's estimate of pre-tax cost of capital adjusted for the specific risks impacting on each 
operating unit. The estimated pre-tax cost of capital is a benchmark for the Group provided by an independent third party.
Advertising and promotional costs are included in the analysis, using latest annual budgets for the year to 27 January 2018  
and projected costs thereafter.
Sensitivity analysis was carried out on the above calculations to review possible levels of impairment after adjusting discount 
rates. At a pre-tax rate of 15%, none of the CGUs were impaired. Whilst cash flow projections used within the impairment 
reviews are subject to inherent uncertainty, changes within reason to the key assumptions applied in assessing the value  
in use calculation would not result in a change in the impairment conclusions reached. 104

15. Pension prepayment
The Company established the A.G. BARR p.l.c. (2008) Scottish Limited Partnership (“the Partnership”) in the year to 26 January 
2014 and through the Partnership has entered into a long term pension funding arrangement with the A.G. BARR p.l.c. (2008) 
Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.

Non-current 17.9 18.3

Prepayment of pension contributions 19.1 19.5
The element of the prepayment classified as current is included within the prepayments figure of £4.1m (2016: £3.8m), as set out 
in note 20.
The Partnership is controlled by A.G. BARR p.l.c. and its results are consolidated by the Group.
A “structured entity” is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding 
who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate only to administrative tasks and the relevant activities are directed 
by means of contractual arrangements. As outlined in note 27, during a prior year, certain freehold properties were transferred 
to a limited partnership (a structured entity) established by the Group the main purpose of which is to lease these properties to 
a Group company and, as a result, to provide the Group’s pension scheme with a distribution of the profits of the Partnership.
The distribution is subject to discretion exercisable by the Group in certain circumstances however, given that the Group has the 
ability to control the limited Partnership by making an additional contribution into the scheme, it is the view of the directors that 
the Group controls the limited Partnership and therefore it is treated as a consolidated entity.
The carrying value of the properties sold to the Partnership and leased back to the Company remain included on the Group’s 
and Company’s balance sheet and continued to be depreciated in line with the Group’s and Company’s accounting policies with 
the Group and Company retaining full operational control over these properties.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption conferred by Regulation 7 of the Partnerships (Accounts) Regulations 2008 
and has, therefore, not appended the accounts of this qualifying partnership to these financial statements. Separate accounts 
for the Partnership are not required to be, and have not been, filed at UK Companies House.
As part of the funding arrangement the Company made a one off payment to the Pension Scheme of £20.4m to allow it to 
invest in the Partnership and this is treated as a prepayment of pension contributions. Further information on the asset backed 
funding arrangement is included within note 27. As the Partnership results are consolidated within the Group results no 
prepayment is recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position. 107

Fair value hierarchy
IFRS 7 requires all financial instruments carried at fair value to be analysed under the following levels:
Level 1:  quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2:  inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly  
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is 
determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is 
available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. The fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts is 
determined using forward exchange rates at the date of the statement of financial position, with the resulting value discounted 
accordingly as relevant.
The following tables show the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities, including their levels in 
the fair value hierarchy. It does not include fair value information for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair 
value if the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

Cash and cash equivalents held by the Group have an original maturity of three months or less. The carrying amount of these 
assets approximates to their fair value.
The fair value of the current trade and other receivables and the current trade and other payables approximates to their book 
value as none of the balances are interest bearing.
For the current borrowings, the impact of discounting is not significant as the borrowings will be paid within 12 months of the 
year end date. The carrying amount approximates their fair value.
The fair value of the non-current borrowings is based on cash flows discounted using the current variable interest rate charged 
on the borrowings of 1.5%, a discount rate of 1.5% and are within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Contingent consideration
The Group has agreed to pay the former owners of Funkin a contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain 
financial targets by Funkin in the two years from the date of its acquisition by the Group. The potential undiscounted amount  
of all future payments that the Group could make under the acquisition agreement is between £nil and £4.5m.
The fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement of £4.5m was estimated by assessing the expected growth  
of Funkin over the two years trading post acquisition. No discount rate has been applied to the fair value estimate of the 
contingent consideration as due to the short time period the effect of discounting has a negligible effect on the fair value.
The Group expects to make a payment of £4.5m within 6 months of the year ended 28 January 2017 (note 12). 110

satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is possible. At that point, the amounts are considered irrecoverable and are 
written off against the trade receivable directly, with a corresponding charge being recorded in administration costs. Where 
trade receivables are past due, an assessment is made of individual customers and the outstanding balance. No provision is 
required in respect of amounts owed by subsidiary companies.
The creation and release of the trade receivables provision has been included within administration costs in the income statement.

26. Financial risk management
Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, cash flow and fair 
value interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on 
the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors. Management identifies, 
evaluates and manages financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s business units. The Board provides guidance on 
overall market risk management including use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity.
In addition, treasury matters are dealt with by the Treasury Committee. 119
A.G. BARR p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Accounts Strategic Report Corporate Governance
Market risk
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally. The Group primarily buys and sells in Sterling but does make purchases and sales 
denominated in US Dollars and Euros. Due to the hedging arrangements that have been in place for the year ended 28 January 
2017, if Sterling had weakened/strengthened by 10% against the US Dollar or Euro, with all other variables held constant, there 
would have been an immaterial effect on post-tax profit (year ended 30 January 2016: immaterial impact on post-tax profit).
The Group periodically enters into forward option contracts to purchase foreign currencies for known purchases where the 
value and volume of trading purchases is known. The Treasury Committee assesses whether hedge accounting should be 
applied for each forward option contract.
Price risk
The Group is not exposed to equity securities price risk because no such investments are held by the Group other than within 
Pension Scheme assets.
The Group purchases a wide range of commodities in the ordinary course of business. Exposure to changes in the market price 
of certain of these commodities, including sugar, plastic, aluminium and mango, is managed through the use of forward physical 
supply contracts, primarily to convert floating or indexed prices to fixed prices. The use of such contracts to hedge commodity 
exposures is governed by the Group’s risk management policies and is continually monitored by the Treasury Committee. 
Commodity derivatives also provide a way to meet customers’ pricing requirements whilst achieving a price structure 
consistent with the Group’s overall pricing strategy.
All of the Group’s commodity derivatives are treated as “own use” contracts, which are outside the scope of IAS 39, since they 
are both entered into, and continue to be held, for the purposes of the Group’s ordinary operations, and are not net settled (the 
Group takes physical delivery of the commodity concerned). “Own use” contracts do not require accounting entries until the 
commodity purchase actually crystallises.
The majority of the Group’s forward physical contracts and commodity derivatives have original maturities of less than one year. 
As all of the commodity contracts qualify for the “own use” treatment, no sensitivity analysis has been carried out. 
Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
As the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, the Group’s income and operating cash inflows are substantially 
independent of changes in market interest rates.
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings. Borrowings obtained at variable rates expose the Group to cash 
flow interest rate risk, which is partially offset by cash held at variable rates.
For the year ended 28 January 2017, if interest rates on Sterling-denominated borrowings at that date had been 0.5% higher/
lower with all other variables held constant, there would have been an immaterial change in the post-tax profit for the year  
(year ended 30 January 2016: immaterial impact).
Credit risk
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial 
institutions, as well as credit exposures to major and direct to store customers, including outstanding receivables and 
committed transactions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of “A” are accepted. If major 
customers are independently rated, these ratings are used. Otherwise, if there is no independent rating, risk control processes 
assess the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors. Individual 
risk limits are set by the management committee based on internal or external ratings. The utilisation of credit limits is regularly 
monitored. Sales to direct to store customers are largely settled in cash in order to manage credit risk from smaller, independent stores. 120

Notes to the Accounts continued
26. Financial risk management continued
Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding 
through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions. Due to the dynamic 
nature of the underlying business, the Group maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining sufficient cash reserves and the 
availability of borrowing facilities.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity reserve (which comprises undrawn borrowing facilities and cash 
and cash equivalents) on the basis of expected cash flows. This is carried out at a Group level and involves projecting forward 
cash flows and considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet excesses of expenditure relative to income.
Capital risk management
The Group defines “capital” as being net cash/(debt) plus equity.
The Group’s objective when managing capital is to maintain an appropriate capital structure to balance the needs of the Group, 
whilst operating within its bank covenants.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain  
or adjust the capital structure, the Group has a number of options available to it including modifying dividend payments to 
shareholders, returning capital to shareholders or issuing new shares. In this way, the Group balances returns to shareholders 
between long term growth and current returns whilst maintaining capital discipline in relation to investing activities and taking 
any necessary action on costs to respond to the current environment.
The Group monitors existing equity in issuance on the basis of the (net cash/(debt))/EBITDA ratio. Net cash/(debt) is calculated 
as being the net of cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing loans and borrowings. The net debt position is discussed in the 
Financial Review on pages 26 to 30. The (net cash/(debt))/EBITDA ratio enables the Group to plan its capital requirements in 
the medium term. The Group uses this measure to provide useful information to financial institutions and investors. The Group 
believes that the current (net cash/(debt))/EBITDA ratio together with existing shares in issuance provides an efficient capital 
structure and an acceptable level of financial flexibility.
For the year ended 28 January 2017, there was a net cash surplus of £9.7m (year ended 30 January 2016: net debt of £11.3m).
The Group monitors capital efficiency on the basis of the return on capital employed ratio (“ROCE”). In the financial year ended 
28 January 2017, ROCE increased to 20.2% from 18.8%.
27. Retirement benefit obligations
During the year the Company operated two pension schemes, the A.G. BARR p.l.c. (2005) Defined Contribution Scheme and 
the A.G. BARR p.l.c. (2008) Pension and Life Assurance Scheme. The latter is a funded defined benefit scheme based on final 
salary which also includes a defined contribution section for the pension provision of new executive entrants. Under the defined 
benefit scheme, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on final pensionable pay. No other post-retirement 
benefits are provided.
Defined benefit scheme: actuarial valuation
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Company and are invested in managed funds. A full valuation 
of the defined benefit scheme was conducted as at 5 April 2014 using the attained age method.
A surplus of £12.2m was determined at the valuation date.
The defined benefit scheme exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, interest rate risk and market 
investment risk.
Responsibility for governance of the plans, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, lies jointly with the 
Company and the board of trustees. The board of trustees is composed of representatives from the Company scheme members 
as set out in the plan’s rules. 121

On 1 May 2016 the A.G. BARR p.l.c. (2008) Pension and Life Assurance Scheme was closed to future accrual following a negotiated 
agreement between the Company and the board of trustees. A curtailment gain of £7.0m arose on the closure to future accrual. 
A past service cost of £1.3m has also been recognised as active members were awarded one year’s further service as part of the 
negotiated closure. Following the closure the Company incurred a further £0.2m of costs in relation to the closure of the Scheme 
to future accrual. These three items have been treated as exceptional items in the year to 28 January 2017 (note 7).
The Company made a £1.0m contribution to the scheme in May 2016 and will make a further £1.0m contribution to the scheme 
in May 2017. 122

Asset backed funding arrangement
During the year to 26 January 2014 the Company established the A.G. BARR Scottish Limited Partnership (“the Partnership”) 
and through the Partnership has entered into a long term pension funding arrangement with the Pension Scheme.
Under this arrangement certain property assets were transferred into the Partnership and are being leased back to A.G. BARR 
p.l.c under a 21 year lease agreement, generating an income stream of £1.1m per annum for the pension scheme, increasing 
annually in line with inflation.
The Partnership is controlled by A.G. BARR p.l.c. and its results are consolidated by the Group. The value of the properties 
transferred into the Partnership remains included on the Group’s and Company’s balance sheet at carrying values at the date  
of transfer with the Group and Company retaining full operational control over these properties.
At the end of the term of the relevant lease, or earlier if the Scheme becomes fully funded to the extent that the members’ 
benefits can be secured with an insurance company, the Company has the option to repurchase the properties in the 
Partnership for an agreed fixed price.

Sensitivity review
The sensitivity of the overall pension liability to changes in the weighted principle assumptions is:
Impact on overall liabilities
Change in assumption Year to 28 January 2017 Year to 30 January 2016
Discount rate Increase/decrease by 0.1% Decreases/increases liabilities by £2.3m Decreases/increases liabilities by £2.2m
Rate of inflation Increase/decrease by 0.1% Increases/decreases liabilities by £2.0m Increases/decreases liabilities by £1.5m
Life expectancy Increase/decrease by 1 year Increases/decreases liabilities by £5.6m Increases/decreases liabilities by £4.3m
Methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses
The sensitivities disclosed were calculated using approximate methods taking into account the duration of the Scheme’s 
liabilities. They have been calculated consistently with last period’s disclosures, however these change over time with financial 
conditions and assumptions.
Risks to which the Scheme exposes the Company
The nature of the Scheme exposes the Company to the risk of paying unanticipated additional contributions to the Scheme in 
times of adverse experience. The most financially significant risks are likely to be:
– Asset volatility
The Scheme’s liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields in line with the 
requirements of IAS 19R. If the Scheme assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The plan holds investments in a 
portfolio of equity and bonds which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term but provide volatility and risk 
in the short term.
The Trustees have made a number of steps to control the level of investment risk within the Scheme over the last 12 months.  
The Trustee and the Company agreed in April 2016 to purchase an annuity policy with Canada Life to cover all future pension 
payments to certain members of the Scheme. This policy was purchased at a cost of £34.7m and secures the total amount  
of future pension payments for 100 of the Scheme’s pensioner members. The Trustees will continue to review the risk exposures 
in light of the longer term objectives of the Scheme. 124
A.G. BARR p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Accounts
Notes to the Accounts continued
27. Retirement benefit obligations continued
Risks to which the Scheme exposes the Company continued
– Changes in bond yields
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities. In the event of a reduction in the corporate bond yields there 
will be an increase in the value of the Scheme’s bond holdings.
– Inflation risk
The Group pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities. The majority of the 
Scheme’s assets are either unaffected by inflation (fixed interest bonds) or loosely correlated with inflation (equities), meaning 
that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
– Life expectancy
The Scheme’s obligation is to provide benefits for the life of the members. An increase in life expectancy will result in an 
increase in the Scheme’s liabilities.
Policy for recognising gains and losses
The Company recognises actuarial gains and losses immediately, through the remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability.
Asset-liability matching strategies used by the Scheme or the Company
The Trustees’ current investment strategy, having consulted with the Company, is to invest circa 40% of the Scheme’s assets  
in a mix of equities and diversifying return seeking assets, with the balance in an annuity policy, long dated gilts and corporate 
bonds, in order to strike a balance between:
 – maximising the returns on the Scheme’s assets; and
 – minimising the risks associated with the lower than expected returns on the Scheme’s assets.
Description of funding arrangements and funding policy that affect future contributions
The Schedule of Contributions dated 9 January 2015 sets out the current contributions payable by the Company to the 
Scheme. This was revised based on the actuarial valuation performed as at 5 April 2014 to allow for the rental income stream 
from the asset backed funding arrangement effectively being a commitment which will offset the requirement for future 
deficit contributions.
Expected contributions over the next accounting period
A.G. BARR p.l.c. expects to contribute approximately £1.0m to the A.G. BARR p.l.c. (2008) Pension and Life Assurance Scheme 
in the period ending 28 January 2017, and the Scheme expects to receive further contributions of approximately £1.2m from the 
asset backed funding arrangement in which the Scheme holds an interest.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 20 years.
The expected maturity analysis of the undiscounted defined benefit pension benefit, estimated on the Scheme’s funding is 
as follows:
Less than

a purchased cost of £6.3m (2016: £8.9m).         
29. Share-based payments
As disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report the Group runs a number of share award plans and share option plans:
 – Savings Related Share Option Scheme which is open to all employees
 – LTIP and ESOS options which are granted to executive directors
 – AESOP awards that are available to all employees
Savings Related Share Option Scheme (“SAYE”)
All SAYEs outstanding at 28 January 2017 and 30 January 2016 have no performance criteria attached other than the 
requirement for the employee to remain in the employment of the Company and to continue contributing to the plan. Options 
granted under the SAYE must be exercised within six months of the relevant award vesting date.
The SAYE is open to all qualifying employees in employment at the date of inception of the scheme. Options are normally 
exercisable after five years from the date of grant. The price at which options are offered is not less than 80% of the average  
of the middle-market price of the five dealing days immediately preceding the date of invitation.
The movements in the number of share options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise prices are as follows:

None of the options listed above were exercisable at the respective year end dates. The outstanding options at the year end had 
exercise prices of £3.58 and £5.67 (2016: £2.54, £3.58 and £5.67).
The weighted average share price on the dates that options were exercised in the year to 28 January 2017 was £5.11.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of the outstanding share options at the year end is 2 years (2016: 3 years). 126

During the year, an award of shares was made to the executive directors as disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The weighted average fair value of the share awards made during the period was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation 
model. The significant inputs to the model were as follows:

Share price at date of grant 527p
Contractual life in years 3
Dividend yield 2.19%
Expected outcome of meeting performance criteria (at grant date) 50%
Fair value determined at grant date 493p
AESOP
As described in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, there are two elements to the AESOP.
The partnership share element provides that for every three shares that a participant purchases in A.G. BARR p.l.c., up to a 
maximum contribution of £150 per month, the Company will purchase one matching share. The matching shares purchased are 
held in trust in the name of the individual. There are various rules as to the period of time that the shares must be held in trust

33. Subsequent events
In February 2017 the Group entered into three revolving credit facilities over periods of 3-5 years with Royal Bank of Scotland 
plc, Bank of Scotland plc and HSBC Bank plc. These facilities provide £60m of Sterling debt facilities to 2019/20, reducing to 
£20m for the period to 2021/22.
On 1 February 2017 the Group completed on the sale of the Walthamstow distribution site. The asset was held for sale at 
28 January 2017 (refer to note 14). Total proceeds of £3.8m were received against a net book value of £1.3m, giving rise to a gain 
on sale of £2.5m, which will be recognised in the year to 27 January 2018. The Group has entered into a 3 year operating lease 
to continue to operate from the site for the short term.
The Board has approved a share repurchase programme of up to £30m, as part of the Group’s approach to capital allocation 
and under the authority to repurchase up to 10% of its own shares granted at the AGM in May 2016. This programme is 
anticipated to commence in the spring of 2017 and complete within 24 months. The AGM in May 2017 will be requested to 
approve the renewal of the authority for the Board to repurchase up to 10% of the Company’s own shares. The Directors do not 
believe that the repurchase programme will have any material impact on the Group’s ability to secure acquisition opportunities 
should these be identified. 129

Non-GAAP measures are provided because they are tracked by management to assess the Group’s operating performance and 
to inform financial, strategic and operating decisions. 
The term “underlying” has been used to improve comparability between the 52 week reporting period ended 28 January 2017 
and the 53 weeks ended 30 January 2016. In the 53 week reporting period ended 30 January 2016 the Group received non-
recurring income associated to the termination of the Orangina franchise and incurred one-off transaction fees associated to 
corporate development activities including Funkin Limited. 
The underlying figures for the 53 week reporting period ended 30 January 2016 have been adjusted for the revenue and  
profit associated to week 53 and the non-recurring Orangina franchise and one-off corporate development transaction fees.
The underlying figures for the period ended 28 January 2017 are the reported figures before exceptional items as disclosed  
in the consolidated income statement. 
Capital expenditure is a non-GAAP measure and defined as the cash purchases of property, plant and equipment as disclosed

Expansionary capex is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as the purchase of property, plant and equipment that is not  
the normal replacement of property, plant and equipment that has come to the end of its useful life. Maintenance capex is  
a non-GAAP measure and is defined as the purchase of property, plant and equipment that is the normal replacement of 
property, plant and equipment that has come to the end of its useful life. Expansionary capex and maintenance capex add 
together to the value of purchase of property, plant and equipment that appears in the consolidated cash flow statement. 
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as the net cash flow as per the cash flow statement excluding the 
movements in borrowings, expansionary capex, the net cash flow on the purchase and sale of shares by employee benefit 
trusts, dividend payments and non-cash exceptional items. 
Full year dividend per share is a non-GAAP measure calculated as the sum of all interim dividends declared during the 
reporting period plus any proposed dividend payable in respect of that reporting period.
Gross margin is a non-GAAP measure calculated by dividing gross profit by revenue. 
Market capitalisation is a non-GAAP measure and defined as the closing share price at the end of a reporting period multiplied 
by the number of issued and fully paid shares of the Company.

week and non-recurring revenue related to the terminated Orangina franchise, to provide a comparable 52 week period. 
Revenue growth is a non-GAAP measure calculated as the difference in revenue between two reporting periods divided by  
the revenue of the earlier reporting period.
ROCE is a non-GAAP measure and defined as operating profit before exceptional items as a percentage of invested capital.

Explanatory Notes
The following notes provide an explanation of the resolutions to be considered at the one hundred and thirteenth annual 
general meeting (the “AGM”) of A.G. BARR p.l.c. (the “Company”).
Resolutions 1 to 15 (inclusive) will be proposed as ordinary resolutions. This means that for each of those resolutions to be 
passed, more than half of the votes cast must be in favour of the resolution. 
Resolutions 16 and 17 will be proposed as special resolutions. This means that for each of those resolutions to be passed, at least 
three-quarters of the votes cast must be in favour of the resolution.
Resolution 1 – Receive and approve the reports and accounts
Shareholders are being asked to receive and approve the audited accounts of the Group and the Company (as audited by 
KPMG LLP) for the year ended 28 January 2017 together with the associated reports of the directors and auditor.
Resolutions 2 and 3 – Directors’ remuneration
The directors’ remuneration report is now divided into three parts: the annual statement by the chairman of the remuneration 
committee, the directors’ remuneration policy and the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
 – The annual statement by the chairman of the remuneration committee (which is set out on page 51 of this report) provides a 
summary of the directors’ remuneration policy and the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
 – The directors’ remuneration policy (which is set out on pages 52 to 63 of this report) sets out the Company’s future policy 
on directors’ remuneration. 
 – The Directors’ Remuneration Report (which is set out on pages 51 to 76 of this report) gives details of the payments and 
share awards made to the directors in connection with their and the Company’s performance during the year ended 
28 January 2017. It also details how the Company’s policy on directors’ remuneration will be operated in 2017. 
Resolution 2 invites shareholders to approve the directors’ remuneration policy. This is a binding policy and, after it takes  
effect, the directors will not be entitled to remuneration unless such remuneration is consistent with the approved policy or 
shareholders otherwise approve the remuneration. If Resolution 2 is approved, the policy will take effect from the conclusion  
of the AGM. Shareholders will be given a binding vote on the directors’ remuneration policy at least every three years.
Resolution 3 invites shareholders to approve the annual statement by the chairman of the remuneration committee and  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report (other than the directors’ remuneration policy) for the year ended 28 January 2017.  
Resolution 3 is an advisory vote and will not affect the way in which the Company’s pay policy has been implemented.  
Each year, shareholders will be given an advisory vote on the implementation of the directors’ remuneration policy in  
relation to the payments and share awards made to directors during the year under review. 
Resolution 4 – Final dividend
Shareholders are being asked to approve a final dividend of 10.87 pence per ordinary share of 4 1/6 pence for the year ended 
28 January 2017. If shareholders approve the recommended final dividend, it will be paid on 9 June 2017 to all shareholders  
on the Company’s register of members on 12 May 2017.
Resolutions 5 to 13 inclusive – Re-election of directors
The board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) complies with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
whereby all directors are subject to annual re-election. Accordingly, all directors of the Company are retiring and offering 
themselves for re-election. 
Biographical details of the directors are set out on pages 36 and 37 of this report. The Board has confirmed that, following 
formal performance evaluation, all of the directors continue to perform effectively and demonstrate commitment to their roles. 
The Board therefore unanimously recommends the proposed re-election of the directors. 
Resolution 14 – Appointment of auditor 
The Company is required to appoint an auditor at each general meeting at which accounts are presented to shareholders.

Resolution 15 – Authority to allot shares 
The directors may not allot shares in the Company unless authorised to do so by shareholders in general meeting. Sub- 
paragraph (a) of Resolution 15, if passed, will authorise the directors to allot shares having an aggregate nominal value of up  
to £1,621,788.50, representing approximately one third of the Company’s issued share capital as at 26 April 2017 (being the 
latest practicable date prior to the publication of this report). The directors have no present intention to exercise this authority.
In line with guidance issued by the Investment Association, sub-paragraph (b) of Resolution 15, if passed, will authorise the 
directors to allot additional shares in connection with a rights issue having an aggregate nominal value of up to £1,621,788.50, 
representing approximately one third of the Company’s issued share capital as at 26 April 2017 (being the latest practicable 
date prior to the publication of this report). The directors have no present intention to exercise the authority sought under 
sub-paragraph (b) of Resolution 15. However, if such authority is obtained, it will give the Company greater flexibility to allot 
additional shares for the purpose of a pre-emptive rights issue. This authority will be used when the directors consider it to be  
in the best interests of shareholders. 
The authorities sought under Resolution 15 will expire on the earlier of 27 July 2018 (being the latest date by which the Company 
must hold its annual general meeting in 2018) and the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the Company held in 2018.
Resolution 16 – Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights
If the directors wish to allot new shares for cash, the Companies Act 2006 states that the shares must be offered first to existing 
shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings. For legal, regulatory and practical reasons, it might not be possible or 
desirable for shares allotted by means of a pre-emptive offer to be offered to certain shareholders, particularly those resident 
overseas. Furthermore, it might, in some circumstances, be in the Company’s interests for the directors to be able to allot some 
shares for cash without having to offer them first to existing shareholders. To enable this to be done, shareholders’ statutory 
pre-emption rights must be disapplied. Accordingly, Resolution 16, if passed, will empower the directors to allot a limited 
number of new equity securities without shareholders’ statutory pre-emption rights applying to such allotment. The authority 
conferred by Resolution 16 would also cover the sale of treasury shares for cash.
Sub-paragraph (a) of Resolution 16 would confer authority on the directors to make any arrangements which may be necessary 
to deal with any legal, regulatory or practical problems arising on a rights issue, an open offer or any other pre-emptive offer in 
favour of ordinary shareholders, for example, by excluding certain overseas shareholders from such issue or offer.
Sub-paragraph (b) of Resolution 16 would disapply shareholders’ statutory pre-emption rights by empowering the directors to 
allot equity securities for cash on a non pre-emptive basis but only new equity securities having a maximum aggregate nominal 
value of £243,268.00, representing approximately 5% of the Company’s issued share capital as at 26 April 2017 (being the latest 
practicable date prior to the publication of this report). 
The authority sought under Resolution 16 will expire on the earlier of 27 July 2018 (being the latest date by which the Company 
must hold an annual general meeting in 2018) and the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the Company held in 2018.
Resolution 17 – Purchase of own shares
The Companies Act 2006 permits a company to purchase its own shares provided the purchase has been authorised by 
shareholders in general meeting. 
Resolution 17, if passed, would give the Company the authority to purchase any of its own issued ordinary shares at a price  
of not less than an amount equal to the nominal value of an ordinary share and not more than the higher of: (i) 5% above  
the average of the middle market quotations of the Company’s ordinary shares as derived from the London Stock Exchange  
Daily Official List for the five dealing days before any purchase is made; and (ii) the higher of the last independent trade of  
an Ordinary Share and the highest current independent bid for an Ordinary Share on the trading venue where the purchase  
is carried out. 
The authority will enable the purchase of up to a maximum of 11,676,877 ordinary shares, representing 10% of the Company’s 
issued ordinary share capital as at the date of the AGM, and will expire on the earlier of 27 July 2018 (being the latest date by 
which the Company must hold an annual general meeting in 2018) and the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the 
Company held in 2018.
On 28 March 2017, the Company announced that the Board has decided to return up to £30 million to shareholders via an 
on-market share repurchase programme. Accordingly, the directors intend to use the authority granted by this resolution to 
make market purchases of the Company’s ordinary shares under the repurchase programme. The directors will only exercise  
the authority to purchase ordinary shares where they consider that such purchases will be in the best interests of shareholders  138
A.G. BARR p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Accounts
generally and will result in an increase in earnings per ordinary share. Purchases are expected to be financed out of distributable 
profits and shares purchased will either be cancelled (and the number of shares in issue reduced accordingly) or held as 
treasury shares.
The Company operates two share option schemes under which awards may be satisfied by the allotment or transfer of ordinary 
shares to a scheme participant. However, in practice, the Company has always satisfied awards to participants by the transfer  
of ordinary shares from the trustee of each of the schemes. 
As at 1 April 2017 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this report), options had been granted over 
1,158,143 ordinary shares (the “Option Shares”) representing approximately 0.99% of the Company’s issued share capital at that 
date. If the authority to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares (as described in Resolution 17 were exercised in full, the Option 
Shares would have represented approximately 1.10% of the Company’s issued share capital as at 1 April 2017. As at 1 April 2017, 
the Company did not hold any treasury shares.

Notes
1. Attending the annual general meeting (the “AGM”) in person
 If you wish to attend the AGM in person, you should arrive at the venue for the AGM in good time to allow your attendance 
to be registered. It is advisable to have some form of identification with you as you may be asked to provide evidence of 
your identity to the Company’s registrar, Equiniti Limited (the “Registrar”), prior to being admitted to the AGM.
2. Appointment of proxies
 Members are entitled to appoint one or more proxies to exercise all or any of their rights to attend, speak and vote at  
the AGM. A proxy need not be a member of the Company but must attend the AGM to represent a member. To be validly 
appointed, a proxy must be appointed using the procedures set out in these notes and in the notes to the accompanying 
proxy form.
 If a member wishes a proxy to speak on their behalf at the AGM, the member will need to appoint their own choice of proxy 
(not the Chairman of the AGM) and give their instructions directly to them. Such an appointment can be made using the 
proxy form accompanying this notice of AGM or through CREST.
 
 Members can only appoint more than one proxy where each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different 
shares. Members cannot appoint more than one proxy to exercise the rights attached to the same share(s). If a member 
wishes to appoint more than one proxy, they should contact the Registrar at Equiniti Limited, Aspect House, Spencer Road, 
Lancing BN99 6DA.
 
 A member may instruct their proxy to abstain from voting on a particular resolution to be considered at the AGM by 
marking the “Withheld” option in relation to that particular resolution when appointing their proxy. It should be noted that 
an abstention is not a vote in law and will not be counted in the calculation of the proportion of votes “For” or “Against”  
the resolution.
 
 The appointment of a proxy will not prevent a member from attending the AGM and voting in person if he or she wishes.
 
 A person who is not a member of the Company but who has been nominated by a member to enjoy information rights  
does not have a right to appoint any proxies under the procedures set out in these notes and should read note 8 below.
3. Appointment of a proxy using a proxy form
 A proxy form for use in connection with the AGM is enclosed. To be valid, any proxy form or other instrument appointing a 
proxy, together with any power of attorney or other authority under which it is signed or a certified copy thereof, must be 
received by post or (during normal business hours only) by hand by the Registrar at Equiniti Limited, Aspect House, Spencer 
Road, Lancing BN99 6DA at least 48 hours before the time of the AGM or any adjournment of that meeting.
 
 If you do not have a proxy form and believe that you should have one, or you require additional proxy forms, please contact 
the Registrar at Equiniti Limited, Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing BN99 6DA.
4. Appointment of a proxy through CREST
 CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may  
do so by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual and by logging on to: www.euroclear.com. CREST personal 
members or other CREST sponsored members and those CREST members who have appointed (a) voting service provider(s) 
should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
 
 In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message 
(a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s 
specifications, and must contain the information required for such instruction, as described in the CREST Manual. The 
message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruction given to a 
previously appointed proxy, must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the Registrar (ID RA19) no later 
than 48 hours before the time of the AGM or any adjournment of that meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be 
taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Application Host) from which 
the Registrar is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any 
change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
  140
A.G. BARR p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Accounts
 CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) should note that Euroclear UK  
& Ireland Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular message. Normal system timings 
and limitations will, therefore, apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST 
member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member, or sponsored member, or has appointed 
(a) voting service provider(s), to procure that his/her CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as 
shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this 
regard, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting system provider(s) are referred to those 
sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
 
 The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
5. Appointment of a proxy by joint holders
 In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint one or more proxies, only the 
purported appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which 
the names of the joint holders appear in the Company’s register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first named 
being the most senior).
6. Corporate representatives
 Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives. Members can only appoint more 
than one corporate representative where each corporate representative is appointed to exercise rights attached to different 
shares. Members cannot appoint more than one corporate representative to exercise the rights attached to the same share(s).
7. Entitlement to attend and vote
 To be entitled to attend and vote at the AGM (and for the purpose of determining the votes they may cast), members must 
be registered in the Company’s register of members at 6.30 p.m. on Monday 29 May 2017 (or, if the AGM is adjourned, at 
6.30 p.m. on the day two days prior to the adjourned meeting). Any changes to the Company’s register of members after 
the relevant deadline will be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at the AGM. 
8. Nominated persons
 Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 (the 
“2006 Act”) to enjoy information rights (a “Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement between him/her and the 
member by whom he/she was nominated, have a right to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy  
for the AGM. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she may,  
under any such agreement, have a right to give instructions to the member as to the exercise of voting rights. 
9. Website giving information regarding the AGM
 Information regarding the AGM, including information required by section 311A of the 2006 Act, and a copy of this notice  
of AGM is available from www.agbarr.co.uk. 
10. Audit concerns
 Members should note that it is possible that, pursuant to requests made by members of the Company under section 527  
of the 2006 Act, the Company may be required to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (a) 
the audit of the Company’s accounts (including the auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before 
the AGM; or (b) any circumstance connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous 
meeting at which annual accounts and reports were laid in accordance with section 437 of the 2006 Act. The Company  
may not require the members requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in complying with sections 527  
or 528 of the 2006 Act. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a website under section 527 of the 2006 
Act, it must forward the statement to the Company’s auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement available

capital consisted of 116,768,778 ordinary shares of 4 1/6 pence each, carrying one vote each. As at 26 April 2017, the

12. Notification of shareholdings
 Any person holding 3% or more of the total voting rights of the Company who appoints a person other than the Chairman

13. Further questions and communication
 Under section 319A of the 2006 Act, the Company must cause to be answered any question relating to the business being 
dealt with at the AGM put by a member attending the meeting unless answering the question would interfere unduly with

of the meeting that the question be answered.
