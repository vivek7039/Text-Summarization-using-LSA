CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Financial results
Group revenue for the year ended 31 March 2017 increased by  
7 per cent. to £22.5m (2016: £21.0m) whereas Net Fee Income (“NFI”) 
improved on the prior year by 8 per cent to £6.19m (2016: £5.73m). The 
results over the past year have seen lower than expected performance 
at a Group level. The investment in staff training and development and 
the introduction of a new CRM system will enhance the results going 
forward but had a direct effect on the Group results to March 2017.
Whilst organic growth in the short to medium term will serve the 
business well for the business to meet our long-term objectives, the 
Board also continues to focus on identifying suitable businesses to 
join the Group to enhance profitability, add new service lines and 
geographies.
Strategy
Nakama Group’s strategy has continued to concentrate on providing 
staffing solutions with two highly specialised businesses: Nakama 
within the digital, creative, media, marketing and technology sectors 
and the UK business within the financial services sector. The approach 
focuses on delivering a local, regional and global solution. The business 
continues to maintain this as fundamental but will look to broaden 
the service offerings across the Group with an emphasis on providing 
digital solutions to clients across recruitment, outsourcing, on site and 
consultancy through the use of technology. It is the strategy of the 
Board and management team to be a leading international specialist 
within staffing, delivering a quality service to our customers and 
candidates whilst creating a sustainable business for the long-term 
benefit of all stakeholders.
The management team has stabilized over the past year and is now 
in a position to focus on delivering value to clients and shareholders 
going forward. We continue to look to recruit further excellent, driven 
individuals to meet our client and candidate needs.
There are currently no new offices planned for the next financial year as 
the Board intends to concentrate on improving the performance of the 
current operations.
Executives and staff
The Group retains a strong team of very knowledgeable and long 
serving staff and we look forward to continuing to build the Nakama 
Group. The Board would like to acknowledge the loyalty and 
commitment of all the staff to the Group and we are extremely grateful 
for their efforts. Again we extend a very warm welcome to all new 
members of the team.
Outlook
Trading in the first quarter has been in line with expectations. Whilst 
the market sectors in which Nakama operates are in high demand, the 
business needs stable local economies in the current trading locations, 
stability in current staff numbers and the continued hiring of new sales 
staff to deliver against less specialised but much larger competitors. 
The Board looks to 2018 as a year in which the Group will seek to grow 
organically and review other options to grow in terms of net fee income 
and profit.

Group revenue for the year ended 31 March 2017 increased by  
7 per cent. to £22.5m (2016: £21.0m) whereas Net Fee Income (“NFI”) 
improved on the prior year by 8 per cent to £6.19m (2016: £5.73m). The 
NFI percentage has increased to 27.5 per cent. (2016: 27.3 per cent). 
APAC revenue increased to £8.82M from £6.92m last year. In the same 
period revenues in the UK decreased from £14.1m to £13.7m mainly due 
to a slowdown in the contractor market.
EBITDA was £25,000 for the year (2016: £257,000) mainly as a result of 
a slowdown in the UK market and continued investment into the USA, a 
market entered into for the first time last year. Although revenue grew 
in APAC, the continued investment in training and technology meant 
that the region made a loss for the year. The region has been through a 
year of restructuring and it is now in a position to grow the bottom line 
going forward. The year-end balance sheet showed borrowings increase 
from £1.2m to £1.5m to help fund the increase in revenue. This also 
had the effect of increasing the year end trade receivables to £3.9m 
(2016:£3.4m).
There was an operating loss for the year of £211,000 (2016: profit 
of £37,000). The Directors are not recommending the payment of a 
dividend for the year but resumption of dividend payments will be kept 
under review.
The 2017 result shows that we have maintained staff levels at 80 after 
a period of attrition during the year.
Our clients need to feel confident before making a permanent or 
contract hire and political events during the last financial year, including 
Brexit and the US presidential election caused a slowdown in decision 
making in some sectors.
UK operations
UK operations continue to see existing markets come under pressure 
from in-house recruitment and externally managed service providers. 
The UK business was restructured from a service provision and 
operational standpoint in Q3 last year. Headcount remained stable but 
the business did not meet its hiring targets internally. Over the last year 
the market has become more heavily brokered and fragmented and the 
ability to generate value in traditional digital sectors has been eroded.
In response to this, Nakama London has continued to increase its 
capacity to deliver within the expanding data and analytics markets 
across both corporate and agency clients. The data and analytics service 
line is complementary and relevant to the existing client base both 
within the UK and globally. Margins and rates are healthy in this sector 
and senior level candidates and clients are suited to the consultative 
and pro-active approach to recruitment that is at the core of Nakama’s 
delivery. The business will look to grow its capabilities in this area 
whilst continuing to look at the implementation of technology to create 
efficiency and higher margins through the automation of lower  
value work.

CEO’S REPORT  
CONTINUED
The UK financial services sector experienced a tougher environment 
with Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) challenges affecting 
contract margins within the sector. Overall there has been an increase 
in permanent billings, with demand for mid and senior level hires.
The UK general insurance market saw increased competition by RPO 
companies impacting on contract delivery and margins. The focus 
for Highams is on the business analyst/product and transformation 
markets within insurance as that is where we see the growth. During 
the year there have been new technology platform programmes 
and digital distribution activity requiring specialist skills. Regulatory 
legislation in insurance, wealth management and pensions is a 
necessary requirement and demand for skills in this area has been 
steady.
APAC operations
Operating conditions across the APAC region remain similar to the 
previous year. A mix of economic environments, financial periods and 
local cultures can prove challenging. We continue to address this by 
ensuring that businesses focus on servicing high value verticals in 
their current markets. All businesses have continued to drive retained 
services and consultancy offerings relevant to their markets. We have 
a key focus on training and development so that the right skills are 
developed along with an onboarding and talent attraction programme 
to ensure that the business attracts and retains the right talent in an 
increasingly competitive market. External competition is increasing 
and it is still Nakama’s key objective to invest in and build a strong 
management team to enable us to continue to pursue a consistent 
and clear strategy in multiple markets in line with the Group’s vision.
The APAC offices have again experienced an increase in turnover. 
This has yielded a 27% increase in revenue to £8.82m compared to 
£6.92m last year. However, investment in training and technology in 
the region during the year in order to future proof the business meant 
that the region made a loss this year of £20,000 compared to a profit 
of £189,000 last year.
The economic outlook in APAC is stable and the economy is in growth 
mode. Hiring restrictions in the Australian markets due to changes in 
legislation will put pressure on salaries and attracting consultants to 
the business. It is likely to have an ongoing effect on the permanent 
hiring outlook within Australia.The digital and technology disruption is 
beneficial in the sectors Nakama provides staff to, specifically within 
analytics, data, digital and transformation. Traditional non digital 
businesses have taken or started to undertake wholesale reviews 
of where to position themselves. There has been an appetite for the 
range of human resource consultancy services that Nakama is starting 
to provide in the region and we see this as an essential differentiator 
of Nakama’s product offering going forward.
Projects are being adopted by organisations across many industries 
which are driving demand for digital skills, a high proportion of 
which are not in the local market. Clients are focusing on a customer 
first digital strategy involving service and product design, the 
strengthening of their data and “big” data and analytics functions 
and we are continuing to see clients evolve their digital customer 
acquisition strategies.
The business has seen demand from the traditional consultancies that 
are now pursuing digital strategies to compete with the traditional 
advertising networks. In the new “gig economy” talent is increasingly 
more mobile than ever before and businesses are continuing to adapt 
to having more flexible staffing solutions. This is evident in the Asian 
markets where the contracting market has started to move from low 
value, low skill to high value, high skill within our sectors.
The client base across our APAC businesses has seen the business 
become more involved with corporate clients whilst continuing to 
service the advertising and digital agency businesses.

We continue to leverage our global networks to deliver against these 
demands. We see a natural cap on the Australian market due to its 
size and location but we still feel that the market has a high level 
of growth over the next financial year, specifically around the range 
of onsite and consultancy services Nakama is providing. The Asia 
businesses have continued to add revenue despite a mixed year 
where we saw changes and challenges in the South East Asia market. 
They have also been key in the introduction of new business across 
the wider region.
Singapore focuses on the South East Asian corridor into Malaysia 
and Thailand, with Hong Kong continuing to build market share 
and experiencing high demand from China and the wider region. 
The businesses benefit from a collaborative approach to business 
development and creating opportunity throughout the region based 
on this approach. We see the growth of both these business units as 
essential to our strategy within the region.
All the APAC businesses continue to have a healthy balance of repeat 
business based on the areas of specialisation, new service lines and 
expertise within the local and increasingly global markets.
The market continues to be competitive; the businesses have seen a 
higher than expected turnover of staff this year in our South East Asia 
market and one of the Australian businesses and finding good quality 
candidates is difficult. The business has addressed this by refocusing 
its internal talent acquisition strategy and approach across all regions.
The business does benefit from having global operations and is 
focused on a sector that is in high demand, which has been beneficial 
to attracting staff from a variety of industries and locations.
The factors to success in APAC continue to remain similar to last 
year: increased competition, a highly mobile workforce that is 
increasingly looking for change, overcoming language barriers, 
restrictions on hiring staff in regions due to changes in legislation 
and financial constraints have the potential to force business costs to 
unsustainable levels and prevent businesses being able to hire.
Retaining high performing staff is critical and ensuring the business 
creates high performing staff in all regions is a key area of focus. 
The skillsets the business is looking to attract to deliver on the group 
strategy will add value to the group as a whole both regionally and 
globally. We maintain our outlook that a strong understanding of local 
and global technology, digital and consultancy markets and our ability 
to work across these from a local, regional and global perspective 
is essential in achieving the growth we seek and delivering to our 
shareholders.

STRATEGIC  
REPORT
The directors present their strategic report together with the audited 
financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017.
Business model
The Group provides recruitment services and solutions to its specialist 
niche market clients in global geographical locations where there is 
both growing demand and a skills shortage.
Recruitment services include permanent staff placements and contract 
staff placed on a fixed term assignment.
The UK is represented by two UK offices: the Nakama brand operating 
from London and the Highams brand operating from Caterham. We work 
closely together to explore opportunities to cross-sell services into our 
respective client bases.
APAC is represented by two Nakama offices in Australia, one in Hong 
Kong and an office in Singapore. We serve digital media markets across 
a broad spectrum of clients ranging from corporates to digital marketing 
agencies.
Last year we opened an office in New York in order to increase the 
global footprint of the Group.
Strategy
At Nakama, we’re in the business of people solutions & consultancy.  
And OUR VISION is to be the best people business on the planet.
OUR WHY – ultimately it’s people who transform, improve &  
grow business.
OUR HOW – Specialisation, Technology, Network – all with the  
right people.
OUR WHAT -
• Recruitment – permanent & contract
• Search
• Outsourcing & RPO
• Project Management
• Research & insights
• Consultancy - change management; people development; EVP etc.
• Software solutions / apps. – talent, payroll etc.
• Education, training & learning
We aim to target those sectors where we can secure profitable 
business and where we can differentiate ourselves from our 
competitors by providing a bespoke and specialist quality service and 
can deliver incremental value to our clients to assist them in managing 
their businesses. Our increasing ability to cross-sell our service to our 
international clients is also key to our strategic ambition to become 
“The Global Specialist Recruitment Business”.
The Group’s target market remains the same, but the scope of its 
geographical spread has expanded over the years The group is also 
keenly focused on the implementation and investment of technology 
services to create higher margins through increased efficiency across 
the group and the potential of reselling these solutions to future clients. 
A focus on core partnerships globally over the next 12 months will also 
position the business into a higher value margin market.
By sourcing candidates through our global network we can track 
specialists by using real time data. We have been able to focus our 
efforts on building Talent Communities through recommendations, 
referrals, local advertising and highly specialised peer groups. Each 
Nakama office has a local and regional talent pool, which in aggregate 
combines to create an international talent pool. We have the ability 
to build self- generating communities in this way. We have a number 
of social media channels and forums that we use to identify local 
talent looking to relocate internationally. These avenues are typically 
established in line with the specialisation for which we are recruiting, 
across local regions and via our global footprint. Linked-in, Twitter, 
Facebook and Instagram are a few of the channels we currently utilise. 
This approach gives operational staff a full view of the businesses we 
are involved with and access to global client and talent lists. As such 
we will continue to focus on hiring and developing our salesforce to 
enable them to perform in their local markets. Our vision for the long 
term is to continue building head count and gaining critical mass in our 
current markets and to expand and establish more international offices. 
By doing so we believe we will be well placed to leverage off our niche 
specialisations and our international footprint to better drive Group 
profitability.

received and profitability by consultant. Although there has been 
some attrition in the contracting market in the UK the NFI percentage 
has increased from 27.3% to 27.5% due to the increase in specialist 
permanent placements. Staff costs as a percentage of NFI has increased 
slightly as a result of an investment in training and development.

With the introduction of a new technology platform we are now more

Key financial risks of the Group
Details of the Group’s financial instruments are given in note 20 to the 
Group financial statements.
Principal risks and uncertainties of the Group
The Board continuously monitors the key risks and uncertainties that 
may impact the business and the ability to deliver our strategy. These 
are identified below:
Staff
The business has undergone a review over the past 12 months with 
a key focus on better performance and an increase in the skills of the 
staff. This has been across all regions of the business. In a service 
company it is essential to maintain client relationships and build 
new business. It is important that high quality staff are recruited and 
retained. It is however of equal importance that all staff contribute 
to the profitability of the business. The use of appropriate incentives, 
focused training and a challenging and supportive environment all work 
to this end. As opportunities grow, we offer the potential for staff to 
relocate to any of our offices and experience different cultures and to 
enhance their position in the Group. We recognise that staff retention 
is vital to our operation especially in our sector. We continue to recruit 
new staff, both experienced and non-experienced to ensure that we 
mitigate any reliance on key individuals and nurture our own sales 
consultants.
Office locations
Nakama has offices in the UK (2), Australia (2), Hong Kong, Singapore 
and New York. It is essential that we examine each of our locations for 
risks of performance and the operations management of these offices, 
ensuring we are aware of local laws and culture and can secure licences 
for the employment of our own staff and those of our placements at 
clients. We continue to recruit new staff to increase the number of 
consultants to ensure that we are not reliant on key individuals.
Competition
There are many competing recruitment organisations and Recruitment 
Process Outsourcing (RPO) companies. The changing social media 
world also creates competition, companies now having moved towards 
in-house recruitment models continue to drive down margins in sectors 
that have become more commoditised. Nakama has continued to refine 
the business focus on highly specialised digital and technology sectors 
and continue to work with internal recruiters and staffing teams as the 
specialist agency to support the specific skills needed with its speed of 
delivery. Nakama maintains and enhances its niche market approach in 
order to continue to differentiate itself from its competitors.
Competition remains robust and was previously mainly from local 
SME based businesses but we have now seen more traditional IT 
businesses compete in the digital space. Competitors are now starting 
to look closely at the markets we operate in. We have seen a small 
increase in competition which operates along some of Nakama’s 
service lines within our markets. It is also the case that we have seen 
some traditional competitors in local markets cease trading due to 
lack of scale and reach. Our ability to remain specialised within the 
digital, technology, creative and marketing industry locally and globally 
continues to provide a significant competitive advantage.
On-line recruiting/other competition
This is an increasingly competitive space and whilst we have seen new 
service offerings enter the market we have not seen much impact to 
date. We differentiate ourselves by being highly specialised, delivering 
a solution to clients’ issues globally. We have a reputation for providing 
quality on-site and embedded solutions, industry expertise and for being 
a valued partner. Not only are the local and global recruitment markets 
becoming increasingly saturated with agencies, but also internal teams 
are taking on the recruitment process. Businesses operating with a 
transactional recruitment approach of simply sending CVs to a job are 
increasingly unable to compete. The demand for speed of service, high 
quality and the delivery of niche talent is more important than ever. Both 
clients and candidates demand more and will engage with recruitment 
partners who really understand their business and requirements and 
offer a premium service.
Clients
Clients may choose not to continue to use Nakama’s services if our 
service fails to meet the required standards. It is therefore essential 
to harness technology to deliver rapid solutions. We are committed to 
ensuring the delivery of high standards and to retaining our excellent 
relationship with clients.
Candidates
Nakama’s ability to work in niche, high demand sectors has continued 
to provide a key reason for candidates to want to be represented by the 
Group. The quality of support services around payroll, job registration, 
job search and information will be a key factor to retaining and 
increasing Nakama’s talent pools globally.
Nakama continues to increase its networks and knowledge about their 
niche business and technical areas by developing a network of clients, 
contractors and applicants relevant to that niche.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ 
RESPONSIBILITIES
Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, 
Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to 
prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and the Company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law), including Financial Reporting 
Standard 101 (FRS 101) Reduced Disclosure Framework.
Under Company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or 
loss of the Group. The Directors are also required to prepare financial 
statements in accordance with rules of the London Stock Exchange for 
companies trading securities on the Alternative Investment Market.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in 
business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the annual report and 
the financial statements are made available on a website. Financial 
statements are published on the Company’s website in accordance 
with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements, which may vary from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the 
Group’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ 
responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial 
statements contained therein.

GOVERNANCE
Nakama Group AR 2017 Proof 7.indd   11 04/08/2017   10:12:26 25474.04 – 4 August 2017 10:12 AM – Proof 7
CORPORATE  
GOVERNANCE
The Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance so 
that the Company’s management procedures are transparent and clearly 
understood by those who work within the Company, and by those who 
invest in it.
The Board
The aim of the Board is to function at the head of the Company’s 
management structures, leading and controlling its activities and setting 
a strategy for enhancing shareholder value. Regular strategy meetings 
are held to review the Group’s forward planning - vital in a rapidly 
changing market and technology environment.
The Board currently consists of four executive directors and two non-
executive directors.
The non-executive directors, whilst not independent by virtue of their 
length of service, do provide an independent challenge. The Company 
does not have a Nomination Committee as such; the Board collectively 
undertakes the functions of such a committee.
The Chairman and the executive directors
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive Officer. The primary role of the Chairman is to 
ensure that the Board functions properly, meets its obligations, and has 
the correct organisation and mechanisms in place to work effectively.
The Chief Executive Officer’s primary role is to provide overall leadership 
and vision in developing, alongside the Board, the strategic direction of 
the Company.
The Chief Executive Officer is also responsible for the management 
of the overall business, ensuring strategic and business plans are 
effectively implemented and the results of which are monitored and 
reported to the Board to ensure financial and operational objectives are 
attained.
The Board has a clear understanding as to the split of responsibilities 
between them, and they meet and communicate regularly so that each 
is aware of the ideas and actions of the others.
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group 
maintains systems and internal financial controls that provide them 
with reasonable assurance regarding the financial information both for 
use within the business and for external publication, and that the assets 
are safeguarded.
Each business has defined financial performance plans that are agreed 
by the Board at the beginning of each financial year to meet Group 
objectives. These plans contain measurable performance targets which 
are continuously monitored to identify shortfalls, so that corrective 
actions can be taken.
An ongoing process has been established for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the principal risks faced by the Group. The process has been 
in place for the full year under review and up to the date of approval of 
the annual report and financial statements. The Board regularly reviews 
the process.
Audit Committee
The Board collectively undertakes the functions of the Audit Committee 
which is chaired by John Higham.
The terms of reference for the Audit Committee are to assist the 
Board in the discharge of its responsibilities for corporate governance, 
financial reporting and internal control. Its duties include maintaining 
an appropriate relationship with the Company’s auditors, keeping under 
review the scope and results of the audit and its effectiveness.
The Audit Committee has sole responsibility for assessing the 
independence of the external auditors, BDO LLP . The Committee has 
had due regard to the document published in November 2003 by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) 
“Reviewing Auditors Independence: guidance for audit committee”. 
Each year the Committee undertakes to seek reassurance that the 
external auditors are independent.
Remuneration Committee
This Committee (Remcom), which meets at least twice a year, is chaired 
by Ken Ford; the Board collectively undertakes the function of Remcom. 
The Board has adopted a set of operational rules for Remcom which will 
be available for inspection at the AGM.
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries, as disclosed in note 2, the 
Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements.

DIRECTORS’  
REMUNERATION REPORT
This report sets out the remuneration policies for the Group’s executive 
directors. It should be read in conjunction with details of directors’ 
remuneration in note 7 which forms part of the audited financial 
statements. The members of the Remuneration Committee (Remcom) 
are identified on page 12.
The members of Remcom are independent of conflicts of interest 
arising from day to day running of the business. Remcom makes 
recommendations to the Board.
Remuneration policies
Remcom recommends to the Board a framework for executive 
remuneration. Remcom determines specific packages for each executive 
director including pension rights and compensation payments.
The general philosophy underlying the Group’s remuneration policy 
for executive directors is the same as that applied to all senior 
employees in order to encourage performance. The basic components 
of remuneration are: salary and benefits, cash bonuses, share schemes 
and pensions.
Salary and benefits
Remcom studies independent reports and market trends in considering 
the level of salary and benefits. It also takes into account experience, 
responsibility and performance.
Bonuses
Bonuses may be awarded at Remcom’s discretion depending on Group 
performance and profits within the relevant business area.
Share schemes
Details of all Company share schemes appear in note 21 to the financial 
statements.
Mark de Lacy was granted options on 2,070,530 shares exercisable at 
1.25p per share pursuant to the Highams EMI Share Option Scheme. 
The vesting of 50% (2,070,530) of these options was contingent on the 
following condition; the gross profit of the Group for the year ended 
31 March 2011 exceeds the gross profit for the year ended 31 March 
2009 by 10%. The balance of the options are exercisable following the 
approval of the audited consolidated accounts of the Company for the 
financial year ended 31 March 2011. 50% of these options have now 
lapsed as the condition of increased gross profit was not met for the 
year. The options were granted by Remcom on 21 November 2008; the 
share price was 1.25p.
Mark de Lacy was granted options on 690,184 shares exercisable at 
2.75p per share pursuant to the Highams EMI Share
Option Scheme. These options are exercisable following the approval of 
the audited consolidated accounts for the financial year ending  
31 March 2012 and were granted by Remcom on 7 September 2010; the 
share price was 2.75p.
Mark de Lacy was also granted options on 345,100 shares exercisable 
at 3.00p per share pursuant to the Highams EMI Share Option Scheme. 
These options are exercisable following the approval of the audited 
consolidated accounts for the financial year ended 31 March 2013 and 
were granted by Remcom on 7 July 2011; the share price was 3.00p. 
Mark de Lacy was granted options on 500,000 shares at 1.12p granted 
by Remcom on 1st August 2013. Mark de Lacy was also granted options 
on 500,000 shares exercisable at 2.88p per share granted by Remcom 
on 31 July 2014.
Pensions
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme, the 
contributions to which are set out in note 6 to the financial statements.
Service contract of the executive directors
Rob Sheffield, Angus Watson, Mark de Lacy and Paul Goodship have 
service agreements terminable by the Company or by the executives of 
not less than six months notice.
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors receive an annual fee in respect of their 
duties. The fees are reviewed annually and are set by the Board. Their 
contracts are immediately terminable.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies of the group are set out below.
The accounting policies that have been applied in the opening statement of financial position have also been applied throughout all periods 
presented in these financial statements.
The areas where significant judgements and estimates have been made in preparing the financial statements and their effect are disclosed in 
note 3.
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. As at 31 March 2017 the Group had net assets of £1,414,000 
(2016: £1,796,000) and made a loss for the year of £352,000 (2016: loss of £70,000). In considering the appropriateness of the going concern 
assumption the Directors have taken into consideration:
1. Monthly operating and cash flow forecasts; and
2. Facilities available to the Group.
The Group has funding arrangements with its principal bankers, linked to receivables, which are on a revolving basis.
The cash flow forecasts are based on historical results, taking in to account a small level of growth for those subsidiaries that are in their early 
years of trading. The current economic conditions and competition in the market create uncertainty over the level of placements and the forecasts 
take account for possible changes in trading performance but with regular income on contractor payments, all the funding arrangements in place 
give us the opportunity to grow the contract base within the headroom of the facility, adjusting where required.
The Directors are therefore confident that the Group will be able to continue as a going concern.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 March 2017. Subsidiaries 
are entities controlled by the Group. The Company controls a subsidiary if all three of the following elements are present: power over the subsidiary; 
exposure to variable returns from the subsidiary; and the ability of the investor to use its power to affect those variable returns. The financial 
statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control 
ceases.
Business combinations
Business combinations of subsidiaries are dealt with by the purchase method. The equity method involves the recognition at fair value of all 
identifiable assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities of the subsidiary, at the acquisition date, regardless of whether or not they were 
recorded in the financial statements of the subsidiary prior to acquisition. On initial recognition, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary are 
included in the consolidated statement of financial position at their fair values, which are also used as the basis for subsequent measurement 
in accordance with the Group accounting policies. Goodwill is stated after separating out identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the 
excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. 
Direct costs of acquisition are recognised immediately as an expense.

2. Accounting policies continued
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable for services provided during the accounting period net of trade 
discounts and value added tax. Revenue in respect of contract placements is recognised in the period in which the contractor undertakes the 
work. Revenue in respect of permanent placements is recognised in the period in which a candidate commences employment. A provision is made 
against any potential rebates that may become due on permanent placements, should the employee leave within a specified period of time. These 
provisions are reversed once this period has expired.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents any excess of the cost of a business combination over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired for 
acquisitions after 31 March 2006, together with goodwill recognised on transition to IFRS on 1 April 2006.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Other intangible assets
Computer software included at cost is amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life of two years. Intangible assets are recognised 
on business combinations if they are separable from the acquired entity or give rise to other contractual/legal rights. The amounts ascribed to such 
intangibles are arrived at by using appropriate valuation techniques. Identified intangible assets comprise of customer relationships and candidate 
database, which are amortised over a six and five-year period, respectively.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided 
at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives at the 
following rates:
Leasehold improvements – over remaining period of lease on a straight-line basis
Computer equipment – 50% per annum on a straight-line basis 
Furniture, fittings and office equipment – 25% per annum on a straight-line basis
Impairment testing of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
Impairment tests on intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually on 31 March. Other non-financial assets are 
subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the 
carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is written down immediately to its recoverable amount.
Leased assets
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. All of the Group’s current leases 
are operating leases.
Taxation
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable profit for the year. Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are 
measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates and the tax laws used to compute the amount 
are those that are enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position differs to 
its tax base, except for differences arising on:
• the initial recognition of goodwill; and
• the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit.
Deferred tax assets are recognised in the statement of financial position only where it is probable that suitable taxable profit will be available 
against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred taxation is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or the liability is settled, 
based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.

Foreign currencies
Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates (the 
“functional currency”) are recorded at the rate of exchange at the time of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies at the statement of financial position date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date. Exchange differences arising on 
the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in the income statement.
On consolidation the results of overseas operations are translated into sterling at rates approximating to those ruling when the transactions 
took place. All assets and liabilities of overseas operations are translated at rates of exchange ruling on the statement of financial position date. 
Exchange differences arising from this policy are recognised directly in the currency reserve via other comprehensive income.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption in IFRS 1 and has deemed cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to be nil 
at the date of transition to IFRS. The gain or loss on disposal of these operations excludes translation differences that arose before the date of 
transition to IFRS and includes later translation differences.
Pension costs
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The pension cost expensed to the income statement represents contributions payable 
by the Group to the pension scheme in the period.
Financial assets
All of the Group’s financial assets are categorised as loans and receivables.
The Group’s financial assets comprise trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents. Trade and other receivables are measured initially at fair value 
and subsequently at amortised cost. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit and loss when there is 
objective evidence that the asset is impaired, (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the counterparty or default or significant delay 
in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the 
difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable. For 
trade receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within 
administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, 
the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial assets and are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. The Group’s financial liabilities comprise trade payables, other payables, and an interest bearing confidential  
invoice discounting facility. All financial liabilities are measured initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective  
interest method.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and – for the purpose of the statement of cash flows – bank overdrafts. Bank 
overdrafts are shown within loans and borrowings in the current liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial position.
Employee share benefit trust
The cost of the Company’s shares held by the employee share benefit trust is deducted from equity in the consolidated statement of financial 
position. Any gain or loss received by the employee share benefit trust on disposal of the shares it holds is also recognised directly in equity. Other 
assets and liabilities of the employee share benefit trust (including borrowings) are recognised as assets and liabilities of the Group. Any shares 
held by the employee share benefit trust are treated as cancelled for the purposes of calculating earnings per share.
Share based payments
Where share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the income statement over the 
vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each 
statement of financial position date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options 
that eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted. As long as all other vesting conditions are 
satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options, measured immediately before 
and after the modification, is also charged to the income statement over the remaining vesting period.

2. Accounting policies continued
Equity
Equity comprises the following:
• “Share capital” represents the nominal value of equity shares.
• “Share premium” represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares.
• “Merger reserve” represents the difference between the value of shares and the nominal value in accordance with the requirements of Merger 
Relief under the Companies Act.
• “Employee share benefit trust reserve” represents the cost of the Company’s shares held by the employee share benefit trust.
• “Currency reserve” represents the differences arising from translation of investments in overseas subsidiaries.
• “Retained earnings” represents retained profits less accumulated losses.
New standards, interpretations and amendments effective from 1 April 2016
The new standards, interpretations and amendments, effective from 1 April 2016, have not had a material effect to the financial statements.
Standards and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not yet been adopted by the Group
The amendments and interpretations to published standards that have an effective date for accounting periods on or after 31 March 2017 or later 
periods have not been adopted early by the Group and assessment of the impact of these standards is currently under review. 
International Accounting Standards (IAS/IFRS)  Effective date:
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments   01/01/2018
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers  01/01/2018
• IFRS 16 Leases     01/01/2019
3. Critical accounting judgements and estimates
In preparing the financial statements it is necessary for the Directors to make estimates and judgements about the future. The key assumption 
made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements this year concerns the consideration of deferred tax asset. The Group has again 
made profits before depreciation and amortisation and is able to relieve some of its losses in determining its current tax payable for the year, which 
is why it is anticipated there will be no current tax liability. Furthermore, because the Directors are confident of continued profitability it is still 
considered appropriate to recognise a deferred tax asset for the future relief of the Group’s remaining losses, with the amount recognised based on 
formalised budgets. However, the actual amount of losses that will be relieved in future will be driven by the Group’s actual profitability (including 
periods beyond those for which formal budgets are prepared) and therefore the amount of the deferred tax asset recognised this year may be 
greater or smaller than the actual benefit accruing to the Group. Details of the Group’s provided and unprovided deferred tax position are shown in 
notes 9 and 18.
The Group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment (see note 12). The recoverable amount is 
determined based on value in use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the choice of a discount rate 
in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows. Actual outcomes may vary.
4. Operating segments
Operating segments are reported on a geographical basis.
The Group has three main reportable segments based on the location revenue is derived from:
• Asia Pacific – This segment includes Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore.
• UK – The UK segment includes candidates placed in the UK and Europe.
• USA – This start up includes candidates placed in the USA.

These segments are monitored by the Board of Directors and are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to them 
The Board of Directors are considered to be the chief operating decision makers. All revenue is derived from the supply of recruitment and human 
resource services.
Factors that management used to identify the Group’s reportable segments
The Group’s reportable segments are strategic business units that, although supplying the same product offerings, operate in distinct markets and 
are therefore managed on a day to day basis by separate teams.
Measurement of operating segment profit or loss, assets and liabilities
The accounts policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.
The Group evaluates performance on the basis of profit or loss from operations before tax not including overhead costs incurred by the head office 
such as plc AIM related costs not recharged, exceptional items, amortisation and share based payments.
The Board does not review assets and liabilities by segment.

12. Goodwill
The Goodwill arose on the acquisition of Nakama Group in October 2011. The business formed part of the Group with effect from the date of 
acquisition of Nakama offices in London, Australia and Hong Kong.
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the cash generating units (CGU’s) as follows:
Goodwill 
carrying 
amount
2017 and 2016
£’000
Nakama London 255
Nakama Hong Kong 28
Nakama Sydney 168
Nakama Melbourne 36
487
The Group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. Impairment tests are undertaken annually on 
31 March using value in use calculations for each CGU. The value in use calculations are based on cash flow projections from formally approved 
budgets covering a five year period plus a terminal value. The key assumptions within the calculations are considered to be revenue growth and the 
discount rate. The average revenue growth rate is 32% in the next financial year (2016: 30%) and 5% per annum thereafter (2016: 6%). The large 
revenue growth rate in the next financial year is based on: historical staff performance, a more focused strategy, new business from new hires and 
a more diversified portfolio of offerings. The discount rate used in the impairment review was 12% (2016: 12%). The recoverable amount calculated 
for all CGUs exceeds the carrying amounts by £6,223,000 (2016: £2,447,001).
If any one of the following changes were made to the above key assumptions, the carrying amount and recoverable amount would be equal:
• If the revenue growth rate for the first year reduced by 33.05% to 107.1% for Nakama Melbourne
• If the revenue growth rate for the first year of 5.5% reduced to 3.7% for Nakama London

The rental contract for the office building rented since July 2000 at Caterham was renewed in March 2013 for a period of five years. As at February 
2016 we have taken leased office space in Singapore on a three year lease, a three year lease in Melbourne in September 2016 and a two year 
lease in Sydney for two years.
Operating lease agreements do not contain any contingent rent clauses. None of the operating lease agreements contain renewal or purchase

19. Related party transactions and controlling related party
The Group’s related parties include its Board of Directors. Details of the Directors’ remuneration are given in note 7. There were no other related 
party transactions.
20. Financial risk management objectives and policies
Financial instruments
The Group uses various financial instruments; these include cash and cash equivalents, and various items such as trade receivables, trade payables 
that arise directly from its operations and an invoice discounting arrangement. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance 
for the Company’s operations.
The main risks arising from the Company’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and currency risk. The Board reviews 
and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profit, bank borrowings and invoice discounting. The Group borrows in Pounds 
Sterling and Australian Dollars through the invoice discounting facility.
Cash deposits are non-interest bearing unless placed on money markets at overnight rates. The overdraft balances are offset against cash deposits 
in accordance with the facility and is managed such that no interest cost is incurred. The invoice discounting facilities are charged at 1.5% above 
the UK base rate for Sterling and Euro borrowing and 1% above base on the Australian facility. The Group is therefore exposed to changes in 
interest rates primarily through its invoice discounting facility.
Liquidity risk
The Group manages its liquidity needs by carefully monitoring cash outflows due in day-to-day business. Liquidity needs are monitored in various 
time bands including on a day-to-day and week-to-week basis, as well as on a monthly basis. As at 31 March 2017 all of the Group’s financial 
liabilities are contractually due within six months of the statement of financial position date. The majority of working capital is provided through the 
invoice discounting facility; additional draw down of these payments are directly related to the trade receivables. The Group’s liquidity needs are 
assessed periodically.
Capital management policies and procedures
The Group’s capital management objectives are:
• to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern; and
• to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing its offerings commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the carrying amount of equity less cash and cash equivalents as presented on the face of the statement 
of financial position. Capital for the reporting years under review is summarised on the next page.
Although Nakama Group plc is not constrained by any externally imposed capital requirements, its goal is to maximise its capital to overall 
financing structure ratio.

The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to its overall financing structure and manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in 
the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.

2016

Plus net borrowings 1,471 1,247
2,941 3,043
Capital-to-overall financing ratio 50.0% 59.0%
Net borrowings comprise invoice financing borrowings. The change in the capital to overall financing ratio this year is due to the loss sustained in 
the year and the increased usage of the invoice financing facility.
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash deposits and trade receivables. Risks associated with cash deposits are low as they are held at 
banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The principal credit risk lies with trade receivables. In order to manage credit risk the directors set limits for customers based on a combination 
of payment history and third party credit references. Credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis in conjunction with debt ageing and collection 
history. The Group has historically not suffered from significant bad debt problems. The Group’s principal bankers are HSBC Bank plc, the Group’s 
invoice discounting facility is also held with HSBC Commercial Finance.
Currency risk
The Group trades within international markets. These transactions are generally priced and invoiced in Euros, Hong Kong Dollar, Singapore Dollar, 
US Dollar and Australian Dollar.
The table below shows the Group’s currency exposures. Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that 
are not denominated in its functional currency of the transactions concerned. The exposures which relate only to the sales ledger balance, purchase 
ledger balance and cash at bank were as follows:

21. Employee share schemes
(a) EMI option scheme
The EMI option scheme was amended with effect from 29 March 2007 in order to reflect legislative changes since the scheme’s creation in 2000. 
Options over 4,141,060 ordinary shares were granted on 21 November 2008 at an exercise price of 1.25 pence per share. 50% of these options have 
since lapsed leaving 2,070,530 under option.
Options over 1,380,368 ordinary shares were granted on 7 September 2010 at an exercise price of 2.75p per share. Options over 690,200 ordinary 
shares were granted on 7 July 2011 at an exercise price of 3.00p per share. Options over 513,900 ordinary shares were granted on 11 December 
2012 at an exercise price of 1.88p. Options over 1,500,000 ordinary shares were granted on 1 August 2013 at an exercise price of 1.12p. Options 
over 2,150,000 ordinary shares were granted on 31 July 2014 at an exercise price of 2.88p
There are no share based payment expenses for the period or the prior period and therefore no further IFRS 2 disclosures are given.
(b) Employee Share Benefit Trust
An Employee Share Benefit Trust was established in November 1995 and its Trustees have the power to grant options to eligible employees over 
shares in the Company at the Trust’s expense, and the Company’s discretion, upon such terms as they think fit and to purchase such shares to be 
acquired by the eligible employees.
The Company did not make any contributions to the Trust during the year (2016: £nil). The Trust holds 183,953 shares in the Company, with a market 
value of £3,396 (2016: 183,953 shares at a market value of £3,672). These shares were purchased at a cost of £61,000.
No shares have been transferred to employees or were under option as at 31 March 2017. The Trust’s only other asset at 31 March 2017 was cash 
at bank of £2,111 (2016: £2,111) which is included in the Group’s statement of financial position as part of cash and cash equivalents. The Trust had 
no liabilities.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2017 
1. Principal accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The parent company financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention. The particular accounting policies adopted are 
described below.
Application of FRS 100 and 101
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 100 Application of Financial Reporting Requirements 
(“FRS 100”) and Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (“FRS 101”).
Disclosure exemptions adopted
In preparing these financial statements the Company has taken advantage of all disclosure exemptions conferred by FRS 101, therefore these 
financial statements do not include:
• certain comparative information as otherwise required by EU endorsed IFRS;
• certain disclosures regarding the Company’s capital;
• a statement of cash flows;
• the effect of future accounting standards not yet adopted;
• the disclosure of the remuneration of key management personnel; and
• disclosure of related party transactions with wholly owned members of Nakama Group plc group of companies.
In addition, and in accordance with FRS 101, further disclosure exemptions have been adopted because equivalent disclosures are included in the 
Company’s consolidated financial statements. These financial statements do not include certain disclosures in respect of:
• share based payments;
• financial instruments; and
• fair value measurement other than certain disclosures required as a result of recording financial instruments at fair value.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost net of depreciation and provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at 
rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset over its expected useful life as follows:
Leasehold improvements  – over period of lease
Computer equipment   – 50% on cost per annum
Furniture, fittings and office equipment – 25% on cost per annum
Motor vehicles   – 25% on written down value per annum
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Leased assets
Rentals payable under operating leases being leases which do not result in the transfer to the Company of substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the assets, are charged to the profit and loss on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Current taxation
Current taxation represents corporation tax payable on the taxable profits for the year or prior periods and is calculated using tax rates and laws 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position differs 
from its tax base except for differences arising on:
• the initial recognition of goodwill;
• the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit; and

Nakama Group AR 2017 Proof 7.indd   38 04/08/2017   10:12:28 25474.04 – 4 August 2017 10:12 AM – Proof 7
• investments in subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference and it is probable that the difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
difference can be utilised.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are 
expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are settled/(recovered).
Share based payments
Where share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the profit and loss over the vesting 
period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each statement 
of financial position date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that 
eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted. As long as all other vesting conditions are 
satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure 
to achieve a market vesting condition. Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the 
options, measured immediately before and after the modification, is also charged to the profit and loss over the remaining vesting period.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the time of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies at the statement of financial position date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date or, if appropriate, at 
the forward contract rate. Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an 
exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss.
Financial guarantee contracts
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts and guarantees the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company 
considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a 
contingent liability until such time that it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates
In preparing the financial statements it is necessary for the Directors to make estimates and judgements about the future. The key assumptions 
made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements this year concern the value of the investmens and intercompany balances in the 
financial statements.
The Group is required to consider, on an annual basis, whether there are indications of impairments over investments and whether the intercompany 
receivables are recoverable. For the investments, the Directors considered there to be indications of impairment as some of the subsidiaries are loss 
making and as such have performed an impairment review. The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations. The use of 
this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the choice of a discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows. 
For the receivables the budgets for the next five years are reviewed.
2. Directors’ remuneration
Directors’ remuneration has been disclosed within the directors’ remuneration report and note 7 of the Group financial statements.
3. Auditors’ remuneration
Auditors’ remuneration attributable to the Company is as follows:
