Important presentational 
changes in this report 
In April 2016 we adopted the euro as  
the Group’s presentational currency, 
and this is the first annual report where  
all financial figures are presented in  
euros rather than pounds sterling. 
On 20 March 201 7 we announced 
an agreement to merge Vodafone India 
with Idea Cellular in India, as a result 
Vodafone India is now excluded from 
Group figures unless otherwise stated. 
India still remains part of the Group 
from an operational perspective.
All amounts marked with an “*” represent organic growth which 
presents performance on a comparable basis, both in terms 
of merger and acquisition activity and movements in foreign 
exchange rates. Organic growth is an alternative performance 
measure. See “Alternative performance measures” on page 205 
for further details and reconciliations to the respective closest 
equivalent GAAP measure.

Good progress in converged 
communications in Europe
Europe remains our single biggest market 
and investment area and is at the heart 
of our “Gigabit Vodafone” converged 
communications strategy. Building on the 
success of Project Spring we continue to invest 
in network quality and customer experience, 
driving subscriber growth across mobile, 
broadband and TV. We are making good 
progress in our major markets, Germany, Italy 
and Spain, while in the UK our priority, for the 
moment, has to be on getting the basics right 
again. The completion of our merger in the 
Netherlands with Ziggo is another big step 
forward for our convergence strategy.
In order to enable an adequate return on the 
massive investments that will be required 
to provide Europe with the infrastructure 
required for a competitive economy in the 
age of digitalisation, a predictable regulatory 
framework is required that supports both 
investment and competition. In this regard 
we are encouraged by the European 
Commission’s (‘EC’) revised European 
Framework Review for Telecoms. In particular, 
the focus on passive infrastructure remedies 
and co-building arrangements, which have 
proven so successful in Spain and Portugal, 
is encouraging, as is the proposal to extend 
spectrum licence terms to at least 25 years. 
As the negotiations on the revised Framework 
enter a critical phase, we need to ensure 
that these well-balanced proposals are not 
diluted – both to avoid future incumbent 
re-monopolisation risks, and to pave the way 
for competitive investment in Europe’s future.
Driving consolidation in India; 
strengthening leadership 
in Africa
It has been a turbulent year in India. The launch 
of free services by a new entrant has disrupted 
an already hypercompetitive market and 
clouded the near and medium-term outlook 
for the industry. As a consequence Vodafone 
decided to stop the IPO process and instead 
look for in-market consolidation options. 
This has resulted in the announced merger 
proposal between Vodafone India and 
Idea Cellular, which will create a new, more 
competitive market player with the scale 
to invest in India’s digital future, while also 
capturing substantial synergies. 
We are very pleased with our progress 
in Africa where we have further strengthened 
our leadership positions, both at Vodacom 
in South Africa and Safaricom in Kenya.
Please see Vittorio Colao’s comments on pages 
12 to 15 for further insight into our strategy.
Our contribution to  
society is substantial
We are convinced that over the long-term 
the success of our business is closely tied 
to the success of the communities in which 
we operate. Consequently, a core part of our 
strategy and business model is to ensure that 
Vodafone’s digital networks and services act 
as a catalyst not only for economic growth, 
but also for equality and empowerment. 
Our “sustainable business strategy” section 
outlines our approach, including our ambition 
to connect an additional 50 million women 
living in emerging markets by 2026 (see 
pages 26 and 27), as well as our commitment 
to operating responsibly. For example, our  
report on “T axation and our total economic 
contribution to public finances” highlights 
our total contribution to governments 
of €15.6 billion in the 2016 financial year. 
Our charitable activities are also expanding 
in scope, as the Vodafone Foundation 
leverages our technology and expertise 
with funding from external NGOs and other 
partners to expand its impact. I recommend 
you take a look at our website for more 
information on the activities of our Foundation. 
Improving returns on capital 
remains a key priority
We are confident in our strategic direction, 
our adjusted EBITDA growth continues 
to improve and our adjusted EBIT is also 
now recovering. 
But we cannot yet be satisfied by the returns 
that we are achieving on the substantial 
organic and inorganic investments that the 
Group has made in recent years. 
As our CFO Nick Read explains in his 
introduction to our business model on page 
1 6, the solution to this challenge is threefold: 
continued profitable revenue growth, with tight 
cost control; portfolio management to gain 
sufficient (in-market) scale to earn attractive 
long-term returns; and a compensation 
approach which focuses more on adjusted EBIT , 
i.e., the profits after capital investment costs, 
and less on adjusted EBITDA, a change which 
we hope the industry will follow.
During the year the Vodafone share price 
on a total return basis has been broadly stable, 
underperforming the FTSE 100. This partly 
reflected a strong recovery by commodity 
producers and cyclically exposed companies, 
which accelerated after the US election results, 
as well as concerns over rising competition 
in the telecoms sector following new entrants 
in India and next year in Italy. 
Overall, the Board remains confident that the 
Group’s cash generation, and consequently 
its return on capital, will continue to recover. 
This confidence is reflected in our unchanged 
intention to grow the dividend, as exhibited 
by the 2.0% increase in the dividend to  
14.77 eurocents for the year.
In concluding, on behalf of the Board I would 
like to express our appreciation to Nick Land 
and Phil Y ea, who will not seek re-election at our 
Annual General Meeting in July 201 7 after 
more than ten years of valuable service. I would 
also like to thank our employees and business 
partners for their efforts and contribution 
to Vodafone’s progress, as well as our 
shareholders for their support and confidence.

Breaking the 
gigabit barrier
In 201 6, we teamed up with ENEL in Italy, a major electricity company, 
to establish a leading fibre provider, taking Italy one step closer to  
becoming a “Gigabit Society”.
In 2016, only 3% of Italian fixed broadband subscribers were on  
fibre and in 2015 60% of the population received less than 30 Mbps.  
Through our partnership with ENEL, called Open Fiber, we will be  
able to deliver gigabit fibre (1,000 Mbps) to 270 cities reaching at least  
9.5 million households by 2022.
Our goal is to create a “Gigabit 
Society” where everyone benefits 
from ubiquitous and reliable 
high-speed connectivity 
Our partnerships and 
investment in superior cable, 
fibre and mobile networks 
allow us to deliver better 
performance everywhere

Market overview
We operate in a fast-moving market where innovation and scale are key
Importance and speed of change in the telecommunications industry
Telecommunications is an essential service 
used by over seven billion mobile customers 
and 0.9 billion broadband users across the 
globe. The global mobile industry generates 
around €1.65 trillion of revenue. 52% 
of revenue arises from traditional voice calls 
and messaging services.
On average, a customer consumes 203 
outgoing minutes per month, which has been 
largely stable over the last couple of years. 
The demand for mobile data services to watch 
videos, browse the internet and use various 
“apps” has accelerated rapidly, and today 48% 
of global revenue comes from data, compared 
to only 22% five years ago. 
The number of smartphone users continues 
to grow rapidly. Today 45% of mobile handsets 
are smartphones, compared to 1 1% five 
years ago. This is being driven by rising living 
standards and population growth, combined 
with lower airtime and device costs.
The fixed telecommunications market 
includes calls, broadband and TV packages, 
generating €0.7 trillion of revenue annually. 
The number of voice-only users continues 
to decline as customers disconnect their 
landlines in favour of mobile phones, however, 
the take-up of broadband and pay TV services 
offsets this. According to Ovum, fixed 
broadband will be the fastest-growing market, 
with revenues increasing at a compound 
annual rate of 3.1% from 2016 to 2021, ahead 
of pay TV at 2.5% and mobile at 1.9%.
In broadband markets, an increasing proportion 
of customers are upgrading from copper-based 
ADSL with speeds up to 24 Mbps to high-speed 
fibre and cable with speeds up to 1,000 Mbps. 
We believe that Gigabit networks direct to 
homes and businesses form the bedrock of 
modern digital communications infrastructure.
Why we are well positioned
We are one of the largest telecommunications 
providers in the world with typically a number 
1 or 2 position by market share in mobile 
in each country we operate in and the largest 
NGN footprint in Europe.
Why we are well positioned
We have the best data network in 14 out 
of the 21 countries we operate in and 
we can market fixed services to the most 
homes in Europe with next generation 
fibre or cable with speeds of up to 1 Gbps.
Growing demand for data and high-speed networks
The telecommunications industry has 
transformed significantly in the last 30 years. 
In the 1990s, mobile phones were mostly 
used for calls on 2G networks, and basic 
picture messages could be sent at very low 
speeds of 50–200 Kbps. Today users can 
enjoy 4G speeds of up to 800 Mbps for rapid 
video downloads, with 1 Gbps speeds already 
demonstrated. This network technology 
innovation has been accompanied by 
the growing demand for smartphones, 
which are now used by 63% of Vodafone’s 
European customers. 
Fixed network development has been 
equally rapid. In the 1990s most fixed 
connections were for landline calls, today 
the greatest use is broadband internet usage. 
Average download speeds have progressed 
rapidly from around 8–1 6 Mbps using copper-
based technology in 2007 to 1 Gbps using 
cable or fibre today. These developments 
bring significant opportunities to drive 
further revenue from increased data usage, 
but also require investment to keep 
up with technology. 
These developments are collectively 
leading to substantial growth in data traffic. 
Between 201 1 and 201 6 mobile data traffic 
increased by an average of 75% p.a. and today 
95% of total traffic on mobile networks across 
the globe is data. 5G, the next major step 
in mobile technology, is expected to launch 
commercially by 2020, most likely only in dense 
urban areas in Europe and will enable speeds 
of up to 1 Gbps combined with extremely 
quick reaction times. This will support the 
development of new applications, including 
in the areas of augmented and virtual reality.

Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 10 We must also manage external  
pressures and expectations 
Increasing demand for 
converged solutions
T oday, consumers are increasingly taking 
bundles of mobile, landline, broadband and 
TV services. For the consumer this provides 
the benefit of simplicity – one provider 
for multiple services – and better value.  
For operators this provides higher customer 
loyalty as well as operational efficiencies.
The same motivations apply for businesses, 
which are increasingly taking advantage 
of converged services that bring together 
communications tools that work across all 
fixed and mobile end points. 
Regulatory burden
The telecom industry is heavily regulated. 
Vodafone’s European businesses are overseen 
by more than 200 national and regional 
regulatory authorities covering areas such 
as spectrum allocation, roaming charges, 
consumer rights, copyright, data protection, 
cyber security and the wholesale fees that 
operators charge each other. While these 
policies are designed to protect consumers, 
for example by championing ever-lower 
retail prices, they have historically failed 
to adequately address the need to encourage 
operator investment in the latest technologies. 
In June 201 7 , European regulators will abolish 
mobile retail roaming charges, enabling 
customers to use their phones abroad at  
the same price as they do at home. 
Why we are well positioned
As Europe’s largest broadband company, 
we are ready for the growing demand for 
converged services. Our high-speed data 
networks in Europe can reach 315 million 
people with 4G mobile and 96 million 
households with fixed broadband.
Increasing competition
The telecommunications industry is highly 
competitive, with many alternative providers, 
giving customers a wide choice of supplier. 
In each of our countries of operation, there are 
typically three or four main mobile network 
operators, such as Vodafone, and several 
resellers that “wholesale” network services 
from operators to sell on to their customers. 
In our fixed markets there is usually one 
national fixed incumbent (typically the 
former state owned operator), one or two 
cable and satellite companies and re-
sellers that rent network services from the 
incumbent. In addition, there are an increasing 
number of over-the-top (‘OTT’) operators that 
provide internet-based apps for content, 
messaging and voice services. Our enterprise 
business also faces competition from OTT 
and cloud service providers which offer 
IT infrastructure as a standardised service 
on a “pay as you go” model. 
The high level of competitive intensity has 
resulted in continued downward pressure 
on the price of services, with the average 
cost per unit of mobile data falling nearly 
40% p. a. over the last three years.
Why we are well positioned
Our substantial investments continue 
to provide superior network and 
customer service levels, supported 
by a very wide range of mobile and fixed 
products and an unrivalled global reach, 
to deliver a leading customer experience 
across the majority of our markets.

We have launched roaming inclusive 
plans across all our EU markets well 
in advance of regulation and already have 
a significant portion of our customers 
that do not pay extra for EU roaming. 
Vodafone typically offers twice the 
number of 4G roaming destinations 
to its customers than any other operator.

Changing customer and societal expectations
T oday, communication networks underpin 
every aspect of society, enabling citizens 
to increase their knowledge while providing 
access to services that can improve health 
and wellbeing, enhance skills and increase 
prosperity. In this context, companies need 
to ensure they operate responsibly as they 
strive to deliver their objectives. There are 
areas within the telecommunications 
industry that are a source of public concern –  
such as privacy, tax and digital human 
rights – areas that our ongoing corporate 
transparency programmes address directly. 
Why we are well positioned
As one of the world’s largest 
communications companies, we are 
proud of the role that we play in bringing 
social benefit to more than half 
a billion mobile customers across 26 
countries. Page 26 of this report shows 
how we are successfully aligning our 
business objectives with a clear social 
purpose to create value and meet 
customer expectations.

Review of the year
Vodafone’s transformation into a leading 
converged operator in our developed markets 
made further progress this year, while long-
lasting tailwinds from rising smartphone 
penetration and data services adoption drove 
growth in our emerging markets. This was 
supported by our strategic differentiators – 
Network Leadership, Customer eXperience 
eXcellence, and outstanding people – 
together with improved cost efficiency. 
Overall, I am pleased to report that the 
Group’s commercial and financial performance 
has further improved, although on a reported 
basis this was masked by currency headwinds.
Network Leadership:  
building a “Gigabit Vodafone”
After the large investments made during 
Project Spring, this year our capital spending, 
measured as a percentage of our revenues, 
returned to a sustainable “mid-teens” level. 
Even so, we continued to record improved 
mobile network performance relative 
to smaller competitors in almost all of our 
markets. This performance gap is critical, 
as by providing a differentiated experience 
to our customers we can justify a price 
premium relative to discounters. We now have 
the leading or co-leading data network in 14 
out of the 21 markets in which independent 
tests are available, and all 21 for voice.
We aim to improve our customers’ experience 
even further with the introduction of “Gigabit 
LTE” – also sometimes described as “ 4G+” 
– in the coming years. In addition, we will 
upgrade our cable and fibre next-generation 
networks (which now pass 36 million  
homes, including the VodafoneZiggo JV in  
the Netherlands) to provide gigabit speeds, 
differentiating our services from those 
provided by copper-based incumbents.
Customer eXperience 
eXcellence: our formula  
for differentiation
Providing an outstanding customer experience 
is critical if we are to capitalise fully on our 
network advantage. 
We aim to ensure that all of our customers 
experience reliable Connectivity, Always 
enjoy excellent value, are Rewarded for their 
loyalty, and receive Easy access to support 
when they need it. This ‘CARE’ formula, 
systematically introduced since 2015 across 
all of our operations, is designed to provide our 
customers with an excellent experience that 
is unique to Vodafone. We measure our progress 
regularly, using the Net Promoter Score (‘NPS’) 
methodology. I am very pleased that we have 
further extended our advantage during the 
past year. We are now the leader or co-leader 
in 1 9 out of 21 markets, with an average NPS 
“gap” to the third placed player of 17 points. 
A year ago, we were a leader or co-leader in just 
13 markets, with a gap of 14 points. In the UK, 
this is not yet the case; we have recovered 
a leadership position in terms of network 
performance and have significantly reduced 
customer complaints, but we still lag the 
competition in our overall customer perception. 
We are confident that our recovery ‘CARE’ plan 
will improve the situation in the UK as well.
Vodafone-Idea: a new  
champion of Digital India
The entrance of a new operator in India offering 
4G services for free has created industry 
turbulence, leading us to take an impairment 
charge of €3.7 billion net of tax. We have 
moved strategically to face the new context 
by proposing to merge Vodafone India with 
Idea Cellular, the number 3 operator in India , 
which will create a new market leader with 
the scale to invest in India’s digital future, while 
also capturing an estimated US$ 10 billion NPV 
in synergies. 
We will jointly control the new combined 
company in partnership with Idea’s founding 
shareholder, the Aditya Birla Group, a leading 
Indian-based international conglomerate. 
We will own 45.1%, the Adityla Birla 
Group 26.0% and Idea’s current minority 
shareholders will own the remaining 28.9%. 
We have agreed a mechanism with the Aditya 
Birla Group to equalise our shareholdings over 
time. The transaction is subject to regulatory 
approvals and is expected to complete during 
calendar year 2018. 
The new company will maintain Idea’s  
listing on the BSE/NSE exchanges in India, 
providing a public market valuation for this 
important asset.
Improved commercial  
and financial results
Overall, the investments made both during 
and after Project Spring are paying off, 
and I am pleased to report another year 
of improved commercial performance and 
increased organic revenue and adjusted 
EBITDA growth for the Group’s operations 
in Europe, Africa and the Middle East.
We remain Europe’ s fastest growing broadband 
operator, with 1.2 million broadband net additions 
during the year, a healthy 1. 1 million increase 
in contract mobile customers, and a 0.7 million 
increase in our converged (fixed plus mobile) 
customer base. An improved overall customer 
experience allowed us to introduce “more-for -
more” propositions, in which customers received 
greater value for a higher monthly payment. 
As a result, consumer contract ARPU stabilised 
after many years of decline.
This good performance was reflected 
in European service revenue growth of 0.6%* vs. 
-0.6%* last year. All major markets grew during 
the year, except the UK. In AMAP , we enjoyed 
another year of strong growth in customers, 
usage and local currency revenues (up 7 .7%* 
in organic terms vs. 8.0%* last year). 
A stronger overall organic service revenue 
performance translated into even faster organic 
adjusted EBITDA growth (up 5.8%* vs. 2.3%* last 
year) thanks to good progress on cost efficiency, 
which Nick Read describes on page 16.
None of these achievements would have  
been possible without the talent and 
dedication of our people, supported by the 
values of speed, simplicity and trust which 
we call “The Vodafone Way”.
 
Vittorio Colao
Chief Executive
Building a converged 
communications leader
Our focus on delivering an excellent customer experience has 
delivered further improvements in our overall commercial and 
financial performance during the year.
Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 12 “More-for-more” initiatives to drive usage and revenue
Over the course of last year we introduced a series of more-for-more offers, 
which typically offer more data in return for a higher monthly fee. As an example, 
in Germany, we recently launched new plans offering more data and a data 
rollover facility, providing customers with the ability to carry over their unused 
data allowance from the prior month. In Vodacom, our innovative “micro-bundling” 
strategy allows customers to purchase data in affordable hourly, daily or weekly 
bundles. These offers typically mean customers generate a lower revenue per 
unit of data, but stabilise or increase average revenue per user.
Data
Providing the best mobile data experience
We aim to provide a leading mobile data 
experience in all of our markets, in order 
to capitalise on the huge demand for mobile 
internet connectivity from both consumer and 
enterprise customers, and to differentiate our 
service from lower quality discount providers.
During the financial year, demand for data 
continued to grow very strongly, with over 
2,700 petabytes of data carried across our 
mobile networks (including India, JVs and 
associates). This was an absolute increase 
in traffic this year of 995 petabytes, which 
was greater than the total traffic carried 
on the network last year. Growth was driven 
by continued adoption of 4G, with 28 million 
customers added during the year bringing the 
total base to 75 million at the end of March. 
This represented 33% of our active data 
users. With bigger touchscreens and faster 
speeds, the customer experience improves 
significantly (particularly for video). As a result, 
4G smartphones typically drive a two to three 
times increase in data usage compared to 3G.
Bigger bundle sizes also contributed to  
usage growth, as we successfully introduced 
“more-for-more” propositions (typically 
offering our customers larger data allowances 
for a higher monthly payment) across most 
of our markets during the year. The success 
of these initiatives was a key driver of our 
improved revenue growth momentum 
compared to the prior year.
In developing markets, which typically lack 
extensive fixed infrastructure, demand for 
internet access via mobile is a long-lasting 
driver of data consumption and revenue 
growth. Data users continued to grow during 
the year, by nine million to 153 million 
(including India), although the launch of free 
services by Reliance Jio in India dragged on our 
data customer growth during the second half. 
Consequently, the largest driver of data growth 
was increased usage levels by data customers. 
As in developed markets, new technologies 
drive higher usage: on average, a 2G customer 
uses 0.2 GB per month; a 3G customer 0.9 GB; 
and a 4G customer 1.7 GB. 
During the coming financial year we will begin 
trials of “Gigabit LTE” / 4G+ services, which will 
deliver further significant gains in data speeds 
along with lower latency (quick reaction time). 
As the new technology will be based on the 
broad and deep 4G network built during 
Project Spring, the incremental cost to achieve 
these gains is expected to be relatively 
modest. We are preparing for 5G by building 
fibre connections to over 95% of urban sites 
in Europe. Additional 5G radio investments will 
only be made once the technology is mature 
and the business case is robust.
Context
 – Smartphone penetration is growing 
rapidly, leading to increasing demand 
for mobile data. 63% of our customers 
have a smartphone in Europe, compared 
to 59% last year
 – Data usage is increasingly driven by the 
demand for high-definition video, 
which requires fast download speeds 
for a great user experience. Data traffic 
increased 65% during the year
 – Users want to use data without worrying 
about unexpected costs whether using 
their mobiles at home or abroad
What we’re aiming for 
 – We’re encouraging more data usage 
with our more-for-more initiatives that 
provide extra data-related benefits for 
a small increment to the monthly fee
 – We want our customers to have the best 
data experience, so we now provide data 
download speeds of at least 3 Mbps – 
the requirement for high-definition video 
– for 92% of data sessions in Europe
 – We are encouraging our customers 
to move to 4G, which provides data 
speeds up to 10x faster than 3G and 
lower latency (quick reaction time) 
for a better user experience. We now 
have 75 million 4G customers, up from 
47 million a year ago
 – We want our customers to use data 
wherever they want, so our 4G roaming 
network now reaches 1 18 countries
 – We are preparing for 5G in the longer 
term by building more fibre connections 
to carry more data

Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financials Additional information Convergence
Combining fixed and mobile
In developed markets, the trend towards 
convergence – the bundling of fixed and 
mobile services within a single contract – 
continues to accelerate, aided by commercial 
offers which typically provide either extra 
value, a financial discount or sometimes 
both of these incentives to customers who 
buy multiple products. Overall, we view this 
trend as a substantial growth opportunity 
for Vodafone. We are an established leader 
in mobile and our recent investments have 
positioned us as the leading challenger in fixed, 
with scope to gain significant profitable 
revenue market share by cross-selling fixed 
products to our mobile base. Additionally, 
churn rates for customers buying multiple 
products are substantially lower – so our 
success in winning fixed relationships is also 
expected to make our mobile base both more 
secure and more profitable over time. 
Our fixed network footprint continues 
to expand, and we are now able to reach 
over 96 million NGN homes in Europe, giving 
us the largest marketable reach of any 
operator. 36 million of these homes are 
connected by our own cable or fibre networks 
(including VodafoneZiggo in the Netherlands). 
The remaining homes are mostly reached 
through wholesale relationships with the local 
incumbent operator. We plan to upgrade our 
own networks to deliver gigabit speeds over 
the coming years, which will further extend the 
competitive advantage we enjoy compared 
to slower copper-based incumbents.
Our progress this past year has been strong: 
we remained Europe’s fastest growing 
broadband company, winning 1.2 million 
new customers. Our total broadband 
customer base, including VodafoneZiggo, 
is now 17 .9 million, of which 16.6 million are 
in Europe. Four million of these customers 
are fully converged, with a further two million 
taking both a fixed and mobile service from 
Vodafone, but not yet benefiting from a single 
bill and/or a cross-product discount. We are 
highly focused on converting these customers 
onto fully converged bundles. Additionally, 
in the Netherlands, just 25% of Ziggo’s fixed 
customers take a Vodafone mobile product – 
a significant cross-selling opportunity for the 
new joint venture.
Succeeding in convergence also means 
providing a best-in-class TV experience. 
This past year we launched “Vodafone TV”and 
“Giga TV”, which are best-in-class TV platforms. 
We also started our journey towards 
consolidating our TV platforms, capturing scale 
efficiencies. Including VodafoneZiggo, we now 
have 14 million TV customers, of which eight 
million pay for advanced digital services. 
We aim to distribute premium content to these 
customers, but where possible we prefer 
to avoid exclusive content deals as these 
tend to drive up costs for the industry with 
no lasting competitive benefit.
Context
 – Customers increasingly want to use 
converged services – i.e. bundle fixed 
and mobile services together under 
a single contract – to easily share 
content between their mobile phone, 
tablet, laptop or TV
 – Access to TV programmes bundled 
with fixed broadband is an increasingly 
important driver of demand for 
converged services
 – The growing demand for converged 
services drives data usage, which in turn 
requires the combination of mobile and 
fibre infrastructure
What we’re aiming for 
 – We expect fixed revenue to grow 
as a percentage of our revenues, driven 
by convergence, which should also 
lead to higher customer loyalty and 
lower churn 
 – We aim to increase our revenue 
market share profitably 
in fixed communications
 – We seek to roll out more high-speed 
broadband services by deploying more 
fibre and working with strategic partners. 
We already reach 96 million households 
in Europe, up from 72 million last year
 – We’re aiming to expand our 
TV services, to complement the take 
up of broadband. We already have 
TV services in eight markets (including 
VodafoneZiggo)

Vodafone Spain – leading our transition to converged services
To date, the fastest take up of converged services – bundles of fixed, mobile or TV – 
has been in Spain. During the year, we added nearly 250,000 new converged customers 
taking us to 2.3 million in total. We have made two important steps to drive demand 
during the year. First, we added to the existing extensive range of TV content including 
football, Netflix, and over 120 TV channels, including launching HBO Spain. Second, 
we further expanded the number of homes passed with high-speed fibre to nearly 
19 million, representing 65% of households, by both deploying more fibre and 
by securing new wholesale arrangements.

Providing network connected, global cloud services
Enterprise customers are moving data and applications to the cloud to become smarter 
and more agile, reduce costs and optimise performance. By combining our strengths 
in fixed connectivity with our Cloud & Hosting portfolio, we are well placed to meet this 
demand and can provide simple, secure IT solutions. During the year, we have expanded 
our geographic presence and our cloud services are now live in seven markets across 
Europe, Africa, Asia and the USA. Combined with our network of partner facilities, we can 
serve businesses on a global scale and offer a consistent cloud experience across 
28 countries. During the year, revenue from Cloud & Hosting services grew 15%.
Enterprise remains a key driver of our business, 
representing approximately 30% of revenues. 
During the year our enterprise revenues 
continued to grow, in contrast to leading 
European peers who experienced a decline 
in their business. This outperformance 
reflects four important differences in our 
business composition and strategy compared 
to a “typical” incumbent operator position.
First, we operate in more international markets 
than all of our traditional telecom rivals, 
and as a result we have a cost advantage 
compared to nationally based competitors 
who are forced to wholesale at a higher cost 
in order to provide services outside their home 
market to multinational clients. This advantage 
in terms of our global reach is reflected in the 
strong performance of Vodafone Global 
Enterprise, which grew 3.0%* in the year. 
Second, the trend towards convergence 
represents an important opportunity for 
profitable revenue market share gains in fixed 
services for enterprise, where our market 
share is only around 7%. We have now built 
a global IP-VPN footprint which is on par with 
the largest global competitors, reaching 272 
Points of Presence in 73 countries. In addition, 
we are developing a range of adjacent 
services such as Cloud & Hosting and security 
solutions, to further increase our share 
of customers’ spending. Our early success 
is reflected in growth of 4.4% in non-mobile 
revenues during the year, which in total now 
account for 29% of our total enterprise sales. 
Third, we remain the market leader in the fast-
growing Internet of Things (‘Io T’) segment, which 
holds huge future potential, with 54 million 
devices connected on our IoT platform. 
In particular, our performance in the automotive 
segment remains strong, with BMW, Porsche 
and many others relying on our IoT solutions. 
We launched narrowband Io T in Spain, and have 
trials running in several countries. With seven 
times the coverage reach of existing GSM-based 
services and very low power consumption 
(devices could last up to ten years with a single 
AAA battery), this technology is likely to catalyse 
a new wave of innovation and industry growth. 
Finally, the composition of our revenues 
is different from many of our rivals. We have very 
limited exposure to declining fixed voice calling, 
or segments such as the UK public-sector which 
have been under pressure from government 
spending cuts; conversely, we enjoy strong 
growth in our emerging markets operations, 
for example with Vodacom achieving 12% 
enterprise growth during the year.
It is also important to recognise that there are 
challenges ahead. Our core European mobile 
revenues remain under pressure as a result of 
intense competition, so it is important that we 
diversify into fixed and related services. In addition, 
we have a number of legacy fixed contracts 
inherited from the Cable & Wireless acquisition 
that are not sufficiently profitable, reflecting 
a large number of costly legacy networks 
and associated products. These networks are 
being phased out, and customers migrated to 
modernised solutions, over the coming years.

Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financials Additional information Chief Financial Officer’s review
Our business model
Vodafone has invested €71 billion over the 
past four years (including India) in order 
to strengthen the quality of our assets 
and enhance our customers’ experience. 
This commitment to invest lies at the heart 
of our strategy, as it enables a differentiated 
customer experience, supporting our leading 
market share and premium price position. 
Scale is also critical, as only a leading or co-
leading market position – combined with 
highly efficient operations and talented people 
– provides us with sufficient cash generation 
to continue to invest, while also earning 
the necessary return for our shareholders. 
This virtuous cycle – in which investment 
drives a differentiated customer experience, 
supporting leading scale, which enables 
ongoing re-investment – is the key to our 
business model (see pages 18 and 19).
I am confident that the investments we have 
made have repositioned Vodafone for future 
profitable growth. However, our returns 
on capital are below our cost of capital 
in several important markets, as is evident from 
our modest adjusted EBIT margin of 8.3%. 
Consequently, I remain focused on three key 
activities in order to drive our returns on capital 
higher in the years ahead.
Fit for Growth: a second 
phase of savings identified
Fit for Growth is a comprehensive cost 
efficiency programme designed to drive 
operating leverage and margin expansion 
without impacting the customer experience.
During the year , we have continued 
to make good progress, delivering an absolute 
reduction in our cost base on an organic basis. 
This is despite the significant underlying cost 
inflation created by Project Spring and continued 
strong growth in fixed and mobile customers 
during the year. Areas of significant cost 
saving included procurement, shared service 
centres, improved sales channel efficiency and 
standardised network design. This cost focus 
is reflected in our improved margin performance, 
with 15 markets out of 22 growing adjusted 
EBITDA faster than service revenue, driving a 1.2* 
percentage point improvement in organic Group 
adjusted EBITDA margin.
Phase two of the Fit for Growth programme 
has now been developed and new internal 
three-year margin targets have been set across 
the Group. These imply another reduction 
in absolute operating costs on an organic basis 
during the coming financial year. 
A focus on returns 
The Group is performing strongly, supported by 
leading network quality and growing customer 
advocacy. We continue to deliver good cost 
efficiency, supporting the Group’s improving free 
cash flow profile and underpinning our dividend.
Our business model:  
leading scale that enables 
constant reinvestment in our 
core assets to drive growth
Our business plan: leading scale and 
sustained investments to provide 
high-quality services and attract 
customers, which in turn provides the 
funds for reinvestment and attractive 
shareholder returns.

Creating a market leader in India 
On 20 March 2017 , we announced our agreement to combine the operations 
of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular. The new company will be jointly controlled 
and will become the market leader in India, with almost 400 million customers 
and 41% revenue market share. It will have the scale to meet customers’ 
rapidly accelerating demand for data consumption with a long-term vision and 
commitment to bring world-class 4G networks to villages, towns and cities 
across India. This is also an opportunity to create value for shareholders based 
on delivering synergies with a net present value of US$10 billion, including 
potential regulatory dis-synergies. 
Future opportunities include the modernisation 
of our legacy IT infrastructure with scalable, 
low-cost cloud-based solutions and greater 
use of digital technologies to reduce the cost 
of customer interactions. 
Portfolio management: India 
and the Netherlands in focus
We continue to actively manage our portfolio 
of operating companies. We must either 
achieve leading or co-leading scale in a market, 
or find a path over time to divest the asset. 
This approach is critical to ensure that we are 
allocating our capital investment towards 
higher return opportunities.
This year, we completed our joint venture 
with Liberty Global on 31 December. 
VodafoneZiggo has convergence 
co-leadership along with the incumbent and 
is thus in an ideal position to compete, while 
capturing synergies with a net present value 
of €3.5 billion. Currently the mobile market 
in the Netherlands is highly competitive, 
weighing on our growth. However, given 
future cost synergies and the opportunities for 
cross-selling, we remain confident in the mid-
term outlook and expect to receive our share 
of at least €500 million in cash returns from 
the JV during calendar year 2017 .
In addition, as Vittorio has outlined, at the 
end of March we announced our intention 
to merge our Indian business with Idea Cellular 
in India, creating a new market leader with 
synergies worth approximately US$10 billion. 
Under IFRS rules India is technically treated 
as a discontinued operation for 201 7 and prior 
financial years. 
With effect from 1 April 2016, the Group’s  
presentation currency was changed  
from pounds sterling to the euro  
to better align with the geographic split  
of the Group’s operations.
From an operational perspective, the Group  
remains highly focused on the management 
of the business and committed to its  
continued success, both prior to the 
completion of the merger and thereafter. 
Given India currently generates minimal free cash 
flow for the Group, and has historically required 
large spectrum investments, the merger also 
improves our dividend coverage. The merger 
is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected 
to complete during calendar 2018. 
Compensation: a focus 
on adjusted EBIT
We are changing our compensation structure 
to align incentives more closely with adjusted 
EBIT. Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure 
of our performance, however it does not 
capture the cost of our capital investments. 
This change will help to ensure that the 
company remains highly focused on capital 
efficiency moving forwards.

Based on guidance foreign exchange rates, 
adjusted EBITDA for the 2017 financial year 
grew organically by 3.4%* to €15.8* billion, 
consistent with the 3% to 6% organic growth 
(implying €15.7 to €16.1 billion) guidance 
range set in November 2016 (including India). 
On the same basis our free cash flow was 
€4.3 billion, consistent with our free cash flow 
guidance of at least €4.0 billion. Our results are 
analysed on pages 35 to 41 in more detail. 
For more information:  
Pages 35 to 43
Looking ahead
We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow 
organically by 4% to 8%; this implies a range 
of €14.0 to €14.5 billion at guidance exchange 
rates. This range excludes Vodafone India, 
but includes the benefit of shareholder 
recharges received by the Group from 
VodafoneZiggo and from Vodafone India, 
as well as an anticipated benefit from the 
introduction of handset financing in the UK. 
Note that shareholder recharges are excluded 
from our calculation of organic growth. 
Excluding Vodafone India, we expect free 
cash flow of around €5.0 billion, before the 
impact of M&A, spectrum payments and 
restructuring costs. 
The Board intends to grow dividends per 
share annually. Dividends will be declared 
in euros and paid in euros, pounds sterling 
and US dollars. The foreign exchange rate 
at which future dividends declared in euros 
will be converted into pounds sterling and 
US dollars will be calculated based on the 
average exchange rate over the five business 
days during the week prior to the payment 
of the dividend.

and shareholder returns
Our products and services play a central 
role in the daily lives of more than half 
a billion people globally. 
Our three global transformation goals – 
described in our sustainable business 
strategy on page 26 – aim to deliver 
meaningful socio-economic benefit for 
our customers and wider society and will 
be achieved by means of our core long-
term business objectives.
Our commitment to enhancing lives 
and livelihoods – together with our 
longstanding commitment to operating 
responsibly – is key to creating a  
sustainable business and is therefore 
integral to our duty to maximise returns 
to our shareholders.
The ongoing cash generated from 
operations allows us to sustain generous 
shareholder returns while also investing 
in the future prosperity of the business. 
Our shareholders regard the dividend 
as an important element of that return 
and that is why we have increased the 
dividend per share every year for more 
than 17 years. In the 2016 calendar year 
Vodafone was the 5th largest dividend 
payer in the FTSE 100.

provide 54 million IoT connections for 
services such as smart meters or internet 
in the car. As a global company we reach 
many countries. 23% of our mobile 
customers are from Europe and the 
remainder are from emerging markets 
such as India and Africa.
We serve a variety of enterprise customers 
including 1,900 multinational corporates, 
90,000 public sector and national 
companies, and nine million small and 
medium sized enterprises.
Among our fixed broadband customers, 
1 1 million (including VodafoneZiggo) take

Revenue
90% of our revenue is service revenue 
from customers and wholesale 
partners for providing mobile and fixed 
connectivity. Most of this is from mobile 
services, but fixed services are becoming 
increasingly important due to our 
investments in fibre and cable networks 
and strong growth in broadband customers. 
Services are charged either on a contract 
basis, typically for a fixed one to two year 
term, or on a prepaid (‘pay-as-you-go’) 
basis. Contract customers may also receive 
a mobile handset and the repayment for 
the handset is included in the monthly fee. 
The remainder of our revenue comprises 
non-service revenue for a variety of items 
such as sales of handsets and accessories.

we remain competitive
 – Reward loyalty to incentivise long-term 
customer relationships, and
 – Easy access to customer service contacts.

Investing in our infrastructure
Over the year we invested €7 .7 billion 
in network and IT infrastructure, which has 
enabled us to further expand our reliability, 
data speeds, coverage and customer service. 
According to independent tests conducted 
by agencies in 21 markets (including India), 
we are either first or second in terms of data 
network quality in 14 markets. 92% of our 
customers’ data usage in Europe is at speeds 
sufficient to watch high definition video and 
our dropped call rate of just 0.37% in Europe 
means we provide a reliable voice connection. 
Our high speed fixed broadband networks, 
including VodafoneZiggo, reach 36 million

Fit for  
Growth 
Managing our financial resources
Fit for Growth is a comprehensive cost 
efficiency programme to generate 
the funds to sustain future growth. 
This is based on external benchmarking 
analysis to determine the cost saving 
opportunity within each local market, as well 
as Group programmes where our global scale 
can provide a competitive advantage.
During the year, we continued to make 
significant cost savings in several areas. 
These included centralising procurement, 
utilising shared services, investment in direct 
sales channels so new customers reach 
us via branded rather than more expensive 
third party channels, standardisation 
of network and IT platforms and zero based 
budgeting initiatives. 
These savings have supported the 1.2 
percentage point improvement in organic 
Group adjusted EBITDA margin during the year.

want our employees to act in The Vodafone 
Way – by operating with speed, simplicity and 
trust
1
. Therefore, we have initiated three people 
programmes. First, initiatives focused on female 
employees to support our goal of building 
a diverse and inclusive organisation. These 
include our global maternity policy, introducing 
a global minimum maternity standard and our 
ReConnect initiative to bring women back into 
the workforce after a career break. Second, 
our enhanced CARE training initiative to ensure 
front line employees act with empathy for our 
customers and take ownership to solve their 
problems. To date 43,000 employees and third 
parties have completed the training. Third, 
incorporating digital technology to improve 
our hiring process, career development tools 
and the workplace experience.

Changes to KPIs this year
We have updated our KPIs to measure 
more accurately the impact of our core 
programmes on our strategic, operational 
and financial performance. 
To reflect our efficiency ambitions as part 
of the Fit for Growth programme we have 
added our goal to achieve higher organic 
adjusted EBITDA growth compared 
to service revenue growth. We have removed 
European average smartphone data usage 
as a separate KPI, as its impact is captured 
by the growth in 4G customers, which we view 
as an important driver fuelling overall data 
usage. We have also removed our employee 
engagement KPI as our performance is now 
comparable to our peers.

The incentive plans used to reward the 
performance of our Directors and our senior

The people behind  
our business
Our people are behind every aspect of our strategy and are 
committed to delivering superior network performance and 
providing a great customer experience.
A diverse and inclusive 
organisation
This year we employed an average of 108,271
1
 
people with 136 nationalities as well as over 
24,485 contractors. Our senior leadership 
team includes 21 nationalities, bringing 
together a diverse set of experiences and 
opinions to help us achieve our goals and 
better understand the needs of our customers. 
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion 
begins at the top, with clear leadership 
from the Vodafone Group Plc Board and 
is embedded at every level of every business 
through The Vodafone Way, the Code 
of Conduct and our Business Principles.
Living The Vodafone Way
The Vodafone Way underpins our culture and 
sets out the type of organisation we want 
to be. At the centre of The Vodafone Way 
is a focus on three core principles: speed, 
simplicity and trust. We want our people 
to respond swiftly and effectively to challenges 
and opportunities, especially those that affect 
our customers. We want them to do so while 
avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy and costly 
and cumbersome internal processes. 
And we want all of our business activities and 
decisions to be informed by an understanding 
that earning and retaining the trust of our 
customers, our employees and all other 
stakeholders must be integral to everything 
we do.
Doing what’s right
We recognise that ethical conduct is just 
as important as high performance and that 
failure to operate ethically will impact our 
business. Our “Code of Conduct” outlines 
the behaviours we expect from every single 
person working for and with Vodafone. 
Our “Business Principles” are the foundation 
of how we do business and set out the values 
we want everyone who works for or with 
Vodafone to respect. Together, these elements 
ensure we protect Vodafone’s reputation, 
our people and our assets. Further details 
can be found on The Vodafone Way, Code 
of Conduct and our Business Principles 
at vodafone.com/ governance.
Focusing on our customers
Over the last year, we have focused 
on improving customer experience through 
a new Vodafone Way of CARE training initiative. 
The core of the programme ensures front line 
staff act with empathy for customers, take 
ownership to solve their problem and for team 
leaders to coach performance. 
So far, more than 39,000 contact centre 
agents and team leads have completed the 
training, as well as over 4,000 retail store 
managers and advisers.
T raining our senior leaders has also been key and 
all leadership teams participated in a Customer 
Experience Leadership programme; a two-day 
workshop focused on listening to customers and 
understanding external best practices. This is all 
part of our approach to ensure the needs of our 
customers are understood and everyone leads 
by putting the customer first.
Attracting and developing 
great people
This year, we invested more than €80 million 
in employee training and development. 
Those programmes take many forms, from 
structured learning and formal training 
through to coaching and mentoring.
Our “Discover” programme for graduates 
accelerates the careers of high performing 
graduates, with over 890 people recruited 
onto this programme during the year. After the 
programme, a number of “Discovers” join 
our international programme, “Columbus”, 
with the purpose of building leadership skills 
through a challenging two-year assignment 
outside their home country.
These programmes are acknowledged and 
welcomed by our employees. In the 2016–17 
Global People Survey, 81% of employees 
surveyed said that they benefited from 
opportunities to learn the skills they needed 
to do their jobs well, a one percentage point 
increase in responses to the same question 
in the survey in the previous year.
We also look for ways to innovate and 
digitalise our recruitment and selection 
process to attract the best people. This year, 
we worked with HireVue to design a new 
end-to-end graduate experience embedding 
psychometric assessments into a video 
interview platform for a unified, world-class 
candidate experience.

Recognising performance
We reward people based on their performance, 
potential and contribution to our success. 
This year, to drive simplification, empower our 
line managers, and encourage more future-
focused and developmental conversations 
between employees and line managers 
we trialled a move away from our previous 
performance dialogue rating system. 
The simplified system was piloted with our 
senior management team and, if deemed 
successful, will be rolled out globally in the 
near future.
We continue to benchmark roles regularly 
to ensure competitive and fair remuneration 
in every country in which we operate. We 
also offer competitive retirement and other 
benefit provisions. Global short-term incentive 
plans are offered to a large percentage of 
employees and global long-term incentive 
plans are offered to our senior managers. Our 
arrangements are subject to company and 
individual performance measures.
Creating a safe place to work
We want everyone working with Vodafone 
to return home safely every day. Despite all 
of our efforts, we deeply regret to report 
1 1 recordable fatalities during the year.
Traffic accidents in emerging markets 
continue to be our main area of exposure. 
We have robust policies and processes in place 
to manage risks and if incidents occur we work 
hard to identify and address their root causes.
Our focus in the year has been on our top five 
safety risks (more information on health and 
safety on our company website) and we work 
with our people and our suppliers to ensure 
expectations and risks are understood and 
preventive actions are in place.
Improving employee wellbeing has also been 
a key area of focus. This year we launched our 
fourth annual Global Wellbeing Challenge 
on World Heart Day in October 2016. 
4,027 employees took part in a wide range 
of exercise activities. Together, they covered 
a total of 302,096 miles – equivalent to going 
1 2 times around the world, to the moon and 
a quarter of the way back – over 56,000 miles 
more than last year.
Increasing employee 
engagement
Every year , all our employees are invited 
to participate in a global survey which allows 
us to measure engagement levels, identify ways 
to improve how we do things and compare 
ourselves with 30 other large companies.
The 2016–17 survey demonstrated that 87% 
of employees who responded are proud 
to work for Vodafone, one point higher than 
in 2015–16. Our overall Engagement Index 
score – demonstrating our employees’ 
willingness to recommend Vodafone 
as an employer and their desire to continue 
working with us – rose by two points to 81%.
Digital workplace training and development – the Vodafone University
During the year, we launched a range of new digital collaboration tools as well as digital 
learning resources supporting a truly digital workspace. One of these initiatives is the 
Vodafone University, accessible to all employees at any time on any device. The Vodafone 
University brings together our specialist and professional courses covering areas such 
as sales and marketing, leadership, technology and customer service. Vodafone University 
programmes have been developed with the support of leading academic institutions 
including the London Business School, Harvard University and Imperial College and are 
also accredited by external training providers.

Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financials Additional information Sustainable business
A new strategic approach
Our businesses play an integral role in the daily 
lives of our 516 million mobile customers and 
are a vital part of the national infrastructure 
upon which the economies of our 26 countries 
of operation depend. Our sustainable business 
strategy is founded on Vodafone’s long-
standing commitment to responsible 
behaviour in everything we do. At the centre 
of that strategy, launched in 2016, is our 
intention to work towards three significant 
global transformation goals. Each goal has 
the potential to deliver meaningful socio-
economic benefits for our customers and for 
wider society. Importantly, each goal has been 
derived from, and will be achieved by means 
of, our core long-term business objectives. 
Our three transformation goals are:
 – women’s empowerment: we are strongly 
committed to diversity and inclusion 
and have set ourselves the ambition 
of becoming the world’s best employer 
for women by 2025. We also intend 
to bring the benefits of mobile – enabling 
access to education, healthcare and 
mobile money services – to an additional 
50 million female customers in emerging 
markets, including women in some of the 
world’s poorest communities;
 – energy innovation: our focus is to 
optimise energy efficiency in, and reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions from, our own 
activities. At the same time, we are working 
to help our customers to reduce their 
greenhouse gas emissions by two tonnes 
for every tonne we generate from our own 
operations; and
 – youth skills and jobs: we intend to apply 
our expertise in digital technologies to help 
young adults enhance their skills and 
secure employment as industries and 
companies embrace digital ways of working. 
We also intend to increase opportunities 
for young people to gain work experience 
within our businesses.
Sustainable business
Mobile and digital technologies play a powerful role in 
today’s societies and in building “a better tomorrow” , 
improving lives and livelihoods and creating new business 
opportunities and industries.
Our sustainable business strategy includes 
a significant focus on corporate transparency, 
with particular emphasis on four areas that 
are the source of greatest public debate 
and concern.
 – Taxation and total economic 
contribution. Our voluntary tax 
transparency report – the first of its 
kind in our industry – includes detailed 
disclosures on a country-by-country actual 
cash paid basis.
 – Digital rights and freedoms. 
Our transparency disclosures on matters 
related to digital human rights include 
our approach and principles on law 
enforcement agency access to private 
communications, freedom of expression, 
censorship and the digital rights of the child.
 – Supply chain integrity and safety. 
Our disclosures related to our sourcing 
and supply chain reflect the Group’s drive 
to ensure responsible and ethical behaviour 
among our suppliers and sub-suppliers and 
ensure safety in our operations.
 – Mobile, masts and health. We provide 
objective and accessible information 
to address public concerns regarding 
electromagnetic fields from mobile phones 
and base stations and explain our approach 
to compliance with international standards 
across all of our operating companies on our 
corporate website (vodafone.com/mmh).

Principles and practice
What we do matters but so does how we work. 
Our strategy covers the principles and practice 
that ensure we operate with integrity at all 
times and remain committed to the highest 
standards of ethical behaviour.
Energy innovation and 
greenhouse gas emissions
All businesses, big and small, have a critical 
role to play in helping to reduce greenhouse 
gas (‘GHG’) emissions in order to limit 
global temperature rises to well below 2ºC. 
The communications industry as a whole 
requires significant amounts of energy – 
in the form of electricity (and diesel for 
back-up generators) – to transmit vast 
amounts of data from billions of people, 
devices and machines.
During the year , we began to develop a new 
global energy strategy intended to bring about 
a significant increase in the efficiency of our own 
operations, coupled with a focus on increasing 
the adoption of lower -carbon and renewable 
energy sources. Our networks account for most 
of the energy consumed in our businesses 
and are the main source of our GHG emissions. 
Customer demand for data increases every 
year. This in turn increases the amount of energy 
we need. However, our focus on energy 
efficiency – working with our equipment 
suppliers – means that the rate of growth in our 
power requirements is much lower than the rate 
of growth in demand for data.
Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 26 During 201 7 , our total greenhouse gas 
emissions were the same as the previous 
year, at 2.59 million tonnes of CO
2
e (carbon 
dioxide equivalent) of which India accounts 
for 0.52 million tonnes CO
2
e despite an increase 
in the size of our network in response 
to customer data demand. We continued 
to improve our overall energy efficiency profile 
during the year and achieved a 37% reduction 
in the volume of GHG emissions produced 
per petabyte (‘PB’) of data carried to reach 
an average of 1, 140 tonnes CO
2
e per PB – 
the best performance recorded to date.
Our efforts to reduce our GHG emissions are 
only one aspect of our Energy Innovation goal. 
In parallel, we continue to innovate to help 
our customers minimise their energy needs, 
particularly through the development of Io T 
services, devices and processes that use 
network intelligence to optimise performance 
and minimise energy use – a field in which 
we are a world leader.

Business Women Connect in Tanzania
In Sub-Saharan Africa, access to financial services can be extremely challenging 
and women often find it harder than men to access land, equipment and other 
assets that would enhance their capacity to grow their businesses and improve 
their livelihoods.
Our programme in T anzania, Business Women Connect (‘BWC’), uses our mobile 
money services, M-Pesa and M-Pawa, to help women micro-business owners 
increase revenue and access loans via their mobile. BWC was launched in 2016 
in a partnership between TechnoServe, Vodacom, ExxonMobil Foundation, 
the World Bank and the Centre for Global Development. Since its launch, 
the programme has trained nearly 3,000 women in the use of M-Pawa while 
nearly 2,000 participants have also received business skills training.
Our goal is to help our customers reduce their 
CO
2
e emissions by two tonnes for every one 
tonne of emissions from our own operations 
by March 2018. We are well on track to meet 
that goal: as of the end of March 201 7 , we were 
helping our customers to save 1.9 tonnes 
of CO
2
e for every tonne of CO
2
e we generated 
through our own activities.
Human Rights
Communications technologies play 
an important role in underpinning 
human rights, enabling citizens to share 
information, communicate and learn. 
Some of our most salient human rights risks 
relate to the citizen’s right to privacy and 
freedom of expression. Our Digital Rights 
and Freedoms Reporting Centre (available 
on vodafone.com) sets out our policies and 
principles regarding a range of these issues.
In March 201 7 , Vodafone became a Board 
member of the Global Network Initiative (‘GNI’), 
a multi-stakeholder body bringing together 
communications and technology companies, 
civil society, academics and investors who 
share a commitment to privacy and freedom 
of expression. 
We are also fully mindful that other forms 
of human rights and other risks can arise 
within our own businesses and supply chain, 
including labour risks, unsafe workplace 
conditions, environmental degradation and 
bribery and corruption.
Our 201 7 Sustainable Business Report 
(vodafone.com/sustainability/report2017) 
sets out our progress against our global 
transformation goals and details our approach 
to mitigating the risks referred to above. 
We have also published a Slavery and 
Human Trafficking Statement and a Conflict 
Minerals Report, in line with our statutory 
reporting requirements.

Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financials Additional information Risk management
Identifying and  
managing our risks
We have a global framework for identifying and managing 
risk within our defined tolerance levels, in relation to both our 
operations and strategy. The framework has been designed to 
provide the Executive Committee and Board with a clear line of 
sight over risk and to enable informed decision making.
Our risk management 
framework
Our external operating environment 
is subject to constant and sometimes rapid 
change. We must be able to respond to this 
change, take appropriate levels of risk 
to protect our market position and take 
advantage of opportunities. Equally, failure 
to manage risk could have an adverse impact 
on the achievement of our strategic goals. 
To understand our risk profile and align 
it with our objectives and decision making 
processes, we operate a global framework 
that ensures we identify risk, set tolerance 
levels and consistently manage risk 
across our business. This also allows 
us to consolidate our view on risk looking 
across all local markets, functions and 
specialist areas. This line of sight gives 
management the information they need 
to make the right decisions for our business.

Report Our principal risks
We undertake a two stage process to identify our principal risks. All local markets and entities 
identify their priority risks which are consolidated into a Group-wide view. We then conduct 
interviews with over 40 senior leaders to gain their insights. The results of both exercises are 
consolidated to produce our principal risks, as reported here. 
Key changes in the year
Our risk profile remains stable relative to last year, with the following key changes: 
 – The two technology risks are now considered separately, as the causes for these are 
different (now risks 5 & 7).
 – The Customer eXperience eXcellence (‘CXX’) risk now focuses on digital capability (risk 8).
 – The adverse political measures risk now includes upcoming 5G auctions (risk 3).
Assurance and oversight 
of risks
In order to provide the Executive Committee, 
Audit & Risk Committee, and Board with a clear 
view on how we mitigate our principal risks and 
whether the mitigations are effective, we apply 
a model of co-ordinated assurance. Our Risk, 
Compliance and Internal Audit communities 
work together on planning, executing and 
reporting assurance activities to ensure 
that there is adequate coverage across the 
control environment with a robust level 
of independent testing. 
Information gathered through our 
co-ordinated assurance process is provided 
to the relevant committees to help drive 
informed decision making. It also helps senior 
management to understand our overall risk 
profile, current levels of control and the culture 
of our business. 
Strengthening our framework 
We constantly strive to improve risk 
management and have made the following 
enhancements over the last 1 2 months:
 – A consistent reporting and oversight 
methodology has been extended across all 
local markets and entities. 
 – We have increased our engagement with 
risk owners to improve monitoring of key 
risks, actions and indicators.
 – We have invested in a global risk tool, which 
allows us to standardise the data stored 
on all risks and to share information across 
the Group.
 – We have worked to develop our risk 
community through best practice sharing, 
training and our annual Global Risk Forum.

What is the risk?
A successful cyber-attack or internal event could result 
in us not being able to deliver services to our customers 
and/or failing to protect their data. 
What is the impact?
Failing to protect our customer information and service 
availability could have major customer, financial, 
reputational and regulatory impact in all markets in which 
we operate.
What is our target tolerance position?
We aim for a secure digital future for our customers. 
Security underpins our commitment to protecting our 
customers with reliable connections and keeping their 
data safe. 
This corresponds to strong preventative, detective 
and responsive controls to minimise the risk 
of a successful attack.
What is the risk?
We face increased competition from a variety of new 
technology providers, new market entrants, evolving 
customer needs and competitor consolidation. 
We must be able to keep pace with new technology and 
to compete in changing markets.
What is the impact?
Our market position and revenues could be damaged 
by failing to provide the services that our customers want 
at a fair price. 
What is our target tolerance position?
We aim for a fair and competitive environment in all of our 
markets, and adopt strategies to deliver this through the 
use of innovative products, services and pricing models. 
We also work with regulators and governments to ensure 
a fair and competitive environment. 
What is the risk?
We operate under licence in most markets and face 
regular changes in regulation, law and operating 
environments. Significant adverse changes, for example 
to tax laws, spectrum pricing or an unfavourable 
regulatory landscape for multi-national companies, could 
impact our ability to do business in our preferred manner. 
What is the impact?
If the cost of operations were to significantly increase, 
directly or indirectly, this would impact our profitability 
and returns to shareholders.
What is our target tolerance position?
We seek actively to engage with governments and tax 
authorities to encourage good working relationships 
and to help shape potential impacts of legislative change 
on the Group.
We look for spectrum auctions to be fair for all 
participants both in terms of ability to access auctions 
and pricing of spectrum.
What is the risk?
We face competition in key markets from providers who 
have the ability to sell converged services on their existing 
infrastructure, with regulation that often fails to deliver 
a level playing field across fixed and content markets.
What is the impact?
If we fail to deliver converged services, either through 
not being able to access infrastructure or content 
at a reasonable price, or through ineffective integration 
of acquired fixed assets, this could lead to higher 
customer churn and/or significant downward pressure 
on prices.
What is our target tolerance position?
We seek a sustainable competitive position to protect our 
mobile market share and grow our fixed broadband and 
TV activities in markets with increasing convergence.
What is the risk?
As we undertake major IT change programmes 
in a number of markets, there is a risk that these projects 
disrupt services or do not provide the benefits that they 
should in a timely manner.
What is the impact?
A significant implementation and migration failure could 
result in a major impact on our customers, revenues, 
costs and reputation.
What is our target tolerance position?
We seek successful IT transformation initiatives as  
the vehicle for delivering a great customer experience, 
high-quality reliable systems, improving our time 
to market and enabling best-in-class digital capabilities.
Cyber threat and information security
Market disruption
Adverse political and regulatory measures
Failure to converge and integrate acquisitions
IT transformation failure
What is the risk?
As a multinational business, we operate in many 
countries and currencies so changes to global economic 
conditions can impact us. This could be because a global 
crisis results in reduced spending power for customers 
or because a relative strengthening or weakening of the 
major currencies in which we transact could impact our 
profitability and cash flow.
What is the impact?
The potential for another global financial crisis may 
lead to further economic instability and subsequent 
reductions in corporate and consumer spending 
or an impact on capital markets that could restrict 
our refinancing requirements.
What is our target tolerance position?
We take a conservative approach to financial risks which 
reflects our diverse business. 
We carefully manage our liquidity and access 
to capital markets to limit our exposure to unstable 
economic conditions.
Unstable economic conditions/inadequate liquidity
Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 30 How do we manage it?
We have a risk based security strategy that is delivered 
by a leading cyber defence team who implement 
customer-focused security controls centrally and 
in local markets, and we have embarked on a continuous 
improvement programme to mitigate the changing 
threats we face.
Key risk indicators
We monitor multiple trends including:
 – Privileged user access levels
 – Confirmed security incidents
 – Critical vulnerabilities
Changes since last report
Organisations in all sectors are targeted by an increasing 
volume and sophistication of cyber attacks. We have 
continued to: improve our cyber defences; upgrade our 
internal controls; and to educate our people, suppliers 
and customers on how to protect our customers’ 
information and communications, networks and assets.
How do we manage it?
We aim to offer a superior customer experience and 
continually improve our offering through a wide set 
of innovative products and services, including fixed and 
mobile content, IoT and voice over LTE.
We monitor the competitor landscape in all markets, 
and react appropriately; working to make sure each 
market has a fair and competitive environment.
Key risk indicators
 – Trends in competitor behaviour and new technologies
 – Level of customers actively using our new products 
and services
Changes since last report
This risk has increased due to a growing use of OTT voice 
apps, changing competitor business models and new 
entrants in some of our markets. In the case of new 
competitors, we have responded by changing our 
approach such as entering into a joint venture in India, 
to ensure that we remain in the best possible position 
to compete.
How do we manage it?
We maintain constructive but robust engagement with 
tax authorities, relevant government representatives 
and non-governmental organisations, as well as active 
engagement with a wide range of international 
companies and business organisations with similar issues. 
We plan our approach to spectrum auctions to ensure 
we achieve fair access at sustainable prices.
Key risk indicators
We monitor:
 – Public sentiment, changes to laws and regulations, 
number and value of disputes across the Group
 – Benchmarking of spectrum cost between countries 
Changes since last report
This risk has increased due to the evolution of national 
politics, which could have an impact on multinational 
companies, the potential for government spectrum 
auctions to push pricing for 5G beyond reasonable levels, 
and increasing instability in some of our markets.
How do we manage it?
We actively look for opportunities, in all markets, 
to provide services beyond mobile through organic 
investment, acquisitions, partnerships, or joint ventures. 
We carefully manage the integration of acquired 
businesses and joint ventures through the alignment 
of policies, processes and systems to ensure maximum 
benefit is delivered.
Key risk indicators
We track various metrics around:
 – Achievement of synergies
 – Next Generation Network (‘NGN’) reach
 – Available assets
 – Number of converged accounts
Changes since last report
This risk has decreased overall due to successful 
merger activities, improved access to assets and 
an increased number of converged customers. 
However, we need to continue to focus on ensuring our 
mobile and fixed customer bases are fully converged, 
and that we successfully integrate and manage our 
acquired assets.
How do we manage it?
We use a standardised programme methodology across 
all major IT transformation programmes to ensure 
a high-quality start up process and increase the certainty 
of the outcome.
We ensure careful testing of all new developments, 
particularly customer-facing solutions, prior to go -live.
Key risk indicators
We consider trends in:
 – Customer disruption
 – Unplanned spend 
 – Return on capital employed
Changes since last report
We have launched a new global approach 
to IT transformation programmes. The process was 
designed to ensure that lessons learnt from previous 
transformation projects are fed into new projects 
to encourage consistency and strengthen governance.

Risk management (continued)
What is the risk?
If our network or IT systems fail, voice, video or data 
transmissions may be significantly interrupted. We need 
to ensure that our critical assets are protected and our 
systems are resilient, so that the impact on our customers 
is avoided or minimised.
What is the impact?
Major incidents caused by suppliers, natural disasters 
or an extreme technology failure, although rare, 
could result in the complete loss of a key technology 
site causing severe impact on our customers, revenues 
and reputation. 
What is our target tolerance position?
Our customer promise is based on reliable availability 
of our network, therefore the recovery of critical mobile, 
fixed and IT services must be fast and robust.
What is the risk?
Failure to deliver a digital, differentiated and 
superior experience to our customers in store, 
online and by phone, could diminish our brand and 
reputation. To do this we need to be agile with strong 
digital capabilities.
What is the impact?
This risk is relevant to all our markets, in both our 
consumer and Enterprise businesses. 
Failure to deliver on our digital and customer experience 
objectives could result in lack of differentiation leading 
to increased customer churn and eventual loss 
of market share. 
What is our target tolerance position?
The Customer eXperience eXcellence (‘CXX’) programme 
is designed to ensure the customer is always at the heart 
of everything we do. 
We have a customer experience framework and facilitate 
best practice sharing and support to local markets. 
What is the risk?
Vodafone must comply with a multitude 
of local and international laws as well as more specific 
regulation. These include licence requirements, 
customer registration, data privacy, anti-money 
laundering, competition law, anti-bribery law and 
economic sanctions. 
What is the impact?
Non-compliance with legislation or regulatory 
requirements could lead to reputational damage, 
financial penalties and/or suspension of our licence 
to operate. 
What is our target tolerance position?
We seek to comply with all applicable laws and 
regulations in all of our markets.
We seek to process personal data honestly, ethically, 
with integrity, and always consistent with applicable 
laws and our values.
What is the risk?
If we do not understand the needs of our Enterprise 
customers and contract on the correct basis to account 
for the complexity of requirements, we will not be able 
to profitably deliver services. 
What is the impact?
Failure to deliver these Enterprise services profitably may 
lead to a reduction in our expected revenue and could 
impact our credibility to deliver on large, complex deals. 
What is our target tolerance position?
We pursue, win and deliver new Enterprise 
business profitably.
We deliver against the commitments made to the 
customer and will manage change throughout.
We deliver the best customer experience at every 
interaction with Vodafone.
T echnology failure

with potential impacts including: changes to national 
legislation, a reduction in mobile phone usage 
or litigation.
What is the impact?
This is an unlikely risk; however, it would have a major 
impact on services used by our customers in all our 
markets – particularly in countries that have a very low 
tolerance for environmental and health related risks.
What is our target tolerance position?
Vodafone does not want to expose anyone to EMF levels 
above those mandated by regulators. 
We comply with national standards, where existing, 
and with our own EMF policy, based on international 
science guidelines. Our vision is to lead within the 
industry in responding to public concern about mobiles, 
masts and health.

How do we manage it?
Unique recovery targets are set for critical sites to limit 
the impact of service outages. A global policy supports 
these targets with minimum controls to ensure 
effective resilience.
We monitor the lifespan of critical assets and maintain 
back up where necessary.
Key risk indicators
 – Number of critical sites able to meet the 
recovery targets
 – Levels of incidents/near misses
Changes since last report
This risk is considered stable as we continue to implement 
improvements to the resilience capabilities of our critical 
mobile, fixed and IT sites.
How do we manage it?
We have central and local CXX teams in place. 
Minimum standards and implementation plans for CXX 
have been developed for each local market. We link our 
senior leaders’ remuneration to customer appreciation 
KPIs. Benchmarking is underway on digital capabilities 
in each market.
Key risk indicators
 – Measurement of NPS
 – Implementation and monitoring of minimum 
CXX standards
Changes since last report
This risk has been expanded to include a focus 
on delivering a differentiated digital experience for 
our customers. For this reason, the risk is considered 
increased, despite the continued success of our 
CXX programme.
How do we manage it?
We have subject matter experts in legal and regulatory 
teams at a local and global level, and a robust policy 
compliance framework.
We train our employees in “Doing what’s right”, 
our training and awareness programme which sets our 
ethical culture across the organisation and ensures 
employees understand their role in ensuring compliance.
Key risk indicators
 – Results of the annual compliance testing programme
 – Number of Speak Up cases in each market
 – Changes to applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements
Changes since last report
With mature compliance programmes in place, this 
risk remains stable. We actively seek to improve 
these programmes and this year will see a focus 
on ensuring compliance with the EU General Data 
Protection Regulation.
How do we manage it?
We manage the commercial and reputational risks 
through strict new product development, deal 
governance, customer solution delivery and service 
management processes. 
Key risk indicators
We track trends in:
 – NPS
 – Revenue and major contract profitability
 – Order completion rates
 – Cumulative deal risk
Changes since last report
Due to the successful implementation of a number 
of process improvements, this risk has decreased.
We have improved deal governance and now have 
stronger in-life contractual management processes.

Brexit implications
The Board continues to keep the possible 
implications of Brexit for Vodafone’s operations 
under review. A cross-functional team, led by two 
Executive Committee members, has identified 
ways in which Brexit might affect the Group’s 
operations. Despite the Article 50 Notice 
having been served, there remains insufficient 
information about the likely terms of the post-
Brexit arrangements between the UK and the 
EU, as well as about any possible transitional 
arrangements, to draw any conclusions about 
the probable impact. Although we are a UK 
headquartered company, a large majority of our 
customers are in other countries, accounting for 
most of our revenue and cash flow. Each of our 
national operating companies is a standalone 
business, incorporated and licensed in the 
jurisdiction in which it operates, and able to adapt 
to a wide range of local developments. As such, 
our ability to provide services to our customers 
in the countries in which we operate, inside or 
outside the EU, is very unlikely to be affected by 
Brexit. We are not a major international trading 
company, and do not use passporting for any of 
our major services or processes.
Depending on the arrangements agreed 
between the UK and the EU, two issues that 
could directly affect our operations, in both cases 
potentially causing us to incur additional cost, are:
 – creation of a data frontier between the 
UK and the EU: the inability to move data 
freely between the UK and EU countries might 
cause us to have to move some technical 
facilities, and affect future network design.
 – inability to access the talent we need to run 
a multinational Group operation from the 
UK: increased controls over or restrictions 
to our ability to employ leading talent from 
non-UK markets could cause us to have 
to adjust our operating model to ensure that 
we attract and retain the best people for the 
roles we have.
A further, indirect, issue that could affect our 
future performance would arise if the Brexit 
process caused significant revisions to macro-
economic performance in our major European 
markets including the UK, thus affecting 
the economic climate in which we operate, 
and in turn impacting the performance of the 
operating companies in those markets.
Long-T erm Viability Statement
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors have assessed the 
prospects of the Group over a period significantly longer than 12 months from the approval 
of the financial statements. The Board has concluded that the most relevant time period for 
this assessment should be three years to align with the Group’s normal business forecasting 
cycle and the long-range plan to 31 March 2020, as well as taking into consideration the 
pace of ongoing change in the telecoms industry. The assessment for this three year period 
includes consideration of the forecast cash flows and obligations of Vodafone India.
The plans and projections prepared as part of this forecasting cycle include the Group’s cash 
flows, committed and required funding and other key financial ratios. They were drawn 
up on the basis that debt refinance will be available in all plausible market conditions and 
that there will be no material changes to the business structure over the review period. 
As of 31 March 2017 , the Group had sources of liquidity (primarily comprised of certain cash 
and cash equivalent balances) and available facilities, of €18.8 billion, which includes undrawn 
Revolving Credit Facilities expiring in FY2020/21. 
The Risk Management Framework on page 28 outlines the approach the Board has taken 
to identifying and managing risk. In making this statement, the Board carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, detailed on pages 30 to 33, including those 
that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. 
Against this background, the output of the long-range plan has been used to perform 
central debt profile and cash headroom analysis, including a review of sensitivity to “business 
as usual” risks to revenue and profit growth. In addition, severe but plausible scenarios in the 
event of each of the principal risks materialising individually and where multiple risks occur 
in parallel, were also tested. This combined scenario included the impact of failing to execute 
key elements of our strategy and respond to market disruption resulting in a significant loss 
of market share to converged and OTT players. This was considered together with a major 
cyber-attack and a subsequent General Data Protection Regulation fine, as well as the 
macro political uncertainty resulting in restricted access to capital markets and devaluation 
of emerging market currencies.
T o assess viability, the headroom position under these scenarios has been calculated using 
the cash and facilities available to the Group. The assessment took into account the availability 
and likely effectiveness of the mitigating actions that could be taken to reduce the impact 
of the identified underlying risks. The headroom remained positive in all scenarios tested.
Having considered the principal risks that the Group may face, the Directors consider that this 
stress-testing based assessment of the Group’s prospects is reasonable in the circumstances, 
taking into account the inherent uncertainty involved. Although this review has considered 
severe but plausible scenarios relevant to the Group, any such review cannot consider all 
risks which may occur, therefore an overall view of the total level of risk required to impede 
our viability was also considered. The cash and available facilities at year end, along with the 
mitigating actions available to reduce cash outgoings, provides a sufficient level of headroom.
Based on the results of their analysis, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the three year period ending 31 March 2020.

Notes:
1 With effect from 1 April 2016, the Group’s presentation currency was changed from pounds sterling to the euro to better align with the geographic split of the Group’s operations. The results 
for the year ended 31 March 2016 have been restated into euros and include the results of Vodafone India as discontinued operations following the agreement to combine it with Idea Cellular. 
Group revenue and service revenue includes the results of Europe, AMAP , Other (which includes the results of partner markets) and eliminations. 2017 results reflect average foreign exchange 
rates of €1:£0.84, €1:INR 73.58, €1:ZAR 15.43, €1:TRY 3.51 and €1: EGP 13.60.
2 Service revenue, adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating profit are alternative performance measures which are non-GAAP measures that are presented to provide readers 
with additional financial information that is regularly reviewed by management and should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to the equivalent GAAP measure. See “Alternative 
performance measures” on page 205 for reconciliations to the closest respective equivalent GAAP measure and “Definition of terms” on page 218 for further details.
3 The “Other” segment primarily represents the results of shareholder recharges received from Vodafone Netherlands, VodafoneZiggo and Vodafone India, partner markets and the net result 
of unallocated central Group costs.
4 Includes a €1.3 billion gain (2016: €nil) on the formation of the VodafoneZiggo joint venture in the Netherlands.
Revenue
Group revenue decreased 4.4% to €47 .6 billion and service revenue 
decreased by 3.7% to €43.0 billion.
In Europe, organic service revenue increased 0.6%* and in AMAP , 
organic service revenue increased by 7 .7%*. Further details on the 
performance of these regions is set out below.
Adjusted EBITDA
Group adjusted EBITDA remained stable at €14.1 billion, with organic 
growth in Europe and AMAP more than offset by foreign exchange 
movements and M&A and other activity. The Group’s adjusted EBITDA 
margin improved by 1.3 percentage points to 29.7%. On an organic 
basis, adjusted EBITDA rose 5.8%* and the Group’s adjusted EBITDA 
margin increased by 1.2* percentage points driven by organic margin 
improvements in both Europe and AMAP .
Adjusted EBIT
Adjusted EBIT increased by 5.3% to €4.0 billion as adjusted EBITDA 
growth outpaced the increase in depreciation and amortisation. 
On an organic basis adjusted EBIT increased by 7 .0%* for the year.

Operating profit
Adjusted operating profit excludes certain income and expenses that 
we have identified separately to allow their effect on the results of the 
Group to be assessed (see page 205). The items that are included 
in operating profit but are excluded from adjusted operating profit 
are discussed below.
No impairment losses were recognised in the current year in respect 
of the Group’s continuing operations (2016: €569 million in Romania). 
Further detail is provided in note 4 to the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements. 
Restructuring costs of €415 million (2016: €316 million) primarily reflect 
discrete cost efficiency actions taken during the year in Germany and 
the UK.
Amortisation of intangible assets in relation to customer bases and 
brands are recognised under accounting rules after we acquire 
businesses and decreased to €1,046 million (2016: €1,338 million) 
due to the acquisitions of KDG, Vodafone Italy and Ono.
Including the above items, operating profit increased by €2.4 billion 
to €3.7 billion, due to a €1.3 billion gain on the formation of the 
VodafoneZiggo joint venture in the Netherlands which for accounting 
purposes was characterised as a part disposal of the Group’s interest 
in Vodafone Netherlands, €0.5 billion lower depreciation and 
amortisation charges, partially as a result of the treatment of our 
Netherlands operation as an asset held for sale during the year and 
the €0.6 billion impairment charge recognised in the year ended 
31 March 2016.

Note:
1 The Group has changed the basis of calculation of the adjusted effective tax rate to focus 
on the Group’s controlled businesses, more closely aligning the adjusted effective rate to the 
cash taxes reported by the Group.
The Group’s adjusted effective tax rate for its controlled businesses for 
the year ended 31 March 2017 was 25.4% compared to 26.6% for the 
last financial year. The lower rate in the current year is primarily due 
to a change in the mix of the Group’s profits. We expect the adjusted 
effective tax rate to remain in the mid-twenties over the medium term.
The Group’s adjusted effective tax rate for both years does not include 
the following items: a reduction in our Luxembourg deferred tax assets 
of €2,651 million following a reduction in the Luxembourg corporate 
tax rate to 26.0%; deferred tax on the use of Luxembourg losses 
of €369 million (2016: €541 million); and a decrease in the deferred tax 
asset of €1,275 million (2016: €4,228 million) arising from a revaluation 
of investments based upon the local GAAP financial statements and tax 
returns, partially offset by a reduction in the deferred tax asset as a result 
of lower interest rates. These items change the total losses we have 
available for future use against our profits in Luxembourg and do not 
affect the amount of tax we pay in other countries.
Earnings per share
Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes the results of Vodafone 
India which are now included in discontinued operations, was 8.04 
eurocents, an increase of 17 .0% year-on-year, as higher adjusted 
operating profit and lower net financing costs more than offset the 
increase in the number of shares following the issuance of mandatory 
convertible bonds in February 2016 which are classified as equity after 
taking into account the cost of future coupon payments.
Basic loss per share was 22.51 eurocents (2016: loss per share 
of 20.25 eurocents) as the €1.3 billion gain on the formation 
of the VodafoneZiggo joint venture in the Netherlands was offset 
by impairment charges of €3.7 billion, net of tax, recognised during 
the year in discontinued operations and the changes in deferred tax 
on losses, as described above, both of which have been excluded from 
adjusted earnings per share.

Service revenue grew 1.9%* for the year (Q3: 1.8%*, Q4: 1.2%*) driven 
by customer growth in both mobile and fixed and stabilising mobile 
contract ARPU, which more than offset regulatory drags. The slowdown 
in the final quarter reflected the full impact of the mobile and fixed 
termination cuts, (a 1.3 percentage point year-on-year headwind), 
as well as the lapping of an accounting reclassification in fixed in the 
prior financial year. 
Mobile service revenue grew 0.1%* (Q3: flat*, Q4: -0.4%*) 
as a higher customer base was offset by regulatory headwinds. 
Excluding regulation (including the MTR cut from 1 December and 
the decline in roaming revenues), mobile service revenue grew 1.6%* 
(Q3: 1.1%*, Q4: 1.8%*). Aided by “more-for-more” propositions and 
successful “Giga moves” campaigns, consumer mobile contract ARPU 
returned to growth in Q4, while contract net additions accelerated in the 
second half (Q4: 123,000 Q3: 61,000) supported by a reduction in churn 
and higher activity in direct channels. The Enterprise mobile market 
remained competitive, however ARPU declines moderated throughout 
the year. Our 4G customer base surpassed 10 million by the period end, 
as we reached 90% 4G population coverage.
Fixed service revenues increased 4.8%* (Q3: 4.8%*, Q4 3.7%*) driven 
by strong broadband customer growth, with 433,000 net customer 
additions (Q4: 123,000), of which 320,000 were on cable and the 
remainder on DSL. Our “GigaKombi” convergence offer, launched in the 
summer last year, continues to gain traction, reaching 357 ,000 accounts 
by year end. We also launched our “GigaTV” advanced digital TV service 
in February 2017 , and our TV customer base reached 7 .7 million at the 
end of the period. Following upgrades to our superior coax-fibre cable 
network during the year, we now offer 400 Mbps speeds to almost 
6 million households (out of our total NGN footprint of 12.6 million). 
Adjusted EBITDA grew 4.5%* with the adjusted EBITDA margin 
improving by 1.5 percentage points to 34.1%. Margin expansion 
was driven by revenue growth, our focus on more profitable 
direct channels and a reduction of underlying operating costs. 
This was supported by exceeding our full year cost and capex target 
synergies of €300 million from the integration of Kabel Deutschland. 
Adjusted EBITDA growth accelerated to 6.0%* in H2, as commercial 
costs stabilised following an increase in H1. 
Italy
Service revenue grew 2.3%* for the year (Q3: 3.0%*, Q4: 2.8%*) 
supported by mobile and fixed ARPU growth and an acceleration 
in consumer fixed performance.
Mobile service revenue grew 1.5%* (Q3: 1.4%*, Q4: 1.4%*) driven 
by ARPU growth in prepaid following changes to our tariff plans and 
improved data monetisation through targeted “more-for-more” 
offers. In Q4, the prepaid pricing environment became increasingly 
competitive, particularly in the below-the-line channels, however 
customer losses moderated somewhat compared to Q3. As at 31 March 
2017 we had reached over 97% population coverage on our 4G network 
and had 9.0 million 4G customers, adding 2.5 million customers within 
the year. 
Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 38
Operating results (continued) Fixed service revenue was up 6.8%* (Q3: 1 1.9%*, Q4: 10.2%*) driven 
by strong customer growth and ARPU improvement across all 
segments during the second half of the financial year. We added 
224,000 broadband customers (Q3: 70,000, Q4: 75,000) during the 
year, and in total we now have 2.2 million broadband customers 
of which 0.7 million are on fibre. We also launched our advanced 
digital “Vodafone TV” proposition in March 201 7 , which is gaining 
good early traction. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew significantly faster than revenues at 10.6%*, 
with a 3.0 percentage point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin 
to 36.5%. This was driven by a strong revenue performance and tight 
cost control, with absolute declines in both customer and operating 
costs during the year.
UK
Our UK operational performance was disrupted during the year 
by mistakes made during the implementation of a new billing system 
in the final calendar quarter of 2015. We have now resolved these 
challenges, with billing accuracy improving to 99.9% and customer 
service levels now above those achieved prior to the implementation 
of the new system. In the fourth quarter we delivered our best ever 
network performance, which is reflected in our ranking as the best voice 
provider and the co-leader for data in the latest independent P3 test.
Our financial performance lagged behind this operational recovery. 
Service revenue declined 3.3%* (Q3: -3.2%*, Q4: -4.8%*) reflecting the 
impact of operational challenges, increased competition in Enterprise 
and lower roaming revenues. The slowdown in the final quarter 
mainly reflected a strong prior year comparator in carrier services 
and Enterprise. 
Mobile service revenue declined 3.3%* (Q3: -3.9%*, Q4: -3.9%*) 
as a result of higher churn, an increase in the SIM only mix driving 
lower ARPU, increased competition in Enterprise and lower 
roaming and MVNO revenues. Improved operational performance 
contributed to lower contract churn rates and growth in branded 
contract customers during the final quarter. We have 9.5 million 4G 
customers at the end of the period, with 4G coverage at 96% (Ofcom 
definition: 98%). 
Fixed service revenue declined 3.4%* (Q3: -0.9%*, Q4: -7 .5%*). 
Excluding carrier service revenue, fixed service revenue declined 2.5%* 
in Q4, reflecting a strong comparator together with the ongoing effect 
of two large contract losses during the year as we balanced our growth 
objectives with a focus on customer profitability. We continued to gain 
good momentum in consumer broadband with 216,000 customers 
by the end of the period (Q4: 33,000 net additions), of which 163,000 
are consumer customers. 
Adjusted EBITDA declined 15.8%* excluding the benefit of one-off 
settlements with other network operators in the prior year, with 
a 3.3 percentage point decline in adjusted EBITDA margin. The decline 
was driven by lower revenues, increased costs as a result of sterling 
weakness post Brexit, regulatory headwinds and reallocation of costs 
across Vodafone Group. These headwinds were partially offset 
by a reduction in underlying operating costs. Excluding the reallocation 
of central costs, sterling weakness and one-off settlements, adjusted 
EBITDA declined at a high-single digit rate both for the year and in H2.
Spain
Service revenue grew 0.9%* (Q3: 0.8%*, Q4: 1.3%*). Excluding the 
impact of handset financing, service revenue grew by 4.0%* in the year 
(Q3: 4.1%*, Q4: 3.8%*). This performance improvement was driven by our 
strong commercial momentum in mobile and fixed, supported by our 
“more-for-more” propositions at the start of the year. 
We maintained our leadership in both consumer and enterprise NPS, 
widening the gap versus our competitors during the year. Vodafone One, 
our fully integrated fixed, mobile and TV service, reached 2.4 million 
customers at the end of the period, up from 1.5 million a year ago. 
Our commercial momentum has remained strong throughout the year 
with 337 ,000 mobile contract net additions (Q3: 97 ,000, Q4: 96,000) 
and 209,000 fixed broadband net additions (Q3: 93,000, Q4: 75,000). 
Our fixed performance accelerated in the second half of the year 
as we focused on cross selling services to our mobile base. Our TV base 
reached 1.3 million (246,000 net additions during the year), reflecting 
the improvement in our content packages. 
Our market-leading 4G coverage reached 93% at the end of the period 
and we now have 7 .6 million 4G customers. In March 2017 , we reached 
a commercial wholesale agreement with Telefónica to access its fibre 
network in both regulated and deregulated areas, which expands our 
NGN footprint to 18.7 million homes passed (almost 65% population 
coverage), of which 10.2 million are on our own network. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew 8.8%*, and adjusted EBITDA margin improved 
by 2.1 percentage points to 27 .3%. This improvement was driven 
by service revenue growth, lower mobile handset subsidies and 
a lower operating cost base; these more than offset sharply higher 
content costs.
Other Europe
Service revenue grew by 2.2%* (Q3: 1.8%*, Q4: 1.3%*), with all of the 
larger markets growing in Q4 (excluding the MTR impact in Ireland). 
Adjusted EBITDA grew 3.2%* and adjusted EBITDA margin improved 
by 0.1 percentage points, reflecting good cost control. 
In Ireland, service revenue was flat* for the year but grew 2.0% excluding 
MTRs (Q4: -1.2%*, 2.3% ex. MTRs) supported by ongoing fixed customer 
growth. Portugal service revenue grew 1.7%* (Q4: 2.2%*), with strong 
fixed customer growth as our FTTH roll-out reached 2.7 million homes, 
which was partially offset by mobile service revenue declines (which 
moderated throughout the year). In Greece, service revenue grew 0.5%* 
(Q4: 0.2%*) driven by growth in consumer fixed service revenue.
VodafoneZiggo
The joint venture between Vodafone Netherlands and Ziggo 
(VodafoneZiggo, in which Vodafone owns a 50% stake) was formed 
on 31 December 2016. Note that VodafoneZiggo’s quarterly reports for 
credit investors are published on a US GAAP basis, whereas Vodafone 
Group reports the results of the joint venture on an IFRS basis.
VodafoneZiggo experienced a decline in local currency revenue of 2% 
in Q4. The decline in local currency mobile service revenue (Q4: -7%) 
reflected increasing competition, particularly in the SoHo segment. 
Cable subscription revenues stabilised in Q4, as increased ARPU offset 
a decline in the customer base, and in the B2B segment (mid and large-
sized enterprises) revenues grew 1%, supported by mobile growth. 
Excluding the impact of the divestment of Vodafone “Thuis”, we added 
16,000 postpaid mobile customers in the quarter, supported by our 
successful promotional campaign. We also added 1 1,000 broadband 
RGU additions in the quarter, with significantly fewer video subscriber 
losses (an outflow of 18,500 RGUs) compared to the prior year. 
Adjusted EBITDA in local currency declined by 6% in Q4, as lower 
revenues and higher mobile acquisition and content costs were only 
partially offset by underlying cost reductions. During the quarter, 
Vodafone received €7 6 million in dividends from the joint venture 
and €14 million in interest payments on the shareholder loan.

Vodacom
Vodacom Group service revenue increased 4.1%* (Q3: 4.0%*, Q4: 3.8%*), 
supported by strong customer additions, data usage and enterprise 
growth in South Africa. Vodacom’s International operations were 
impacted by a change in customer registration requirements in the prior 
year, which slowed customer growth during the period. 
In South Africa service revenue grew 5.6%* (Q3: 5.6%*, Q4: 5.6%*), with 
continued strong customer growth in both the prepaid and contract 
base supported by our effective segmentation strategy. We added 
3.2 million prepaid mobile customers (Q4: 1.2 million) in the year and 
contract churn remained at historically low levels. Data revenue growth 
remained strong at 20% for the year, supported by growth in active data 
customers (19.5 million), data bundle sales (almost 500 million sold 
during the year, up 45%), and higher usage. Voice revenue fell by 3.7%*, 
with the pace of decline slowing in the final quarter due to the success 
of our personalised voice bundle strategy on our “Just 4 You” platform. 
Our market-leading network has now reached 76% 4G coverage 
(up from 58% in the prior year), and we have 6.0 million 4G customers. 
Vodacom’s international operations outside South Africa, which now 
represent 22.5% of Vodacom Group service revenue, grew 2.3%* 
(Q3: 1.9%*, Q4: 0.5%*) supported by commercial actions such as the 
introduction of “Just 4 You” personalised offers across all markets. 
Commercial momentum stabilised towards the end of the year 
as we began to lap the changes in customer registration requirements 
in T anzania, the DRC and Mozambique, while political and economic 
disruptions adversely impacted the DRC’s performance. M-Pesa 
customers totalled 10 million in Q4 (up from 6.8 million the prior year). 
Vodacom Group adjusted EBITDA grew 4.9%*, with a 0.9 percentage 
point adjusted EBITDA margin improvement to 39.0%. In South Africa, 
margin improvement was supported by a subsidy shift towards data 
enabled devices, improved channel efficiencies, rationalisation of offices 
and network cost savings. International margins declined modestly 
as revenue growth was lower than underlying cost inflation.
Other AMAP
Service revenue grew by 10.8%* (Q3: 10.5%*, Q4: 9.8%*), with strong 
local currency growth in Turkey, Egypt and Ghana. 
Service revenue in Turkey was up 16.0%* (Q3: 15.0%*, Q4: 13.9%*), 
supported by good growth in consumer contract, strong fixed customer 
momentum and a robust performance in Enterprise. Adjusted EBITDA 
grew 29.9%*, with an adjusted EBITDA margin improvement of 2.5 
percentage points to 21.2% driven by lower commercial spend and 
improved operating cost control. 
Egypt service revenue grew by 15.6%* (Q3: 19.6%*, Q4: 22.8%*) as rising 
data penetration drove higher ARPU. Adjusted EBITDA grew 22.7%*, 
with a 2.6 percentage point adjusted EBITDA margin improvement 
to 44.4% as revenue growth and cost discipline more than offset high 
inflationary pressures. 
Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 40
Operating results (continued) In New Zealand, service revenue was up 0.8%* (Q3: flat*, Q4: 0.3%*) 
with strong fixed performance and mobile customer growth across 
both consumer and Enterprise. In February 2017 , the New Zealand 
Commerce Commission (‘NZCC’) did not approve the proposed merger 
with Sky Network Television. We are reviewing the reasoning of the 
NZCC and have reserved the right to appeal the decision. 
Associates and joint ventures
Safaricom, Vodafone’s 40% associate, which is the number one mobile 
operator in Kenya, achieved local currency service revenue growth 
of 14.8% for the year and local currency adjusted EBITDA growth 
of 24.6% (20.6% excluding a current year benefit), driven by data 
and M-Pesa. 40 out of 47 targeted regions (counties) now have 4G 
coverage. During the year the Group received €214 million in dividends 
from Safaricom.
Vodafone Hutchison Australia (‘VHA’), in which Vodafone owns a 50% 
stake, continued to perform solidly in a competitive environment. 
VHA continued to grow service revenue (excluding MTRs), driven 
by growth in our contract customer base and ARPU. Local currency 
adjusted EBITDA grew 19.0%, driven by an increase in underlying 
revenue and strong commercial cost discipline.
Indus T owers, the Indian towers company in which Vodafone has 
a 42% interest, will be excluded from the perimeter of the Idea merger. 
Indus achieved local currency revenue growth of 6.2% and adjusted 
EBITDA growth of 0.3% for the year. Indus owned 122,730 towers 
as at 31 March 2017 , with a tenancy ratio of 2.35x. Our share of Indus’ 
adjusted EBITDA for the year was €410 million and its contribution 
to Vodafone Group adjusted operating profit was €98 million. During the 
year the Group received €126 million in dividends from Indus Towers.
India
1
On 20 March 201 7 , Vodafone announced an agreement to combine 
its subsidiary, Vodafone India (excluding its 42% stake in Indus Towers), 
with Idea Cellular. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals 
and is expected to close during calendar 2018. The combined company 
will be jointly controlled by Vodafone and the Aditya Birla Group. 
Vodafone India has been classified as discontinued operations for Group 
reporting purposes. From an operational perspective, the Group remains 
highly focused on the management of the business and committed 
to its success, both prior to the completion of the merger and thereafter. 
The results of Vodafone India are detailed below.

2 Year ended 31 March 2017 includes a gross impairment charge of €4.5 billion (2016: €nil) 
recorded in respect of the Group’s investment in India, which together with the recognition 
of an associated €0.8 billion deferred tax asset, led to an overall €3.7 billion reduction in the 
carrying value of Vodafone India.
With effect from 1 April 2016, the Group changed the reporting 
of certain dealer commissions in India. Annual and quarterly organic 
growth rates for the year ended 31 March 2017 of Vodafone India 
have been amended to exclude the impact of this change, which had 
no effect on earnings or cash flows. 
Service revenue declined 0.7%* (Q3: -1.9%*, Q4: -1 1.5%*) as a result 
of heightened competitive pressure following free services offered 
by the new entrant during the second half of the year. The slowdown 
in Q4, as expected, was due to the ongoing impact of free services, 
which dragged on data and voice pricing, compounded by the leap year 
benefit in the prior period. However, we grew our overall customer base 
during the year and retained our high value customers. 
Data browsing revenue declined by 16%* in Q4 compared to +0.6%* 
in Q3. Our active data customer base returned to growth in the 
quarter, increasing to 66.9 million (Q3: 65.0 million), mainly reflecting 
a 2.7 million increase in our 3G/ 4G customer base to 37 .7 million (adding 
10 million customers in the year). Unit prices declined 38% year-on-year 
(Q3: -1 1%), although this helped to stimulate 40% growth in monthly 
data usage per 3G/ 4G customer to 636 MB (Q3: 505 MB). 
Voice revenue declined 13%* in Q4 (Q3: -3.0%*) as the benefit of higher 
incoming volumes and a larger customer base was offset by a 22% 
year-on-year decline in voice prices as the market moved to unlimited 
voice propositions. Total mobile customers increased 4.4 million in the 
quarter, giving a closing customer base of 209 million. 
Following the Indian spectrum auction in October, we now offer 4G 
services in 18 circles, up from 9 circles prior to the auction. These circles 
cover around 92% of service revenues and 96% of our data revenues.
Adjusted EBITDA declined 10.5%*, with a 2.2 percentage point 
deterioration in adjusted EBITDA margin to 27 .3%. This reflected lower 
revenues in the second half of the year and higher costs as a result of 4G 
network expansion, partially offset by lower intra circle roaming fees and 
an underlying reduction in operating costs. 
In the first half of the 2017 financial year, the Group recorded a non-
cash impairment of €6.4 billion (€5.0 billion net of tax), relating to our 
Indian business. This was driven by lower projected cash flows within 
our business plan as a result of increased competition in the market. 
Impairment testing at 31 March 2017 , following the announcement 
of the merger of Vodafone India with Idea Cellular, gave rise to a partial 
reversal of that impairment. As a result, the impairment charge for the 
year reduced to €4.5 billion (€3.7 billion net of tax).

further details and reconciliations to the respective closest equivalent GAAP measure. Consolidated statement of financial position 
The consolidated statement of financial position is set out on page 100. 
Details on the major movements of both our assets and liabilities in the 
year are set out below:
Assets
Goodwill and other intangible assets 
Goodwill and other intangible assets decreased by €12.4 billion 
to €46.2 billion. The decrease primarily arose as a result of €9.8 billion 
of assets relating to India which were transferred to assets held for 
sale (see below). Other movements comprise €2.6 billion of additions, 
including €0.4 billion for spectrum additions, primarily in Egypt, 
plus €2.2 billion of software additions which were partly offset 
by €4.8 billion of amortisation and €0.4 billion of unfavourable foreign 
exchange movements.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment decreased by €5.3 billion to €30.2 billion, 
principally due to €5.4 billion of additions driven by continued 
investment in the Group’s networks, offset by unfavourable foreign 
exchange movements of €0.7 billion, €6.3 billion of depreciation charges 
and €3.7 billion transferred to assets held for sale (see below).
Other non-current assets  
Other non-current assets decreased by €3.9 billion to €35.5 billion, 
mainly due to €4.0 billion decrease in deferred tax assets largely 
due to the reduction of tax losses in Luxembourg (see note 6 for 
further details) and a €1.2 billion reduction in other investments 
following the repayment of US$2.5 billion of loan notes issued 
by Verizon Communications Inc., partly offset by a €2.7 billion increase 
in investment in associates and joint ventures following the creation 
of the VodafoneZiggo joint venture in the Netherlands during the year.
Current assets
Current assets decreased by €6.4 billion to €25.5 billion which includes 
a €4.1 billion decrease in cash and cash equivalents, €1.3 billion 
reduction in taxation recoverable and a €1.7 billion decrease in trade 
and other receivables.
Assets and liabilities held for sale
Assets and liabilities held for sale at 31 March 2017 of €17 .2 billion and 
€1 1.8 billion respectively, relate to our operations in India following the 
agreement to combined with Idea Cellular. Amounts at 31 March 2016 
related to our operations in the Netherlands, which were combined with 
those of Liberty Global Plc to form VodafoneZiggo, a 50:50 joint venture, 
on 31 December 2016.
Total equity and liabilities
T otal equity
Total equity decreased by €1 1.4 billion to €73.7 billion largely due 
to €4.1 billion of dividends paid to equity shareholders and non-
controlling interests and the total comprehensive loss for the year 
of €7 .4 billion.
Non-current liabilities
Non-current liabilities decreased by €3.1 billion to €38.6 billion, primarily 
due to a €2.5 billion decrease in long-term borrowings.
Current liabilities
Current liabilities decreased by €1 1.2 billion to €30.6 billion mainly due 
to a €8.2 billion decrease in short-term borrowings and a €3.1 billion 
decrease in trade and other payables. 
Trade payables at 31 March 2017 were equivalent to 45 days (2016 
restated: 42 days) outstanding, calculated by reference to the amount 
owed to suppliers as a proportion of the amounts invoiced by suppliers 
during the year. It is our policy to agree terms of transactions, including 
payment terms, with suppliers and it is our normal practice that 
payment is made accordingly.

Dividends
Dividends will continue to be declared in euros and paid in euros, 
pounds sterling and US dollars, aligning the Group’s shareholder 
returns with the primary currency in which we generate free cash flow. 
The foreign exchange rate, at which future dividends declared in euros 
will be converted into pounds sterling and US dollars, will be calculated 
based on the average exchange rate over the five business days during 
the week prior to the payment of the dividend. 
In May 2016, the Board determined that future dividend growth would 
be calculated from the level of 14.48 eurocents per share for the year 
ended 31 March 2016 (six months ended 30 September 2015: 4.65 
eurocents per share), which is equivalent to the total dividend payout 
of 1 1.45 pence for the year ended 31 March 2016 (six months ended 
30 September 2015: 3.68 pence) at the 31 March 2016 foreign 
exchange conversion rate of £:€1.2647 .
The Board is recommending a final dividend per share of 10.03 
eurocents, representing a 2% increase over the prior financial year’s final 
dividend per share based on the 31 March 2016 foreign exchange 
conversion rate of £1:€1.2647 . The ex-dividend date for the final dividend 
is 8 June 201 7 for ordinary shareholders, the record date is 9 June 201 7 
and the dividend is payable on 4 August 2017 . Dividend payments 
on ordinary shares will be paid directly into a nominated bank or building 
society account.

Notes:
1 Cash flows and funding for the year ended 31 March 2016 excludes the cash flows, funding 
and net debt of Vodafone India. 
2 Capital additions include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets, other than licence and spectrum, during the year.
3 Operating free cash flow and free cash flow for the year ended 31 March 2017 excludes 
€266 million (2016: €252 million) of restructuring costs. Operating free cash flow and free 
cash flow are alternative performance measures which are non-GAAP measures that are 
presented to provide readers with additional financial information that is regularly reviewed 
by management and should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to the equivalent 
GAAP measure. See “Alternative performance measures” on page 205 for reconciliations 
to the closest respective equivalent GAAP measure and “Definition of terms” on page 218 
for further details.
4 Other cash flows for the year ended 31 March 2017 include €2,366 million (2016: €nil)  
received from the repayment of US$2.5 billion of loan notes issued by Verizon 
Communications Inc. and €3,571 million (2016: €1,162 million) from a capital injection 
into Vodafone India.
Operating free cash flow
Operating free cash flow increased €2.4 billion as stable adjusted 
EBITDA and working capital outflows predominantly relating to the 
final payments for Project Spring were offset by lower capital additions, 
which decreased by €2.9 billion to €7 .7 billion following the completion 
of the Project Spring investment programme last financial year.
Capital additions
Capital additions were 16.1% of Group revenues, at the top-end of the 
Group’s “mid-teens” guidance range for capital intensity as a percentage 
of revenues, reflecting increased success-based capex as a result 
of strong customer growth.
Free cash flow
Free cash flow was €4.1 billion, an increase of €2.8 billion from the prior 
year, driven by higher operating free cash flow, lower interest paid and 
higher dividends from Indus Towers, Safaricom and VodafoneZiggo.
Licence and spectrum payments
Licence and spectrum payments include amounts relating to the 
purchase of spectrum in Germany of €0.1 billion and €0.3 billion 
in Egypt (2016: €1.9 billion in Germany, €0.8 billion in Turkey, €0.2 billion 
in Italy and €0.1 billion in the UK). 
Acquisitions and disposals
Acquisitions and disposals include €0.6 billion of proceeds following 
the merger of Vodafone Netherlands and Ziggo during the year. 
Convertible issue
Last year, we received €3.5 billion of proceeds from the issue 
of £2.9 billion of mandatory convertible bonds in February 2016.
Foreign exchange 
A foreign exchange loss of €1.4 billion was recognised on net debt 
as a result of the adverse translation impact of closing foreign exchange 
rates, mainly due to movements in the pound sterling, US dollar and 
South African rand against the euro. 
Net debt
Closing net debt at 31 March 2017 of €31.2 billion (2016: €28.8 billion) 
excludes net debt of Vodafone India, which is instead included 
in assets and liabilities held for sale on the consolidated statement 
of financial position. In addition, net debt excludes £2.8 billion 
of mandatory convertible bonds issued in February 2016, which are 
classified as equity after taking into account the cost of future coupon 
payments. The Group now holds US$2.5 billion of Verizon loan notes 
and €1.0 billion of shareholder loans to VodafoneZiggo, both of which 
are not included within net debt.
Net debt includes includes liabilities of €1.8 billion (2016: €1.8 billion) 
relating to minority holdings in KDG and certain bonds which are 
reported at an amount €2.0 billion higher than their euro-equivalent 
cash redemption value as a result of hedge accounting under IFRS.
This year’s report contains the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 43, 
which includes an analysis of our performance and position, 
a review of the business during the year, and outlines the principal 
risks and uncertainties we face. The Strategic Report was approved 
by the Board and signed on its behalf by the Chief Executive and 
Chief Financial Officer.

Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financials Additional information Chairman’s governance statement
Committed to the highest 
standards of governance
Integrity and accountability are at the heart of everything we do 
and are integral to creating long-term value for our shareholders. 
We are in full compliance with the 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
Board highlights of the year
As a Board we try to spend quality time on those aspects of governance 
that contribute most to the success of the Company; the development 
of a strategy with an attractive value creation potential, having the right 
people and processes for its successful implementation, monitoring 
progress against plan and managing risk in an ever more volatile 
external environment. 
The Board held its annual strategy meeting and a Board meeting 
in Rome, providing an opportunity for the Directors to meet our Italian 
colleagues, customers and other stakeholders. During the year several 
aspects of the strategy were explored in further detail through strategy 
“deep dives”.
The rapidly evolving competitive situation in India was a recurring item 
on the Board’s agenda, eventually resulting in the Board’s approval 
of the proposed merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, announced 
in March 2017 .
The Board also supported and approved the creation of VodafoneZiggo, 
a joint venture in the Netherlands established to deliver converged 
consumer services and a further illustration of the execution of our 
convergence and enterprise strategy.
The Board paid a special visit to our UK local business, with detailed 
discussions focused on performance and trends in our UK consumer 
and enterprise base, customer services operations and network 
operations. Board engagement with operations is also an important 
aspect of our focus on talent development and succession planning.
More detail of these meetings and other topics on the Board’s agenda 
can be found on pages 52 and 53.

of the information included in this “Governance” section of the Annual Report 
together with information contained in the “Shareholder information” section 
on pages 190 to 196.
Culture and governance
The Board is committed to ensuring there is a strong and effective 
system of corporate governance in place to support the successful 
execution of Vodafone’s strategy. During the period under review (and 
as of the date of publication of this report) we have fully complied with 
the provisions and applied the main principles of the 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code. We intend to be in full compliance with the 2016 
UK Corporate Governance Code which will apply to us in our 201 7–18 
financial year. 
Good governance and a commitment to operating with integrity 
is central to our culture, at all levels and in all parts of our business. 
The environment in which we operate evolves continuously, shaped 
by emerging trends in consumer behaviours and expectations, 
shifts in regulatory and legal requirements and changing attitudes 
towards the role of large companies in society. Our internal culture 
evolves accordingly as we seek to ensure that the way in which 
we work conforms to our many stakeholders’ highest expectations. 
Everyone who works with us is required to comply with our Business 
Principles (the values we respect) and our Code of Conduct (the 
behaviours we expect) at all times, reinforced through what we call 
The Vodafone Way, which sets out the type of organisation we want 
to be. An overview of The Vodafone Way, our Business Principles and 
our Code of Conduct can be found on pages 24 and 25. The Board and 
Executive Committee are critical in setting the tone of the organisation 
and play a key role in embedding our culture throughout the Group, 
in order to ensure that Vodafone’s reputation is protected effectively. 
More information on our culture can be found on page 46. 
The success of our business is dependent on the Board taking decisions 
for the benefit of its members as a whole and in doing so having regard 
for all its stakeholders: its employees, its suppliers, customers and 
the wider community and environment. This is consistent with the 
Group’s core and sustainable business objectives. 
It is always rewarding to see instances of our governance being 
recognised externally. I was delighted that Vodafone was the winner 
of the Best Audit Disclosure award at the ICSA: The Governance Institute 
Awards 2016. We will always strive to ensure that our governance 
processes are in line with latest best practice and that our approach 
to disclosure is clear and transparent.
Board changes and diversity
In January 201 7 , we announced the appointment of Maria Amparo 
Moraleda Martinez as a Non-Executive Director with effect from 1 June 
2017 . Amparo is an international business leader with an engineering 
background and IT and technology expertise. She will be a valuable 
addition to the Board and will become a member of the Audit and 
Risk Committee.
Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 44 In March we announced that Nick Land and Phil Y ea will not seek 
re-election at our Annual General Meeting in July 201 7 after more than 
ten years of service. On behalf of the Board, I would like to express our 
thanks and appreciation to Nick and Phil for their valuable contributions. 
Details of the resulting changes to the Board and its Committees 
are detailed in the Nominations and Governance Committee Report 
on page 56.
The Board believes that diversity, both in the boardroom and 
throughout the organisation, is key to our success. I am pleased 
to report that 25% of our Board roles are currently held by women; 
furthermore, after the AGM in July 2017 , this percentage will rise to 36%. 
We are also looking at measures to increase diversity on the boards 
of our subsidiary businesses in local markets. Details of our commitment 
to increase the number of women throughout our organisation can 
be found on page 21.
Listening to our shareholders
Effective communication with our shareholders is fundamental to our 
success. We strive to communicate our strategy and activities clearly 
to all our shareholders. We also welcome active engagement with 
all of our shareholders to answer their questions and receive their 
feedback. Further details of our approach to shareholder engagement 
can be found on pages 64 and 65. 
Shareholders will vote this year on the adoption of our remuneration 
policy. That vote, which is binding, is in line with the requirement that the 
policy receives shareholder approval at least every three years. The full 
remuneration policy is set out on pages 71 to 76.
Objectives for the year ahead
Y our Board remains committed to ensuring the highest standards 
of corporate governance across the Group in all aspects of the delivery 
of our strategy. I am confident that the Directors and our senior leaders 
understand fully that how we work is as important as what we achieve 
and that, throughout the organisation as a whole, there is a rigorous 
focus on the importance of compliance and integrity when meeting the 
challenges, and seizing the opportunities, over the year ahead.

Leadership structure
Creating the right  
culture through our 
governance framework
The Board is responsible for maintaining a strong and  
effective governance system throughout the Group.
How the Board operates
The Board is collectively responsible for the oversight and success 
of our business. There is a clear division of responsibilities between 
the Chairman, who was independent on appointment, and the 
Chief Executive. 
The Board held seven scheduled meetings during the year and 
additional meetings were held as required. The meetings are structured 
to allow open discussion. At each Board meeting, the Chairman also 
met with the Non-Executive Directors without the Executives present. 
Information on the matters considered at the Board meetings are set 
out on pages 52 and 53.
All of our Directors attended all Board meetings and their respective 
Committee meetings during the financial year. No apologies for absence 
were received.
Culture: setting the tone from the top
The Board recognises that a healthy corporate culture is fundamental 
to our business purpose and strategy. Vodafone’s culture is defined 
through The Vodafone Way, our Business Principles and the Code 
of Conduct. Together these set out what we expect from our employees 
and how we expect business to be carried out. By embedding The 
Vodafone Way into our processes, we strive for a culture of speed, 
simplicity and trust. Our culture is not static and has evolved over 
time, reflecting the changing environment we operate in. Our Code 
of Conduct, which includes details of our Business Principles and 
The Vodafone Way, can be found on our website, vodafone.com/
governance.
Our leaders have a critical role in setting the tone of our organisation 
and championing the behaviours we expect to see. The Executive 
Committee led campaigns and engagement throughout the year 
to highlight our values, beliefs and business approach to health and 
safety, business integrity, The Vodafone Way, Customer eXperience 
eXcellence, diversity and inclusion. 
Various indicators are used to monitor and provide insight into our 
culture, including employee engagement, health, safety and wellbeing 
measures and diversity indicators. The state of our culture is assessed 
through compliance reviews, internal audit and formal and informal 
channels for employees to speak up and we ensure action is taken 
to address behaviour that falls short of our expectations.
The Board 
Responsible for the overall 
conduct of the Group’s business 
including our long-term success; 
setting our values, standards and 
strategic objectives; reviewing

Board approved merger in India
The Board oversaw and approved the proposed merger of Vodafone India 
and Idea Cellular in March this year. The merger will create a new market 
leader to participate in India’s digital future. In approving the merger, 
the Board took into consideration the current market environment in India 
which has changed significantly in the past year and the projected synergies 
from the intended merger.

UK review: focus on customer excellence and technology
The Board visited the Vodafone UK and Group Technology hub for 
Technology Enterprise Services and IT. As part of this review, the Board 
received a demonstration of the monitoring of business-critical fixed networks 
which Vodafone manages for its customers. Deep-dive sessions focused 
on the UK Enterprise business, network and technology, customer service and 
the consumer business. The customer service session reviewed the actions 
being taken to restore customer service satisfaction. Effectiveness
 
Board evaluation, induction and training
Board development
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that all Non-Executive 
Directors receive ongoing training and development. Our Non-Executive 
Directors are conscious of the need to keep themselves properly briefed 
and informed about current issues.
T opics covered at sessions attended by our Directors during the 
year were consumer, customer service, network and share dealing 
rules. Specific and tailored updates, delivered by the Group Financial 
Controlling and Operations Director, were also provided to the members 
of our Audit and Risk Committee during the year covering key themes 
surrounding financial and narrative reporting, and accounting and 
auditing standards.
The Board also received reports from the Group General Counsel and 
Company Secretary on current legal and governance issues.
There is a procedure to enable Directors to take independent legal and/
or financial advice at the Company’s expense, managed by the Group 
General Counsel and Company Secretary. No such independent advice 
was sought in the 2017 financial year.
The Group General Counsel and Company Secretary also:
 – assists the Chairman by organising induction and training 
programmes and ensuring that all Directors have full and timely 
access to all relevant information;
 – ensures that the correct Board procedures are followed; and
 – advises the Board on corporate governance matters.
The removal of the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary 
is a matter for the Board as a whole.
Board evaluation 201 7
Board effectiveness review
The Board recognises that it continually needs to monitor and improve 
its performance. This is achieved through annual performance 
evaluation, full induction of new Board members and ongoing Board 
development activities.
Each Director completed 
a confidential online 
questionnaire, designed 
by Lintstock and the Group 
General Counsel and Company 
Secretary. Each Board 
Committee undertook a specific 
self-assessment questionnaire. 
The Audit and Risk Committee 
assessment also included input 
from the external auditor and 
relevant senior management.
The Chairman then held one-to-
one interviews with each of the 
Directors to discuss the reports.
The Chairman reviewed the 
Directors’ contributions and the 
Senior Independent Director led 
the review of the performance 
of the Chairman.
Lintstock prepared a report 
based on the completed 
questionnaires for the Chairman 
and the chairman of each 
of the Board Committees. 
The chairman of each Board 
Committee gave feedback 
on the evaluation of their 
Committee to their Committees 
and to the Board at its meeting 
in March 2017 . The Chairman 
discussed Lintstock’s report 
with the Nominations and 
Governance Committee and 
with the Board at its meeting 
in March 2017 .
This year’s process
In accordance with our three-year cycle, Board effectiveness is reviewed 
by an external performance evaluation every three years, and will 
be externally conducted again in 2019. An internal performance 
evaluation was carried out this year, with the assistance of Lintstock 
Limited (‘Lintstock’), a London-based corporate advisory firm, which has 
no other connection with Vodafone.

Maria Amparo Moraleda Martinez’s appointment
During the year the Committee recognised that it would be valuable for 
a Non-Executive Director to be appointed who had IT and technology 
expertise as well as experience as an international business leader. 
The Committee worked with Russell Reynolds Associates, an executive 
search consultancy, to identify suitable candidates. 
Amparo will join the Board as a Non-Executive Director with effect from 
1 June 2017.
Amparo is a high calibre international business leader who brings to the  
Board extensive engineering, IT and technology expertise developed from  
her previous roles as chief operating officer of the international division 
of Iberdrola and president of IBM Southern Europe.
Amparo’s other current appointments:
 – Airbus Group SE, non-executive director
 – CaixaBank, non-executive director
 – Solvay SA, non-executive director
Board review insights 2015–16
 – Recommendation: review the Board induction and development 
programme to focus on strategically significant areas
Action taken in 2016–17: the induction programme for new 
Directors was refreshed and sessions were arranged for Directors 
to learn more about the Company’s strategic priorities and significant 
risks including cyber threats, convergence, network quality, 
content, customer experience initiatives and Enterprise business 
developments including the growth of Internet of Things business.
 – Recommendation: increase transparency around Board and 
executive succession plans
Action taken in 2016–17: the Chairman discussed Board 
succession plans and the profile to be sought in new Board 
appointments with the Directors and kept the Board informed 
of progress during the process to appoint a new Non-Executive 
Director. Executive succession plans were discussed by the 
Nominations and Governance Committee and the outcomes 
of the discussion were shared with the Board.
 – Recommendation: clarify expectations on an overall strategic 
framework
Action taken in 2016–17: in addition to the Board’s regular reviews 
on performance of individual operating companies, the Board 
discussed Group-wide strategic themes during the course of the 
year in Board meetings and in the annual strategy meeting.
 – Recommendation: create more opportunities for Board members 
to spend informal time together
Action taken in 2016–17: the Directors dined together on the eve 
of each Board meeting, sometimes with senior executives as guests. 
The meetings at Vodafone Italy and Vodafone UK also provided 
occasions for the Directors to spend informal time together. 
Conclusions from the 2016–17 review:
The conclusions of this year’s review have been positive and have 
confirmed that the Board and its Committees operate effectively 
and that each Director contributes to the overall effectiveness and 
success of the Group.
The recommendations from this year’s review included:
 – Although the Board’s composition was rated highly, 
it was agreed that adding further financial expertise would 
be beneficial, particularly in view of the impending retirement 
of Nick Land and Phil Yea from the Board.
 – The Directors should continue to build their knowledge and 
understanding of the Company’s Enterprise business and 
its content assets. In addition, more time should be spent 
on digital matters.
 – The balance between focus on organic growth and on portfolio 
management needs to be carefully managed.
 – More opportunities should be provided for the Directors to take 
part in site visits and one-to-one interactions with members 
of the executive team.
The Board will address these recommendations during the 
2018 financial year and will report on progress in our 2018 
Annual Report.

matters relating to corporate governance.
Responsibilities:
 – Assessing the composition of the Board and making 
recommendations on appointments to the Board and senior 
executive succession planning;

its Committees and individual Directors; and
 – Overseeing all matters relating to corporate governance, bringing

 The Committee continues its work of ensuring 
the Board composition is right and that our 
governance is effective. 
Any conflicts identified are considered and, as appropriate, authorised 
by the Board. A register of authorised conflicts is maintained which 
is reviewed periodically. 
The Committee reviewed the independence of all the Non-Executive 
Directors. All Non-Executive Directors are considered independent and 
their contributions continue to be effective. They have all submitted 
themselves for re-election at the 201 7 AGM with the exception of Phil 
Yea and Nick Land. Amparo Moraleda will be elected for the first time 
in accordance with our Articles of Association.
The Executive Directors’ service contracts and Non-Executive Directors’ 
appointment letters are available for inspection at our registered office 
and at our AGM.
Board evaluation
The Committee oversaw the internal evaluation of the Board and 
Committees. A description of the evaluation is set out on page 54.
Succession planning
The Committee received several presentations throughout the year 
from the Chief Executive and Group Human Resources Director. 
The presentations provided details of the changes to the Vodafone 
organisational structure in order to deliver our strategy as well 
as succession planning for senior management. Potential successors 
have been identified for the top senior management positions and the 
Committee reviewed the profiles for all of these positions during the year.
The Committee also monitors a schedule on the length of tenure 
of the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors and the mix and skills 
of the Directors. The Committee is satisfied that adequate succession 
planning is currently in place for the Executive Directors and senior 
executives, but will keep succession planning under review and monitor 
the progress and success of the development plans which have been 
established for relevant employees.
Diversity
Vodafone acknowledges the importance of diversity and inclusion to the 
effective functioning of the Board. This includes diversity of skills and 
experience, age, gender , disability, sexual orientation, cultural background 
and belief. Currently, 25% of our Board roles are held by women and our 
ambition over the coming years is to increase that proportion further , 
which is supported by our Board diversity policy. Following Amparo 
Moraleda’s appointment on 1 June 201 7 , 31% of our Board roles will be held 
by women; this will increase further after the AGM with 36% of our Board 
being women. Our Board diversity statistics can be found on page 49.
Diversity extends beyond the boardroom. The Board supports 
management in its efforts to build a diverse organisation. Vodafone has 
recently launched the ReConnect programme which aims to bring 
talented women back into the workplace after a career break and 
to increase the number of women in management roles. Further details 
are set out on pages 7 and 21 and on the Vodafone website.
Governance
The Committee reviewed Vodafone’s compliance with the 2014 
UK Corporate Governance Code and was satisfied that Vodafone 
complied with the Code during the year. It also received updates 
on corporate governance developments during the year and 
considered the impact of those developments on Vodafone.

(set out on pages 48 and 49) do not conflict with their duties and 
commitments as Directors of the Company. Our Directors must:
 – report any changes to their commitments to the Board;
 – notify the Company of actual or potential conflicts or a change 
in circumstances relating to an existing authorisation; and
 – complete an annual conflicts questionnaire. 
Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 56 Accountability
 
Audit and Risk Committee
Key objectives:
The provision of effective governance over the appropriateness 
of the Group’s financial reporting, including the adequacy 
of related disclosures, the performance of both the internal 
audit function and the external auditor and oversight over the 
Group’s system of internal control including risk management and 
compliance activities.
Responsibilities:
The Board has approved terms of reference for the Committee 
which are available at vodafone.com/ governance. These provided 
the framework for the Committee’s work in the year and can 
be summarised into four primary sets of activities. These are 
oversight of the:
 – appropriateness of the Group’s external financial reporting;
 – relationship with, and performance of, the external auditor;
 – Group’s system of internal control, including risk management 
framework and the work of the internal audit function; and
 – Group’s system of compliance activities.
The Committee met six times during the year and each meeting 
had full attendance. The terms of reference of the Committee are 
available on vodafone.com/ governance.
The Committee continued to oversee the 
Group’s financial reporting, financial control and 
risk management and compliance processes, 
with areas of particular focus this year including 
the preparations for the future implementation 
of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16, both of which will 
have a significant impact on the Group, a 
number of accounting, reporting and valuation 
judgements in relation to the agreements to 
form new joint ventures in the Netherlands 
and India as well as deep dives into a range of 
technology, commercial and market risks.
Membership, relevant skills and experience
On 23 March 2017 , the Group announced that both myself and Phil Yea 
would not seek re-election at the Company’s annual general meeting 
in July 2017 after more than ten years of service. As a result, with effect 
from 28 July 201 7 , David Nish will be appointed Chairman of the Audit 
and Risk Committee and Maria Amparo Moraleda Martinez will become 
a member of the Audit and Risk Committee.
The Committee was conscious of the need for a strong knowledge 
transfer process and efficient succession planning and as a result, 
David Nish was appointed as an additional Committee member 
on 1 January 2016, allowing him to take an active role in the 
Committee’s activities in the year. David was appointed after a rigorous 
process to ensure the Committee will continue to have the necessary 
financial experience, commercial expertise and capital markets skills 
required to meet its responsibilities and provide an effective level 
of challenge to management. Similarly, Amparo brings her international 
business experience, engineering background and IT and technology 
expertise to the role and will be a valuable addition to the Committee. 
Full biographies of the Committee members are set out on pages 48 
and 49.
All the members of the Committee are Non-Executive Directors of the 
Company and given my experience, I continue to be designated as the 
financial expert on the Committee for the purposes of the US Sarbanes-
Oxley Act and the UK Corporate Governance Code for 2017 . David Nish 
will assume this role upon my retirement.
In order to ensure that the Committee continues to have experience 
and knowledge relevant to the sector in which the Company operates, 
all of the Non-Executive Directors of the Company receive ongoing 
training and development as detailed in the section on Board evaluation, 
induction and training on pages 54 and 55. In addition, every three years 
the Board appoints an external organisation to perform an independent 
review of the Committee to evaluate its performance. The last 
independent review was performed in March 2016 which concluded 
that the Board members considered the Committee to be thorough and 
fully effective in meeting its objectives.
How the Committee operates
The Committee met six times during the year, five times under its 
standard schedule of meetings plus an additional meeting in October 
2016 to cover a specific external auditor independence matter 
as detailed later in this report. Two of the standard meetings are timed 
for September and March in each year so that the Committee can 
assess in advance the issues likely to effect the Group’s half-year and 
year end reporting. The meetings in October and May conclude this 
work and play a key role in the approval of the Group’s external financial 
results. The meeting in January has a focus on risk and compliance 
related matters. Meetings of the Committee generally take place the 
day before a Board meeting to maximise the efficiency of interaction 
with the Board and I report to the Board, as a separate agenda item, 
on the activity of the Committee and matters of particular relevance 
to the Board in the conduct of its work, with the Board receiving copies 
of the Committee minutes.
The external auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , is invited to each 
meeting together with the Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer, 
the Deputy Chief Financial Officer, the Group Financial Controlling 
and Operations Director, the Group Audit Director, the Group Risk and 
Compliance Director, and the Group General Counsel and Company 
Secretary. The Committee also regularly meets separately with each 
of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , the Chief Financial Officer and the 
Group Audit Director without others being present.

Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 57
Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financials Additional information Financial reporting
The Committee’s primary responsibility in relation to the 
Group’s financial reporting is to review, with both management and 
the external auditor, the appropriateness of the half-year and annual 
financial statements concentrating on, amongst other matters:
 – the quality and acceptability of accounting policies and practices;
 – material areas in which significant judgements have been 
applied or where significant issues have been discussed with the 
external auditor;
 – providing advice to the Board on the form and basis underlying the 
long-term viability statement;
 – the clarity of the disclosures and compliance with financial reporting 
standards and relevant financial and governance reporting 
requirements, including the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code 
and the European Securities and Marketing Association Guidelines 
on Alternative Performance Measures;
 – any correspondence from regulators in relation to our financial 
reporting; and
 – an assessment of whether the Annual Report, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy. This assessment forms 
the basis of the advice given to the Board to assist them in making the 
statement required by the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code.
Accounting policies and practices
The Committee received reports from management in relation to the 
identification of critical accounting judgements and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty, significant accounting policies and proposed 
disclosure of these in the 2017 Annual Report. Following discussions 
with management and the external auditor, the Committee approved 
these critical accounting judgements, significant accounting policies 
and disclosures which are set out in note 1 “Basis of preparation” to the 
consolidated financial statements.
The Committee received regular reports from management on the 
programmes for the adoption of IFRS 15 “Revenue from contracts 
with customers” and IFRS 16 “Leases”, both of which are likely to have 
a substantial effect on the Group’s accounting when adopted for the 
years ending 31 March 2019 and 2020 respectively. Our disclosures 
on pages 107 and 108 include further qualitative detail on the impact 
of these two accounting standards. The Committee’s work in relation 
to the oversight of these programmes is set out below.
Regulators and our financial reporting
There has been no correspondence from regulators, including the 
FRC’s Corporate Reporting Review team, in relation to our financial 
reporting during the 2017 financial year. The Committee is committed 
to improving the effectiveness and clarity of the Group’s corporate 
reporting and has continued to encourage management to consider, 
and adopt where appropriate, initiatives by regulatory bodies which 
would enhance our reporting, such as the FRC Lab projects on “business 
model reporting” and “digital future – data”.
In addition, the Committee continued to support the Group’s broader 
commitment to corporate transparency which this year saw the 
publication of the Group’s award-winning report into its “T axation and 
total economic contribution to public finances” report. Now in its fifth 
year, the report remains the most comprehensive publication of its 
kind in the telecommunications and technology sectors covering tax 
strategy and detailed analysis of taxes paid around the world. 
Significant judgements and issues
The significant areas of focus considered and actions taken by the 
Committee in relation to the 201 7 Annual Report, which have been 
extended to reflect the Group’s change in presentation currency from 
sterling to the euro from 1 April 2016, are outlined below. We discussed 
these with the external auditor during the year and, where appropriate, 
these have been addressed as areas of audit focus as outlined in the 
Audit Report on pages 91 to 98.
Significant judgements and issues
Matter considered Action
Revenue recognition
The timing of revenue recognition, the recognition of revenue on 
a gross or net basis, the treatment of discounts, incentives and 
commissions and the accounting for arrangements with multiple 
deliverables are complex areas of accounting. See note 1 “Basis of 
preparation” for further detail.
In addition there is heightened risk in relation to the accounting for 
revenue as a result of the inherent complexity of newly introduced 
systems and changing pricing models.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shared its approach to the audit of 
revenue in their detailed audit plan, which identified the primary 
risks attaching to the audit of revenue to be (a) the controls over 
the underlying accuracy of billing systems and (b) presumed fraud 
risk, and reported on the results of its audit work in this area to the 
Committee at both the half-year and year end.
The Committee confirmed with management that the basis of 
revenue accounting remained unchanged from prior years with 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP . As a result, the Committee was 
satisfied with the appropriateness of the revenue recognised in 
the financial statements.

Audit and Risk Committee (continued)
Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 58 Significant judgements and issues
Matter considered Action
Taxation
The Group is subject to a range of tax claims and related legal actions 
across a number of jurisdictions where it operates. The most material 
claim continues to be from the Indian tax authorities in relation to our 
acquisition of Vodafone India Limited in 2007 , further details of which 
are included in note 30 “Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings”.
Further, the Group has extensive accumulated tax losses as detailed 
in note 6 “T axation”, and a key management judgement is whether a 
deferred tax asset should be recognised in respect of these losses. As 
at 31 March 2017 , the Group had recognised a €23.5 billion deferred 
tax asset primarily in respect of these tax losses.
The Group T ax Director presented on both provisioning and 
disclosure of tax contingencies and deferred tax asset recognition at 
the November 2016 and May 2017 Committee meetings. He also 
provided an update on upcoming changes in the wider tax landscape 
that were potentially relevant to the Group. PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP also identified this as an area of higher audit effort and the 
Committee received reporting from it on these matters.
The Committee challenged both management and 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP on the legal judgements underpinning 
both the provisioning and disclosure stance adopted in relation to 
material elements of tax contingent liabilities and the IFRS basis of, and 
operating assumptions underlying, the deferred tax assets recognised 
at the year end. Consequently, the Committee was satisfied with the 
approach adopted in the financial statements by management for 
each matter.
Impairment testing
This is an area of focus for the Committee given the materiality of the 
Group’s goodwill balances (€26.8 billion at 31 March 2017) and the 
inherent subjectivity in impairment testing.
The judgements in relation to impairment testing continue to relate 
primarily to the assumptions underlying the calculation of the value 
in use of the Group’s businesses, being the achievability of the long-
term business plans and the macroeconomic and related modelling 
assumptions underlying the valuation process. As at 31 March 2017 , 
these judgements were extended to include the assessment of the fair 
value of Vodafone India.
During the year, a new entrant in India launched free trial services 
for an extended period and commercial price plans at a significant 
discount to prevailing market pricing, resulting in competitive 
responses from other operators. This created a high degree of 
uncertainty over a range of commercial planning assumptions 
including future pricing, profitability and market structure, resulting 
in a wide range of potential outcomes which the Committee had 
to consider in assessing management’s view of future business 
performance and cash flows for impairment valuation purposes at 
both 30 September 2016 and 31 March 2017 .
A net of tax impairment charge of €3.7 billion was recorded in respect 
of the Group’s investment in Vodafone India for the year ended 
31 March 2017 . See note 4 “Impairment losses” for detail.
The Committee received detailed reporting from management and 
challenged the appropriateness of the assumptions made, including:
 – the consistent application of management’s methodology;
 – the achievability of the business plans;
 – assumptions in relation to terminal growth in the businesses at the 
end of the plan period; and
 – discount rates.
This remains an area of audit focus and PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP provided detailed reporting on these matters to the Committee, 
including sensitivity testing.
As a result, the Committee was satisfied with both the appropriateness 
of the analysis performed by management and the impairment 
related disclosures set out in note 4 to the financial statements.
Liability provisioning
The Group is subject to a range of claims and legal actions from a 
number of sources, including competitors, regulators, customers, 
suppliers and, on occasion, fellow shareholders in Group subsidiaries.
The level of provisioning for contingent and other liabilities is an 
issue where legal and management judgements are important and 
accordingly an area of Committee focus. See note 30 “Contingent 
liabilities and legal proceedings” for further detail.
The Committee received a presentation from the Group’s General 
Counsel and Company Secretary and the Director of Litigation in both 
November 2016 and May 201 7 on management’s assessment of the 
most significant claims.
As this is an area of audit focus, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP also 
reviews these claims and relevant legal advice received by the Group, 
to form a view on the appropriateness of the level of provisioning that 
is shared with the Committee.
The Committee challenged both management and 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP on the level of provisioning for legal 
claims and was satisfied that the amounts recorded appropriately 
reflected the risk of loss.

Audit and Risk Committee (continued)
Significant judgements and issues
Matter considered Action
Significant one-off transactions
The Committee reviewed the accounting and reporting implications of 
the merger of Vodafone’s and Liberty Global’s operating businesses in 
the Netherlands and the agreement to combine Vodafone India with 
Idea Cellular into a new joint venture. The latter resulted in Vodafone 
India being accounted for as a discontinued operation at 31 March 
2017 . See note 7 “Discontinued operations and assets held for resale” 
and note 28 “Acquisitions and disposals” for further detail.
Management outlined the key accounting and disclosure impacts in 
relation to these transactions.
The Committee also received detailed reporting from 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP on their assessment of the accounting 
and disclosures made by management in the financial statements.
After having reviewed these reports and the financial statements, the 
Committee concluded that it was satisfied with the accounting and 
disclosures made in the Annual Report.
Key business controls
The Group has continued to devote considerable resources to the 
development of key business and related IT controls to ensure a 
robust system of internal control.
Following the prior year implementation of a suite of standard 
controls over the Group’s core financial processes, there have been 
no significant changes to the Group’s key business controls.
The Committee reviewed the work performed by management in 
relation to the implementation and maintenance of these controls, 
including the degree to which they operated effectively throughout 
the year and at the year end. This was supplemented by the results of 
related reviews performed by Internal Audit.
The audit scope of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP included certain 
of these key business and IT controls and they reported to the 
Committee the results of their audit testing in these areas. Further 
detail is provided in the PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP audit report on 
pages 91 to 98.
As a result, the Committee was satisfied with the basis of 
management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 
as required by section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act and with 
management’s ongoing focus on enhancements to the internal 
control environment.
Change in presentation currency
Following the change in the Company’s functional currency and 
the Group’s presentation currency from sterling to the euro with 
effect from 1 April 2016, the Group has performed a full historic 
retranslation of the Group’s results. See note 1 “Basis of preparation” 
for further detail.
Management outlined the key accounting and disclosure impacts in 
relation to the changes in both the Company’s functional currency 
and the Group’s presentation currency.
The Committee also received detailed reporting from 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , at both the half-year and the year 
end, on their assessment of the accounting and disclosures 
made by management in respect of the change in functional and 
presentational currency.
After having reviewed these reports and the disclosures in the financial 
statements, the Committee concluded that it was satisfied with the 
accounting and disclosure for each of these matters.
Other matters
The Committee also undertook a range of further activities in relation 
to the Group’s accounting and external reporting in the year:
Adoption of recent accounting developments
The Committee received regular reporting from management 
on the Group’s ongoing implementation of IFRS 15 “Revenue from 
contracts with customers”, which will be adopted in the financial year 
ending 31 March 2019, focusing on the key decision points relating 
to the choice of IT system, systems integration, the methodology 
in which the standard would be adopted and programme resourcing. 
The implementation programme continued to progress satisfactorily 
during the year, with the accounting systems build being finalised and 
tested and new business and IT controls being designed and rolled out. 
Markets are expected to go-live across the Group in a phased approach 
starting from March 2017 . Similar reporting was given to the Committee 
in relation to the Group’s implementation of IFRS 16 “Leases”, which will 
be adopted in the financial year ending 31 March 2020.
Brexit
The Committee discussed a number of issues arising from the UK’s vote 
to leave the European Union in June 2016, including consideration 
of the impact on our principal risks, as set out on pages 28 to 34, 
and the consideration of potential tax impacts in conjunction with the 
Group’s tax risk mitigation strategy, further details of which are included 
in Note 6 “Taxation”.
Fair, balanced and understandable
As part of the Committee’s assessment of whether the Annual 
Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, business model and strategy, 
it draws on the work of the Group’s Disclosure Committee and has 
discussions with senior management. 
Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 60 The processes and controls that underpin our consideration include 
ensuring that:
 – all contributors are fully briefed on the fair, balanced and 
understandable requirement;
 – a dedicated and experienced core team is responsible for the 
coordination of content submissions, verification, detailed review 
and challenge;
 – senior management confirms that the content in respect 
of their areas of responsibility is considered to be fair, balanced 
and understandable;
 – the Disclosure Committee reviews and assesses the Annual Report 
as a whole; and
 – the Committee receives an early draft of the Annual Report to enable 
timely review and comment.
This year, following guidance issued by the European Securities 
and Markets Authority, the Committee’s assessment was extended 
to cover the use and disclosure of alternative performance measures 
(or “non-GAAP” measures) to ensure that they were clearly explained, 
defined and labelled, disclosed separately from reported GAAP metrics, 
not given undue prominence compared to reported IFRS measures 
and were reconciled to the nearest GAAP financial metric. In addition, 
the Committee also considered the financial reporting responsibilities 
of the Directors under section 1 72 of the Companies Act 2006 
to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members 
as a whole as well as meeting the needs of wider society.
These processes allowed us to provide positive assurance to the 
Board to assist them in making the statement required by the 2014 
UK Corporate Governance Code.
Long-term viability statement
As part of the Committee’s responsibility to provide advice to the Board 
on the form and basis underlying the long-term viability statement 
as set out on page 34, the Committee reviewed the process and 
assessment of the Group’s prospects made by management, including:
 – the review period and alignment with the Group’s internal long-
term forecasts;
 – the assessment of the capacity of the Group to remain viable 
after consideration of future cash flows, expected debt service 
requirements, undrawn facilities and access to capital markets;
 – the modelling of the financial impact of certain of the 
Group’s principal risks materialising using severe but plausible 
scenarios; and
 – ensuring clear and enhanced disclosures in the Annual Report 
as to why the assessment period selected was appropriate to the 
Group, what qualifications and assumptions were made and how 
the underlying analysis was performed, consistent with recent 
FRC pronouncements.
 – Management also sought independent external advice on best 
practice to ensure appropriate compliance with the requirements 
of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code.
External audit
The Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing the 
relationship with, and performance of, the external auditor. This includes 
making the recommendation on the appointment, reappointment 
and removal of the external auditor, assessing their independence 
on an ongoing basis, negotiating and approving the statutory audit fee, 
the scope of the statutory audit and approval of the appointment of the 
lead audit engagement partner.
Auditor appointment
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were appointed as the Group’s external 
auditor in July 2014 following an audit tender and, whilst the 
Group has no current retendering plans, in accordance with the 
UK implementation of the EU Audit Regulation and Directive or the 
Competition & Markets Authority Order on the Statutory Audit 
Market, the Group will be required to put the external audit contract 
out to tender by 2024. In addition, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
will be required to rotate the audit partner responsible for the Group 
audit every five years and, as a result, the current lead audit partner, 
Andrew Kemp, who was appointed in July 2014, will be required to  
step down following the completion of the 2019 audit.
The Committee continues to review the auditor appointment and the 
need to tender the audit, ensuring the Group’s compliance with the 
2014 UK Corporate Governance Code and the reforms of the audit 
market by the UK Competition and Markets Authority. Accordingly, 
the Company confirms that it complied with the provisions of the 
Competition and Markets Authority’s Order for the financial year under 
review. For the financial year ending 31 March 2018, the Committee 
has recommended to the Board that PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP be reappointed under the current external audit contract 
and the Directors will be proposing the reappointment 
of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP at the annual general meeting 
in July 2017 .
Audit risk
At the start of the audit cycle for the 2017 financial year we received 
from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP a detailed audit plan identifying 
their audit scope, planning materiality and their assessment of key risks. 
The audit risk identification process is considered a key factor in the 
overall effectiveness of the external audit process. For the 2017 financial 
year, the key risks identified were as follows;
 – T axation matters, including recognition and recoverability of deferred 
tax assets in Luxembourg and Germany and a provisioning claim for 
withholding tax in India.
 – Carrying value of goodwill.
 – Provisions and contingent liabilities.
 – Revenue recognition including accuracy of revenue recorded given 
the complexity of systems and fraud.
 – Management override of internal controls.
 – Accounting for significant one-off transactions.
 – Capitalisation and asset lives.
 – Change in the Group’s presentation currency.
The key audit risks for the 2017 financial year, are unchanged from the 
2016 financial year except for the addition of a new risk arising from the 
change in the Group’s presentation currency from sterling to the euro. 
These risks are regularly reviewed by the Committee to ensure the 
external auditor’s areas of audit focus remain appropriate.
Working with the auditor
We hold private meetings with the external auditor at each Committee 
meeting to provide additional opportunity for open dialogue and 
feedback from the Committee and the auditor without management 
being present. Matters typically discussed include the external 
auditor’s assessment of business risks, the transparency and 
openness of interactions with management, confirmation that there 
has been no restriction in scope placed on them by management, 
the independence of their audit and how they have exercised 
professional scepticism. I also meet with the external lead audit partner 
outside the formal Committee process throughout the year.

Audit and Risk Committee (continued)
Effectiveness of the external audit process
The Committee reviewed the quality of the external audit throughout 
the year and considered the performance of PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP , taking into account the Committee’s own assessment and 
feedback, the results of a detailed survey of senior finance personnel 
across the Group focusing on a range of factors we considered 
relevant to audit quality, feedback from PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP on their performance against their own performance objectives 
and the firm-wide audit quality inspection report issued by the FRC 
in May 2016. In addition, the FRC’s Audit Quality Review team reviewed 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s audit of the Group’s financial statements 
for the year ended 31 March 2016 as part of their 2016 annual 
inspection of audit firms. This concluded that their work was of a high 
standard at both a Group and component level, identifying only minor 
issues arising, all of which were addressed in the audit firm’s proposed 
action plan. 
Based on these reviews, the Committee concluded that there had 
been appropriate focus and challenge by PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP on the primary areas of the audit and that they had applied robust 
challenge and scepticism throughout the audit. Consequently, as noted 
above, the Committee has recommended to the Board that they 
be reappointed at the annual general meeting in July 2017 . 
Independence and objectivity
In its assessment of the independence of the auditor and in accordance 
with the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board’s standard 
on independence, the Committee receives details of any relationships 
between the Company and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP that may 
have a bearing on their independence and receives confirmation that 
they are independent of the Company within the meaning of the 
securities laws administered by the US Securities and Exchange 
Commission (‘SEC’).
During the year, we were notified by our lead audit partner that 
a company, for which a number of PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP partners were acting as administrators, was considering 
litigation against the Group. The Committee, in consultation 
with the Group’s legal advisors, reviewed the implications 
on PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s audit independence from the roles 
played by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s partners as administrators 
and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Group’s statutory auditor 
in the context of relevant regulations and ethical standards. Further, 
the Committee consulted with the UK Financial Reporting Council and 
a number of institutional investors. 
T o address any potential threat to their audit independence, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP put in place a number of safeguards 
including ensuring both the administration and audit teams were 
physically separate and had no interactions, that working papers 
and other highly confidential material were separately stored with 
highly restricted access and that the lead group engagement partner 
would be solely responsible for the audit implications of the potential 
litigation. In response, we requested that both PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP’s Compliance Department and its independent non-executives 
provide oversight of the effectiveness of the safeguards put in place 
and they reported to the Committee on these safeguards on a regular 
basis. PricewaterhouseCoopers confirmed to the Committee that these 
safeguards had been put in place, were being monitored internally and 
operated effectively throughout the relevant period.
The Committee concluded that this position was not prohibited and 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP remained independent for the purposes 
of the audit throughout this period. 
Audit fees
For the 2017 financial year, the Committee considered the ongoing 
fee proposal included as part of the audit tender in 2014, negotiated 
audit scope changes and, following the receipt of formal assurance that 
their fees were appropriate for the scope of the work required, agreed 
a charge from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and related member 
firms of €16 million for statutory audit services. This included €1 million 
in respect of advance audit procedures in respect of the forthcoming 
implementation of IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”.
Non-audit fees
As one of the ways in which it seeks to protect the independence 
and objectivity of the external auditor, the Committee has a policy 
governing the engagement of the external auditor to provide non-audit 
services. This precludes PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP from providing 
certain services such as valuation work or the provision of accounting 
services and also sets a presumption that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
should only be engaged for non-audit services where there is no legal 
or practical alternative supplier.
For certain specific permitted services, the Committee has pre-
approved that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP can be engaged 
by management, subject to the policies set out above, and subject 
to a €60,000 fee limit for individual engagements, a €500,000 total fee 
limit for services where there is no legal alternative and a €500,000 
total fee limit for services where there is no practical alternative supplier. 
For all other services or those permitted services that exceed these 
specified fee limits, I, as Chairman, or in my absence another Committee 
member, can pre-approve permitted services.
In addition, the Committee assessed the impact of revised UK regulation 
including the prohibition of the auditor playing any part in management 
or decision making and expected regulations restricting non-audit 
services that auditors can provide, including a cap on the amount 
of non-audit fees that can be billed and a list of prohibited services. 
Consequently, the Group’s policy on non-audit fees was amended 
to reflect these additional restrictions during the 2017 financial year for 
implementation in the 2018 financial year.
Non-audit fees were €4.0 million of which €3.5 million was for services 
where there was no legal alternative and €0.5 million for services where 
there was no practical alternative supplier. Non-audit fees represented 
22% of audit fees for the 2017 financial year (2016: 1 1%, 2015: 33%) 
with the increase in the current year mainly due to €1.1 million of fees 
relating to a potential initial public offering (‘IPO’) of Vodafone India that 
was being considered prior to the agreement to combine the business 
with Idea Cellular. Further details of the fees paid for audit and non-audit 
services to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP can be found in note 3 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Internal control and risk management
The Committee has the primary responsibility for the oversight of the 
Group’s system of internal control, including the risk management 
framework and the work of the Internal Audit function.
Assessment of Group’s system of internal control, including 
risk management framework
The Group’s risk assessment process and the way in which significant 
business risks are managed is a key area of focus for the Committee. 
Our activity here was driven primarily by the Group’s assessment of its 
principal risks and uncertainties, as set out on pages 28 to 34 and our 
review included reports from the Group Risk and Compliance Director, 
with whom I met regularly during the year, on the Group’s risk evaluation 
process as well as a review of changes to significant risks identified 
at both operating entity and Group levels.
Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 62 The Committee also maintains a programme of in-depth reviews into 
specific financial, operational and regulatory areas of the business. 
These reviews are critical to the role of the Committee, as they allow 
us to meet key business leaders responsible for these areas and provide 
independent challenge to their activities. During the 2017 financial year, 
the areas reviewed included:
 – technology failure, including a review of the Group’s technology 
resilience risk management plan, policy compliance across both the 
Group’s mobile and fixed networks, cyber-threat resiliency and user 
access management;
 – tax risk mitigation strategy, including proactive engagement with 
key stakeholders, external publication of the updated “T ax Risk 
Management Policy” to meet new UK legislative requirements and 
internal policies to manage tax fraud risks;
 – unstable economic conditions and the impact on the 
Group’s treasury operations including the setting of debt maturities, 
fixed/floating interest rate mix and counterparty credit risk;
 – the impact on the framework for risk and compliance in Vodafone 
India following changes in competition driven by the new 
market entrant and the demonetisation introduced by the Indian 
Government in November 2016;
 – the integration of Vodafone Netherlands and Ziggo into the 
merged 50:50 joint venture and the transition to common 
governance standards;
 – a review of the monitoring work being done to assess the impact 
of the referendum vote that Britain should leave the EU; and
 – a review of PricewaterhouseCoopers’ data security and 
confidentiality arrangements.
The Group has in place an internal control environment to protect 
the business from the material risks which have been identified. 
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate 
internal controls over financial reporting and we have responsibility for 
ensuring the effectiveness of these controls. Last year, these controls 
were enhanced through the application of a co-ordinated assurance 
approach which provides a framework that allows a comprehensive 
assessment of the assurance and compliance activities for the 
Group’s significant risks.
We reviewed the process by which the Group evaluated its control 
environment. Our work here was driven primarily by the Group 
Audit Director’s reports on the effectiveness of internal controls, 
significant identified frauds and any identified fraud that involved 
management or employees with a significant role in internal controls. 
Oversight of the Group’s compliance activities in relation to section 404 
of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act also falls within the Committee’s remit.
The Committee has completed its review of the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal control, including risk management, during 
the year and up to the date of this Annual Report, in accordance with the 
requirements of the Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control 
and related Financial and Business Reporting published by the FRC.
It confirms that no significant failings or weaknesses were identified 
in the review for the 2017 financial year and allowed us to provide 
positive assurance to the Board to assist them in making the statements 
required by the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code. Where areas for 
improvement were identified, processes are in place to ensure that the 
necessary action is taken and that progress is monitored.
Internal audit
Monitoring and review of the scope, extent and effectiveness of the 
activity of the Group Internal Audit department is an agenda item 
at each Committee meeting. We approve the annual audit plan prior 
to the start of each financial year and receive updates from the Group 
Audit Director on audit activities, progress against the approved Group 
audit plan, the results of any unsatisfactory audits and the action 
plans to address these areas. I also met regularly with the Group 
Audit Director, which has been of particular importance following the 
appointment of a new Group Audit Director this year, to set annual 
objectives, monitor performance against these objectives, discuss 
the team’s activities and any significant issues arising from their work. 
Following an independent assessment of the function’s effectiveness 
in 2015, and the increasing pace of change of the business, initiatives 
are continuing to be implemented to evolve and strengthen Internal 
Audit’s effectiveness.
Compliance with section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act
The Committee takes an active role in monitoring the Group’s 
compliance activities in respect of section 404 of the US Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, receiving reports from management in the year covering:
 – financial control governance;
 – changes to the section 404 programme, including scoping and the 
results of work performed; and
 – the evolution of the wider control environment in response 
to ongoing business developments.
The scope of the Group’s section 404 compliance activities in 2017 
was broadly stable compared to the 2016 financial year. The external 
auditor reported the status of their work in each of their reports 
to the Committee.
Compliance activities
The Committee is responsible for the oversight of the Group’s 
compliance programme and held a number of deep dive sessions 
on compliance-related matters in the year. These focused on:
 – the organisational model for managing fraud including the use 
of shared services to enhance preventative controls and increase 
the use of big data and advanced analytics to detect trends earlier, 
the types of fraud most commonly detected and the level of fraud 
within the Enterprise business;
 – results from the annual Policy Compliance Review which tests the 
extent to which local markets and Group entities are compliant with 
our high risk policies;
 – a review of the new EU General Data Protection Regulation, likely 
to take effect from May 2018, including the areas of potential impact 
for the Group; and
 – results of the use of “Speak Up” channels in place to enable 
employees to raise concerns about possible irregularities 
in financial reporting or other issues and the outputs of any 
resulting investigations.

Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 65
Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financials Additional information Our US listing requirements
As Vodafone’s American depositary shares are listed on NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (‘NASDAQ’), we are required to disclose a summary of any 
material differences between the corporate governance practices we follow and those of US companies listed on NASDAQ. Vodafone’s corporate 
governance practices are primarily based on UK requirements but substantially conform to those required of US companies listed on NASDAQ. 
The material differences are set out in the following table:  
Board member independence Different tests of independence for Board members are applied under the 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’) and the NASDAQ listing rules. The Board is not required 
to take into consideration NASDAQ’s detailed definitions of independence as set out in the 
NASDAQ listing rules. The Board has carried out an assessment based on the independence 
requirements of the Code and has determined that, in its judgement, each of Vodafone’s Non-
Executive Directors is independent within the meaning of those requirements. 
Committees The NASDAQ listing rules require US companies to have a nominations committee, an audit 
committee and a compensation committee, each composed entirely of independent directors, 
with the nominations committee and the audit committee each required to have a written 
charter which addresses the committee’s purpose and responsibilities, and the compensation 
committee having sole authority and adequate funding to engage compensation consultants, 
independent legal counsel and other compensation advisors. 
 – Our Nominations and Governance Committee is chaired by the Chairman of the Board and 
its other members are independent Non-Executive Directors.
 – Our Remuneration Committee is composed entirely of independent Non-Executive 
Directors. 
 – Our Audit and Risk Committee is composed entirely of Non-Executive Directors, each 
of whom (i) the Board has determined to be independent based on the independence 
requirements of the Code and (ii) meets the independence requirements of the Securities 
Exchange Act 1934.
 – We have terms of reference for our Nominations and Governance Committee, Audit and Risk 
Committee and Remuneration Committee, each of which complies with the requirements 
of the Code and is available for inspection on our website at vodafone.com/ governance.
 – These terms of reference are generally responsive to the relevant NASDAQ listing rules, 
but may not address all aspects of these rules.
Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct Under the NASDAQ listing rules, US companies must adopt a Code of Conduct applicable to all 
directors, officers and employees that complies with the definition of a “code of ethics” set out 
in section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 
 – We have adopted a Code of Ethics that complies with section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
which is applicable only to the senior financial and principal executive officers, and which 
is available on our website at vodafone.com/ governance.
 – We have also adopted a separate Code of Conduct which applies to all employees.
Quorum The quorum required for shareholder meetings, in accordance with our Articles of Association, 
is two shareholders, regardless of the level of their aggregate share ownership, while 
US companies listed on NASDAQ are required by the NASDAQ listing rules to have a minimum 
quorum of 33.33% of the shareholders of ordinary shares for shareholder meetings.
Related party transactions In lieu of obtaining an independent review of related party transactions for conflicts 
of interests in accordance with the NASDAQ listing rules, we seek shareholder approval for 
related party transactions that (i) meet certain financial thresholds or (ii) have unusual features 
in accordance with the Listing Rules issued by the FCA in the United Kingdom (the ‘Listing 
Rules’), the Companies Act 2006 and our Articles of Association. 
Further, we use the definition of a transaction with a related party as set out in the Listing Rules, 
which differs in certain respects from the definition of related party transaction in the NASDAQ 
listing rules. 
Shareholder approval When determining whether shareholder approval is required for a proposed transaction, 
we comply with both the NASDAQ listing rules and the Listing Rules. Under the NASDAQ 
listing rules, whether shareholder approval is required for a transaction depends on, among 
other things, the percentage of shares to be issued or sold in connection with the transaction. 
Under the Listing Rules, whether shareholder approval is required for a transaction depends on, 
among other things, whether the size of a transaction exceeds a certain percentage of the size 
of the listed company undertaking the transaction.
Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 66 Remuneration
 
Directors’ remuneration
Letter from the Remuneration 
Committee Chairman
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I present our 201 7 Directors’ Remuneration 
Report. This report sets out our proposed policy which, if approved 
at our 201 7 AGM, will take effect immediately from the date of  
this meeting. The report also sets out how our current policy was 
implemented during the year.
Current policy – a successful implementation
Our current policy has received continued support since its approval 
at the 2014 AGM, with the Annual Report on Remuneration receiving 
a vote in favour of 97% in each of the last two years.
The Committee believes that the effectiveness of the current policy 
reflects a commitment to our principles of:
 – ensuring our remuneration policy, and the manner in which it is  
implemented, drives the behaviours that support our strategy and 
business objectives;
 – maintaining a “pay for performance” approach to remuneration 
which ensures our incentive plans only deliver significant rewards 
if and when they are justified by business performance;
 – aligning the interests of our senior management team with those 
of shareholders by developing an approach to share ownership that 
helps to maintain commitment over the long term; and
 – offering competitive and fair rates of pay and benefits.
It is both due to this continued support and its ongoing appropriateness 
that the Committee maintained the current policy for its full three 
year life.
Aligning remuneration arrangements with strategic priorities
The importance of aligning our remuneration arrangements 
with our strategic priorities continued to play a crucial role in the 
Committee’s decision-making during the year.
In terms of financial measures, cash flow continues to remain the key 
financial metric in the industry in which we operate – this is currently 
reflected through the presence of this measure in both our short-
term and long-term incentive plan. As we work towards our vision – 
a converged communications leader – a Gigabit Vodafone for the 
Gigabit Society – ensuring that our business has the required resources 
to invest in these new opportunities remains critical to future success. 
Through the proposed change to the structure of our long-term 
incentive, as outlined further below, we therefore seek to ensure the 
weighting of this metric is further enhanced.
From a strategic perspective we aim to deliver superior returns to our 
shareholders by differentiating our business through the provision 
of superior customer service. This strategic vision continues to influence 
our business both internally and externally as we seek to build 
on the early successes generated through our Customer eXperience 
eXcellence programme. As such, the 40% weighting on customer 
appreciation KPIs that was used in 201 7 will continue to apply during 
2018. This will ensure that a significant part of our executives’ short-term 
reward is linked to how our customers judge our performance.
It is the Committee’s view that our reward arrangements best support 
our business effectiveness by only delivering above target payouts 
when this is justified through company performance. This is reflected 
through the stretching and robust variable incentive target-setting 
process undertaken by the Committee on an annual basis which has 
delivered variable levels of payout. 
Key objective:
T o assess and make recommendations to the Board on the policies 
for executive remuneration and reward packages for the individual 
Executive Directors.
Responsibilities:
 – determining, on behalf of the Board, the policy on the 
remuneration of the Chairman of the Board, the Executive 
Directors and the senior management team;
 – determining the total remuneration packages for these individuals 
including any compensation on termination of office;
 – operating within recognised principles of good governance; and
 – preparing an Annual Report on Directors’ remuneration.
The Committee met five times during the year and each meeting 
had full attendance. The terms of reference of the Committee are 
available on vodafone.com/ governance.
Remuneration 
Committee
The Committee continued to ensure that 
decisions made during the year reflected our 
principles, company performance and external 
considerations. In addition, the Committee 
adopted an early timetable of shareholder 
engagement in respect of the policy review.

Page 85 During this year’s shareholder consultation a number of investors 
acknowledged that the Committee has a track record of setting 
stretching targets and ensuring that payments are in line with 
performance – the average payout over the last three years, including 
the year under review, for the GSTIP and GLTI has been 54% and 22% 
of maximum respectively. This is a principle that will continue to apply 
in 2018 and beyond.
Finally, our effectiveness as a business is built on long-term sustainable 
performance. In an industry with an ever-changing technological 
landscape it is vital that our reward arrangements encourage long-term 
strategic thinking and growth, rather than short-term profit-taking. 
It is for this reason that the majority of our proposed reward policy 
continues to be weighted towards the Global Long Term Incentive Plan 
whilst TSR remains a key performance measure in ensuring our final 
payouts accurately reflect the shareholder experience over this period.
The year ahead
In addition to the policy changes outlined below, the 2018 annual bonus 
will see adjusted EBITDA replaced with adjusted EBIT as one of the three 
financial performance conditions to reflect an increased focus on both 
capital discipline and expenditure.
Such a change is within the terms of the current policy and as such 
no wording changes to the GSTIP section of the Policy Report are 
proposed. Annual bonus weightings will also remain unchanged 
for 2018. 
In respect of long-term incentives the revised GLTI structure, subject 
to approval at our 201 7 AGM, will be used for the 2018 GLTI awards 
to the Executive Directors (which will be awarded in the 201 7 
calendar year).
Full details of the remuneration arrangements for our executive 
directors for the year ahead are outlined on pages 84 and 85 of the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
Remuneration outcomes – performance in 2017
Business performance during the year reflected the implementation 
of a number of key strategic programmes across our markets, including 
the capital investment made under Project Spring which has provided 
the platform necessary to work towards our vision of being a converged 
communications leader. Other core programmes in operation during 
the year included our Fit for Growth strategy which aims to reduce 
costs and make the organisation more effective – yielding both 
environmental and financial benefits for the business. The business also 
remained focused on our Customer eXperience eXcellence programme 
during the year which aims to continually improve our customer service 
to ensure full advantage can be taken of the improvements we are 
making to our network.
Remuneration outcomes for performance in 2017 reflect the progress 
made across all of these fronts whilst also reflecting the fact that 
in order to achieve our vision there remains work to be done. 
Annual bonus performance conditions for the year under review 
remained unchanged from 2016, with 60% of opportunity 
based on financial measures and 40% on strategic measures. 
Financial measures comprised service revenue, adjusted EBITDA and 
adjusted free cash flow (all equally weighted) whilst the strategic 
element was based on customer appreciation KPIs.
During the year, service revenue and adjusted EBITDA performance 
were below target whilst performance under the adjusted free cash 
flow and customer appreciation KPIs measures were in line with target. 
The combined performance under all of these measures during the year 
resulted in an overall payout of 47 .3% of maximum. 
As in previous years the annual bonus targets for the year under review 
are disclosed in our Annual Report on Remuneration. Following on from 
our decision to improve disclosure last year by detailing the full target 
ranges used under the financial measures, the Committee has again 
sought to further improve transparency by disclosing additional detail 
on performance against the customer appreciation KPIs metrics.
The final outcome under this strategic element is based on a weighted 
average of performance across all of our markets utilising a range 
of metrics. Despite the difficulty in condensing such a variety of outputs, 
it is recognised that greater insight into outcomes under this measure 
is desired by shareholders. The Committee has therefore sought 
to provide details in a manner which is both succinct and useful to our 
stakeholders. Further details are provided on pages 78 and 79.
The 2015 Global Long-Term Incentive award was subject to free cash 
flow and TSR performance as measured over a three year period 
ending 31 March 2017 . The free cash flow measure finished just above 
target performance during this period whilst TSR performance was 
below the median of TSR comparator group resulting in no uplift being 
applied to the free cash flow outcome. Overall payout for the award was 
therefore 43.5% of maximum.
Shareholder consultation – constructive, timely engagement
Notwithstanding the support received for the current arrangements, 
the Committee recognises that the regulatory requirement to resubmit 
the Policy Report presents a natural point at which to incorporate any 
shareholder feedback and appropriate best practice features that have 
emerged during the last three years.
This is why the Committee committed to an early timetable of  
shareholder engagement in respect of the policy review. In doing so, 
the Committee sought to ensure that shareholder views and comments 
were fully considered as part of the review, with enough time scheduled 
to allow for a two way dialogue.
I can report that the consultation facilitated a high level of response from 
investors, which allowed the Committee to clearly explain the proposals 
and ensure that all feedback was properly considered across a number 
of scheduled Committee meetings.
Proposed policy – evolution, not revolution
The proposed changes reflected in our Policy Report, and outlined 
in detail on the summary page at the end of this letter, do not seek 
a complete overhaul of our current arrangements. Instead, the changes 
reflect our stakeholders’ wishes for the simplification of the current 
arrangements in a manner which retains the core qualities and 
principles that have underpinned our reward strategy in recent years.
This is exemplified through the proposed simplification of the GLTI plan 
via the removal of the co-investment element and the simplification 
of the interplay of performance conditions under the payout matrix. 
Both of these proposed changes tackle features of the current 
arrangements which a number of shareholders have flagged as being 
overly complex, and are coupled with other best practice changes 
including an increase in shareholding guidelines and the introduction 
of clawback.
Remuneration
 
Directors’ remuneration (continued)
Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 68 Improving how we encourage share ownership
Importantly, in proposing to remove the co-investment element 
as a way of simplifying the GLTI, the Committee has also sought 
to ensure that the revised arrangements continue to replicate the share 
ownership effect of co-investment by re-establishing market leading 
shareholding guidelines (500% of salary for the Chief Executive and 
400% of salary for other Executive Directors). This ensures that the 
revised arrangements provide a streamlined GLTI whilst also supporting 
clear and stretching ownership requirements.
In order to reflect the importance of shareholding guidelines both 
during employment but also in the period post-employment, 
the increased guidelines will apply until all long-term incentives have 
vested. This will ensure that our executives continue to share in the 
shareholder experience of any decisions made before departure but 
which may have implications after departure. If this requirement is not 
met, then the Committee will have the ability to lapse any unvested 
GLTI awards.
Furthermore, underpinning this change in how we encourage share 
ownership is an expectation that executives who have not met their 
new, higher shareholding guideline will increase their holding by 100% 
of salary each year until this is reached. If this expectation is not met, 
the Committee will have the discretion to reduce an individual’s next 
target GLTI grant by up to 100% of salary. As Chairman of the Committee 
I would like to reassure shareholders that were these circumstances 
to apply, such discretion will be used in all but exceptional cases.
Simplifying the payout matrix
It was made clear during both this and previous consultations that our 
shareholders would prefer to see the current payout matrix replaced 
with a simpler additive structure where all performance metrics are 
assessed independently of each other. The Committee has listened 
to shareholders on this point and recognises that the more traditional 
schedule allows for a clearer and simpler communication of both 
expected and actual performance. Such a change is therefore reflected 
in the revised Policy Report.
The revised payout matrix has also been designed to ensure that the 
GLTI plan is more weighted towards adjusted FCF performance – a key 
strategic measure for our business. This is reflected through a proposed 
2/3 weighting to this measure with the other 1/3 weighted towards the 
same relative TSR measure used under the current arrangements.
Also in line with shareholder preferences, a further proposed revision 
is the reduction in the size of awards payable at threshold for all 
Executive Directors. 
Other matters considered
In order to align with market practice a key change proposed by the 
Committee is the introduction of clawback to all incentive plans. 
These arrangements will complement the malus arrangements already 
in place and deliver on the Committee’s promise to introduce clawback 
at the next point at which the Policy Report was up for approval.
A potential change that was considered during the consultation was 
the introduction of annual bonus deferral. Following consultation with 
shareholders, the Committee determined that the objectives of bonus 
deferral were already being met through other features of the proposed 
arrangements – namely the heavy weighting of packages towards our 
long-term incentive which already has deferral built in, and the proposed 
increase in shareholding guidelines. The Committee will however 
continue to monitor this area of practice and ensure that shareholders 
remain satisfied with the levels of deferral and share ownership built into 
the arrangements elsewhere.
Pay in the wider context
The Committee is fully aware of the attention that executive pay 
has received in the wider market in recent years. The importance 
of ensuring that pay remains appropriate in light of individual 
and business performance continues to remain central to the 
Committee’s decision-making. 
As in previous years the Committee will continue to ensure that 
incentive payouts are not excessive and any salary increases remain 
appropriate. During the year the Committee agreed a salary increase 
of 1.5% for the Chief Financial Officer (effective 1 July 2018), however 
the Chief Executive’s salary will, at his request, remain unchanged. 
This will be the third year in a row, and the fifth time in the last six years, 
in which the Chief Executive’s salary will not have increased. The salary 
review was taken in the context of a budgeted increase of 1.5% in the 
UK for this year, with the wider Executive Committee being maintained 
in line with local market budgets as explained later in this report. 
The Committee recognises the importance of engagement with both 
internal and external stakeholders and will continue to ensure that such 
engagement plays a central role in future remuneration developments. 
At an employee level our people survey remains a key tool in this 
respect, with the high participation and engagement rate facilitating 
direct communication between the business and our colleagues
Conclusion
I would like to sign-off this letter by thanking our shareholders for the 
continued engagement and support that has been demonstrated 
during the year. In a climate where executive remuneration and 
the processes governing these arrangements is increasingly met 
with scepticism, the Committee welcomed the way shareholders 
engaged actively and constructively during this year’s consultation. 
The Committee values the strong relationships that have been built with 
stakeholders through years of active and timely engagement and will 
continue to work hard to ensure this remains the case in future years.
The Policy Report presented on the following pages is the result 
of an early, informative and engaging consultation and, as Chairman 
of the Committee, I will endeavour to ensure this appreciation of the 
importance of stakeholder engagement continues to be a pillar 
of future Committee activity.

Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financials Additional information Remuneration
 
Directors’ remuneration (continued)
Summary of proposed changes to the Policy Report
In line with the rationale outlined in the Letter from the 
Remuneration Committee Chairman, it is proposed to:
Shareholding guidelines
 – Increase shareholding guidelines to 500% of salary for the Chief 
Executive and 400% of salary for other Executive Directors.
 – Introduce discretion to reduce long-term incentive grant levels 
for Directors who have not met their guideline nor increased their 
shareholding by 100% of salary during the year.
 – Introduce a post-employment condition whereby Directors must 
continue to meet their guideline until all long-term incentives 
have vested. If this requirement is not met, then any unvested 
GLTI awards will normally be forfeited.
Global Long-Term Incentive Plan
 – Remove the co-investment element of the GLTI to simplify the 
plan structure.
 – Replace the current vesting matrix with a simplified model 
whereby both measures operate independently. 
 – Rebalance the weightings of the performance measures to 2/3 
in favour of adjusted FCF and 1/3 in favour of relative TSR. 
 – Reduce threshold opportunity from 1 18.75% to 103.5% of salary 
for the Chief Executive and from 105% to 94.5% of salary for other 
Executive Directors. This equates to reducing threshold vesting 
from 20% to 18% of maximum opportunity.
 – As a result of rebalancing the vesting schedule, maximum 
opportunity for the Chief Executive will also be reduced from 
593.75% to 575% of salary and target opportunity will be reduced 
from 237 .5% to 230% of salary. This is to ensure payout curves 
remain the same across all participants.
Introduction of clawback
 – Trigger events will constitute material misstatement 
of performance, material miscalculation of performance condition 
outcomes and gross misconduct.
 – The provisions will apply to all future GLTI awards and bonus 
payments, and the application period for the provisions will 
be up to three years after the payment of any bonus award, 
and up to two years after the vesting of any GLTI.

Include post-employment holding requirements. Remuneration Policy
In this forward-looking section we describe our remuneration policy for the Board. This includes our considerations when determining policy, 
a description of the elements of the reward package, including an indication of the potential future value of this package for each of the 
Executive Directors, and the policy applied to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors.
We will be seeking shareholder approval for our Remuneration Policy at the 2017 AGM and we intend to implement at that point. A summary 
and explanation of the proposed changes to the current remuneration policy is provided on pages 67 to 70. Subject to approval, we will review 
our policy each year to ensure that it continues to support our company strategy and if we feel it is necessary to make a change to our policy 
within the next three years, we will seek shareholder approval.
Considerations when determining remuneration policy
Our remuneration principles which are outlined on page 67 are the context for our policy. Our principal consideration when determining 
remuneration policy is to ensure that it supports our company strategy and business objectives.
The views of our shareholders are also taken into account when determining executive pay. In advance of asking for approval for the 
remuneration policy we have consulted with our major shareholders. We invited our top 20 shareholders and a number of key governance 
stakeholders to comment on remuneration at Vodafone and to provide feedback on the proposed changes to the current policy which was 
approved at the 2014 AGM. A number of meetings between shareholders and the Remuneration Committee Chairman took place during 
this consultation period. Further details of this consultation are provided on pages 67 to 69 whilst a summary of the proposed changes to our 
current policy, which are incorporated in this revised Remuneration Policy section, is provided on page 70. 
Listening to and consulting with our employees is very important. This can take different forms in different markets but always includes our 
annual people survey which attracts very high levels of participation and engagement. We do not consult directly with employees on the 
executive remuneration policy nor is any fixed remuneration comparison measurement used. However, when determining the policy for 
Executive Directors, we have been mindful of the pay and employment conditions of employees in Vodafone Group as a whole, with particular 
reference to the market in which the executive is based. Further information on our remuneration policy for other employees is given 
on page 7 4.
Performance measures and targets
Our Company strategy and business objectives are the primary consideration when we are selecting performance measures for our incentive 
plans. The targets within our incentive plans that are related to internal financial measures (such as revenue, profit and cash flow) are typically 
determined based on our budgets. Targets for strategic and external measures (such as customer appreciation KPIs and total shareholder 
return (‘TSR’)) are set based on company objectives and in light of the competitive marketplace. The threshold and maximum levels 
of performance are set to reflect minimum acceptable levels at threshold and very stretching levels at maximum.
As in previous Remuneration Reports we will disclose the details of our performance targets for our short and long-term incentive plans. 
However, our annual bonus targets are commercially sensitive and therefore we will only disclose our targets in the Remuneration Report 
following the completion of the financial year. We will disclose the targets for each long-term award in the Remuneration Report for the financial 
year preceding the start of the performance period. 
At the end of each performance period we review performance against the targets, using judgement to account for items such as (but 
not limited to) mergers, acquisitions, disposals, foreign exchange rate movements, changes in accounting treatment, material one-off tax 
settlements etc. The application of judgement is important to ensure that the final assessments of performance are fair and appropriate.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee reviews the incentive plan results before any payments are made to executives or any shares vest and 
has full discretion to adjust the final payment or vesting downwards if they believe circumstances warrant it. In particular, the Committee has the 
discretion to use either malus or clawback as it sees appropriate. In the case of malus, the award may lapse wholly or in part, may vest to a lesser 
extent than it would otherwise have vested or vesting may be delayed. In the case of clawback, the Committee may recover bonus amounts 
that have been paid up to three years after the relevant payment date, or recover share awards that have vested up to two years after the 
relevant vesting date. The key trigger events for the use of the clawback arrangements include material misstatement of performance, material 
miscalculation of performance condition outcomes, and gross misconduct. Subject to approval of this Remuneration Policy, the clawback 
arrangements will be applicable to all future bonus amounts paid, or share awards granted, following the 2017 AGM.

Notes to the remuneration policy table
Existing arrangements
We will honour existing awards to Executive Directors, and incentives, benefits and contractual arrangements made to individuals prior to their 
promotion to the Board and/or prior to the approval and implementation of this policy. For the avoidance of doubt this includes payments 
in respect of any award granted under the previous remuneration policy. This will last until the existing incentives vest (or lapse) or the benefits 
or contractual arrangements no longer apply.
Long-Term Incentive (‘GLTI’)
When referring to our long-term incentive awards we use the financial year end in which the award was made. For example, the “2017 award” 
was made in the financial year ending 31 March 2017 . The awards are usually made in the first half of the financial year (the 2017 award was made 
in June 2016).
The extent to which awards vest depends on two performance conditions:
 – underlying operational performance as measured by adjusted free cash flow; and
 – relative Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) against a peer group median.
Adjusted free cash flow
The free cash flow performance is based on the cumulative adjusted free cash flow figure over the performance period. The detailed targets and 
the definition of adjusted free cash flow are determined each year as appropriate. The target adjusted free cash flow level is set by reference to our 
long-range plan and market expectations. We consider the targets to be critical to the Company’s long-term success and its ability to maximise 
shareholder value, and to be in line with the strategic goals of the Company. The Remuneration Committee sets these targets to be sufficiently 
demanding with significant stretch where only outstanding performance will be rewarded with a maximum payout.
The cumulative adjusted free cash flow vesting levels as a percentage of the award subject to this performance element are shown in the table 
below (with linear interpolation between points):
Performance
Vesting percentage 
(% of FCF element) 
Below threshold 0%
Threshold 18%
Target 40%
Maximum 100%
TSR outperformance of a peer group median
We have a limited number of appropriate peers and this makes the measurement of a relative ranking system volatile. As such, the  
outperformance of the median of a peer group is felt to be the most appropriate TSR measure. The peer group for the performance 
condition is reviewed each year and amended as appropriate.
The TSR vesting levels as a percentage of the award subject to this performance element are shown in the table below (with linear interpolation 
between points):
Vesting percentage
(% of TSR element)
Below median 0%
Median 18%
Percentage outperformance of the peer group median equivalent to 65th percentile 40%
Percentage outperformance of the peer group median equivalent to 80th percentile 100%
In order to determine the percentages for the equivalent outperformance levels above median, the Remuneration Committee seeks independent 
external advice.
Remuneration policy for other employees
While our remuneration policy follows the same fundamental principles across the Group, packages offered to employees reflect differences 
in market practice in the different countries, role and seniority.
For example, the remuneration package elements for our Executive Committee are essentially the same as for the Executive Directors with some 
minor differences, for example smaller levels of share awards and local or regional performance conditions where appropriate. The remuneration 
for the next level of management, our senior leadership team, again follows the same principles with local and individual performance aspects 
in the annual bonus targets and performance share awards. They also receive lower levels of share awards which are partly delivered in conditional 
share awards without performance conditions.

The tables below provide estimates of the potential future remuneration for each of the Executive Directors based on the remuneration 
opportunity to be granted in the 2018 financial year. Potential outcomes based on different performance scenarios are provided for each 
Executive Director.
The assumptions underlying each scenario are described below.
Fixed Consists of base salary, benefits and pension.
Base salary is at 1 July 2017 .
Benefits are valued using the figures in the total remuneration for the 2017 financial year table on page 78 (of the 2017 report).
Pensions are valued by applying cash allowance rate of 24% of base salary at 1 July 2017 .

On target Based on what a Director would receive if performance was in line with plan.
The target award opportunity for the annual bonus (‘GSTIP’) is 100% of base salary.
The target award opportunity for the long-term incentive (‘GLTI’) is 230% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 210% for the 
Chief Financial Officer. We assumed that TSR performance was at median. 
Maximum Two times the target award opportunity is payable under the annual bonus (‘GSTIP’).
The maximum levels of performance for the long-term incentive (‘GLTI’) are 250% of target award opportunity. We assumed 
that TSR performance was at or above the 80th percentile equivalent.
All scenarios Long-term incentives consist of share awards only which are measured at face value i.e. no assumption for increase in share 
price or cash dividend equivalents payable.

Recruitment remuneration
Our approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary and appropriate to attract the right talent to the role. 
The remuneration policy table (pages 72 and 73) sets out the various components which would be considered for inclusion in the remuneration 
package for the appointment of an Executive Director. Any new Director’s remuneration package would include the same elements, 
and be subject to the same constraints, as those of the existing Directors performing similar roles. This means a potential maximum bonus 
opportunity of 200% of base salary and long-term incentive maximum face value of opportunity at award of 575% of base salary.
When considering the remuneration arrangements of individuals recruited from external roles to the Board, we will take into account the 
remuneration package of that individual in their prior role. We only provide additional compensation to individuals for awards foregone. 
If necessary we will seek to replicate, as far as practicable, the level and timing of such remuneration, taking into account also any remaining 
performance requirements applying to it. This will be achieved by granting awards of cash or shares that vest over a timeframe similar to those 
forfeited and if appropriate based on performance conditions. A commensurate reduction in quantum will be applied where it is determined that 
the new awards are either not subject to performance conditions or subject to performance conditions that are not as stretching as those of the 
awards forfeited.
Service contracts of Executive Directors
After an initial term of up to two years Executive Directors’ contracts have rolling terms and are terminable on no more than 12 months’ notice.
The key elements of the service contract for executives relate to remuneration, payments on loss of office (see below), and restrictions during 
active employment (and for 12 months thereafter). These restrictions include non-competition, non-solicitation of customers and employees etc.
Additionally, all of the Company’s share plans contain provisions relating to a change of control. Outstanding awards and options would normally 
vest and become exercisable on a change of control to the extent that any performance condition has been satisfied and pro-rated to reflect the 
acceleration of vesting.
Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 75
Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financials Additional information Remuneration Policy (continued)
Payments for departing executives
In the table below we summarise the key elements of our policy on payment for loss of office. We will of course, always comply both with the 
relevant plan rules and local employment legislation.
Provision Policy
Notice period and 
compensation for  
loss of office in 
service contracts
 – 12 months’ notice from the Company to the Executive Director.
 – Up to 12 months’ base salary (in line with the notice period). Notice period payments will either be made as normal 
(if the executive continues to work during the notice period or is on gardening leave) or they will be made 
as monthly payments in lieu of notice (subject to mitigation if alternative employment is obtained).
Treatment of annual bonus 
(‘GSTIP’) on termination 
under plan rules
 – The annual bonus will be pro-rated for the period of service during the financial year and will reflect the extent 
to which Company performance has been achieved.
 – The Remuneration Committee has discretion to reduce the entitlement to an annual bonus to reflect the 
individual’s performance and the circumstances of the termination.
Treatment of unvested 
long-term incentive awards 
(‘GLTI’) on termination 
under plan rules
 – An Executive Director’s award will vest in accordance with the terms of the plan and satisfaction of performance 
conditions measured at the normal completion of the performance period, with the award pro-rated for the 
proportion of the vesting period that had elapsed at the date of cessation of employment.
 – The Remuneration Committee has discretion to vary the level of vesting as deemed appropriate, and in particular 
to determine that awards should not vest for reasons which may include, at their absolute discretion, departure 
in case of poor performance, departure without the agreement of the Board, or detrimental competitive activity.
Pension and benefits – Generally pension and benefit provisions will continue to apply until the termination date.
 – Where appropriate other benefits may be receivable, such as (but not limited to) payments in lieu of accrued holiday 
and legal fees or tax advice costs in relation to the termination.
 – Benefits of relative small value may continue after termination where appropriate, such as (but not limited to) 
mobile phone provision.
In exceptional circumstances, an arrangement may be established specifically to facilitate the exit of a particular individual albeit that any such 
arrangement would be made within the context of minimising the cost to the Group. We will only take such a course of action in exceptional 
circumstances and where it is considered to be in the best interests of shareholders.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration
Our policy is for the Chairman to review the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors annually following consultation with the Remuneration 
Committee Chairman. Fees for the Chairman are set by the Remuneration Committee.
Element Policy
Fees – We aim to pay competitively for the role including consideration of the time commitment required. We benchmark 
the fees against an appropriate external comparator group. We pay fees to our Chairman and Senior Independent 
Director that include fees for chairmanship of any committees. We pay a fee to each of our other Non-Executive 
Directors and they receive an additional fee if they chair a committee. Non-executive fee levels are set within the 
maximum level as approved by shareholders as part of our Articles of Association.
Allowances – An allowance is payable each time a non-Europe-based Non-Executive Director is required to travel to attend Board 
and committee meetings to reflect the additional time commitment involved.
Incentives – Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any incentive plans. 
Benefits – Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any benefit plans. The Company does not provide any contribution 
to their pension arrangements. The Chairman is entitled to the use of a car and a driver whenever and wherever 
he is providing his services to or representing the Company. We have been advised that for Non-Executive Directors, 
certain travel and accommodation expenses in relation to attending Board meetings should be treated as a taxable 
benefit therefore we also cover the tax liability for these expenses.
Non-Executive Director service contracts
Non-Executive Directors are engaged on letters of appointment that set out their duties and responsibilities. The appointment of Non-Executive 
Directors may be terminated without compensation. Non-Executive Directors are generally not expected to serve for a period exceeding nine 
years. For further information refer to the “Nomination and Governance Committee” section of the Annual Report.

Remuneration Committee
In this section we give details of the composition of the Remuneration Committee and activities undertaken during the 2017 financial year. 
The Committee is comprised to exercise independent judgement and consists only of the following independent Non-Executive Directors:
Chairman: Valerie Gooding  
Committee members: Dr Mathias Döpfner, Renee James and Samuel Jonah
The Committee regularly consults with Vittorio Colao, the Chief Executive, and Ronald Schellekens, the Group HR Director, on various matters 
relating to the appropriateness of awards for Executive Directors and senior executives, though they are not present when their own compensation 
is discussed. In addition, Adrian Jackson, the Group Reward and Policy Director, provides a perspective on information provided to the Committee, 
and requests information and analysis from external advisers as required. Rosemary Martin, the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, 
advises the Committee on corporate governance guidelines and acts as secretary to the Committee.
External advisers
The Remuneration Committee seeks and considers advice from independent remuneration advisers where appropriate. The appointed advisers, 
Willis T owers Watson, were selected through a thorough process led by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and were appointed by the 
Committee in 2007 . The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee has direct access to the advisers as and when required, and the Committee 
determines the protocols by which the advisers interact with management in support of the Committee. The advice and recommendations 
of the external advisers are used as a guide, but do not serve as a substitute for thorough consideration of the issues by each Committee member. 
Advisers attend Committee meetings occasionally, as and when required by the Committee.
Willis T owers Watson is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the Remuneration Consultants’ 
Group Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. This is based upon principles of transparency, integrity, 
objectivity, competence, due care and confidentiality by executive remuneration consultants. Willis Towers Watson has confirmed that it adheres

2017 remuneration
In this section we summarise the pay packages awarded to our Executive Directors for performance in the 2017 financial year versus 2016. 
Specifically we have provided a table that shows all remuneration that was earned by each individual during the year and computed a single total 
remuneration figure for the year. The value of the annual bonus (‘GSTIP’) reflects what was earned in respect of the year but will be paid out in cash 
in the following year. Similarly the value of the long-term incentive (‘GLTI’) reflects the share awards which will vest in June 2017 as a result of the 
performance through the three year period ended at the completion of our financial year on 31 March 2017 .
The Remuneration Committee reviews all incentive awards prior to payment and uses judgement to ensure that the final assessments 
of performance are fair and appropriate. If circumstances warrant it, the Committee may adjust the final payment or vesting downwards. On this 
occasion, based on the fact that final annual bonus payout and final vesting level of long-term incentives awards under the GLTI were deemed 
to be an accurate reflection of performance and were considered fair and appropriate, the Committee did not use its discretion to adjust 
final outcomes.

2017 annual bonus (‘GSTIP’) payout (audited)
In the table below we disclose our achievement against each of the performance measures and targets in our annual bonus (‘GSTIP’) and the 
resulting total annual bonus payout level for the year ended 31 March 2017 of 94.5% of target. This is applied to the target bonus level of 100% 
of base salary for each executive. Commentary on our performance against each measure is provided below the table.

Notes:
1 These figures are adjusted to include the removal of the impact of M&A, foreign exchange movements and any changes in accounting treatment.
2 Adjusted EBITDA, previously referred to as EBITDA in prior year reports.
During the year under review, service revenue performance was slightly below budget which was mainly due to below target performance in our 
UK, India and Carrier Services businesses. Adjusted EBITDA result was also slightly below target performance with the UK business off-setting 
above target performance in Europe and India off-setting positive performance in the AMAP region. With regards to adjusted free cash flow, overall 
performance was on target with below target results in the Europe and AMAP regions being offset by positive cash management at a Group level.
Customer appreciation KPIs
An assessment of performance under the customer appreciation KPIs measure was conducted on a market by market basis. Each market was 
assessed against a number of different metrics which included: 
 – Net promoter score for both Consumer and Enterprise business units
 – Brand consideration for Enterprise and both Consumer user and Consumer non-user
 – Churn, revenue market share and ARPU
Remuneration
 
Directors’ remuneration (continued)
Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 78 In respect of the measures included under the customer appreciation KPIs, net promoter score is used as a measure of the extent to which our 
customers would recommend us, whilst brand consideration acts as a measure of the percentage of people who would consider using a certain 
brand as their telecoms provider. 
Both measures utilise data from our local markets which is collected and validated for quality and consistency by independent third party agencies. 
The data is sourced from studies involving both our own customers and customers of our competitors for the NPS measure, and both Vodafone 
users and non-users for the brand consideration measure. In formulating a final assessment of performance under the customer appreciation KPIs 
other relevant customer factors such as churn, customer growth and service levels are considered. 
The aggregated performance for the regions and the Group are calculated on a revenue-weighted average to give an overall achievement. 
Performance this year under this measure is as follows;
Customer appreciation  
KPIs Achievement
Europe 89.5%
AMAP 119.5%
Group 99.1%
The achievement percentage for Europe reflects strong performance in Italy, where we remain the Consumer NPS leader, as well as in Spain where 
not only did we remain the Consumer NPS leader but we also now lead the brand consideration for non user consumers. This strong performance 
however is offset by poor performance in the UK where further improvement is required on the customer experience.
The achievement percentage for AMAP reflects strong performance in several markets, specifically Egypt, South Africa and Ghana. Egypt are 
leaders in both Consumer and Enterprise NPS and continue to maintain their number 1 position in brand consideration for both Consumer and 
Enterprise, while South Africa continue to lead in both Consumer NPS and brand consideration.

All-employee share plans
During the year, the Executive Directors were eligible to participate in the UK all-employee plans.
Summary of plans
Sharesave
The Vodafone Group 2008 Sharesave Plan is an HM Revenue & Customs (‘HMRC’) approved scheme open to all staff permanently employed by 
a Vodafone company in the UK as of the eligibility date. Options under the plan are granted at up to a 20% discount to market value. Executive 
Directors’ participation is included in the option table on page 82.
Share Incentive Plan
The Vodafone Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’) is an HMRC approved plan open to all staff permanently employed by a Vodafone company in the UK. 
Participants may contribute up to a maximum of £125 per month (or 5% of salary if less) which the trustee of the plan uses to buy shares on their 
behalf. An equivalent number of shares are purchased with contributions from the employing company. UK-based Executive Directors are eligible 
to participate.
Following a review of the UK all-employee plans it was decided that with effect from 1 April 201 7 such offerings should be solely provided through 
an enhanced Sharesave programme. The new arrangements bring our UK all-employee plans more closely in line with market practice, help 
to reduce our costs and provide a simpler share plan offering for our UK employees.

the shareholding guidelines will be increased to 500% of salary for the Chief Executive and 400% of salary for other Executive Directors with 
effect from the 2017 AGM. The revised guidelines will also include a post-employment condition whereby the Executive Directors will be required 
to continue to meet their guideline until all long-term incentives have vested. If this condition is not met, then any unvested GLTI awards will 
normally be forfeited 
Collectively the Executive Committee including the Executive Directors own more than 21 million Vodafone shares, with a value of over 
£45.3 million. None of the Executive Committee members’ shareholdings amounts to more than 1% of the issued shares in that class of share,

below shows the performance of the Company relative to the STOXX Europe 600 Index over an eight year period. The STOXX Europe 600 Index 
was selected as this is a broad-based index that includes many of our closest competitors. It should be noted that the payout from the long-term 
incentive plan is based on the TSR performance shown in the chart on page 79 and not this chart.

Change in the Chief Executive’s remuneration
In the table below we show the percentage change in the Chief Executive’s remuneration (salary, taxable benefits and annual bonus payment) 
between the 2016 and 2017 financial years compared to the average for other Vodafone Group employees who are measured on comparable 
business objectives and who have been employed in the UK since 2016 (per capita). Vodafone has employees based all around the world and some 
of these individuals work in countries with very high inflation therefore a comparison to Vodafone’s UK-based Group employees is more appropriate 
than to all employees.

2018 remuneration
Details of how the remuneration policy will be implemented for the 2018 financial year are set out below.
2018 base salaries
As part of the 201 7 review, the Remuneration Committee considered business performance, salary increases for other UK employees and external 
market information. In respect of external market information, the Committee looked at the following two peer groups: 
1)   Euro Top peer group: Top 25 European general industry companies by market capitalisation, excluding financial services companies, as well 
as a select group of telecommunications companies in the Top 100 that are also members of our TSR peer group. 
2)   FTSE 30: Top 30 FTSE listed companies by market capitalisation, excluding financial services companies. 
The Committee decided to increase the salary of the Chief Financial Officer by 1.5% which is in line with the average salary increase budget for all 
employees across the UK. The Chief Executive requested not to be considered for a salary increase during the review. The average salary increase for 
Executive Committee members will be 1.6% – this compares to a budget of 1.5% which is based on an average of the relevant local market budget 
for each Executive Committee member.
The annual salaries for 2018 (effective 1 July 201 7) are as follows:
 – Chief Executive: Vittorio Colao £1,150,000; and
 – Chief Financial Officer: Nick Read £725,000.
2018 annual bonus (‘GSTIP’)
Following the Committee’s annual review of the GSTIP framework, and as outlined on pages 68 and 70, the Committee decided that the adjusted 
EBITDA measure used in previous years should be replaced with an adjusted EBIT measure to reflect an increased focus on both capital discipline 
and expenditure. The performance measures and weightings for 2018 are outlined below.
 – service revenue (20%);
 – adjusted EBIT (20%);
 – adjusted free cash flow (20%); and
 – customer appreciation KPIs (40%). This includes an assessment of net promoter score (‘NPS’) and brand consideration measures.
The assessment of NPS and brand consideration metrics utilises data collected in our local markets which is validated for quality and consistency 
by independent third party agencies. Further details on how this data is collated and how the individual metrics used to measure customer 
appreciation KPIs are defined is provided on pages 78 and 79. 
Due to the potential impact on our commercial interests, annual bonus targets are considered commercially sensitive and therefore will be disclosed 
in the 2018 Remuneration Report following the completion of the financial year.

Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 84 Long-term incentive (‘GLTI’) awards for 2018
Subject to the approval of the Remuneration Policy at the 201 7 AGM, awards for 2018 will be made in line with the arrangements described in our 
policy on pages 72 to 7 4. Vesting of the 2018 award will be subject to the performance of adjusted free cash flow (2/3 of total award) and TSR (1/3 
of total award). The details for the 2018 award targets are provided in the table below (with linear interpolation between points). 
Following the annual review of the performance measures which included a review of analysis provided by the Committee’s external advisers, 
the Committee decided that for the 2018 award the TSR outperformance range should be increased from 4.5% at target and 9.0% at maximum 
to 5.0% and 10.0% respectively. The Committee also determined it appropriate to keep the same peer group constituents as used for the 2017 
award, but to also include Royal KPN and Liberty Global in the 2018 peer group.

2018 remuneration for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
For the 2017 review, the fees for our Chairman and non-executives have been benchmarked against the FTSE 30 (excluding financial services 
companies). Following the review it was agreed that no changes would be made to the current fee levels which are outlined in the table below.

For 2018, the allowance payable each time a non-Europe-based Non-Executive Director is required to travel to attend Board and Committee 
meetings to reflect the additional time commitment involved is £6,000.
Further remuneration information
Dilution
All awards are made under plans that incorporate dilution limits as set out in the guidelines for share incentive schemes published by the Investment 
Association. The current estimated dilution from subsisting executive awards is approximately 2.9% of the Company’s share capital at 31 March 2017 
(2.8% at 31 March 2016), whilst from all-employee share awards it is approximately 0.3% (0.5% at 31 March 2016). This gives a total dilution of 3.2% 
(3.3% at 31 March 2016).
Service contracts
The terms and conditions of appointment of our Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal business 
hours and at the annual general meeting (for 15 minutes prior to the meeting and during the meeting). The Executive Directors have notice periods 
in their service contracts of 12 months. The Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment do not contain provision for notice periods or for 
compensation if their appointments are terminated.

Directors’ statement of responsibility
Financial statements and accounting records
Company law of England and Wales requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group at the end 
of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. 
In preparing those financial statements the Directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;
 – make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 – present information, including accounting policies, 
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
 – state whether the consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted for use in the EU and Article 4 of the 
EU IAS Regulations. The Directors also ensure that the consolidated 
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS 
as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’);
 – state for the Company’s financial statements whether applicable 
UK accounting standards have been followed; and
 – prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the Group will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and of the Group and to enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 
and for the consolidated financial statements, Article 4 of the EU IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for the system of internal control, 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and, hence, 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 
48 and 49 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
 – the consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
IFRS as issued by the IASB and IFRS as adopted by the EU, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit 
of the Group; 
 – the parent company financial statements, prepared in accordance 
with United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit 
of the Company; and
 – the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Group together 
with a description and carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
The Directors confirm that they have carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks of the Group. 
The Directors are also responsible under section 1 72 of the Companies 
Act 2006 to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its 
members as a whole and in doing so have regard for the needs of wider 
society and stakeholders, including customers, consistent with the 
Group’s core and sustainable business objectives.
Having taken advice from the Audit and Risk Committee, the Board 
considers the report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and that it provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.
Neither the Company nor the Directors accept any liability to any 
person in relation to the Annual Report except to the extent that 
such liability could arise under English law. Accordingly, any liability 
to a person who has demonstrated reliance on any untrue or misleading 
statement or omission shall be determined in accordance with section 
90A and schedule 10A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.
Disclosure of information to the auditor
Having made the requisite enquiries, so far as the Directors are aware, 
there is no relevant audit information (as defined by section 418(3) of the 
Companies Act 2006) of which the Company’s auditor is unaware and 
the Directors have taken all the steps they ought to have taken to make 
themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that 
the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
The Directors are responsible for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable

Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financials Additional information
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, performance, position and principal risks 
and uncertainties and how these are managed or mitigated are set out 
in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 43. 
In addition, the financial position of the Group is included 
in “Borrowings”, “Liquidity and capital resources” and “Capital and 
financial risk management” in notes 21, 22 and 23 respectively to the 
consolidated financial statements, which include disclosure in relation 
to the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its 
capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and 
liquidity risk.
The Group believes it adequately manages or mitigates its solvency 
and liquidity risks through two primary processes, described below.
Business planning process and performance management
The Group’s forecasting and planning cycle consists of three in-year 
forecasts, a budget and a long-range plan. These generate income 
statement, cash flow and net debt projections for assessment by Group 
management and the Board.
Each forecast is compared with prior forecasts and actual results 
so as to identify variances and understand the drivers of the changes 
and their future impact so as to allow management to take action where 
appropriate. Additional analysis is undertaken to review and sense check 
the key assumptions underpinning the forecasts.
Cash flow and liquidity reviews
The business planning process provides outputs for detailed cash flow 
and liquidity reviews, to ensure that the Group maintains adequate 
liquidity throughout the forecast periods. The prime output is a one year 
liquidity forecast which is prepared and updated on a daily basis which 
highlights the extent of the Group’s liquidity based on controlled cash 
flows and the headroom under the Group’s undrawn revolving credit 
facility (‘RCF’).
The key inputs into this forecast are:
 – free cash flow forecasts, with the first three months’ inputs being  
sourced directly from the operating companies (analysed on a  
daily basis), with information beyond this taken from the latest 
forecast/budget cycle;
 – bond and other debt maturities; and
 – expectations for shareholder returns, spectrum auctions and 
M&A activity.
The liquidity forecast shows two scenarios assuming either maturing 
commercial paper is refinanced or no new commercial paper issuance. 
The liquidity forecast is reviewed by the Group Chief Financial Officer 
and included in each of his reports to the Board.
In addition, the Group continues to manage its foreign exchange and 
interest rate risks within the framework of policies and guidelines 
authorised and reviewed by the Board, with oversight provided 
by the Treasury Risk Committee.
Conclusion
The Group has considerable financial resources, and the Directors 
believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks 
successfully. Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and accounts.
Management’s report on internal control  
over financial reporting
As required by section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management 
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control 
over financial reporting for the Group. The Group’s internal control over 
financial reporting includes policies and procedures that:
 – pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets;
 – are designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the EU and IFRS 
as issued by the IASB, and that receipts and expenditures are being 
made only in accordance with authorisation of management and the 
Directors of the Company; and 
 – provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely  
detection of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition 
of the Group’s assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements. 
Any internal control framework, no matter how well designed, 
has inherent limitations including the possibility of human error and 
the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures, 
and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections 
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the 
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes 
in conditions or because the degree of compliance with the policies 
or procedures may deteriorate.
Management has assessed the effectiveness of the internal control 
over financial reporting at 31 March 2017 based on the updated 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee 
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (‘COSO’) 
in 2013. Based on management’s assessment, management has 
concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective 
at 31 March 2017 . 
During the period covered by this document, there were no changes 
in the Group’s internal control over financial reporting that have 
materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the 
effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting.
The Group’s internal control over financial reporting at 31 March 2017 
has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , an independent 
registered public accounting firm who also audit the Group’s  
consolidated financial statements. Their audit report on internal  
control over financial reporting is on page 90.

Report of independent registered public accounting firm
T o Board of Directors and shareholders 
of Vodafone Group Plc
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated statement of financial 
position and the related consolidated income statement, consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement 
of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows present 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Vodafone Group 
Plc and its subsidiaries (‘the Company’) at 31 March 2017 and 31 March 
2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each 
of the three years ended 31 March 2017 in conformity with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board and in conformity with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. Also in our 
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective 
internal control over financial reporting as of 31 March 2017 , based 
on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework 2013 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (‘COSO’). 
The Company’s management is responsible for these financial 
statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial 
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control 
over financial reporting, included in Management’s report on internal 
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions 
on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal control 
over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and International 
Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether 
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all 
material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included 
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting 
principles used and significant estimates made by management, 
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit 
of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining 
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing 
the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such 
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. 
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, 
the Company changed its presentation currency with effect from 
1 April 2016.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process 
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes 
those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary 
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets 
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial 
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections 
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the 
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes 
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies 
or procedures may deteriorate.

Our audit approach
Overview
Audit scope
Materiality
Areas of 
focus
 
Overall Group materiality: €215 million which represents 5% of a three year average of ‘Adjusted 
operating profit’ (‘AOP’), including Vodafone India. We used a three year average given volatility in the 
measure year-on-year as a result of Project Spring.
We identified six local operations which, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial 
information, either due to their size or their risk characteristics comprising UK, Spain, Italy, India, 
Germany and Vodacom South Africa. The scope of work in Germany did not include an audit of the 
complete financial information of Kabel Deutschland GmbH (‘KDG’).
Further specific audit procedures over central functions and areas of significant judgement, including 
taxation, goodwill, treasury and material provisions and contingent liabilities, were performed at the 
Group’s Head Office.
 – T axation matters, including a provisioning claim for withholding tax in India and the recognition and 
recoverability of deferred tax assets in Luxembourg and Germany.
 – Carrying value of goodwill.
 – Provisions and contingent liabilities.
 – Revenue recognition – accuracy of revenue recorded given the complexity of systems.
 – Significant one-off transactions.
 – Capitalisation and asset lives.
 – IT systems and controls.
 – Changes in Group’s presentation currency. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 92
Audit report on the consolidated and parent company financial statements (continued)
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, 
we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override 
of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due 
to fraud.
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identified 
as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide an opinion 
on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. This is not 
a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
T axation matters 
The Group operates across a large number of 
jurisdictions and is subject to periodic challenges by 
local tax authorities on a range of tax matters during the 
normal course of business including transfer pricing, 
indirect taxes and transaction related tax matters. 
We focused on two matters relating to the legal claim 
in respect of withholding tax on the acquisition of 
Hutchison Essar Limited and the recognition and 
recoverability of deferred tax assets in Luxembourg 
and Germany.
Provisioning claim for withholding tax – there continues 
to be uncertainty regarding the resolution of the 
legal claim from the Indian authorities in respect 
of withholding tax on the acquisition of Hutchison 
Essar Limited.
Recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets in 
Luxembourg and Germany – significant judgement is 
required in relation to the recognition and recoverability 
of deferred tax assets, particularly in respect of losses 
in Luxembourg and Germany amounting to €19.6 
billion and €2.8 billion respectively. During the current 
year €4.3 billion of deferred tax assets have been de-
recognised due to lower interest rates and a change in 
the local Luxembourg corporate tax rate. 
Refer to the Audit and Risk Committee Report, note 1 
– “Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty”, note 6 – “Taxation” and note 30 
– “Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings”.
 
We evaluated the design and implementation of controls in respect of provisioning for 
withholding tax and the recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets.
We used our tax specialists to gain an understanding of the current status of the Indian tax 
investigation and monitored changes in the disputes by reading external advice received 
by the Group, where relevant, to establish that the tax provisions had been appropriately 
adjusted to reflect the latest external developments.
In respect of the deferred tax assets, we assessed the recoverability of losses from a tax 
perspective through performing the following:
 – understanding how losses arose and where they are located, including to which 
subgroups they are attributed;
 – considering whether the losses can be reversed;
 – evaluating the results of local statutory impairment assessments including reversals;
 – considering the impact of recent regulatory developments, as applicable; 
 – assessing any restrictions on future use; and
 – determining whether any of the losses will expire.
In addition we assessed the application of International Accounting Standard 1 2 – Income 
T axes including:
 – understanding the triggers for recognition of deferred tax assets;
 – considering effects of tax planning strategies; 
 – testing the mathematical accuracy of the cash flow models and challenging and 
agreeing the key assumptions in the Board approved five year management plan; and 
 – assessing management’s view of the Group’s likelihood of generating future taxable 
profits to support the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. 
We determined that the carrying value of deferred tax assets at 31 March 2017 was 
supported by management’s plans including intercompany funding arrangements.
We validated the appropriateness of the related disclosures in note 6 and note 30 of the 
financial statements, including the disclosures made in respect of the utilisation period of 
deferred tax assets. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 93

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Carrying value of goodwill 
The Group has goodwill of €26.8 billion contained 
within 22 cash generating units (‘CGUs’).
Impairment charges to goodwill have been recognised 
in prior periods. With the continued difficult 
macroeconomic environment in Europe and the 
changing regulatory environment globally the risk 
that goodwill is impaired increases.
For the CGUs which contain goodwill, the determination 
of recoverable amount, being the higher of fair value 
less costs to sell and value in use, requires judgement 
on the part of management in both identifying and 
then valuing the relevant CGUs. Recoverable amounts 
are based on management’s view of variables such as 
future average revenue per user, average customer 
numbers and customer churn, timing and approval 
of future capital, spectrum and operating expenditure 
and the most appropriate discount rate.
In the year ended 31 March 2017 , a pre-tax impairment 
charge of €4.5 billion was recognised related to 
goodwill in India. Refer to area of focus on ‘Significant 
one-off transactions’. 
Refer to the Audit and Risk Committee Report, note 1 
– “Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty”, note 4 – “Impairment losses” 
and note 10 – “Intangible assets”.
 
We evaluated the appropriateness of management’s identification of the Group’s CGUs 
and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the impairment assessment 
process, including indicators of impairment.
With the support of our valuation experts, we benchmarked and challenged key 
assumptions in management’s valuation models used to determine recoverable amount 
against external data, including assumptions of projected adjusted EBITDA, projected 
capital expenditure, projected licence and spectrum payments, long-term growth rate 
and discount rates. 
We performed testing of the mathematical accuracy of the cash flow models and 
challenging and agreeing the key assumptions in the Board approved five year 
management plan. 
Based on our procedures, we noted no exceptions and consider management’s key 
assumptions to be within a reasonable range. 
We validated the appropriateness of the related disclosures in note 4 and note 10 of the 
financial statements. 
Provisions and contingent liabilities 
There are a number of threatened and actual legal, 
regulatory and tax cases against the Group. There is a 
high level of judgement required in estimating the level 
of provisioning required.
Refer to the Audit and Risk Committee Report, note 1 
– “Critical accounting judgements and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty”, note 1 7 – “Provisions” and 
note 30 – “Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings”.
 
We used our tax specialists to gain an understanding of the current status of the tax cases 
and monitored changes in the disputes by reading external advice received by the Group, 
where relevant, to establish that the tax provisions had been appropriately adjusted to 
reflect the latest external developments.
For legal, regulatory and tax matters our procedures included the following:
 – testing key controls surrounding litigation, regulatory and tax procedures;
 – performing substantive procedures on the underlying calculations supporting the 
provisions recorded;
 – where relevant, reading external legal opinions obtained by management;
 – meeting with regional and local management and reading subsequent 
Group correspondence;
 – discussing open matters with the Group litigation, regulatory, general counsel and 
tax teams;
 – assessing management’s conclusions through understanding precedents set in similar 
cases; and
 – circularisation where appropriate of relevant third party legal representatives and direct 
discussion with them regarding certain material cases.
Based on the evidence obtained, while noting the inherent uncertainty with such legal, 
regulatory and tax matters, we determined the level of provisioning at 31 March 2017 to 
be appropriate.
We validated the completeness and appropriateness of the related disclosures through 
assessing that the disclosure of the uncertainties in note 17 and note 30 of the financial 
statements was sufficient. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 94

Revenue recognition – accuracy of revenue recorded 
given the complexity of systems 
There is an inherent risk around the accuracy of 
revenue recorded given the complexity of systems 
and the impact of changing pricing models to revenue 
recognition (tariff structures, incentive arrangements, 
discounts etc.).
The application of revenue recognition accounting 
standards is complex and involves a number of key 
judgements and estimates.
Refer to the Audit and Risk Committee Report and 
note 1 – “Critical accounting judgements and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty”.
 
 
We instructed the six local market audit teams in Group audit scope to undertake 
consistent audit procedures over revenue. 
Our audit approach included controls testing and substantive procedures covering, 
in particular:
 – testing the IT environment in which billing, rating and other relevant support systems 
reside, including the change control procedures in place around systems that bill 
material revenue streams;
 – testing the end-to-end reconciliation from business support systems to billing and 
rating systems to the general ledger. This testing included validating material journals 
processed between the billing system and general ledger;
 – performing tests on the accuracy of customer bill generation on a sample basis and 
testing of a sample of the credits and discounts applied to customer bills; and
 – testing cash receipts for a sample of customers back to the customer invoice.
We also considered the application of the Group’s accounting policies to amounts billed 
and the accounting implications of new business models to check that Group accounting 
policies were appropriate for these models and were followed.
Based on our work, we noted no significant issues on the accuracy of revenue recorded in 
the year.
Significant one-off transactions 
We focused on two significant one-off transactions 
which occurred during the year: the completion of the 
Netherlands joint venture with Liberty Global and the 
proposed merger of the Group’s Indian business with 
Idea Cellular. Accounting for these transactions and 
related disclosures requires the exercise of significant 
judgement.
Netherlands joint venture – on 31 December 2016 
Liberty Global and Vodafone completed a 50:50 
joint venture in respect of their businesses in the 
Netherlands, ‘VodafoneZiggo’. Management has 
assessed that VodafoneZiggo is a jointly controlled 
entity as decisions about the relevant activities require 
the consent of both parties. A gain of €1.3 billion has 
been recognised in connection with the transaction. 
Transaction with Idea – on 20 March 201 7 the merger 
of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular was announced. 
This merger, once completed, will result in a 45.1% stake 
for Vodafone Group, 26% stake for Aditya Birla Group 
with the remaining 28.9% being shares in public float. 
The Vodafone India business, excluding its 42% stake in 
Indus T owers, has been presented as ‘held for sale’ and 
‘discontinued operations’ as at 31 March 2017 . At the 
balance sheet date, as required by IFRS 5 the business 
is held at fair value less cost to sell. A pre-tax impairment 
charge of €4.5 billion has been recognised for the 
year, together with the recognition of an associated 
€0.8 billion deferred tax asset.
Refer to the Audit and Risk Committee Report, note 1 
– “Critical accounting judgements and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty” and related notes in the 
financial statements.
 
Our procedures on the Netherlands joint venture included the following:
 – making use of our valuations specialists to support the assessment of the valuation 
of the business, including challenging and agreeing the key assumptions in the 
approved business plan and the allocation of synergies to calculate the gain; 
 – challenging management’s assessment on the treatment as a joint venture including 
examining the relevant agreements; and 
 – checking the disclosures in the Annual Report.
Our procedures on the proposed transaction with Aditya Birla Group included the 
following:
 – challenging management on whether the requirements under IFRS 5 for the India 
business to be classified as held for sale and discontinued operations were met, 
including reading and discussion of relevant third party legal advice; 
 – making use of our valuation specialists to examine the valuation methodology 
in determining the fair value less cost to sell; 
 – verifying the accuracy of management’s calculation of the impairment charge and 
allocation to respective asset classes and the recognition and recoverability of the 
associated deferred tax asset; and 
 – checking the disclosures in the Annual Report.
Based on our procedures, we noted no issues and were satisfied with the associated 
accounting for these matters. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 95

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Capitalisation and asset lives 
There are a number of areas where management 
judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant 
and equipment, software intangible assets and their 
respective depreciation profiles. These include:
 – the decision to capitalise or expense costs;
 – the annual asset life review including the impact 
of changes in the Group’s strategy; and
 – the timeliness of the transfer from assets in the 
course of construction.
Refer to the Audit and Risk Committee Report, note 1 
– “Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty”, note 10 – “Intangible assets” 
and note 1 1 – “Property, plant and equipment”.
 
We tested controls in place over the property, plant and equipment cycle, evaluated the 
appropriateness of capitalisation policies, performed tests of details on costs capitalised 
and assessed the timeliness of the transfer of assets in the course of construction and the 
application of the asset life. 
In performing these substantive procedures, we assessed the judgements made by 
management including:
 – the nature of underlying costs capitalised as part of the cost of the network roll-out;
 – the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation; and
 – in assessing the need for accelerated depreciation given the network modernisation 
programme in place across Europe.
No issues were noted from our testing.
IT systems and controls 
We place a high level of reliance on the Group’s 
IT systems and key internal controls. As a result a 
significant proportion of our audit effort was conducted 
in this area at local, regional and Group levels and at the 
Group’s shared service centres.
The Group has continued to devote considerable 
resources to the development of key business and 
related IT controls to ensure a robust system of internal 
control as described in the Audit and Risk Committee 
Report on page 60.
 
We conducted detailed end-to-end walkthroughs of the finance processes, utilising 
our understanding from the prior year to reassess the design effectiveness of the key 
internal controls and to identify changes. We then conducted testing of the operating 
effectiveness of these controls to obtain evidence that they operated throughout the 
year. In response to the changes and control enhancements made during the year, we 
performed the following:
 – evaluating the design of the controls to ensure they mitigated the relevant financial 
reporting risks and testing the operation of controls in the periods prior to and post 
any change;
 – where systems changed during the year, testing IT general controls and data migration 
processes; and
 – tested controls and performed additional substantive procedures of key general ledger 
account reconciliations and manual journals.
We did not regard any of the control issues identified in 2017 as significant in the context of 
the Group financial statements. 
Changes in Group’s presentation currency 
With effect from 1 April 2016, the Group’s presentation 
currency was changed from sterling to euro to better 
align with the geographic split of the Group’s operations. 
This change was accounted for retrospectively resulting 
in historical retranslation of the Group’s results.
 
Our procedures included the following:
 – testing the Hyperion Financial Management (‘HFM’) application, including controls 
in place, to conclude on the appropriateness of the euro presentation currency 
application set up;
 – testing the retranslation of sterling comparative balances disclosed in the 
financial statements;
 – testing the disclosures included in the Annual Report;
 – examining management’s accounting paper assessing the impact of the presentation 
currency change upon their hedge relationships, and for material hedge accounting 
relationships we examined the respective hedging instrument to assess its 
effectiveness; and
 – testing key controls in place over designation and monitoring of quasi equity 
loan arrangements and performing tests of details on the accounting treatment 
of material balances.
No issues were noted from our testing. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 96
Audit report on the consolidated and parent company financial statements (continued)
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, 
taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.
The Group operates in 26 countries across two regions; “Europe” and “AMAP”. In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined 
the type of work that needed to be performed at the local operations by us, as the Group engagement team, or component auditors within PwC 
UK and from other PwC network firms operating under our instruction. Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined 
the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those local operations to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit 
evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
The Group’s local operations vary in size with the six operations in Group scope (UK, Spain, Italy, India, Vodafone Germany, Vodacom South Africa) 
representing 67% and 66% of the Group’s revenue and AOP including Vodafone India. We identified these six local operations as those that, in our 
view, required an audit of their complete financial information, due to their size or risk characteristics. The materiality applied by the component 
auditors in the context of the Group audit ranged from €65 million to €160 million. These local operations are also subject to audits for local 
statutory purposes where their local statutory materiality ranges from €1 million to €175 million.
Specific audit procedures over certain balances and transactions were performed to give appropriate coverage of all material balances at both 
geographical division and Group levels. The Group engagement team visited all six operations in scope for Group reporting during the audit cycle 
and the lead audit partner or a senior member of the Group engagement team attended the year end audit clearance meetings.
Further specific audit procedures over central functions and areas of significant judgement, including taxation, goodwill, treasury and material 
provisions and contingent liabilities, were performed at the Group’s Head Office.
In addition, audits for local statutory purposes are performed at a further 15 locations. Where possible, the timing of local statutory audits was 
accelerated to align to the Group audit timetable, with significant findings reported to the Group engagement team.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with 
qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual 
financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements 
as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality €215 million (2016: €248 million).
How we determined it 5% of a three year average of AOP , including Vodafone India.
Rationale for benchmark applied We used a three year average given volatility in the measure year-on-year as  
a result of Project Spring.
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above €15 million 
(2016: €14 million) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement of responsibility, set out on pages 88 and 89, in relation to going concern. 
We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the Directors’ 
statement of responsibility about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.
As noted in the Directors’ statement of responsibility, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the Group and Company have adequate resources to remain 
in operation, and that the Directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our 
audit we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can 
be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Other required reporting
Consistency of other information and compliance with applicable requirements
Companies Act 2006 reporting
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 – the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements; 
 – the Strategic Report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements;
 – the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set out on pages 44 to 85 with respect to internal control and risk management 
systems and about share capital structures is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements; and
 – the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set out on pages 44 to 85 with respect to the Company’s corporate governance 
code and practices and about its administrative, management and supervisory bodies complies with rules 7 .2.2, 7 .2.3 and 7 .2.7 of the Disclosure 
Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the Financial Conduct Authority. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 97
Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financials Additional information
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group, the Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we are required to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ report, and in the information 
referred to above in the Corporate Governance Statement. We have nothing to report in this respect.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – information in the Annual Report is:
 – materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
 – apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the 
Group and Company acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
 – otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report.
 – the statement given by the Directors on page 88, in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’), that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole 
to be fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for members 
to assess the Group’s and Company’s position and performance, business model and strategy 
is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and Company acquired in the course 
of performing our audit; and
We have no exceptions to report.
 – the section of the Annual Report on pages 57 to 63, as required by provision C.3.8 of the Code, 
describing the work of the Audit and Risk Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit and Risk Committee.
We have no exceptions to report.
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity 
of the Group
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to 
draw attention to in relation to:
 – the Directors’ confirmation on page 88 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.1 
of the Code, that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
We have nothing material to add or to 
draw attention to.
 – the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being 
managed or mitigated; and
We have nothing material to add or to 
draw attention to.
 – the Directors’ explanation on page 34 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.2 
of the Code, as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have 
done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures 
drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing material to add or to 
draw attention to.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement of responsibility that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group and the Directors’ statement of responsibility in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was 
substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process supporting their statements; 
checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether the statements are consistent with 
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our audit. We have nothing to report having performed our review.
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or
 – the Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 98

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Corporate governance statement
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, a Corporate governance statement has not been prepared by the 
Company. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate governance statement relating to ten further provisions of the Code. 
We have nothing to report having performed our review.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ statement of responsibility set out on pages 88 and 89, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose 
or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of:
 – whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed;
 – the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and
 – the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, 
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis 
for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired 
by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic Report, Directors’ report and Corporate governance statement, we consider whether those 
reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.

Notes:
1 See note 1 “Basis of preparation”.
2 See note 18 “Called up share capital”.
3 Includes share premium, capital reserve, capital redemption reserve, merger reserve and share-based payment reserve. The merger reserve was derived from acquisitions made prior 
to 31 March 2004 and subsequently allocated to additional paid-in capital on adoption of IFRS.
4 The currency reserve is used to record cumulative translation differences on the assets and liabilities of foreign operations. The cumulative translation differences are recycled to the income 
statement on disposal of the foreign operation.
5  The investment reserve is used to record the cumulative fair value gains and losses on available-for-sale financial assets. The cumulative gains and losses are recycled to the income statement 
on disposal of the assets.
6 The revaluation surplus derives from acquisitions of subsidiaries made before the Group’s adoption of IFRS 3 (Revised) on 1 April 2010 and comprises the amounts arising from recognising the 
Group’s pre-existing equity interest in the acquired subsidiary at fair value.
7 Includes the impact of the Group’s cash flow hedges with €787 million net gain deferred to other comprehensive income during the year (2016: €337 million net gain; 2015: €768 million net 
gain) and €654 million net gain (2016: €294 million net gain; 2015: €821 million net gain) recycled to the income statement.
8 Includes €9 million tax credit (2016: €5 million credit; 2015: €9 million credit).
9 Includes amounts relating to foreign translation differences arising on the retranslation of reserves due to the change in the Group’s presentation currency.
10 Includes the equity component of mandatory convertible bonds which were compound instruments issued in the year ended 31 March 2016. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 102

1. Basis of preparation 
This section describes the critical accounting judgements and estimates that management has identified 
as having a potentially material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements and sets out our 
significant accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole. Where an accounting policy 
is generally applicable to a specific note to the financial statements, the policy is described within that note. 
We have also detailed below the new accounting pronouncements that we will adopt in future years and our 
current view of the impact they will have on our financial reporting.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) and are also prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union (‘EU’), 
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations. The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported 
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. A discussion on the Group’s critical accounting judgements and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty is detailed below. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that 
period; they are recognised in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
With effect from 1 April 2016, the Group’s presentation currency changed from sterling to the euro to better align with the geographic split of the 
Group’s operations and the Group reclassified €580 million from goodwill to investments in associates and joint ventures in respect of Indus Towers 
within the consolidated statement of financial position to align with the Group’s cash-generating unit classifications. Prior periods, including the 
amounts presented for the years ended 31 March 2016 and 31 March 2015, together with all disclosed alternative performance measures, have 
been restated into euros using closing rates at the relevant balance sheet date for assets, liabilities, share capital, share premium and other capital 
reserves and the income statement has been restated at the average rate for the comparative period or the spot rate for significant transactions. 
The results of Vodafone India are presented in results from discontinued operations in the current and prior periods and its assets and liabilities 
reported in assets and liabilities held for sale, respectively, at 31 March 2017 .
Vodafone Group Plc is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales (registration number 1833679). The registered address of the Company 
is Vodafone House, The Connection, Newbury, Berkshire, RG14 2FN, England.
IFRS requires the Directors to adopt accounting policies that are the most appropriate to the Group’s circumstances. These have been applied 
consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. In determining and applying accounting policies, Directors and management are 
required to make judgements in respect of items where the choice of specific policy, accounting estimate or assumption to be followed could 
materially affect the Group’s reported financial position, results or cash flows; it may later be determined that a different choice may have been 
more appropriate.
Management has identified accounting judgements and estimates relating to revenue recognition, taxation, business combinations and goodwill, 
joint arrangements, finite lived intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, post employment benefits, provisions and contingent liabilities and 
impairment that it considers to be critical due to their impact on the Group’s financial statements. These critical accounting judgements, estimates 
and related disclosures have been discussed with the Company’s Audit and Risk Committee. 
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Revenue recognition 
Arrangements with multiple deliverables
In revenue arrangements where more than one good or service is provided to the customer, customer consideration is allocated between the goods 
and services using relative fair value principles. The fair values determined for deliverables may impact the timing of the recognition of revenue. 
Determining the fair value of each deliverable can require complex estimates. The Group generally determines the fair value of individual elements 
based on prices at which the deliverable is regularly sold on a stand-alone basis after considering any appropriate volume discounts.
Gross versus net presentation
When the Group sells goods or services as a principal, income and payments to suppliers are reported on a gross basis in revenue and operating 
costs. If the Group sells goods or services as an agent, revenue and payments to suppliers are recorded in revenue on a net basis, representing the 
margin earned. Whether the Group is considered to be the principal or an agent in the transaction depends on analysis by management of both the 
legal form and substance of the agreement between the Group and its business partners; such judgements impact the amount of reported revenue 
and operating expenses but do not impact reported assets, liabilities or cash flows.
Taxation
The Group’s tax charge on ordinary activities is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges. The calculation of the Group’s total tax charge 
involves estimation and judgement in respect of certain matters where the tax impact is uncertain until a conclusion is reached with the relevant tax 
authority or through a legal process. The Group uses in-house tax experts when assessing uncertain tax positions and seeks the advice of external 
professional advisors where appropriate.
Provisions are recognised for uncertain tax positions when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and management judge that 
it is probable that there will be a future outflow of economic benefits from the Group. Provisions are measured using management’s estimate of the 
most likely outcome. The final resolution of uncertain tax positions may give rise to material profits, losses and/ or cash flows. Resolving tax issues can 
take many years as it is not always within the control of the Group and often depends on the efficiency of legal processes in the relevant tax jurisdiction.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
1. Basis of preparation (continued)
Recognition of deferred tax assets 
Significant items on which the Group has exercised accounting estimation and judgement include the recognition of deferred tax assets in respect 
of losses in Luxembourg, Germany, Spain and India and capital allowances in the United Kingdom.
The recognition of deferred tax assets, particularly in respect of tax losses, is based upon whether management judge that it is probable that there 
will be sufficient and suitable taxable profits in the relevant legal entity or tax group against which to utilise the assets in the future.
Judgement is required when determining probable future taxable profits. The Group assesses the availability of future taxable profits using the same 
undiscounted five year forecasts for the Group’s operations as are used in the Group’s value in use calculations (see “Impairment reviews” below). 
Where tax losses are forecast to be recovered beyond the five year period, the availability of taxable profits is assessed using the cash flows and 
long-term growth rates used for the value in use calculations.
The estimated cash flows inherent in these forecasts include the unsystematic risks of operating in the telecommunications business including 
the potential impacts of changes in the market structure, trends in customer pricing, the costs associated with the acquisition and retention 
of customers, future technological evolutions and potential regulatory changes, such as our ability to acquire and/or renew spectrum licences.
Changes in the estimates which underpin the Group’s forecasts could have an impact on the amount of future taxable profits and could have 
a significant impact on the period over which the deferred tax asset would be recovered.
The Group only considers substantively enacted tax laws when assessing the amount and availability of tax losses to offset against the future taxable 
profits. See note 6 “Taxation” to the consolidated financial statements.
Business combinations and goodwill
When the Group completes a business combination, the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, including intangible assets, 
are recognised. The determination of the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities is based, to a considerable extent, on management’s judgement. 
If the purchase consideration exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired then the incremental amount paid is recognised as goodwill. If the 
purchase price consideration is lower than the fair value of the assets acquired then the difference is recorded as a gain in the income statement.
Allocation of the purchase price between finite lived assets (discussed below) and indefinite lived assets such as goodwill affects the subsequent 
results of the Group as finite lived intangible assets are amortised, whereas indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortised.
On transition to IFRS the Group elected not to apply IFRS 3 “Business combinations” retrospectively as the difficulty in applying these requirements 
to business combinations completed by the Group between incorporation and 1 April 2004 exceeded any potential benefits. Goodwill recorded 
before the date of transition to IFRS amounted to €1 17 ,775 million. If the Group had elected to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively it may have led 
to an increase or decrease in goodwill, licences, customer bases, brands and related deferred tax liabilities recognised on acquisition. 
See note 28 “Acquisitions and disposals” to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
Joint arrangements
The Group participates in a number of joint arrangements where control of the arrangement is shared with one or more other parties. A joint 
arrangement is classified as a joint operation or as a joint venture; depending on management’s assessment of the legal form and substance of the 
arrangement, which may require the use of judgement.
The classification can have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Group’s share of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and 
cash flows of joint operations are included in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis, whereas the Group’s investment and share 
of results of joint ventures are shown within single line items in the consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated income statement 
respectively. See note 12 “Investments in associates and joint arrangements” to the consolidated financial statements.
The determination of gains or losses arising from the contribution or sale of a subsidiary as part of the formation of a joint arrangement requires 
management to make significant estimates to determine the present value of future cash flows to be generated by the joint arrangement in order 
to determine the fair value of non-cash consideration received.
Finite lived intangible assets
Other intangible assets include amounts spent by the Group acquiring licences and spectrum, customer bases and brands and the costs 
of purchasing and developing computer software.
Where intangible assets are acquired through business combinations and no active market for the assets exists, the fair value of these assets 
is determined by discounting estimated future net cash flows generated by the asset. Estimates relating to the future cash flows and discount rates 
used may have a material effect on the reported amounts of finite lived intangible assets.
Estimation of useful life
The useful life over which intangible assets are amortised depends on management’s estimate of the period over which economic benefit will 
be derived from the asset. Reducing the useful life will increase the amortisation charge in the consolidated income statement. Useful lives are 
periodically reviewed to ensure that they remain appropriate. The basis for determining the useful life for the most significant categories of intangible 
assets is discussed below.
Licence and spectrum fees
The estimated useful life is generally the term of the licence unless there is a presumption of renewal at negligible cost; this is adjusted if necessary, 
for example taking into account the impact of any expected changes in technology.
Customer bases
The estimated useful life principally reflects management’s view of the average economic life of the customer base and is assessed by reference 
to customer churn rates. An increase in churn rates may lead to a reduction in the estimated useful life and an increase in the amortisation charge. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 105
Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financials Additional information
Capitalised software
For computer software, the estimated useful life is based on management’s view, considering historical experience with similar products as well 
as anticipation of future events which may impact their life such as changes in technology. The useful life will not exceed the duration of a licence.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment represents 19.5% (2016: 21.0%) of the Group’s total assets; estimates and assumptions made may have a material 
impact on their carrying value and related depreciation charge. See note 1 1 “Property, plant and equipment” to the consolidated financial 
statements for further details.
Estimation of useful life
The depreciation charge for an asset is derived using estimates of its expected useful life and expected residual value, which are reviewed annually. 
Increasing an asset’s expected life or residual value would result in a reduced depreciation charge in the consolidated income statement.
Management determines the useful lives and residual values for assets when they are acquired, based on experience with similar assets and taking 
into account other relevant factors such as any expected changes in technology. The useful life of network infrastructure is assumed not to exceed 
the duration of related operating licences unless there is a reasonable expectation of renewal or an alternative future use for the asset.
Post employment benefits
Management uses estimates when determining the Group’s liabilities and expenses arising for defined benefit pension schemes. Management 
is required to estimate the future rates of inflation, salary increases, discount rates and longevity of members, each of which may have 
a material impact on the defined benefit obligations that are recorded. Further details, including a sensitivity analysis, are included in note 26 
“Post employment benefits” to the consolidated financial statements.
Provisions and contingent liabilities
The Group exercises judgement in measuring and recognising provisions and the exposures to contingent liabilities related to pending litigation 
or other outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement, mediation, arbitration or government regulation, as well as other contingent liabilities 
(see note 30 “Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings” to the consolidated financial statements). Judgement is necessary to assess the likelihood 
that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise, and estimates are required to determine the possible range of any financial settlement. 
The inherent uncertainty of such matters means that actual losses may materially differ from estimates.
Impairment reviews
IFRS requires management to perform impairment tests annually for indefinite lived assets and, for finite lived assets, if events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
Impairment testing requires management to judge whether the carrying value of assets can be supported by the net present value of future cash 
flows that they generate. Calculating the net present value of the future cash flows requires estimates to be made in respect of highly uncertain 
matters including management’s expectations of:
 – growth in adjusted EBITDA, calculated as adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation;
 – timing and amount of future capital expenditure, licence and spectrum payments;
 – long-term growth rates; and 
 – appropriate discount rates to reflect the risks involved.
Management prepares formal five year forecasts for the Group’s operations, which are used to estimate their value in use. In certain developing 
markets ten year forecasts are used if it is considered that the fifth year of a forecast is not indicative of expected long-term future performance 
as operations may not have reached maturity.
For operations where five year forecasts are used for the Group’s value in use calculations, a long-term growth rate into perpetuity has been 
determined as the lower of:
 – the nominal GDP growth rates for the country of operation; and 
 – the long-term compound annual growth rate in adjusted EBITDA in years six to ten estimated by management. 
For operations where ten year forecasts are used for the Group’s value in use calculations, a long-term growth rate into perpetuity has been: 
 – the nominal GDP growth rates for the country of operation; and 
 – the compound annual growth rate in adjusted EBITDA in years nine to ten of the management plan.  
Changing the assumptions selected by management, in particular the discount rate and growth rate assumptions used in the cash flow projections, 
could significantly affect the Group’s impairment evaluation and hence reported assets and profits or losses. Further details, including a sensitivity 
analysis, are included in note 4 “Impairment losses” to the consolidated financial statements.
For discontinued operations, impairment testing requires management to determine whether the carrying value of the discontinued operation can 
be supported by the fair value less costs to sell. Where not observable in a quoted market, management have determined fair value less costs to sell 
by reference to the outcomes from the application of a number of potential valuation techniques, determined from inputs other than quoted prices 
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 106
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
1. Basis of preparation (continued)
Significant accounting policies applied in the current reporting period that relate to the financial 
statements as a whole
Accounting convention
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis except for certain financial and equity instruments that have been 
measured at fair value.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, subsidiaries controlled by the Company (see note 33 
“Related undertakings” to the consolidated financial statements) and joint operations that are subject to joint control (see note 12 “Investments 
in associates and joint arrangements” to the consolidated financial statements).
Foreign currencies
The consolidated financial statements are presented in euro, which became the Company’s functional currency on 1 April 2016 as the primary 
currency in which the Company’s financing activities and investment returns are denominated. Each entity in the Group determines its own 
functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. 
Similarly, with effect from 1 April 2016, the Group’s presentation currency was changed from sterling to euro to better align with the geographic split 
of the Group’s operations. Amounts presented for the years ended 31 March 2016 and 31 March 2015 have been translated into euros using closing 
rates at the relevant balance sheet date for amounts recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated statement 
of changes in equity and average rates for the relevant year for amounts reported in the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows.
The change of presentation and functional currency has not changed either the Group’s or the Company’s foreign exchange management strategy.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the respective functional currency of the entity at the rates prevailing on the 
reporting period date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing 
on the initial transaction dates. Non-monetary items measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Changes in the fair value of monetary securities denominated in foreign currency classified as available-for-sale are analysed between translation 
differences and other changes in the carrying amount of the security. Translation differences are recognised in the income statement and other 
changes in carrying amount are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets, such as investments in equity securities classified as available-for-sale, are reported as part 
of the fair value gain or loss and are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Share capital, share premium and other capital reserves are initially recorded at the functional currency rate prevailing at the date of the transaction 
and are not retranslated.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of entities with a functional currency other than euro 
are expressed in euro using exchange rates prevailing at the reporting period date. Income and expense items and cash flows are translated at the 
average exchange rates for the period and exchange differences arising are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. On disposal 
of a foreign entity, the cumulative amount previously recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income relating to that particular 
foreign operation is recognised in profit or loss.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and 
translated accordingly.
In respect of all foreign operations, any exchange differences that have arisen before 1 April 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are deemed to be nil 
and will be excluded from the determination of any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
The net foreign exchange loss recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 March 2017 is €637 million (31 March 
2016: €1,141 million loss; 2015: €261 million gain). The net gains and net losses are recorded within operating profit (2017: €133 million charge; 
2016: €24 million credit; 2015: €8 million charge), other income and expense and non-operating income and expense (2017: €nil; 2016: €282 million 
charge; 2015: €1 million credit), investment and financing income (2017: €505 million charge; 2016: €872 million charge; 2015: €263 million credit) 
and income tax expense (2017: €1 million credit; 2016: €1 1 million charge; 2015: €5 million credit). The foreign exchange gains and losses included 
within other income and expense and non-operating income and expense arise on the disposal of interests in joint ventures, associates and 
investments from the recycling of foreign exchange gains previously recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
New accounting pronouncements adopted on 1 April 2016
On 1 April 2016 the Group adopted the following new accounting policies to comply with amendments to IFRS. The accounting pronouncements, 
none of which is considered by the Group as significant on adoption, are:
 – Amendments to IAS 1 “Disclosure Initiative”;
 – Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 “Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation”; Amendments to IFRS 1 1 “Accounting 
for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations”; and
 – “Improvements to IFRS: 2012-2014 cycle”. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 107
Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financials Additional information
New accounting pronouncements to be adopted on 1 April 2017 
The following pronouncements which are potentially relevant to the Group have been issued by the IASB are effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 201 7 and which have not yet been endorsed by the EU:
 – Amendments to IAS 1 2 “Recognition of Deferred T ax Assets for Unrealised Losses”;
 – Amendments to IAS 7 “Disclosure Initiative”; which requires additional disclosures of changes in liabilities arising from financing activities; and
 – Amendments to IFRS 12 “Disclosure of Interests in other entities” (part of “Improvements to IFRS 2014-2016 Cycle”).
The Group’s financial reporting will be presented in accordance with the new standards above, which are not expected to have a material impact 
on the consolidated results, financial position or cash flows of the Group, from 1 April 2017 .
New accounting pronouncements to be adopted on or after 1 April 2018
The following pronouncements which are potentially relevant to the Group have been issued by the IASB are effective for annual periods beginning 
on 1 January 2018 and which have not yet been endorsed by the EU:
 – Amendments to IFRS 2 “Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions”;
 – Amendments to IFRS 4 “Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts”;
 – Amendment to IAS 28 “Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures” (part of “Improvements to IFRS 2014-2016 Cycle”); and
 – IFRIC 22 “Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration”.
The Group’s financial reporting will be presented in accordance with the new standards above, which are not expected to have a material impact 
on the consolidated results, financial position or cash flows of the Group, from 1 April 2018.
In addition, the Group will adopt the following standards, which have been issued by the IASB:
 – On 1 April 2018 the Group will adopt IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” and IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” which are effective for 
accounting periods on or after 1 January 2018 and which have been endorsed by the EU. 
 – On 1 April 2019 the Group will adopt IFRS 16 “Leases”, which has not yet been endorsed by the EU and is effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or before 1 January 2019. 
IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 are significant new standards, the impacts of which on the Group’s financial reporting are currently being assessed. 
IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”
IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” was issued in July 2014 to replace IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” and has been 
endorsed by the EU. The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and will be adopted by the Group 
on 1 April 2018. 
IFRS 9 will impact the classification and measurement of the Group’s financial instruments and will require certain additional disclosures. 
The primary changes relate to the assessment of hedging arrangements and provisioning for potential future credit losses on financial assets; 
the Group is continuing to analyse the impact of these changes which are not currently considered likely to have any major impact on the 
Group’s current accounting treatment or hedging activities. 
IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”
IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, which has been endorsed by the EU, was issued in May 2014 and subsequent amendments, 
“Clarifications to IFRS 15”, which have not yet been endorsed by the EU, were issued in April 2016. IFRS 15, as amended, is effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. IFRS 15 sets out the requirements for recognising revenue and costs from contracts with customers 
and includes extensive disclosure requirements; it will have a material impact on the Group’s reporting of revenue and costs as follows:
 – IFRS 15 will require the Group to identify deliverables in contracts with customers that qualify as separate “performance obligations”. 
The performance obligations identified will depend on the nature of individual customer contracts, but might typically be identified for mobile 
handsets, other equipment provided to customers and for services provided to customers such as mobile and fixed line communications 
services. The transaction price receivable from customers must be allocated between the Group’s performance obligations under the 
contracts on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. Revenue will then be recognised either at a point in time or over time when the respective 
performance obligations in a contract are delivered to the customer. Stand-alone selling prices will be based on observable sales prices; however, 
where stand-alone selling prices are not directly observable, estimates of stand-alone selling prices will be required which will maximise the use 
of observable inputs
 – Currently revenue allocated to deliverables is restricted to the amount that is receivable without the delivery of additional goods or services; 
this restriction will no longer be applied under IFRS 15. The primary impact on revenue reporting will be that when the Group sells subsidised 
devices together with airtime service agreements to customers, revenue allocated to equipment and recognised at contract inception, when 
control of the device typically passes to the customer, will increase and revenue subsequently recognised as services are delivered during the 
contract period will reduce. Where additional up-front unbilled revenue is recorded for the sale of devices, this will be reflected in the consolidated 
statement of financial position as a contract asset. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 108
1. Basis of preparation (continued)
 – Under IFRS 15, certain incremental costs incurred in acquiring a contract with a customer will be deferred on the consolidated statement 
of financial position and amortised as revenue is recognised under the related contract; this will generally lead to the later recognition of charges 
for some commissions payable to third party dealers and employees.
 – Certain costs incurred in fulfilling customer contracts will be deferred on the consolidated statement of financial position under IFRS 15 
and recognised as related revenue is recognised under the contract. Such deferred costs are likely to relate to the provision of deliverables 
to customers that do not qualify as performance obligations and for which revenue is not recognised; currently such costs are generally expensed 
as incurred.
The impact of the changes above on the Group’s reportable segments will depend largely on the extent to which customers receive discounted 
goods or services, such as mobile handsets, when they enter into airtime service agreements with the Group in the relevant markets. The combined 
impact of the changes is expected to increase the gross profit, or reduce the gross loss, recorded at inception on many customer contracts; in such 
cases, this will typically reduce the gross profit reported during the remainder of the contract; however, these timing differences will not impact the 
total gross profit reported for a customer contract over the contract term.
The transactions impacted by IFRS 15 are high in volume, value and complexity, therefore the Group is continuing to assess the impact of these 
and other accounting changes that will arise under IFRS 15 and cannot reasonably estimate the impact; however, the changes highlighted above 
will have a material impact on the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of financial position after the Group adopts 
IFRS 15 on 1 April 2018. The Group expects to be in a position to estimate the impact of IFRS 15 early in the first quarter of the year commencing 
1 April 2018.
When IFRS 15 is adopted, it can be applied either on a fully retrospective basis, requiring the restatement of the comparative periods presented 
in the financial statements, or with the cumulative retrospective impact of IFRS 15 applied as an adjustment to equity on the date of adoption; when 
the latter approach is applied it is necessary to disclose the impact of IFRS 15 on each line item in the financial statements in the reporting period. 
The Group will reflect the cumulative impact of IFRS 15 in equity on the date of adoption.
IFRS 16 “Leases”
IFRS 16 “Leases” was issued in January 2016 to replace IAS 17 “Leases”. The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2019 and will be adopted by the Group on 1 April 2019. IFRS 16 has not yet been adopted by the EU.
IFRS 16 will primarily change lease accounting for lessees; lease agreements will give rise to the recognition of an asset representing the right to use 
the leased item and a loan obligation for future lease payables. Lease costs will be recognised in the form of depreciation of the right to use asset 
and interest on the lease liability. Lessee accounting under IFRS 16 will be similar in many respects to existing IAS 17 accounting for finance leases, 
but will be substantively different to existing accounting for operating leases where rental charges are currently recognised on a straight-line basis 
and no lease asset or lease loan obligation is recognised. 
Lessor accounting under IFRS 16 is similar to existing IAS 17 accounting and is not expected to have a material impact for the Group.
The Group is assessing the impact of the accounting changes that will arise under IFRS 16; however, the following changes to lessee accounting will 
have a material impact as follows:
 – Right-of-use assets will be recorded for assets that are leased by the Group; currently no lease assets are included on the Group’s consolidated 
statement of financial position for operating leases.
 – Liabilities will be recorded for future lease payments in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position for the “reasonably certain” period 
of the lease, which may include future lease periods for which the Group has extension options. Currently liabilities are generally not recorded 
for future operating lease payments, which are disclosed as commitments. The amount of lease liabilities will not equal the lease commitments 
reported on 31 March 2019, but may not be dissimilar. 
 – Lease expenses will be for depreciation of right-of-use assets and interest on lease liabilities; interest will typically be higher in the early 
stages of a lease and reduce over the term. Currently operating lease rentals are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term within 
operating expenses. 
 – Operating lease cash flows are currently included within operating cash flows in the consolidated statement of cash flows; under IFRS 16 these 
will be recorded as cash flows from financing activities reflecting the repayment of lease liabilities (borrowings) and related interest. 
A high volume of transactions will be impacted by IFRS 16 and material judgements are required in identifying and accounting for leases. Therefore, 
the Group is continuing to assess the impact of these and other accounting changes that will arise under IFRS 16 and cannot reasonably estimate 
the impact; however, the changes highlighted above will have a material impact on the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement 
of financial position and consolidated statement of cash flows after the Group’s adoption on 1 April 2019. 
When IFRS 16 is adopted, it can be applied either on a fully retrospective basis, requiring the restatement of the comparative periods presented 
in the financial statements, or with the cumulative retrospective impact of IFRS 16 applied as an adjustment to equity on the date of adoption; when 
the latter approach is applied it is necessary to disclose the impact of IFRS 16 on each line item in the financial statements in the reporting period. 
Depending on the adoption method that is utilised, certain practical expedients may be applied on adoption. The Group has not yet determined 
which adoption method will be adopted or which expedients will be applied on adoption.

2. Segmental analysis
The Group’s businesses are managed on a geographical basis. Selected financial data is presented on this 
basis below. 
The Group’s operating segments are established on the basis of those components of the Group that are evaluated regularly by the chief operating 
decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Group has a single group of related services and products, 
being the supply of communications services and products. Revenue is attributed to a country or region based on the location of the Group 
company reporting the revenue. Transactions between operating segments are charged at arm’s-length prices.
Segment information is provided on the basis of geographic areas, being the basis on which the Group manages its worldwide interests, with each 
country in which the Group operates treated as an operating segment. The aggregation of operating segments into the Europe and AMAP regions 
reflects, in the opinion of management, the similar economic characteristics within each of those regions as well the similar products and services 
offered and supplied, classes of customers and the regulatory environment. In the case of the Europe region this largely reflects membership 
of the European Union, while for the AMAP region this largely includes emerging and developing economies that are in the process of rapid growth 
and industrialisation.
Certain financial information is provided separately within the Europe region for Germany, Italy, the UK and Spain, and within the AMAP region for 
India and Vodacom, as these operating segments are individually material for the Group. The segmental revenue and profit of India are included 
in discontinued operations for all years reported and segmental assets and cash flows are included in assets and liabilities held for sale at 31 March 
2017 . See note 7 “Discontinued operations and assets held for resale” for details.
Accounting policies
Revenue 
Revenue is recognised to the extent the Group has delivered goods or rendered services under an agreement, the amount of revenue can 
be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group. Revenue is measured at the 
fair value of the consideration receivable, exclusive of sales taxes and discounts.
The Group principally obtains revenue from providing mobile and fixed telecommunication services including: access charges, voice and video calls, 
messaging, interconnect fees, fixed and mobile broadband and related services such as providing televisual and music content, connection fees and 
equipment sales. Products and services may be sold separately or in bundled packages.
Revenue for access charges, voice and video calls, messaging and fixed and mobile broadband provided to contract customers is recognised 
as services are performed, with unbilled revenue resulting from services already provided accrued at the end of each period and unearned revenue 
from services to be provided in future periods deferred. Revenue from the sale of prepaid credit is deferred until such time as the customer uses the 
airtime, or the credit expires.
Revenue from interconnect fees is recognised at the time the services are performed.
Revenue for the provision of televisual and music content is recognised when or as the Group performs the related service and, depending on the 
nature of the service, is recognised either at the gross amount billed to the customer or the amount receivable by the Group as commission for 
facilitating the service.
Customer connection revenue is recognised together with the related equipment revenue to the extent that the aggregate equipment and 
connection revenue does not exceed the fair value of the equipment delivered to the customer. Any customer connection revenue not recognised, 
together with any related excess equipment revenue, is deferred and recognised over the period in which services are expected to be provided 
to the customer.
Revenue for device sales is recognised when the device is delivered to the end customer and the significant risks and rewards of ownership have 
transferred. For device sales made to intermediaries, revenue is recognised if the significant risks associated with the device are transferred to the 
intermediary and the intermediary has no general right to return the device to receive a refund. If the significant risks are not transferred, revenue 
recognition is deferred until sale of the device to an end customer by the intermediary or the expiry of any right of return.
In revenue arrangements including more than one deliverable, the arrangements are divided into separate units of accounting. Deliverables are 
considered separate units of accounting if the following two conditions are met: (i) the deliverable has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis 
and (ii) there is evidence of the fair value of the item. The arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on its 
relative fair value. Revenue allocated to deliverables is restricted to the amount that is receivable without the delivery of additional goods or services. 
This restriction typically applies to revenue recognised for devices provided to customers, including handsets.
Commissions
Intermediaries are given cash incentives by the Group to connect new customers and upgrade existing customers.
For intermediaries who do not purchase products and services from the Group, such cash incentives are accounted for as an expense. Such cash 
incentives to other intermediaries are also accounted for as an expense if:
 – the Group receives an identifiable benefit in exchange for the cash incentive that is separable from sales transactions to that intermediary; and
 – the Group can reliably estimate the fair value of that benefit.
Cash incentives that do not meet these criteria are recognised as a reduction of the related revenue. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 110

Note:
1 With effect from 1 April 2015, Vodacom changed its accounting for the acquisition of handsets by certain customers through Vodacom SA’s indirect distribution channels. This had the effect 
of reducing equipment revenue and decreasing direct expenses, with no impact on profits or cash flows. The impact on the year ended 31 March 2015 is not material.
Total revenue recorded in respect of the sale of goods for the year ended 31 March 2017 was €4,029 million (2016: €4,472 million, 
2015: €4,101 million).

1 Relates to fees for statutory and regulatory filings. The increase in the amount for the year ended 31 March 2017 primarily arose from work on regulatory filings prepared in anticipation 
of a potential IPO of Vodafone India that was under consideration prior to the agreement for the merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular.
2 At the time of the Board decision to recommend PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the statutory auditor for the year ended 31 March 2015 in February 2014, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were 
providing a range of services to the Group. All services that were prohibited by the Securities and Exchange Commission (‘SEC’) for a statutory auditor to provide, ceased by 31 March 2014. 
All engagements that are not prohibited by the SEC, but would not have met the Group’s own internal approval policy for non-audit services, ceased by 30 June 2014 to enable a transition 
to alternative suppliers, where required. These services had a value of approximately €3 million through to completion and are included in the table above.
A description of the work performed by the Audit and Risk Committee in order to safeguard auditor independence when non-audit services are 
provided is set out in the Audit and Risk Committee report on pages 57 to 63. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 113

4. Impairment losses
Impairment occurs when the carrying value of assets is greater than the present value of the net cash flows they 
are expected to generate. We review the carrying value of assets for each country in which we operate at least 
annually. For further details of our impairment review process see “Critical accounting judgements and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty” in note 1 “Basis of preparation” to the consolidated financial statements.
Accounting policies
Goodwill
Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows, known as cash-
generating units. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated 
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying 
amount of each asset in the unit. Impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversible in subsequent periods.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
The Group prepares and approves formal five year management plans for its operations, which are used in the value in use calculations. In certain 
developing markets the fifth year of the management plan may not be indicative of the long-term future performance as operations may not have 
reached maturity. For these operations, the Group may extend the plan data for an additional five year period.
Property, plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets
At each reporting period date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets 
to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable 
amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset 
or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount, not to exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset 
or cash-generating unit in prior years and an impairment loss reversal is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Impairment losses
Following our annual impairment review, the impairment charges recognised in the consolidated income statement within operating profit

In addition to the impairment losses above, in the first half of the 2017 financial year, the Group recorded a non-cash impairment of €6.4 billion, 
relating to our Indian business. This was driven by lower projected cash flows within our business plan as a result of increased competition in the 
market. Impairment testing at 31 March 2017 , following the announcement of the merger of Vodafone India with Idea Cellular, gave rise to a partial 
reversal of that impairment. As a result, the Group recorded an overall impairment loss of €4,515 million (2016: €nil, 2015: €nil) in respect of the 
fair value of Group’s investment in India which, together with the recognition of an associated €840 million deferred tax assets, led to an overall 
€3,675 million reduction in the carrying value of Vodafone India, the results of which are included discontinued operations. See note 7 “Discontinued 
operations and assets held for resale” for further details.

Key assumptions used in the value in use calculations
The key assumptions used in determining the value in use are:
Assumption How determined
Projected adjusted 
EBITDA
Projected adjusted EBITDA has been based on past experience adjusted for the following:
 – voice and messaging revenue is expected to benefit from increased usage from new customers, especially in emerging 
markets, the introduction of new services and traffic moving from fixed networks to mobile networks, though these 
factors will be offset by increased competitor activity, which may result in price declines, and the trend of falling 
termination and other regulated rates;
 – non-messaging data revenue is expected to continue to grow as the penetration of 3G (plus 4G where available) enabled 
devices and smartphones rise along with higher data bundle attachment rates, and new products and services are 
introduced; and
 – margins are expected to be impacted by negative factors such as the cost of acquiring and retaining customers 
in increasingly competitive markets and the expectation of further termination rate cuts by regulators and by positive 
factors such as the efficiencies expected from the implementation of Group initiatives.
Projected capital 
expenditure
The cash flow forecasts for capital expenditure are based on past experience and include the ongoing capital expenditure 
required to roll out networks in emerging markets, to provide voice and data products and services and to meet the 
population coverage requirements of certain of the Group’s licences. Capital expenditure includes cash outflows for the 
purchase of property, plant and equipment and computer software.
Projected licence and 
spectrum payments
The cash flow forecasts for licence and spectrum payments for each operating company for the initial five years include 
amounts for expected renewals and newly available spectrum. Beyond that period, a long-run cost of spectrum is assumed.
Long-term growth rate For businesses where the five year management plans are used for the Group’s value in use calculations, a long -term 
growth rate into perpetuity has been determined as the lower of:
 – the nominal GDP rates for the country of operation; and
 – the long-term compound annual growth rate in adjusted EBITDA in years six to ten estimated by management.
Pre-tax risk adjusted 
discount rate
The discount rate applied to the cash flows of each of the Group’s operations is generally based on the risk free rate for 
ten year bonds issued by the government in the respective market. Where government bond rates contain a material 
component of credit risk, high-quality local corporate bond rates may be used.
These rates are adjusted for a risk premium to reflect both the increased risk of investing in equities and the systematic risk 
of the specific Group operating company. In making this adjustment, inputs required are the equity market risk premium 
(that is the required increased return required over and above a risk free rate by an investor who is investing in the market 
as a whole) and the risk adjustment, beta, applied to reflect the risk of the specific Group operating company relative to the 
market as a whole.
In determining the risk adjusted discount rate, management has applied an adjustment for the systematic risk to each 
of the Group’s operations determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed mobile telecommunications 
companies and, where available and appropriate, across a specific territory. Management has used a forward-looking equity 
market risk premium that takes into consideration both studies by independent economists, the average equity market 
risk premium over the past ten years and the market risk premiums typically used by investment banks in evaluating 
acquisition proposals.
Y ear ended 31 March 2017
As a discontinued operation, Vodafone India has been valued at fair value less costs to sell. Vodafone India’s fair value less costs to sell is not 
observable in a quoted market and accordingly it has been determined with reference to the outcomes from the application of a number of potential 
valuation techniques, which are considered to result in a “level 2” valuation
1
. As such significant judgement is required and involves the use 
of estimates. The two bases of valuation which were given the strongest weighting in the overall assessment of fair value are set out below. Fair value 
has been assessed to be €14.0 billion. See note 7 “Discontinued operations and assets held for resale” for further details.
 – The contracted cash price for the sale of a portion of the entity to the Aditya Birla Group as part of the planned disposal of Vodafone India, 
adjusted for the agreed level of debt which is an observable price relating to Vodafone India; and
 – The share price of Idea Cellular prior to the announcement of the plan to dispose of Vodafone India and participate with Idea Cellular in the 
planned jointly controlled entity, adjusted for transaction specific factors. Idea Cellular equity shares are the primary component of the 
consideration for Vodafone India to be received by the Group, and the value of the Idea Cellular shares has been adjusted to reflect 50% of the 
estimated cost synergies that management expects to be realised by the jointly controlled entity. A 10% increase or reduction in the expected 
cost synergies included in this determination of fair value would result in a €220 million increase or reduction, respectively, in the fair value less 
costs to sell of Vodafone India calculated using this approach.
Note:
1 Level 2 classification comprises items where fair value is determined from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 115

2 Projected capital expenditure, which excludes licences and spectrum, is expressed as the range of capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue in the initial five years for all cash-generating 
units of the plans used for impairment testing.
Sensitivity analysis
Other than as disclosed below, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the 
carrying value of any cash-generating unit to materially exceed its recoverable amount. 
The estimated recoverable amount of the Group’s operations in Germany, Spain and Romania exceed their carrying values by €3.5 billion, 
€1.0 billion and €0.2 billion respectively. The changes in the following table to assumptions used in the impairment review would, in isolation,

The carrying values for Vodafone UK, Portugal, Ireland and Czech Republic include goodwill arising from their acquisition by the Group and/
or the purchase of operating licences or spectrum rights. While the recoverable amounts for these operating companies are not materially greater 
than their carrying value, each has a lower risk of giving rise to impairment that would be material to the Group given their relative size or the 
composition of their carrying value. The changes in the following table to assumptions used in the impairment review would have, in isolation, 
led to an impairment loss being recognised in the year ended 31 March 2017 .

Y ear ended 31 March 2016 
During the year ended 31 March 2016 impairment charges of €569 million were recorded in respect of the Group’s investments in Romania. 
The impairment charge relates solely to goodwill. The recoverable amount of Romania is €0.9 billion.
The impairment charges were driven by lower projected cash flows within the business plans resulting in our reassessment of expected future 
business performance in the light of the current trading environment.

Sensitivity analysis
Other than as disclosed below, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the 
carrying value of any cash-generating unit to materially exceed its recoverable amount.
The estimated recoverable amounts of the Group’s operations in Romania, Germany and Spain are equal to, or not materially greater than, their 
carrying values; consequently, any adverse change in key assumptions would, in isolation, cause a further impairment loss to be recognised. 
The estimated recoverable amounts of the Group’s operations in Germany and Spain exceed their carrying values by €2.0 billion and 
€1.0 billion respectively.

5. Investment income and financing costs
Investment income comprises interest received from short-term investments, bank deposits, government bonds 
and results from foreign exchange contracts which are used to hedge net debt. Financing costs mainly arise from 
interest due on bonds and commercial paper issued, bank loans and the results of hedging transactions used 
to manage foreign exchange and interest rate movements.

6. Taxation
This note explains how our Group tax charge arises. The deferred tax section of the note also provides information 
on our expected future tax charges and sets out the tax assets held across the Group together with our view 
on whether or not we expect to be able to make use of these in the future. 
Accounting policies
Income tax expense represents the sum of the current and deferred taxes.
Current tax payable or recoverable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement 
because some items of income or expense are taxable or deductible in different years or may never be taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability 
for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the future arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. It is accounted for using 
the statement of financial position liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that temporary differences or taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) 
of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised 
to the extent they arise from the initial recognition of non-tax deductible goodwill.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint 
arrangements, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting period date and adjusted to reflect changes in the Group’s assessment that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.
T ax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they 
either relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities which intend 
to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
T ax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly 
to equity, in which case the tax is recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity.

Factors affecting the tax charge in future years
The Group’s future tax charge, and effective tax rate, could be affected by several factors including; tax reform in countries around the world, 
including any arising from the implementation of the OECD’s BEPS actions and European Commission initiatives such as the proposed anti tax 
avoidance directive, tax and financial reporting directive or as a consequence of state aid investigations, future corporate acquisitions and disposals, 
any restructuring of our businesses and the resolution of open tax issues (see below).
We do not anticipate any significant impact on our future tax charge, liabilities or assets, as a result of the triggering of Article 50(2) of the Treaty 
on European Union but cannot rule out the possibility that, for example, a failure to reach satisfactory arrangements for the UK’s future relationship 
with the European Union, could have an impact on such matters.
The Group is routinely subject to audit by tax authorities in the territories in which it operates and, specifically, in India where these are usually 
resolved through the Indian legal system. The Group considers each issue on its merits and, where appropriate, holds provisions in respect of the 
potential tax liability that may arise. However, the amount ultimately paid may differ materially from the amount accrued and could therefore affect 
the Group’s overall profitability and cash flows in future periods. See note 30 “Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings” to the consolidated 
financial statements.

Deferred tax assets on losses in Luxembourg
Included in the table above are losses of €82,634 million (2016: €81,176 million) that have arisen in Luxembourg companies, principally as a result 
of revaluations of those companies’ investments for local GAAP purposes. 
A deferred tax asset of €19,632 million (2016: €23,942 million) has been recognised in respect of these losses, as we conclude it is probable that 
the Luxembourg entities will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which we can utilise these losses. In December 2016, 
the Luxembourg government enacted the previously announced reduction to the corporate tax rate (including municipal business tax) to 27 .1% 
for the year ended 31 March 2017 and 26.0% for the year ending 31 March 2018. The impact of this decreased corporate tax rate has reduced the 
value of our deferred tax asset by €2,651 million.
The Luxembourg companies’ income is derived from the Group’s internal financing and procurement and roaming activities. The Group has 
reviewed the latest forecasts for the Luxembourg companies, including their ability to continue to generate income beyond the forecast period 
under the tax laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. The assessment also considered whether the structure of the Group would 
continue to allow the generation of taxable income. Based on this the Group concludes that it is probable that the Luxembourg companies will 
continue to generate taxable income in the future. Any future changes in tax law or the structure of the Group could have a significant effect 
on the use of losses, including the period over which the losses can be utilised. 
Based on the current forecasts the losses will be fully utilised over the next 55 to 60 years. A 5%–10% change in the forecast income in Luxembourg 
would change the period over which the losses will be fully utilised by four to seven years.
During the current year the Group recognised an additional €329 million (2016: used €3,037 million) of our deferred tax assets as a result of the 
revaluation of investments based upon the local GAAP financial statements, and tax returns at 31 March 2017 . The Group also derecognised 
a deferred tax asset of €1,603 million related to losses in Luxembourg expected to be used beyond 60 years due to lower interest rates increasing the 
length of time over which these losses would be utilised. Revaluation of investments for local GAAP purposes, which are based on the Group’s value 
in use calculations, can give rise to impairments or the reversal of previous impairments. These can result in a significant change to our deferred tax 
assets and the period over which these assets can be utilised.
€993 million (2016; nil) of the Group’s Luxembourg losses expire, and no deferred tax asset is recognised as they will expire before we can use these 
losses. The remaining losses do not expire. 
We also have €9,132 million (2016: €9,132 million) of Luxembourg losses in a former Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group company, for which 
no deferred tax asset has been recognised as it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised.  Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 122
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
6. Taxation (continued)
Deferred tax assets on losses in Germany
The Group has tax losses of €18,139 million (2016: €18,461 million) in Germany arising on the write down of investments in Germany in 2000. 
The losses are available to use against both German federal and trade tax liabilities and they do not expire.
A deferred tax asset of €2,799 million (2016: €2,858 million) has been recognised in respect of these losses as we conclude it is probable that the 
German business will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which we can utilise these losses. The Group has reviewed the latest 
forecasts for the German business which incorporate the unsystematic risks of operating in the telecommunications business (see pages 28 to 34). 
In the period beyond the five year forecast, we have reviewed the profits inherent in the value in use calculations, and based on these and our 
expectations for the German business we believe it is probable the German losses will be fully utilised.
Based on the current forecasts, the losses will be fully utilised over the next 10 to 12 years. A 5%–10% change in the forecast profits of the German 
business would not significantly alter the utilisation period.
Deferred tax assets on losses in Spain
The Group has tax losses of €3,646 million in Spain, predominantly arising from the Group’s acquisition of Grupo Corporative Ono S.A. in 2015. 
and which are available to offset against the related future profits of the Spanish business. The losses do not expire.
A deferred tax asset of €914 million (2016: €851 million) has been recognised in respect of Ono’s losses as we conclude it is probable that the Spanish 
business will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which we can utilise these losses. The Group has reviewed the latest forecasts 
for the Spanish business which incorporate the unsystematic risks of operating in the telecommunications business (see pages 28 to 34). In the 
period beyond the five year forecast, we have reviewed the profits inherent in the value in use calculations, and based on these and our expectations 
for the Spanish business we believe it is probable the losses will be fully utilised.
Based on the current forecasts the losses will be fully utilised over the next 20 to 23 years. The utilisation period has increased from the prior 
year reported period (eight to ten years) as a result of a change of law which limits the use of brought forward losses against current year profits. 
A 5%–10% change in the forecast profits of the Spanish business would change the period over which the losses are utilised by one to two years. 
Other tax losses
The Group has losses amounting to €7 ,880 million (2016: €8,504 million) in respect of UK subsidiaries, which are only available for offset against 
future capital gains and since it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised, no deferred tax asset has been recognised, in line with the prior year.
The remaining losses relate to a number of other jurisdictions across the Group. There are also €108 million (2016: €486 million) of unrecognised 
other temporary differences.
The Group holds a deferred tax liability of €95 million (2016: €67 million) in respect of deferred taxation that would arise if temporary differences 
on investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures were to be realised after the balance sheet date (see table above).
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of a further €20,237 million (2016: €22,562 million) of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, 
associates and joint ventures because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable 
that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognised deferred tax liabilities 
in respect of these unremitted earnings.

have been paid in cash. The cash payment is reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows as cash flows from financing activities.
Deferred tax assets on losses in India
The Group recognises a deferred tax asset of €1,202 million relating to its Indian business. This includes a deferred tax asset of €816 million relating 
to losses. The deferred tax asset has been recognised as we conclude it is probable that we will generate taxable profits in the future, against which 
we can utilise these losses.
The Group has reviewed the latest forecasts for the Indian business which incorporate the unsystematic risks of operating in the 
telecommunications business (see page 1 14). In the period beyond the five year forecast, we have reviewed the profits inherent in the valuation 
of Indian business, and based on these and our expectations for the Indian business we believe it is probable the losses will be fully utilised. 
Based on the current forecasts the losses will be fully utilised over the next ten years.
We do not recognise a deferred tax asset of €352 million in relation to losses where we currently believe that is not probable these losses will 
be utilised in the future.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
10. Intangible assets 
Our statement of financial position contains significant intangible assets, mainly in relation to goodwill and 
licences and spectrum. Goodwill, which arises when we acquire a business and pay a higher amount than the fair 
value of its net assets primarily due to the synergies we expect to create, is not amortised but is subject to annual 
impairment reviews. Licences and spectrum are amortised over the life of the licence. For further details see 
“Critical accounting judgements” in note 1 “Basis of preparation” to the consolidated financial statements.
Accounting policies
Identifiable intangible assets are recognised when the Group controls the asset, it is probable that future economic benefits attributed to the asset 
will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the entity recognised at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not 
subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is evidence that it may be required. Goodwill is denominated in the 
currency of the acquired entity and revalued to the closing exchange rate at each reporting period date.
Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in the income statement.
On disposal of a subsidiary or a jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss 
recognised in the income statement on disposal.
Goodwill arising before the date of transition to IFRS, on 1 April 2004, has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject to being tested 
for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining 
any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Finite lived intangible assets
Intangible assets with finite lives are stated at acquisition or development cost, less accumulated amortisation. The amortisation period and method 
is reviewed at least annually. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied 
in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
Licence and spectrum fees
Amortisation periods for licence and spectrum fees are determined primarily by reference to the unexpired licence period, the conditions for licence 
renewal and whether licences are dependent on specific technologies. Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the estimated useful lives from the commencement of related network services.
Computer software
Computer software comprises computer software purchased from third parties as well as the cost of internally developed software. 
Computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software. Costs that are 
directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and are probable of producing 
future economic benefits, are recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs of software development include employee costs and directly 
attributable overheads.
Software integral to an item of hardware equipment is classified as property, plant and equipment. Costs associated with maintaining computer 
software programs are recognised as an expense when they are incurred. 
Internally developed software is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met:
 – an asset is created that can be separately identified;
 – it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and
 – the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life from the date the software is available for use.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets, including brands and customer bases, are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Amortisation is charged to the 
income statement, over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date they are available for use, on a straight-line basis, with the 
exception of customer relationships which are amortised on a sum of digits basis. The amortisation basis adopted for each class of intangible asset 
reflects the Group’s consumption of the economic benefit from that asset. 
Estimated useful lives
The estimated useful lives of finite lived intangible assets are as follows:
 – Licence and spectrum fees 3–25 years
 – Computer software 3–5 years
 – Brands 1–10 years
 – Customer bases 2–15 years Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 127

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
11. Property, plant and equipment 
We make significant investments in network equipment and infrastructure – the base stations and technology 
required to operate our networks – that form the majority of our tangible assets. All assets are depreciated over 
their useful economic lives. For further details on the estimation of useful economic lives, see “Critical accounting 
judgements” in note 1 “Basis of preparation” to the consolidated financial statements.
Accounting policies
Land and buildings held for use are stated in the statement of financial position at their cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and any 
accumulated impairment losses.
Amounts for equipment, fixtures and fittings, which includes network infrastructure assets and which together comprise an all but insignificant 
amount of the Group’s property, plant and equipment, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment losses. Depreciation of these assets commences when the 
assets are ready for their intended use.
The cost of property, plant and equipment includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land, using the straight-line method, over their estimated useful lives, 
as follows:
Land and buildings
 – Freehold buildings 25–50 years
 – Leasehold premises the term of the lease
Equipment, fixtures and fittings
 – Network infrastructure and other 1–35 years
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the term 
of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between any sale 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 129

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
12. Investments in associates and joint arrangements
We hold interests in an associate in Kenya, where we have significant influence, as well as in a number of joint 
arrangements in the UK, the Netherlands, India and Australia, where we share control with one or more third 
parties. For further details see “Critical accounting judgements” in note 1 “Basis of preparation” to the consolidated 
financial statements.
Accounting policies
Interests in joint arrangements
A joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint 
control; that is, when the relevant activities that significantly affect the investee’s returns require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing 
control. Joint arrangements are either joint operations or joint ventures.
Gains or losses resulting from the contribution or sale of a subsidiary as part of the formation of a joint arrangement are recognised in respect of the 
Group’s entire equity holding in the subsidiary.
Joint operations
A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have the rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, 
relating to the arrangement or that other facts and circumstances indicate that this is the case. The Group’s share of assets, liabilities, revenue, 
expenses and cash flows are combined with the equivalent items in the financial statements on a line-by-line basis.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Group’s interest in a jointly controlled entity is accounted for in accordance with the Group’s accounting 
policy for goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary.
Joint ventures
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have the rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
At the date of acquisition, any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of the joint venture is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment.
The results and assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method 
of accounting. Under the equity method, investments in joint ventures are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost 
as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the joint venture, less any impairment in the value of the investment. 
The Group’s share of post-tax profits or losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement. Losses of a joint venture in excess of the 
Group’s interest in that joint venture are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made 
payments on behalf of the joint venture.
Associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but where the Group does not have 
control or joint control over those policies.
At the date of acquisition, any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of the associate is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. 
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost as adjusted for post-
acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of the investment. The Group’s share 
of post-tax profits or losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement. Losses of an associate in excess of the Group’s interest 
in that associate are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf 
of the associate.
Joint operations
The Company’s principal joint operation has share capital consisting solely of ordinary shares and is indirectly held, and principally operates in the 
UK. The financial and operating activities of the operation are jointly controlled by the participating shareholders and are primarily designed for all 
but an insignificant amount of the output to be consumed by the shareholders.

13. Other investments
We hold a number of other listed and unlisted investments, mainly comprising US$2.5 billion of loan notes from 
Verizon Communications Inc.
Accounting policies
Other investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms 
require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value, including 
transaction costs.
Other investments classified as held for trading and available-for-sale are stated at fair value. Where securities are held for trading purposes, gains 
and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net profit or loss for the period. For available-for-sale investments, gains and losses 
arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the 
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity, determined using the weighted average cost method, is included in the net profit or loss for 
the period.
Other investments classified as loans and receivables are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.

17 . Provisions
A provision is a liability recorded in the statement of financial position, where there is uncertainty over the timing 
or amount that will be paid, and is therefore often estimated. The main provisions we hold are in relation to asset 
retirement obligations, which include the cost of returning network infrastructure sites to their original condition 
at the end of the lease, and claims for legal and regulatory matters. For further details see “Critical accounting 
judgements” in note 1 “Basis of preparation” to the consolidated financial statements.
Accounting policies
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will 
be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ 
best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date and are discounted to present value where the effect 
is material.
Asset retirement obligations
In the course of the Group’s activities, a number of sites and other assets are utilised which are expected to have costs associated with 
decommissioning. The associated cash outflows are substantially expected to occur at the dates of exit of the assets to which they relate, 
which are long term in nature, primarily in periods up to 25 years from when the asset is brought into use.
Legal and regulatory
The Group is involved in a number of legal and other disputes, including notifications of possible claims. The Directors of the Company, after 
taking legal advice, have established provisions after taking into account the facts of each case. The timing of cash outflows associated with 
the majority of legal claims are typically less than one year, however, for some legal claims the timing of cash flows may be long term in nature. 
For a discussion of certain legal issues potentially affecting the Group see note 30 “Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings” to the consolidated 
financial statements.
Other provisions
Other provisions comprises various provisions including those for restructuring costs and property. The associated cash outflows for restructuring 
costs are primarily less than one year. The timing of the cash flows associated with property is dependent upon the remaining term of the 
associated lease.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
21. Borrowings
The Group’s sources of borrowing for funding and liquidity purposes come from a range of committed bank 
facilities and through short-term and long-term issuances in the capital markets including bond and commercial 
paper issues and bank loans. We manage the basis on which we incur interest on debt between fixed interest rates 
and floating interest rates depending on market conditions using interest rate derivatives. The Group enters into 
foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements on certain monetary items.
Accounting policies
Capital market and bank borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value (which is equal to cost at inception), and are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, except where they are identified as a hedged item in a designated hedge relationship. 
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the amount due on settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over 
the term of the borrowing. Where bonds issued with certain conversion rights are identified as compound instruments they are initially measured 
at fair value with the nominal amounts recognised as a component in equity and the fair value of future coupons included in borrowings. These are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
21. Borrowings (continued) 
Fair values of bonds and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are based on Level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy respectively, using 
quoted market prices or discounted cash flows with a discount rate based upon forward interest rates available to the Group at the reporting date. 
Further information can be found in note 23 “Capital and financial risk management”. 
The Group’s gross and net debt includes certain bonds which have been designated in hedge relationships, which are carried at €2.0 billion 
(2016: €2.1 billion) higher than their euro equivalent redemption value. In addition, where bonds are issued in currencies other than euros, the Group 
has entered into foreign currency swaps to fix the euro cash outflows on redemption. The impact of these swaps are not reflected in gross debt and 
would further reduce the euro equivalent redemption value of the bonds by €0.9 billion (2016: €1.2 billion).
Maturity of borrowings and other financial liabilities
The maturity profile of the anticipated future cash flows including interest in relation to the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities on an  
undiscounted basis which, therefore, differs from both the carrying value and fair value, is as follows:

Notes:
1 The weighted average interest rate for the Group’s sterling denominated fixed rate borrowings is 2.5% (2016: 4.6%). The weighted average time for which these rates are fixed is 16.6 years 
(2016: 6.4 years). The weighted average interest rate for the Group’s euro denominated fixed rate borrowings is 2.1% (2016: 2.7%). The weighted average time for which the rates are fixed 
is 8.4 years (2016: 6.5 years). The weighted average interest rate for the Group’s US dollar denominated fixed rate borrowings is 0.2% (2016: 3.6%). The weighted average time for which the 
rates are fixed is 0.1 years (2016: 2.0 years). The weighted average interest rate for the Group’s other currency fixed rate borrowings is 8.5% (2016: 9.4%). The weighted average time for which 
the rates are fixed is 12.0 years (2016: 6.8 years).
2 At 31 March 2017 other borrowings of €1.9 billion (2016: €2.0 billion) include a €1.8 billion (2016: €1.8 billion) liability for payments due to holders of the equity shares in Kabel Deutschland AG  
under the terms of a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement.
The figures shown in the tables above take into account cross-currency and interest rate swaps used to manage the currency and interest rate 
profile of financial liabilities. Interest on floating rate borrowings is generally based on national LIBOR equivalents or government bond rates in the 
relevant currencies. Additional protection from euro interest rate movements is provided by fixing interest rates or reducing floating interest rates 
using interest rate swaps or interest rate futures

At 31 March 2017 the Group’s most significant committed facilities comprised two revolving credit facilities which remained undrawn throughout 
the year of US$4.0 billion (€3.8 billion) maturing in three to four years and US$4.1 billion (€3.8 billion) maturing in three to five years. Under the terms 
of these bank facilities, lenders have the right, but not the obligation, to cancel their commitment 30 days from the date of notification of a change 
of control of the Company and have outstanding advances repaid on the last day of the current interest period. The facility agreements provide for 
certain structural changes, that do not affect the obligations of the Company, to be specifically excluded from the definition of a change of control. 
This is in addition to the rights of lenders to cancel their commitment if the Company has committed an event of default.
The terms and conditions of the Group’s drawn facilities obtained in relation to projects in its Italian, German, Turkish, United Kingdom and Romanian 
operations of €2.0 billion in aggregate are similar to those of the US dollar and euro revolving credit facilities. Further information on these facilities 
can be found in note 22 “Liquidity and capital resources”. 
22. Liquidity and capital resources
This section includes an analysis of net debt, which we use to manage capital, and committed borrowing facilities.
Net debt
Net debt was €31.2 billion at 31 March 2017 and includes liabilities for amounts payable under the domination agreement in relation to Kabel 
Deutschland AG (€1.8 billion). This decreased by €5.7 billion in the year primarily as a result of the classification of Vodafone India as discontinued 
operations. Further information can be found in note 7 “Discontinued operations and assets held for sale”.
Net debt represented 44% of our market capitalisation at 31 March 2017 compared to 46% at 31 March 2016. Average net debt at month end 
accounting dates over the 12-month period ended 31 March 2017 was €33.0 billion and ranged between net debt of €29.9 billion and €37 .9 billion.

Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financials Additional information
At 31 March 2017 we had €8,835 million of cash and cash equivalents which are held in accordance with the counterparty and settlement risk limits 
of the Board approved treasury policy. The main forms of liquid investment at 31 March 2017 were managed investment funds, money market

The cash received from collateral support agreements mainly reflects the value of our interest rate swap and cross-currency interest rate 
swap portfolios which are substantially net present value positive. See note 23 “Capital and financial risk management” for further details 
on these agreements.
Commercial paper programmes 
We currently have US and euro commercial paper programmes of US$15 billion and €8 billion respectively which are available to be used to meet 
short-term liquidity requirements. At 31 March 2017 amounts external to the Group of €2,262 million were drawn under the euro commercial paper 
programme and US$1,484 million (€1,386 million) were drawn down under the US commercial paper programme, with such funds being provided 
by counterparties external to the Group. At 31 March 2016 amounts external to the Group of €8,907 million and US$38 million (€33 million) 
were drawn under the euro commercial paper programme and US$471 million (€413 million) were drawn down under the US commercial paper 
programme, with such funds being provided by counterparties external to the Group. 
The commercial paper facilities were supported by US$4.1 billion (€3.8 billion) and €4.0 billion of syndicated committed bank facilities 
(see “Committed facilities” below). No amounts had been drawn under either bank facility.
Bonds
We have a €30 billion euro medium-term note programme and a US shelf programme which are used to meet medium to long-term funding 
requirements. At 31 March 2017 the total amounts in issue under these programmes split by currency were US$12.3 billion, €15.1 billion, £4.2 billion, 
CHF0.7 billion and NOK1.7 billion.
At 31 March 2017 we had bonds outstanding with a nominal value of €32.3 billion. During the year ended 31 March 2017 bonds with a nominal 
value equivalent of €6.0 billion were issued under the euro medium-term note programme. The bonds issued in the year were:

On 25 February 2016 the Group issued £2.9 billion (€3.5 billion) of subordinated mandatory convertible bonds issued in two tranches, with the first 
£1.4 billion (€1.7 billion) maturing on 25 August 2017 and a further £1.4 billion (€1.7 billion) maturing on 25 February 2019 with coupons of 1.5% 
and 2.0% respectively. At the initial conversion price adjusted for dividends declared during the year, of £2.0546, at maturity the bond will convert 
to 1,401,732,698 Vodafone Group Plc shares representing approximately 5% of Vodafone’s share capital. The mandatory bonds are compound 
instruments with nominal values of £2.8 billion (€3.5 billion) recognised as a component of shareholders’ funds in equity. The fair value of future 
coupons of £0.1 billion (€0.1 billion) is recognised as a financial liability in borrowings and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method. Refer to the consolidated statement of changes in equity on page 101.
The Group has hedged its exposure under the subordinated mandatory convertible bonds to any future movements in its share price by an option 
strategy designed to hedge the economic impact of share price movements during the term of the bonds. Should the Group decide to buy back 
ordinary shares to mitigate the dilution resulting from the conversion, the hedging strategy will provide a hedge for the repurchase price.
Own shares
The Group held a maximum of 2,254,825,696 of its own shares during the year which represented 8.0% of issued share capital at that time. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 146

Furthermore, certain of our subsidiaries are funded by external facilities which are non-recourse to any member of the Group other than the 
borrower. These facilities may only be used to fund their operations. At 31 March 2017 Vodafone Egypt had a fully drawn term loan of US$53 million 
(€50 million) and undrawn revolving credit facilities of EGP4 billion (€207 million). Vodacom had fully drawn facilities of US$1 12 million (€105 million) 
and facilities of ZAR0.48 billion (€33.3 million) of which ZAR0.47 billion (€32.8 million) was drawn. Vodafone Ghana had fully drawn facilities 
of US$142 million (€133 million) and GHS60 million (€13 million).
Dividends from associates and to non-controlling shareholders
Dividends from our associates are generally paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors or shareholders of the individual operating and holding 
companies, and we have no rights to receive dividends except where specified within certain of the Group’s shareholders’ agreements. Similarly, 
other than ongoing dividend obligations to the KDG minority shareholders should they continue to hold their minority stake, we do not have existing 
obligations under shareholders’ agreements to pay dividends to non-controlling interest partners of our subsidiaries or joint ventures.
The amount of dividends received and paid in the year are disclosed in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
Potential cash outflows from option agreements and similar arrangements
Under the terms of the sale and purchase agreement governing the disposal of the US Group, including the 45% interest in Verizon Wireless, 
the Group retains the responsibility for any tax liabilities of the US Group, excluding those relating to the Verizon Wireless partnership, for periods 
up to the completion of the transaction on 21 February 2014. 
Put options issued as part of the hedging strategy for the mandatory convertible bonds permit the holders to exercise against the Group if there 
is a decrease in our share price. Under the terms of the options, settlement must be made in cash which will equate to the reduced value of shares 
from the initial conversion price, adjusted for dividends declared during the year, on 1,402 million shares.
Sale of trade receivables 
During the year the Group sold certain trade receivables to a financial institution. Whilst there are no repurchase obligations in respect of these 
receivables, the Group provided a credit guarantee which would only become payable if default rates were significantly higher than historical rates. 
The credit guarantee is not considered substantive and substantially all risks and rewards associated with the receivables passed to the purchaser 
at the date of sale, therefore the receivables were derecognised. The maximum payable under the guarantees at 31 March 2017 was €360 million. 
No provision has been made in respect of these guarantees as the likelihood of a cash outflow has been assessed as remote. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 148
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
23. Capital and financial risk management
This note details our treasury management and financial risk management objectives and policies, as well 
as the exposure and sensitivity of the Group to credit, liquidity, interest and foreign exchange risk, and the policies 
in place to monitor and manage these risks. 
Accounting policies
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities, in respect of financial instruments, are recognised on the Group’s statement of financial position when the 
Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered 
into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that provides a residual interest in the 
assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets. The accounting policies 
adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.
Put option arrangements over non-controlling interest
The potential cash payments related to put options issued by the Group over the equity of subsidiary companies are accounted for as financial 
liabilities when such options may only be settled by exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of shares 
in the subsidiary.
The amount that may become payable under the option on exercise is initially recognised at present value within borrowings with a corresponding 
charge directly to equity. The charge to equity is recognised separately as written put options over non-controlling interests, adjacent to non-
controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries. The Group recognises the cost of writing such put options, determined as the 
excess of the present value of the option over any consideration received, as a financing cost.
Such options are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, in order to accrete the liability up to the 
amount payable under the option at the date at which it first becomes exercisable; the charge arising is recorded as a financing cost. In the event 
that the option expires unexercised, the liability is derecognised with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates which it manages using derivative 
financial instruments.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use 
of financial derivatives consistent with the Group’s risk management strategy. Changes in values of all derivatives of a financing nature are included 
within investment income and financing costs in the income statement unless designated in an effective cash flow hedge relationship or a hedge 
of a net investment in foreign operations when changes in value are deferred to other comprehensive income or equity respectively. The Group 
does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each 
reporting date. The Group designates certain derivatives as:
 – hedges of the change of fair value of recognised assets and liabilities (‘fair value hedges’); or
 – hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency or interest rate risks of firm commitments (‘cash flow hedges’); or
 – hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting, or if the Company chooses to end the hedging relationship.
Fair value hedges
The Group’s policy is to use derivative instruments (primarily interest rate swaps) to convert a proportion of its fixed rate debt to floating rates in order 
to hedge the interest rate risk arising, principally, from capital market borrowings. The Group designates these as fair value hedges of interest rate risk 
with changes in fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in the income statement for the period together with the changes in the fair value 
of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk, to the extent the hedge is effective. Gains or losses relating to any ineffective portion are recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
Cash flow hedges
Cash flow hedging is used by the Group to hedge certain exposures to variability in future cash flows. The portion of gains or losses relating 
to changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as effective cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income; 
gains or losses relating to any ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement.
When the hedged item is recognised in the income statement, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated 
in equity for the hedging instrument are reclassified to the income statement. However, when the hedged transaction results in the recognition 
of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated 
in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 149
Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financials Additional information
When hedge accounting is discontinued, any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income at that time remains in equity and 
is recognised in the income statement when the hedged transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. If a forecast transaction 
is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Net investment hedges
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are recognised directly in equity. Gains and losses 
on those hedging instruments (which include bonds, commercial paper, cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange contracts) designated 
as hedges of the net investments in foreign operations are recognised in equity to the extent that the hedging relationship is effective; these 
amounts are included in exchange differences on translation of foreign operations as stated in the statement of comprehensive income. Gains and 
losses relating to hedge ineffectiveness are recognised immediately in the income statement for the period. Gains and losses accumulated in the 
translation reserve are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.

Net debt 31,169 36,915
Equity 73,719 85,136
Capital 104,888 122,051
The Group’s policy is to borrow centrally using a mixture of long-term and short-term capital market issues and borrowing facilities to meet 
anticipated funding requirements. These borrowings, together with cash generated from operations, are loaned internally or contributed as equity 
to certain subsidiaries. The Board has approved three internal debt protection ratios being: net interest to operating cash flow (plus dividends from 
associates); retained cash flow (operating cash flow plus dividends from associates less interest, tax, dividends to non-controlling shareholders and 
equity dividends) to net debt; and operating cash flow (plus dividends from associates) to net debt. These internal ratios establish levels of debt that 
the Group should not exceed other than for relatively short periods of time and are shared with the Group’s debt rating agencies being Moody’s, 
Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor’s. 
Financial risk management
The Group’s treasury function manages centrally the Group’s funding requirement, net foreign exchange exposure, interest rate management 
exposures and counterpart risk arising from investments and derivatives.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines authorised and reviewed by the Board, most recently 
on 3 November 2015. A treasury risk committee comprising of the Group’s Chief Financial Officer, Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, 
Group Financial Controller, Group Treasury Director and Director of Financial Reporting meets three times a year to review treasury activities and 
its members receive management information relating to treasury activities on a quarterly basis. The Group’s accounting function, which does not 
report to the Group Treasury Director, provides regular update reports of treasury activity to the Board. The Group’s internal auditor reviews the 
internal control environment regularly.
The Group uses a number of derivative instruments for currency and interest rate risk management purposes only that are transacted by specialist 
treasury personnel. The Group mitigates banking sector credit risk by the use of collateral support agreements.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
23. Capital and financial risk management (continued)
The Group invested in UK index-linked government bonds on the basis that they generated a floating rate return in excess of £ LIBOR and are 
amongst the most creditworthy of investments available.
The Group has two managed investment funds. These funds hold fixed income euro securities and the average credit quality is high double A.
Money market investments are in accordance with established internal treasury policies which dictate that an investment’s long-term credit rating 
is no lower than mid BBB. Additionally, the Group invests in AAA unsecured money market mutual funds where the investment is limited to 10% 
of each fund.
The Group also invests in a fund where the underlying assets are supply chain receivables, the creditworthiness of which are enhanced 
by an insurance wrapper as provided by established insurance companies with a long-term credit rating of at least A-.
The Group invests in repurchase agreements which are fully collateralised investments. The collateral is sovereign and supranational debt with 
at least one AAA rating denominated in euros, sterling and US dollars and can be readily converted to cash. In the event of any default, ownership 
of the collateral would revert to the Group. Detailed below is the value of the collateral held by the Group at 31 March:
 2017 
Restated 
2016 
 €m  €m 
Sovereign – 3,415
Supranational – – 
 – 3,415
In respect of financial instruments used by the Group’s treasury function, the aggregate credit risk the Group may have with one counterparty 
is limited by (i) reference to the long-term credit ratings assigned for that counterparty by Moody’s, Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor’s; (ii) that 
counterparty’s five year credit default swap (‘CDS’) spread; and (iii) the sovereign credit rating of that counterparty’s principal operating jurisdiction. 
Furthermore, collateral support agreements were introduced from the fourth quarter of 2008. Under collateral support agreements the 
Group’s exposure to a counterparty with whom a collateral support agreement is in place is reduced to the extent that the counterparty must post 
cash collateral when there is value due to the Group under outstanding derivative contracts that exceeds a contractually agreed threshold amount. 
When value is due to the counterparty the Group is required to post collateral on identical terms. Such cash collateral is adjusted daily as necessary. 
In the event of any default, ownership of the cash collateral would revert to the respective holder at that point. Detailed below is the value of the cash 
collateral, which is reported within short-term borrowings, held by the Group at 31 March:

The majority of the Group’s trade receivables are due for maturity within 90 days and largely comprise amounts receivable from consumers and 
business customers. At 31 March 2017 €3,322 million (2016: €4,082 million) of trade receivables were not yet due for payment. Overdue trade  
receivables consisted of €789 million (2016: €1,636 million) relating to the Europe region, and €423 million (2016: €318 million) relating to the AMAP 
region. Financial statements are monitored by management and provisions for bad and doubtful debts raised where it is deemed appropriate.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited given that the Group’s customer base is large and unrelated. Due to this, 
management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for bad and doubtful receivables. 
Amounts charged to administrative expenses during the year ended 31 March 2017 were €589 million (2016: €679 million) (see note 15 “Trade and 
other receivables”).
As discussed in note 30 “Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings”, the Group has covenanted to provide security in favour of the trustee of the 
Vodafone Group UK Pension Scheme in respect of the funding deficit in the scheme. The security takes the form of an English law pledge over 
UK index-linked government bonds.
Liquidity risk
At 31 March 2017 the Group had €4.0 billion and US$4.1 billion syndicated committed undrawn bank facilities which support the US$15 billion 
and €8.0 billion commercial paper programme available to the Group. The Group uses commercial paper and bank facilities to manage short-term 
liquidity and manages long-term liquidity by raising funds in the capital markets. 
The euro syndicated committed facility has a maturity date of 28 March 2021. The US$ syndicated committed facility has a maturity date 
of 27 February 2022. Both facilities have remained undrawn throughout the financial year and since year end and provide liquidity support. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 151
Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financials Additional information
The Group manages liquidity risk on long-term borrowings by maintaining a varied maturity profile with a cap on the level of debt maturity in any 
one calendar year, therefore minimising refinancing risk. Long-term borrowings mature between one and 39 years.
Liquidity is reviewed daily on at least a 1 2 month rolling basis and stress tested on the assumption that all commercial paper outstanding 
matures and is not reissued. The Group maintains substantial cash and cash equivalents which at 31 March 2017 amounted to €8,835 million 
(2016: €12,922 million).
Market risk
Interest rate management
Under the Group’s interest rate management policy, interest rates on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in euros, US dollars and sterling 
are maintained on a floating rate basis except for periods up to six years where interest rate fixing has to be undertaken in accordance with treasury 
policy. The policy also allows euros, US dollars and sterling to be moved to a fixed rate basis if interest rates are statistically low. Where assets and 
liabilities are denominated in other currencies interest rates may also be fixed. In addition, fixing is undertaken for longer periods when interest rates 
are statistically low.
For each one hundred basis point rise in market interest rates for all currencies in which the Group had borrowings at 31 March 2017 there would 
be an increase in profit before tax by approximately €470 million (2016: approximately €29 million) including mark-to-market revaluations of interest 
rate and other derivatives and the potential interest on outstanding tax issues. There would be no material impact on equity.
At 31 March 2017 other than USD denominated liabilities, which are retained in order to hedge foreign exchange movements arising from our 
investment in VZ Communication loan notes, substantially all of our outstanding liabilities are held on a fixed interest rate basis in accordance with 
treasury policy.
Foreign exchange management
As Vodafone’s primary listing is on the London Stock Exchange its share price is quoted in sterling. Since the sterling share price represents the 
value of its future multi-currency cash flows, principally in euro, South African rand and sterling, the Group maintains the currency of debt and 
interest charges in proportion to its expected future principal cash flows and has a policy to hedge external foreign exchange risks on transactions 
denominated in other currencies above certain de minimis level. 
At 31 March 2017 19% of net debt was denominated in currencies other than euro (8% US dollar, 5% South African rand and 6% other). This allows 
US dollar, South African rand and other debt to be serviced in proportion to expected future cash flows and therefore provides a partial hedge 
against income statement translation exposure, as interest costs will be denominated in foreign currencies. 
Under the Group’s foreign exchange management policy, foreign exchange transaction exposure in Group companies is generally maintained at the 
lower of €5 million per currency per month or €15 million per currency over a six month period. 
The Group recognises foreign exchange movements in equity for the translation of net investment hedging instruments and balances treated 
as investments in foreign operations. However, there is no net impact on equity for exchange rate movements on net investment hedging 
instruments as there would be an offset in the currency translation of the foreign operation. At 31 March 2017 the Group held financial liabilities 
in a net investment against the Group’s South African rand. Sensitivity to foreign exchange movements on the hedging liabilities, analysed 
against a strengthening of the South African rand by 18% would result in a decrease in equity of €493 million which would be fully offset 
by foreign exchange movements on the hedged net assets. At 31 March 2016 the Group held financial liabilities in a net investment against the 
Group’s consolidated euro net assets. Subsequent to the change in the Company’s functional currency and the Group’s presentation currency 
from sterling to euro with effect from 1 April 2017 , the Group’s primary foreign exchange exposure is to South African rand (2016: euro). 
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity of the Group’s adjusted operating profit to a strengthening of the Group’s major currency in which 
it transacts. The percentage movement applied to the currency is based on the average movements in the previous three annual reporting periods. 
Amounts are calculated by retranslating the operating profit of each entity whose functional is South African rand.

At 31 March 2017 the Group’s sensitivity to foreign exchange movements, analysed against a strengthening of the US dollar by 1 1% (2016: 8%) on its 
external US dollar exposure, would decrease the profit before tax by €100 million (2016: €76 million). Foreign exchange on certain sterling balances 
analysed against a 10% strengthening of sterling would decrease the profit before tax by €262 million (2016: €nil).
Equity risk
There is no material equity risk relating to the Group’s equity investments which are detailed in note 13 “Other investments”.
The Group has hedged its exposure under the subordinated mandatory convertible bonds to any future movements in its share price 
by an option strategy designed to hedge the economic impact of share price movements during the term of the bonds. As at 31 March 2017 the 
Group’s sensitivity to a movement of 7% (2016: 5%) in its share price would result in an increase or decrease in profit before tax of approximately 
€236 million (2016: €182 million). Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 152

to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
Derivative financial instruments that do not meet the criteria for offset could be settled net in certain circumstances under ISDA (International Swaps 
and Derivatives Association) agreements where each party has the option to settle amounts on a net basis in the event of default from the other. 
Collateral may be offset and net settled against derivative financial instruments in the event of default by either party. The aforementioned collateral 
balances are recorded in “other short-term investments” or “short-term debt” respectively.

26. Post employment benefits
We operate a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans for our employees. 
The Group’s largest defined benefit scheme is in the UK. For further details see “Critical accounting 
judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty” in note 1 “Basis of preparation” to the consolidated 
financial statements. 
Accounting policies
For defined benefit retirement plans, the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the plan liabilities is recognised 
as an asset or liability on the statement of financial position. Scheme liabilities are assessed using the projected unit funding method and applying 
the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting period date. Assets are valued at market value.
Actuarial gains and losses are taken to the statement of comprehensive income as incurred. For this purpose, actuarial gains and losses comprise 
both the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising because of differences between the previous actuarial 
assumptions and what has actually occurred. The return on plan assets, in excess of interest income, is also taken to other comprehensive income.
Other movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the income statement, including the current service cost, any past service cost and 
the effect of any settlements. The interest cost less the expected interest income on assets is also charged to the income statement. The amount 
charged to the income statement in respect of these plans is included within operating costs or in the Group’s share of the results of equity 
accounted operations, as appropriate.
Cumulative actuarial gains and losses at 1 April 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, were recognised in the statement of financial position. 
The Group contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
Background
At 31 March 2017 the Group operated a number of pension plans for the benefit of its employees throughout the world, with varying rights and 
obligations depending on the conditions and practices in the countries concerned. The Group’s pension plans are provided through both defined 
benefit and defined contribution arrangements. Defined benefit schemes provide benefits based on the employees’ length of pensionable service 
and their final pensionable salary or other criteria. Defined contribution schemes offer employees individual funds that are converted into benefits 
at the time of retirement.
The Group operates defined benefit schemes in Germany, Ghana, India, Ireland, Italy, the UK and the United States. Defined contribution pension 
schemes are currently provided in Australia, Egypt, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, 
South Africa, Spain and the UK.

Defined benefit schemes
Vodafone Group’s retirement policy is to provide competitive pension provision, in each operating country, in line with the market median for that location. 
Vodafone Group’s preferred retirement provision is focused on Defined Contribution (‘DC’) arrangements and/ or State provision for future service.
The Group’s main defined benefit funding liability is the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme (‘Vodafone UK plan’). Since June 2014 the plan has 
consisted of two segregated sections the Vodafone Section and the Cable & Wireless Section. Both sections are closed to new entrants and to future 
accrual. The Group also operates unfunded plans in Germany and funded plans in Ireland. Defined benefit pension provision exposes the Group 
to actuarial risks such as longer than expected longevity of participants, lower than expected return on investments and higher than expected 
inflation, which may increase the liabilities or reduce the value of assets of the schemes.
The defined benefit schemes are administered by Trustee Boards who are legally separate from the Group and consist of representatives who are 
employees, former employees or are independent from the Company. The Boards of the pension schemes are required by legislation to act in the 
best interest of the participants, set the investment strategy and contribution rates and are subject to statutory funding objectives.
The Vodafone UK plan is registered as an occupational pension plan with HMRC and is subject to UK legislation and operates within the framework 
outlined by the Pensions Regulator. UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently and that valuations are undertaken at least 
every three years. Separate valuations are required for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section. Within 15 months of each valuation date, the plan 
trustees and the Group must agree any contributions required to ensure that the plan is fully funded over time on a suitably prudent measure.
The publication by the International Accounting Standards Board in June 2015 of its Exposure Draft of amendments to IFRIC 14 IAS 19 – The Limit 
on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction, has provided additional clarity on the role of trustees’ rights 
in an assessment of the recoverability of a surplus in an employee pension fund. The trustees of the Vodafone UK plan have neither a unilateral right 
to wind up the plan nor a unilateral right to improve members’ benefits. 
The trustees obtain regular actuarial valuations to check whether the statutory funding objective is met and whether a recovery plan is required 
to restore funding to the level of the agreed technical provisions. The previous valuations for the Vodafone and CWW Sections of the Vodafone 
UK plan were carried out as at 31 March 2013 resulting in the Group paying a special one-off contributions totalling £365 million (€442 million) 
in April 2014 (£325 million (€394 million) into the Vodafone Section and £40 million (€48 million) into the CWW Section). No further contributions 
were due in respect of the deficit revealed at the 2013 valuation.
The most recent triennial actuarial valuation is currently being undertaken by independent actuaries appointed by the plan trustees, with an effective 
date of 31 March 2016. The preliminary results indicate that due to falls in government bond yields since the 2013 valuation, it is likely that additional 
deficit payments will be required. The valuation results and recovery plan are currently being agreed by the trustees and the Company.
Funding plans are individually agreed for each of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes with the respective trustees, taking into account 
local regulatory requirements. It is expected that ordinary contributions relating to future service of €133 million will be paid into the Group’s defined 
benefit pension schemes during the year ending 31 March 2018. The Group has also provided certain guarantees in respect of the Vodafone 
UK plan; further details are provided in note 30 “Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings” to the consolidated financial statements.
Actuarial assumptions
The Group’s scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit credit method using the principal actuarial assumptions set out below:
 2017 2016 2015
 % %  % 
Weighted average actuarial assumptions used at 31 March

:   
Rate of inflation

Discount rate 2.6 3.2 3.0
Notes:
1 Figures shown represent a weighted average assumption of the individual schemes.
2 The rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred payment is the rate of inflation.
Mortality assumptions used are based on recommendations from the individual scheme actuaries which include adjustments for the experience 
of the Group where appropriate. The Group’s largest scheme is the Vodafone UK plan. Further life expectancies assumed for the UK schemes are 
24.1/25.4 years (2016: 24.0/25.3 years; 2015: 24.5/25.8 years) for a male/female pensioner currently aged 65 and 26.7 /28.3 years (2016: 65 and 
26.6/28.1 years; 2015: 27 .1/28.7 years) from age 65 for a male/female non-pensioner member currently aged 40.

The past service costs includes the results of a Pension Increase Exchange (‘PIE’) exercise carried out in the main UK defined benefit scheme 
between June and October 2016. All eligible pensioners were given the opportunity to exchange future increases on part or all of their pension and 
receive a higher pension immediately. If they accepted the offer (after taking financial advice), they no longer receive future increases on that part 
of their pension, the net impact of which was to reduce the future liabilities of the scheme.

form of future refunds or, for plans still open to benefit accrual, in the form of possible reductions in future contributions. 
Duration of the benefit obligations
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 31 March 2017 is 22.9 years (2016: 22.3 years; 2015: 22.7 years).

The schemes have no direct investments in the Group’s equity securities or in property currently used by the Group. Each of the plans manages 
risks through a variety of methods and strategies including equity protection, to limit downside risk in falls in equity markets, inflation and interest 
rate hedging and, in the CWW Section of the Vodafone UK plan, a substantial insured pensioner annuity policy. The CWW Section annuity policy 
fully matches the pension obligations of those pensioners insured, and therefore the fair value has been set equal to the present value of the 
related obligations. 
Investment funds of €299 million at 31 March 2017 include €278 million of investments in diversified alternate beta funds held in the Vodafone 
Section of the Vodafone UK plan.
Plan assets have been measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement”. The actual return on plan assets over the year 
to 31 March 2017 was a gain of €1,008 million (2016: €3 million loss).  Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 159

Sensitivity analysis
Measurement of the Group’s defined benefit retirement obligation is sensitive to changes in certain key assumptions. The sensitivity analysis below 
shows how a reasonably possible increase or decrease in a particular assumption would, in isolation, result in an increase or decrease in the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation as at 31 March 2017 .

The sensitivity analysis may not be representative of an actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that changes in assumptions 
would occur in isolation of one another. In presenting this sensitivity analysis, the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation has 
been calculated on the same basis as prior years using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that 
applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the statement of financial position.
27 . Share-based payments
We have a number of share plans used to award shares to Directors and employees as part of their remuneration 
package. A charge is recognised over the vesting period in the consolidated income statement to record the cost 
of these, based on the fair value of the award on the grant date.
Accounting policies
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value 
(excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled 
share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the shares that will eventually 
vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. A corresponding increase in retained earnings is also recognised.
Some share awards have an attached market condition, based on total shareholder return (‘TSR’), which is taken into account when calculating 
the fair value of the share awards. The valuation for the TSR is based on Vodafone’s ranking within the same group of companies, where possible, 
over the past five years.
The fair value of awards of non-vested shares is an average calculation of the closing price of the Group’s shares on the days prior to the grant date, 
adjusted for the present value of the delay in receiving dividends where appropriate.
The maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares which may be issued in respect of share options or share plans will not (without shareholder 
approval) exceed:
 – 10% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately prior to the date of grant, when aggregated with the total number 
of ordinary shares which have been allocated in the preceding ten year period under all plans; and
 – 5% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately prior to the date of grant, when aggregated with the total number 
of ordinary shares which have been allocated in the preceding ten year period under all plans, other than any plans which are operated  
on an all-employee basis.
Share options
Vodafone Group executive plans
No share options have been granted to any Directors or employees under the Company’s discretionary share option plans in the year ended 
31 March 2017 . There are options outstanding under the Vodafone Global Incentive Plan. These options are normally exercisable between three 
and ten years from the date of grant. The vesting of some of these options was subject to satisfaction of performance conditions. Grants made 
to US employees are made in respect of American Depositary Shares (‘ADS’).
Vodafone Group Sharesave Plan
The Vodafone Group 2008 Sharesave Plan enables UK staff to acquire shares in the Company through monthly savings of up to £375 (increased 
from £250) over a three and/or five year period, at the end of which they may also receive a tax-free bonus. The savings and bonus may then 
be used to purchase shares at the option price, which is set at the beginning of the invitation period and usually at a discount of 20% to the then 
prevailing market price of the Company’s shares. 
Share plans
Vodafone Group executive plans
Under the Vodafone Global Incentive Plan awards of shares are granted to Directors and certain employees. The release of these shares 
is conditional upon continued employment and for some awards achievement of certain performance targets measured over a three year period.
Vodafone Share Incentive Plan
The Vodafone Share Incentive Plan enables UK staff to acquire shares in the Company through monthly purchases of up to £125 per month or 5% 
of salary, whichever is lower. For each share purchased by the employee, the Company provides a free matching share. Following a review of the 
UK all-employee plans it was decided that with effect from 1 April 201 7 employees would no longer be able to contribute to the Share Incentive 
Plan and would therefore no longer receive matching shares. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 160

The compensation cost included in the consolidated income statement in respect of share options and share plans was €95 million 
(2016: €154 million; 2015: €104 million) which is comprised principally of equity-settled transactions.
The average share price for the year ended 31 March 2017 was 216.2 pence (2016: 224.2 pence; 2015: 212.7 pence).

28. Acquisitions and disposals
We completed a number of acquisitions and disposals during the year, most significantly, the combination of our 
operations in the Netherlands with those of Liberty Global plc to form VodafoneZiggo, a 50:50 joint venture, details 
of which are set out below. For further details see “Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty” in note 1 “Basis of preparation” to the consolidated financial statements.
Accounting policies
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values 
at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group. Acquisition-related costs are 
recognised in the income statement as incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition 
date. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree 
and the fair value of the Group’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree, if any, over the net amounts of identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The interest of the non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree may initially be measured either at fair 
value or at the non-controlling shareholders’ proportion of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis.
Acquisition of interests from non-controlling shareholders
In transactions with non-controlling parties that do not result in a change in control, the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid 
or received and the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted is recognised in equity. 
Acquisitions
The aggregate cash consideration in respect of purchases of interests in subsidiaries, net of cash acquired, is as follows: 
 €m
Cash consideration paid: 
Acquisitions completed during the year 32
Net cash acquired (4)
28
During the 2017 financial year, the Group completed a number of acquisitions for an aggregate net cash consideration of €28 million. The aggregate 
fair values of goodwill, identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired operations were €1 million, €34 million and €7 million respectively. 
No amount of goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Disposals
On 31 December 2016, we combined our operations in the Netherlands with those of Liberty Global plc to create VodafoneZiggo Group Holding 
B.V. (‘VodafoneZiggo’), a 50:50 joint venture providing national unified communications. As a result of the transaction, we no longer consolidate our 
previous interest in the Netherlands and account for our 50% interest in VodafoneZiggo as a Joint Venture using the equity method. The Group 
recognised a net gain on the formation of VodafoneZiggo of €1,275 million.

Notes:
1 Included in purchase of interests in associates and joint ventures in the consolidated statement of cash flows. 
2 The fair value of our initial investment in VodafoneZiggo is not observable in a quoted market. Accordingly, the fair value has been primarily determined with reference to the outcome 
of a discounted cash flow analysis. Certain significant inputs used in the valuation, such as forecasts of future cash flows, are based on our assumptions and are therefore unobservable. 
The valuation therefore falls under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The weighted average cost of capital and terminal growth rate used to value our initial investment in VodafoneZiggo were 
7.0% and 1.0% respectively.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
29. Commitments
A commitment is a contractual obligation to make a payment in the future, mainly in relation to leases and 
agreements to buy assets such as network infrastructure and IT systems. These amounts are not recorded 
in the consolidated statement of financial position since we have not yet received the goods or services from 
the supplier. The amounts below are the minimum amounts that we are committed to pay.
Accounting policies
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value 
of the minimum lease payments as determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the statement 
of financial position as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation 
so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognised in the income statement.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. 
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Operating lease commitments
The Group has entered into commercial leases on certain properties, network infrastructure, motor vehicles and items of equipment. 
The leases have various terms, escalation clauses, purchase options and renewal rights, none of which are individually significant to the Group. 
Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases comprise:

Acquisition commitments
On 20 March 2017 , Vodafone announced the agreement to combine its subsidiary, Vodafone India (excluding its 42% stake in Indus Towers), with 
Idea Cellular, which is listed on the Indian Stock Exchanges, with the combined company to be jointly controlled by Vodafone and the Aditya 
Birla Group. Vodafone will own 45.1% of the combined company after transferring a stake of 4.9% to the Aditya Birla Group for circa INR39 billion 
(circa US$579 million) in cash concurrent with completion of the merger. The Aditya Birla Group will then own 26.0% and has the right to acquire 
more shares from Vodafone under an agreed mechanism with a view to equalising the shareholdings over time. If Vodafone and the Aditya 
Birla Group’s shareholdings in the combined company are not equal after four years, Vodafone will sell down shares in the combined company 
to equalise its shareholding to that of the Aditya Birla Group over the following five-year period. Until equalisation is achieved, the voting rights of the 
additional shares held by Vodafone will be restricted and votes will be exercised jointly under the terms of the shareholders’ agreement. 
The transaction is subject to approvals from the relevant regulatory authorities and is also subject to other customary closing conditions, including 
the absence of any material adverse change. Shareholder approval will be required from Idea shareholders under a scheme of arrangement. 
The transaction has a break-fee of INR33 billion (US$500 million) that would become payable under certain circumstances. It is anticipated that 
completion will take place during the 2018 calendar year.
On 9 June 2016, Vodafone announced its intention to merge with Sky Network Television in New Zealand, thereby creating the country’s leading 
integrated telecommunications and media group. Vodafone will become a 51% shareholder in the combined group, will receive NZ$1.25 billion 
in cash and will look to realise the benefits of an estimated NZ$850 million NPV from synergies. Sky shareholders have voted in favour of the 
transaction but completion is still subject to local regulatory approvals. In February 2017 , the New Zealand Commerce Commission (‘NZCC’) did not 
approve the proposed merger with Sky Network Television. We are reviewing the reasoning of the NZCC and have preserved the right to appeal 
the decision. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 163

UK pension schemes
The Group’s main defined benefit scheme is the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme (the ‘Scheme’) which has two segregated sections, 
the Vodafone Section and the CWW Section, as detailed in note 26.
The Group has covenanted to provide security in favour of the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme – Vodafone Section whilst a deficit remains 
for this section. The deficit is measured on a prescribed basis agreed between the Group and Trustee. The Group provides a combination of surety 
bonds and a charge over UK indexed gilts as the security. 
The level of the security has varied since inception in line with the movement in the Scheme deficit. At 31 March 2017 the Scheme retains security 
over €1.2 billion (notional value). The security may be substituted either on a voluntary or mandatory basis. The Company has also provided two 
guarantees to the Vodafone Section of the Scheme for a combined value up to €1.5 billion to provide security over the deficit under certain defined 
circumstances, including insolvency of the employers. The Company has also agreed a similar guarantee of up to €1.5 billion for the CWW Section.
An additional smaller UK defined benefit scheme, the THUS Plc Group Scheme, has a guarantee from the Company for up to €130 million.
Legal proceedings
The Company and its subsidiaries are currently, and may from time to time become, involved in a number of legal proceedings, including inquiries 
from, or discussions with, governmental authorities that are incidental to their operations. However, save as disclosed below, the Company does not 
believe that it or its subsidiaries are currently involved in (i) any legal or arbitration proceedings (including any governmental proceedings which are 
pending or known to be contemplated) which may have, or have had in the 1 2 months preceding the date of this report, a material adverse effect 
on the financial position or profitability of the Company or its subsidiaries; or (ii) any material proceedings in which any of the Company’s Directors, 
members of senior management or affiliates are either a party adverse to the Company or its subsidiaries or have a material interest adverse to the 
Company or its subsidiaries. Due to inherent uncertainties, the Company cannot make any accurate quantification of any cost, or timing of such cost, 
which may arise from any of the legal proceedings referred to in this Annual Report, however costs in complex litigation can be substantial.
Indian tax cases
In August 2007 and September 2007 , Vodafone India Limited (‘VIL ’) and Vodafone International Holdings BV (‘VIHBV’) respectively received notices 
from the Indian tax authority alleging potential liability in connection with an alleged failure by VIHBV to deduct withholding tax from consideration 
paid to the Hutchison Telecommunications International Limited group (‘HTIL ’) in respect of HTIL ’s gain on its disposal to VIHBV of its interests 
in a wholly-owned Cayman Island incorporated subsidiary that indirectly holds interests in VIL. Following approximately five years of litigation in the 
Indian courts in which VIHBV sought to set aside the tax demand issued by the Indian tax authority, in January 201 2 the Supreme Court of India 
handed down its judgement, holding that VIHBV’s interpretation of the Income T ax Act 196 1 was correct, that the HTIL transaction in 2007 was 
not taxable in India, and that consequently, VIHBV had no obligation to withhold tax from consideration paid to HTIL in respect of the transaction. 
The Supreme Court of India quashed the relevant notices and demands issued to VIHBV in respect of withholding tax and interest. 
On 28 May 2012 the Finance Act 2012 became law. The Finance Act 2012, which amended various provisions of the Income Tax Act 1961 with 
retrospective effect, contained provisions intended to tax any gain on transfer of shares in a non-Indian company, which derives substantial value 
from underlying Indian assets, such as VIHBV’s transaction with HTIL in 2007 . Further, it seeks to subject a purchaser, such as VIHBV, to a retrospective 
obligation to withhold tax. VIHBV received a letter on 3 January 2013 from the Indian tax authority reminding it of the tax demand raised prior to the 
Supreme Court of India’s judgement and purporting to update the interest element of that demand to a total amount of INR142 billion, which 
amount includes principal and interest as calculated by the Indian tax authority but does not include penalties. 
On 10 January 2014, VIHBV served an amended trigger notice on the Indian Government under the Netherlands-India Bilateral Investment Treaty 
(‘Dutch BIT’), supplementing a trigger notice filed on 17 April 2012, immediately prior to the Finance Act 2012 becoming effective, to add claims 
relating to an attempt by the Indian Government to tax aspects of the transaction with HTIL under transfer pricing rules. A trigger notice announces 
a party’s intention to submit a claim to arbitration and triggers a cooling off period during which both parties may seek to resolve the dispute 
amicably. Notwithstanding their attempts, the parties were unable to amicably resolve the dispute within the cooling off period stipulated in the 
Dutch BIT. On 17 April 2014, VIHBV served its notice of arbitration under the Dutch BIT, formally commencing the Dutch BIT arbitration proceedings. 
In June 2016, the tribunal was fully constituted with Sir Franklin Berman KCMG QC appointed as presiding arbitrator. The Indian Government 
has raised objections to the application of the treaty to VIHBV’s claims and to the jurisdiction of the tribunal under the Dutch BIT. The tribunal 
is considering these jurisdictional objections and has indicated it will determine shortly whether to decide the Indian Government’s objections 
to jurisdiction as a preliminary question.  Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 164
30. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings (continued)
Separately, on 15 June 2015, Vodafone Group Plc and Vodafone Consolidated Holdings Limited served a trigger notice on the Indian Government 
under the United Kingdom-India Bilateral Investment Treaty (‘UK BIT’) in respect of retrospective tax claims under the Income T ax Act 196 1 
(as amended by the Finance Act 2012). Although relating to the same underlying facts as the claim under the Dutch BIT, the claim brought 
by Vodafone Group Plc and Vodafone Consolidated Holdings Limited is a separate and distinct claim under a different treaty. On 24 January 2017 , 
Vodafone Group Plc and Vodafone Consolidated Holdings Limited served a Notice of Arbitration on the Indian Government formally commencing 
the arbitration. The Indian Government has failed to appoint a second arbitrator as required under the UK BIT and has objected to Vodafone’s request 
that the President of the International Court of Justice (as appointing authority under the UK BIT) appoint the second arbitrator to the tribunal. 
The Indian Government has indicated that it considers the arbitration under the UK BIT to be an abuse of process but this is strongly denied 
by Vodafone.
On 12 February 2016, VIHBV received a notice dated 4 February 2016 of an outstanding tax demand of INR221 billion (which included interest 
accruing since the date of the original demand) along with a statement that enforcement action, including against VIHBV’s indirectly held assets 
in India would be taken if the demand was not satisfied. Separate proceedings in the Bombay High Court taken against VIHBV to seek to treat 
it as an agent of HTIL in respect of its alleged tax on the same transaction, as well as penalties of up to 100% of the assessed withholding tax for 
the alleged failure to have withheld such taxes, were listed for hearing at the request of the Indian Government on 21 April 2016 despite the 
issue having been ruled upon by the Supreme Court of India. The hearing has since been periodically listed and then adjourned or not reached 
hearing. VIHBV and Vodafone Group Plc will continue to defend vigorously any allegation that VIHBV or VIL is liable to pay tax in connection with 
the transaction with HTIL and will continue to exercise all rights to seek redress including pursuant to the Dutch BIT and the UK BIT. We have not 
recorded a provision in respect of the retrospective provisions of the Income T ax Act 196 1 (as amended by the Finance Act 201 2) and any tax 
demands based upon such provisions. 
Other Indian tax cases
VIL and Vodafone India Services Private Limited (‘VISPL ’) (formerly 3GSPL) are involved in a number of tax cases with total claims exceeding 
€2.6 billion plus interest, and penalties of up to 300% of the principal.
VISPL tax claims
VISPL has been assessed as owing tax of approximately €301 million (plus interest of €432 million) in respect of (i) a transfer pricing margin charged 
for the international call centre of HTIL prior to the 2007 transaction with Vodafone for HTIL assets in India; (ii) the sale of the international call centre 
by VISPL to HTIL; and (iii) the acquisition of and/or the alleged transfer of options held by VISPL for VIL. The first two of the three heads of tax are 
subject to an indemnity by HTIL. The larger part of the potential claim is not subject to any indemnity. VISPL unsuccessfully challenged the merits 
of the tax demand in the statutory tax tribunal and the jurisdiction of the tax office to make the demand in the High Court. The Tax Appeal Tribunal 
heard the appeal and ruled in the Tax Office’s favour. VISPL lodged an appeal (and stay application) in the Bombay High Court which was concluded 
in early May 2015. On 13 July 2015 the tax authorities issued a revised tax assessment reducing the tax VISPL had previously been assessed as owing 
in respect of (i) and (ii) above. In the meantime, (i) a stay of the tax demand on a deposit of £20 million and (ii) a corporate guarantee by VIHBV for the 
balance of tax assessed remain in place. On 8 October 2015, the Bombay High Court ruled in favour of Vodafone in relation to the options and the 
call centre sale. The Tax Office has appealed to the Supreme Court of India. A hearing has been adjourned until some time in July or August 2017 
with no specified date.
Indian regulatory cases
Litigation remains pending in the Telecommunications Dispute Settlement Appellate Tribunal (‘TDSAT’), High Courts and the Supreme Court of India 
in relation to a number of significant regulatory issues including mobile termination rates (‘MTRs’), spectrum and licence fees, licence extension and 
3G intra-circle roaming (‘ICR’).
Public interest litigation: Yakesh Anand v Union of India, Vodafone and others
The Petitioner brought a special leave petition in the Supreme Court of India on 30 January 2012 against the Government of India and mobile 
network operators, including VIL, seeking recovery of the alleged excess spectrum allocated to the operators, compensation for the alleged excess 
spectrum held in the amount of approximately €4.7 billion and a criminal investigation of an alleged conspiracy between government officials and 
the network operators. A claim with similar allegations was dismissed by the Supreme Court of India in March 2012, with an order that the Petitioner 
should pay a fine for abuse of process. The case is pending before the Supreme Court of India and is expected to be called for hearing at some 
uncertain future date. 
3G inter-circle roaming: Vodafone India and others v Union of India
In April 2013, the Indian Department of Telecommunications (‘DoT’) issued a stoppage notice to VIL ’s operating subsidiaries and other mobile 
operators requiring the immediate stoppage of the provision of 3G services on other operators’ mobile networks in an alleged breach of licence 
claim. The DoT also imposed a fine of approximately €5.5 million. VIL applied to the Delhi High Court for an order quashing the DoT’s notice.
Interim relief from the notice has been granted (but limited to existing customers at the time with the effect that VIL was not able to provide 3G 
services to new customers on other operators’ 3G networks pending a decision on the issue). The dispute was referred to the TDSAT for decision, 
which ruled on 28 April 2014 that VIL and the other operators were permitted to provide 3G services to their customers (current and future) on other 
operators’ networks. The DoT has appealed the judgement and sought a stay of the tribunal’s judgement. The DoT’s stay application was rejected 
by the Supreme Court of India. The matter is pending before the Indian Supreme Court of India. 
One time spectrum charges: VIL v Union of India
The Indian Government has sought to impose one time spectrum charges of approximately €525 million on certain operating subsidiaries of VIL. 
VIL filed a petition before the TDSAT challenging the one time spectrum charges on the basis that they are illegal, violate VIL ’s licence terms and 
are arbitrary, unreasonable and discriminatory. The tribunal stayed enforcement of the Government’s spectrum demand pending resolution of the 
dispute. The matter is due to go for final hearing before the Supreme Court of India, and will be listed in due course.

Other public interest litigation
Three public interest litigations have been initiated in the Supreme Court of India against the Indian Government and private operators on the 
grounds that the grant of additional spectrum beyond 4.4/6.2 MHz has been illegal. The cases seek appropriate investigation and compensation 
for the loss to the exchequer.
Adjusted Gross Revenue (‘AGR’) dispute before the Supreme Court of India: VIL and others v Union of India
VIL has challenged the tribunal’s judgement dated 23 April 2015 to the extent that it dealt with the calculation of AGR, upon which licence fees and 
spectrum usage charges are based. The cumulative impact of the inclusion of these components is approximately Rs. 2,200 Crores (€0.3 billion). 
The DoT also moved cross appeals challenging the tribunal’s judgement. In the hearing before the Supreme Court of India, the Court orally directed 
the DoT not to take any coercive steps in the matter, which was adjourned. On 29 February 2016, the Supreme Court of India ordered that the DoT 
may continue to raise demands for fees and charges, but may not enforce them until a final decision on the matter. 
Other cases in the Group
Patent litigation
Germany
The telecoms industry is currently involved in significant levels of patent litigation brought by non-practising entities (‘NPEs’) which have acquired 
patent portfolios from current and former industry companies. Vodafone is currently a party to patent litigation cases in Germany brought against 
Vodafone Germany by Marthon, IPCom and Intellectual Ventures. Vodafone has contractual indemnities from suppliers which have been invoked 
in relation to the alleged patent infringement liability. 
Spain
Vodafone Group Plc has been sued in Spain by TOT Power Control (‘TOT’), an affiliate of Top Optimized Technologies. The claim makes a number 
of allegations including patent infringement, with TOT seeking over €500 million from Vodafone Group Plc as well as an injunction against using the 
technology in question. Vodafone’s challenge of the appropriateness of Spain as a venue for this dispute has been denied. Vodafone Group Plc will 
appeal the denial. A hearing on TOT’s application for an injunction has taken place, and a decision is expected shortly.
Germany: Mannesmann and Kabel Deutschland takeover – class actions
The German courts are determining the adequacy of the mandatory cash offer made to minority shareholders in Vodafone’s takeover 
of Mannesmann. This matter has been ongoing since 2001. The German courts are also determining whether “squeeze out” compensation 
is payable to affected Mannesmann shareholders in a similar proceeding. In September 2014, the German courts awarded compensation 
to minority shareholders of Mannesmann in the amount of €229.58 per share, which would result in a pay-out of €19 million (plus €13 million 
of accrued interest). The German courts also ruled that the “squeeze out” compensation should amount to €251.31 per share, which would result 
in a pay-out of €43.8 million (plus interest of €23 million of accrued interest). Vodafone has appealed these decisions. Similar proceedings were 
initiated by 80 Kabel Deutschland shareholders. These proceeding are in their early stages, and, accordingly, Vodafone believes that it is too early 
to assess the likely quantum of any claim.
In a hearing dated 6 October 2016, the Court examined the Kabel Deutschland business plan which formed the main basis for the calculation of the 
offer per share. A decision is not expected until summer 2017 .
Italy: British Telecom (Italy) v Vodafone Italy 
The Italian Competition Authority concluded an investigation in 2007 when Vodafone Italy gave certain undertakings in relation to allegations that 
it had abused its dominant position in the wholesale market for mobile termination. In 2010, British Telecom (Italy) brought a civil damages claim 
against Vodafone Italy on the basis of the Competition Authority’s investigation and Vodafone Italy’s undertakings. British Telecom (Italy) seeks 
damages in the amount of €280 million for abuse of dominant position by Vodafone Italy in the wholesale fixed to mobile termination market for 
the period from 1999 to 2007 . A court appointed expert delivered an opinion to the Court that the range of damages in the case should be in the 
region of €10 million to €25 million which was reduced in a further supplementary report published in September 2014 to a range of €8 million 
to €1 1 million. Judgement was handed down by the court in August 2015, awarding €12 million (including interest) to British Telecom (Italy). 
British Telecom (Italy) has appealed the amount of the damages to the Court of Appeal of Milan. In addition, British Telecom (Italy) has asked again 
for a reference to the European Court of Justice for an interpretation of the European community law on antitrust damages. Vodafone Italy has filed 
an appeal and the hearing is scheduled for July 2017 . 
Italy: FASTWEB v Vodafone Italy
The Italian Competition Authority concluded an investigation in 2007 when Vodafone Italy gave certain undertakings in relation to allegations 
it had abused its dominant position in the wholesale market for mobile termination. In 2010, FASTWEB brought a civil damages claim against 
Vodafone Italy on the basis of the Competition Authority’s investigation and Vodafone Italy’s undertakings. FASTWEB sought damages in the 
amount of €360 million for abuse of dominant position by Vodafone Italy in the wholesale fixed to mobile termination market. A court appointed 
expert delivered an opinion to the Court that the range of damages in the case should be in the region of €0.5 million to €2.3 million. On 15 October 
2014, the Court decided to reject FASTWEB’s damages claim in its entirety. FASTWEB appealed the decision and the first appeal hearing took place 
in September 2015. The final hearing took place in September 2016, and on 1 March 2017 the Court rejected FASTWEB’s appeal and confirmed the 
first instance ruling. FASTWEB has until October 2017 to appeal this decision to the Supreme Court.
Italy: Telecom Italia v Vodafone Italy (‘TeleTu’)
Telecom Italia brought civil claims against Vodafone Italy in relation to TeleTu’s alleged anti-competitive retention of customers. Telecom Italia 
seeks damages in the amount of €101 million. The Court decided on 9 June 2015 to appoint an expert to verify whether TeleTu has put in place 
anticompetitive retention activities. The expert has prepared a draft report with a range of damages from €nil–5.6 million. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 166
30. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings (continued)
Greece: Papistas Holdings SA, Mobile Trade Stores (formerly Papistas SA) and Athanasios and Loukia Papistas v Vodafone Greece, Vodafone Group 
Plc and certain Directors and Officers of Vodafone
In December 2013, Mr. and Mrs. Papistas, and companies owned or controlled by them, brought three claims in the Greek court in Athens against 
Vodafone Greece, Vodafone Group Plc and certain Directors and officers of Vodafone Greece and Vodafone Group Plc for purported damage caused 
by the alleged abuse of dominance and wrongful termination of a franchise arrangement with a Papistas company. Approximately €1.0 billion of the 
claim is directed exclusively at one former and one current Director of Vodafone Greece. The balance of the claim (approximately €285.5 million) 
is sought from Vodafone Greece and Vodafone Group Plc on a joint and several basis. Both cases have been adjourned until September 2018, 
but it is possible that Papistas may re-file his claim under the new Greek civil procedure regime (which aims to hear trials within one year).
Netherlands: Consumer credit/handset case
In February 2016, the Dutch Supreme Court ruled on the Dutch implementation of the EU Consumer Credit Directive and “instalment sales 
agreements” (a Dutch law concept), holding that bundled “all-in” mobile subscription agreements (i.e. device along with mobile services) 
are considered consumer credit agreements. As a result, Vodafone Netherlands, together with the industry, has been working with the Ministry 
of Finance and the Competition Authority on compliance requirements going forward for such offers. The ruling also has retrospective effect. 
A number of small claims have been submitted by individual customers in the small claims courts. 
South Africa: GH Investments (‘GHI’) v Vodacom Congo
Vodacom Congo contracted with GHI to install ultra-low cost base stations on a revenue share basis. After rolling out three sites, GHI stopped 
and sought to renegotiate the terms. Vodacom Congo refused. GHI accused it of bad faith and infringement of intellectual property rights. In April 
2015, GHI issued a formal notice for a claim of US$1.16 billion, although there does not seem to be a proper basis nor any substantiation for the 
compensation claimed. The dispute was submitted to mediation under the International Chamber of Commerce. A mediator was appointed 
in September 2015 who convened a first meeting which took place in early November 2015. A follow-up mediation meeting was scheduled for 
December 2015 but was postponed without a new date having been fixed. In July 2016, Vodacom filed a request for arbitration with the International 
Chamber of Commerce’s International Court of Arbitration. In their response GHI revised their claim down to €237 million. Each party has appointed 
an arbitrator and the arbitrators have appointed a third arbitrator to act as chairman of the tribunal.
South Africa: Makate v Vodacom (Proprietary) Limited (‘Vodacom’)
In 2008, Mr. Makate instituted legal proceedings to claim compensation for a business idea that led to a product known as “Please Call Me”. On 1 July 
2014, the South Gauteng High Court, Johannesburg (‘the High Court’) found that Mr. Makate had proven the existence of a contract. However, 
the High Court ruled that Vodacom was not bound by that contract because the responsible director of product development and services did not 
have authority to enter into any such agreement on Vodacom’s behalf. The High Court also rejected Mr. Makate’s claim on the basis that it had lapsed 
in terms of the Prescription Act 68 of 1969.
The High Court and Supreme Court of Appeal turned down Mr. Makate’s application for leave to appeal on 1 1 December 2014 and 2 March 2015, 
respectively. Mr. Makate applied for leave to appeal in the Constitutional Court. On 26 April 2016, after having heard the application on 1 September 
2015, the Constitutional Court granted leave to appeal and upheld Mr. Makate’s appeal. In doing so, the Constitutional Court ordered that:
(i)  Vodacom is bound by the agreement concluded between Mr. Makate and the then director of product development and services;
(ii)  Vodacom is to commence negotiations in good faith with Mr. Makate to determine reasonable compensation; and
(iii)  in the event of the parties failing to agree on the reasonable compensation, the matter must be submitted to Vodacom’s Chief Executive Officer 
for determination of the amount within a reasonable time.
Mr. Makate failed to obtain from the Constitutional Court a second order that compensation be based on revenue rather than fees for his 
contribution. Negotiations between Vodacom and Mr. Makate continue in accordance with the first order of the Constitutional Court.

32. Subsequent events
On 15 May 2017 , the Group announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Vodafone International Holdings B.V. (‘VIHBV’), has agreed to transfer 
part of its indirect shareholding in Safaricom Limited (‘Safaricom’) to Vodacom Group Limited (‘Vodacom’), its sub-Saharan African subsidiary. 
Based on the agreed terms of the transaction, VIHBV will be exchanging a 35% indirect interest in Safaricom for 226.8 million new ordinary Vodacom 
shares. The transaction, which has a value of €2,361 million based on Vodacom’s closing share price on Friday 12 May 2017 , will increase the 
Group’s ownership in Vodacom from 65% to 70%. VIHBV will continue to hold a 5% indirect interest in Safaricom following the transfer, in addition 
to the interest held through Vodacom. 
Completion of the transaction is subject to a number of conditions, including approvals from Vodacom minority shareholders, approval from 
the Financial Surveillance Department of the South African Reserve Bank and confirmation from the Kenya Capital Markets Authority that the 
transaction does not trigger an obligation for Vodacom to make a mandatory bid for Safaricom.
The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of the 201 7 calendar year and is not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s free 
cash flow or earnings. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 168

A full list of subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associated undertakings (as defined in the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008) as at 31 March 2017 is detailed below. No subsidiaries are excluded from the Group consolidation. 
Unless otherwise stated the Company’s subsidiaries all have share capital consisting solely of ordinary shares and are indirectly held. The percentage 
held by Group companies reflect both the proportion of nominal capital and voting rights unless otherwise stated.
Subsidiaries
Accounting policies
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Company. Control is achieved where the Company has existing rights that give it the current ability 
to direct the activities that affect the Company’s returns and exposure or rights to variable returns from the entity. The results of subsidiaries acquired 
or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date 
of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into 
line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Non-controlling 
interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling shareholder’s share 
of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results 
in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

Notes:
1 With effect from 1 April 2016, the Group’s presentation currency was changed from pounds sterling to the euro to better align with the geographic split of the Group’s operations. The results 
for the year ended 31 March 2016 have been restated into euros and include the results of Vodafone India as discontinued operations following the agreement to combine it with Idea Cellular. 
Group revenue and service revenue includes the results of Europe, AMAP , Other (which includes the results of partner markets) and eliminations. 2016 results reflect average foreign exchange 
rates of €1:£0.73, €1:INR72.3, €1:ZAR15.21, €1:TKL3.14 and €1: EGP8.66.
2 Alternative performance measures are non-GAAP measures that are presented to provide readers with additional financial information that is regularly reviewed by management and should not 
be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to the equivalent GAAP measure. See “Alternative performance measures” on page 205 for reconciliations to the closest respective equivalent GAAP 
measure and “Definition of terms” on page 218 for further details. 
3 The “Other” segment primarily represents the results of the partner markets and the net result of unallocated central Group costs.
Revenue
Group revenue increased 2.9% to €49.8 billion and service revenue 
increased 2.3% to €44.6 billion. Reported growth includes the full 
year impact from the acquisitions of Hellas Online (‘HOL ’) and Cobra 
Automotive (‘Cobra’) in the prior year.
In Europe, organic service revenue declined 0.6%* reflecting continued 
competitive pressures in a number of markets, with improving trends 
throughout the year.
In AMAP , organic service revenue increased by 8.0%* continuing its 
sustained track record of strong organic growth.
Adjusted EBITDA
Group adjusted EBITDA increased 3.3% to €14.2 billion driven by organic 
growth in Europe and AMAP and the positive impact of the acquisitions 
of HOL and Cobra and foreign exchange movements. 
On an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA rose 2.3%* and the 
Group’s adjusted EBITDA margin stabilised at 28.4%.
Operating profit
Adjusted operating profit excludes certain income and expenses that 
we have identified separately to allow their effect on the results of the 
Group to be assessed (see page 205). The items that are included 
in operating profit but are excluded from adjusted operating profit are 
discussed below.
An impairment loss of €569 million was recognised in the 2016 
financial year (2015: €nil). Further detail is provided in note 4 to the 
Group’s consolidated financial statements. Restructuring costs 
of €316 million (2015: €204 million) have been incurred to improve 
future business performance and reduce costs.
Amortisation of intangible assets in relation to customer bases and 
brands are recognised under accounting rules after we acquire 
businesses and decreased to €1,338 million (2015: €1,617 million) 
due to the acquisition of Ono. 
Including the above items, operating profit decreased by €0.8 billion 
to €1.3 billion as the €0.6 billion impairment charge, €0.5 billion higher 
depreciation and amortisation charges and €0.1 billion increase 
in restructuring costs were partly offset by a €0.4 billion increase 
in adjusted EBITDA.
Note:
* All amounts in the Operating Results section marked with an “*” represent organic growth 
which presents performance on a comparable basis, both in terms of merger and acquisition 
activity and movements in foreign exchange rates. Organic growth is an alternative 
performance measure. See “Alternative performance measures” on page 205 for further 
details and reconciliations to the respective closest equivalent GAAP measure. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 178

Service revenue declined 0.4%* for the year, but returned to growth 
in Q4 (Q3: -0.4%*; Q4: 1.6%*) led by improvements in consumer mobile 
and fixed trends and aided by an accounting reclassification in fixed. 
Mobile service revenue declined 1.6%*. Consumer contract revenue 
stabilised in the year, supported by consistent growth in contract net 
additions (+594,000 for the year). This performance has been driven 
by an increased focus on direct channels and our “Otelo” second brand; 
during Q4, higher competition in indirect channels weighed on our 
contract net additions. The Enterprise market became increasingly 
competitive during the year, leading to a deteriorating revenue trend 
as falling ARPU more than offset good contract wins. We have made 
further strong progress on network investment, with 87% 4G coverage 
and dropped call rates declining 25% year-on-year to an all-time low 
of 0.44%. In November, the independent “Connect” test confirmed the 
premium quality of our voice network in Germany and a strong second 
and most improved data position.
Fixed service revenue growth was 1.5%*, with continued strong growth 
in cable and a slowing decline in DSL -related revenue. Cable net adds 
growth continued to be strong throughout the year, supplemented 
by ongoing migrations from the DSL base; in the second half of the year 
DSL net additions also turned positive, with growing customer demand 
for VDSL. Broadband ARPU was down year-on-year in a promotional 
market, with improvements in cable offset by DSL declines, although 
the pace of decline began to moderate during H2. The integration 
of KDG has been completed; we expect cost synergies to meet the initial 
targets set out at the time of acquisition, and now expect further upside 
potential longer-term. In November, we launched Vodafone Red One, 
our fully integrated fixed, mobile and TV service combining high speed 
mobile and fixed; as of 31 March 2016 we had 54,000 customers. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew 2.1%*, with adjusted EBITDA margin improving 
by 0.8* percentage points. The impact of lower revenues and 
increased Project Spring network opex was more than offset by opex 
efficiencies (including KDG synergies), savings in commercial costs 
(aided by our increased focus on direct channels) and a change 
in commission processes. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 179

Italy
Service revenue declined 0.8%* for the year, but returned to growth 
in Q4 (Q3: -0.3%*; Q4: 1.3%*), aided by the leap-year benefit. 
The mobile business is on a steady recovery path, while fixed 
performance continues to be positive despite increased competition 
in recent months.
Mobile service revenue declined 1.1%*, as a recovery in ARPU supported 
by prepaid price increases only partially offset the year-on-year decline 
in the customer base. Mobile number portability in the market has 
reduced in recent quarters and the customer base decline stabilised 
during the year, aided by market-leading NPS scores in mobile following 
our Project Spring investments. Consumer trends improved faster 
than Enterprise, where competitive intensity has increased in H2. 
As of 31 March 2016 we have 95% population coverage on our 4G 
network and 6.5 million 4G customers (September 2015: 4.0 million).
Fixed service revenue was up 1.2%*, driven by sustained commercial 
momentum. We added 168,000 broadband customers during the year, 
a strong performance, and in Q4 50% of our gross adds have taken 
a fibre-based service. Of our base of 2.0 million broadband customers, 
297 ,000 are fibre customers. We have now built out our own fibre 
network to over 16,000 cabinets, enabling us to reach 3.6 million 
households. Our high speed broadband roll-out in Italy will be enhanced 
by our commercial agreement with Enel, which plans to roll out 
Fibre-To-The-Home (‘FTTH’) to 224 cities nationwide, providing access 
on competitive commercial terms. In these areas Enel will be our 
exclusive fibre partner going forward.
Adjusted EBITDA was up 3.1%*, as we successfully offset the decline 
in service revenue with savings in commercial costs and operating 
expenses. The adjusted EBITDA margin was stable year-on-year due 
principally to higher handset revenues.
UK
Service revenue declined 0.3%* for the year (Q3: -0.7%*; Q4: -0.1%*), 
with improving trends in fixed offset by a slowdown in mobile, reflecting 
operational challenges following a billing system migration. Q4 growth 
benefited from strong carrier services activity; excluding this, underlying 
trends were stable. The organic growth rate for the year excludes one-
off settlements with other network operators in Q2.
Mobile service revenue declined 0.7%*. Contract customer growth 
slowed in Q4, impacted partly by higher churn in relation to the 
billing system migration. Revenue trends were also impacted by the 
pricing and usage of 08XX numbers following the introduction 
of Non-Geographic Call Services regulation, and a focus on giving 
customers more control of their out-of-bundle data spend. As a result, 
in-bundle revenue and demand for data add-ons continued to grow. 
Enterprise mobile trends remained relatively stable despite increased 
competition. National 4G coverage reached 91% (based on the OFCOM 
definition), and 99.5% in London; based on our estimations, 4G coverage 
was 84%, and despite some delays the pace of 4G coverage expansion 
in conjunction with our network sharing partner is now accelerating. 
We achieved significant growth in 4G customers, with 7 .0 million at the 
period end (September 2015: 5.3 million).
Fixed service revenue grew 1.1%*. Excluding carrier services, fixed 
service revenue grew 2.4%* in the second half of the year including 
an improving performance in Enterprise. After regional trials during 
the summer, we began to offer our consumer broadband service 
to 24 million premises across the UK (98% of BT’s fibre footprint) 
in October, securing 38,000 customers by 31 March 2016. Our new 
TV service is in field trials with plans to launch later in the current 
calendar year.
Adjusted EBITDA grew 1.2%*, with a 0.2* percentage point increase 
in the adjusted EBITDA margin driven by continued operational 
efficiencies. Reported adjusted EBITDA benefited from one-off 
settlements with other network operators in the first half of the year.
Spain 
Service revenue declined 3.5%* (Q3: -3.1%*; Q4: -3.2%*), with 
mobile revenue recovering steadily despite the negative effect 
of handset financing, and continued positive momentum in fixed. 
Excluding handset financing effects, service revenues declined 
by 0.3%* in the year.
Mobile service revenue fell 8.0%*. The contract customer base 
continued to grow in a more stable market, despite increased 
promotional activity around the start of the new football season. We are 
seeing signs that ARPU is beginning to stabilise, aided by our market-
leading NPS scores in mobile and our “more-for-more” pricing strategy, 
in which customers receive higher data allowances and additional 
features (e.g. free European roaming) together with an increase in the 
monthly tariff. Our 4G population coverage reached 91% at 31 March 
2016 and we have 5.4 million 4G customers.
Fixed service revenue rose 7 .8%*, supported by consistent growth 
in broadband net additions. The integration of Ono has proceeded 
successfully and we have already achieved 100% of the original 
€240 million of cost and capex synergies targeted. We now expect 
to be able to deliver €300 million of annualised run-rate savings 
over the original timeframe. In part this reflects the very successful 
launch in May of Vodafone One, our fully integrated cable, mobile 
and TV service, which has already reached 1.5 million customers. 
Including our joint fibre network build with Orange, we now reach 
8.5 million premises with cable or fibre. Our recent agreement 
with Mediapro together with the wholesale obligations imposed 
on the incumbent provide us with access to a full range of premium 
TV channels for the coming years, albeit at an increased cost.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.2%* year-on-year with a 1.3* percentage 
point increase in the adjusted EBITDA margin, as strong cost control, 
the benefit to margin from handset financing and the cost synergies 
from the Ono acquisition more than offset rising TV costs.
Other Europe
Service revenue rose 1.5%* (Q3: 1.6%*; Q4: 2.1%*), with all markets 
except Greece achieving growth during the year. In Q4, Romania (7 .7%*), 
Portugal (3.5%*) and the Czech Republic enjoyed an improvement 
in top-line growth.
In the Netherlands, service revenue increased 0.3%*, with growth 
moving into decline during H2 (Q3: 0.2%*; Q4: -1.3%*) as continued 
gains in fixed (partly aided by a Q4 accounting reclassification) 
were offset by a decline in mobile contract ARPU. 
In Portugal, fixed service revenue continues to grow strongly and 
mobile is recovering as ARPU and churn pressure from the shift towards 
convergent pricing begins to moderate. Our FTTH network now reaches 
2.4 million homes. Ireland returned to service revenue growth in Q2, 
with strong momentum in fixed and an improving trend in mobile. 
The initial 4G roll-out is complete with 95% population coverage. 
In Greece macroeconomic conditions remained a drag, however 
good cost control led to improved margins. The integration of HOL 
is progressing according to plan.
Adjusted EBITDA declined 1.5%*, with a 1.0* percentage point decline 
in adjusted EBITDA margin, mainly driven by lower margins in Portugal 
and Romania. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 180

Vodacom
Vodacom Group service revenue increased 5.4%* (Q3: 7 .2%*; Q4: 6.3%*), 
supported by strong momentum in both South Africa and the 
International operations.
In South Africa, organic service revenue grew 4.7%* (Q3: 7 .2%*; 
Q4: 6.5%*), with the consumer and enterprise businesses both 
performing well. We continued to focus on building brand and network 
differentiation, with our performance driven by strong demand for data. 
We further enhanced our leading network position, more than doubling 
our LTE/ 4G sites to over 6,000, taking coverage to 58.2% on LTE/ 4G 
and 98.9% on 3G. Data revenue growth remained strong at 18.8%* 
in Q4 and data is now 36.3% of local service revenue. Our pricing 
transformation strategy is making good progress, with 85% of contract 
customers now on integrated price plans and churn falling to our lowest 
levels at 6.9% in Q4. Total bundle sales reached 1.1 billion, supported 
by our “Just 4 U” personalised offers.
Service revenue growth in Vodacom’s International operations outside 
South Africa was 10.0%*, driven by increased voice revenue as a result 
of pricing strategies and bundle offerings, data take-up and M-Pesa. 
Active data customers reached 10.1 million, 37% of total customers, 
and active M-Pesa customers totalled 6.8 million in Q4, all benefiting 
from sustained network investment.
Vodacom Group adjusted EBITDA increased 12.7%*, significantly 
faster than revenues, with a 3.6* percentage point improvement 
in adjusted EBITDA margin. This strong performance partly reflected 
a change in accounting for certain transactions in the indirect channel, 
which depressed equipment sales and total revenues with no impact 
on adjusted EBITDA. Excluding this effect, adjusted EBITDA margins 
rose driven by operating leverage, tight cost control and a tailwind from 
foreign exchange gains. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 181

Other AMAP
Service revenue increased 10.1%* (Q3: 10.8%*; Q4: 12.1%*), with strong 
growth in Turkey, Egypt and Ghana partially offset by a decline in Qatar. 
Service revenue in Turkey was up 19.7%*, reflecting continued strong 
growth in consumer contract and Enterprise revenue, and we launched 
4G services in April 2016. Fixed momentum was strong, almost 
quadrupling the fixed broadband customer base to 363,000 at the end 
of the period. 
In Egypt, service revenue was up 8.9%* driven by continued strong 
growth in data. 
New Zealand returned to modest growth, with solid mobile contract 
customer trends and improving fixed ARPU.
Adjusted EBITDA grew 4.5%*, with a 2.1* percentage point contraction 
in adjusted EBITDA margin. A strong revenue performance and 
improved margins in Turkey were partly offset by higher costs for 
imported goods post foreign exchange rate devaluations across 
the region.
Associates and joint ventures
Indus Towers, the Indian towers company in which Vodafone has a 42% 
interest, achieved local currency revenue growth of 5.8%. Indus Towers 
owned 1 19,881 towers as at 31 March 2016, with a tenancy ratio of 2.25. 
Indus Towers’ contribution to the Group’s adjusted operating profit was 
€101 million. 
Safaricom, Vodafone’s 40% associate which is the leading mobile 
operator in Kenya, saw local currency service revenue growth of 13.8% 
for the year, with local currency adjusted EBITDA up 16.8%, driven 
by an increase in the customer base leading to growth across all 
revenue streams, predominantly mobile data and M-Pesa. 4G coverage 
is now in 20 out of 47 counties.
Vodafone Hutchison Australia (‘VHA’), in which Vodafone owns a 50% 
stake, is performing solidly in an intensely competitive environment, 
with service revenues (excluding MTR impact) returning to growth after 
five years in decline. Adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by an increase 
in revenue and improved cost management.

by a number of regulatory changes, including MTR cuts, roaming price 
caps and an increase in service tax. Excluding these impacts, service 
revenue growth was 10.0%*. Q4 growth recovered versus Q3 as voice 
price competition moderated during the quarter and regulatory impacts 
began to reduce in March.
We added 14.1 million customers during the year, taking the total 
to 197 .9 million. Growth in total minutes of use continued, but this was 
offset by a decline in average revenue per minute as a result of ongoing 
competition on voice business.
Data growth continues to be very strong, with data usage over the 
network up 64% year-on-year, and the active data customer base 
increasing by 3.8 million to 67 .5 million. The 3G customer base grew 
to 27 .4 million, up 41.4% year-on-year, and smartphone penetration 
in our four biggest urban areas is now 52.8%. In Q4, browsing revenue 
represented 19.2% of local service revenue, up from 14.9% in the 
equivalent quarter last year.
Since the launch of Project Spring we have added over 37 ,700 new 3G 
sites, taking the total to 55,500 and our population coverage to 95% 
of target urban areas. We have launched 4G in five key circles and plan 
to expand to cover over 60% of our data revenues in the coming year, 
ahead of the upcoming spectrum auction.
Our M-Pesa business continues to expand, with 1.3 million active 
customers at March 2016, and approximately 120,000 agents. In August, 
the Reserve Bank of India granted us “in principle” approval to set 
up a payments bank.
Adjusted EBITDA grew 4.1%*, with a 0.2* percentage point deterioration 
in adjusted EBITDA margin as the benefits of service revenue growth 
were offset by the ongoing increase in operating costs related to Project 
Spring, higher acquisition costs and the translation effects of non-rupee 
operating costs. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 182

Notes to the Company financial statements
1. Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company are drawn up in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and Financial Reporting Standard 101 
“Reduced disclosure framework”, (‘FRS 101’). The Company will continue to prepare its financial statements in accordance with FRS 101 
on an ongoing basis until such time as it notifies shareholders of any change to its chosen accounting framework. 
The Company financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial 
assets and financial liabilities and in accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared on a going 
concern basis. With effect from 1 April 2016 the functional currency of the Company was changed from pounds sterling to the euro and applied 
prospectively from the date of change, as this is now the primary currency in which the Company’s financing activities and investments returns are 
denominated. As a result of the change in functional currency, the Company has chosen to change its presentation currency which is accounted for 
retrospectively. Prior periods, including the amounts presented for the years ended 31 March 2016 have been restated into euros using closing rates 
at the relevant balance sheet date for assets, liabilities, share capital, share premium and other capital reserves and the income statement has been 
restated at the average rate for the comparative year or the spot rate for significant transactions.
The following exemptions available under FRS 101 have been applied:
 – Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2, “Shared-based payment” (details of the number and weighted-average exercise prices of share options, 
and how the fair value of goods or services received was determined);
 – IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures”;
 – Paragraph 91 to 99 of IFRS 13, “Fair value measurement” (disclosure of valuation techniques and inputs used for fair value measurement of assets 
and liabilities);
 – Paragraph 38 of IAS 1 “Presentation of financial statements” comparative information requirements in respect of paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1;
 – The following paragraphs of IAS 1 “Presentation of financial statements”:
 – 10(d) (statement of cash flows);
 – 16 (statement of compliance with all IFRS);
 – 38A (requirement for minimum of two primary statements, including cash flow statements);
 – 38B-D (additional comparative information);
 – 40A-D (requirements for a third statement of financial position);
 – 1 1 1 (cash flow statement information); and
 – 134-136 (capital management disclosures).
 – IAS 7 “Statement of cash flows”;
 – Paragraph 30 and 31 of IAS 8 “Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors” (requirement for the disclosure of information 
when an entity has not applied a new IFRS that has been issued but is not yet effective); and 
 – The requirements in IAS 24 “Related party disclosures” to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members 
of a group.
As permitted by section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, the income statement of the Company is not presented in this Annual Report. 
These separate financial statements are not intended to give a true and fair view of the profit or loss or cash flows of the Company. The Company 
has not published its individual cash flow statement as its liquidity, solvency and financial adaptability are dependent on the Group rather than its 
own cash flows. 
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of Company financial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Company financial statements and 
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates and 
underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate 
is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future 
periods. The key area of judgement that has the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is the review for 
impairment of investment carrying values. 
Significant accounting policies applied in the current reporting period that relate to the financial statements as a whole 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional rate of currency prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the Company’s functional currency at the rates prevailing on the reporting 
period date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the 
initial transaction dates. Non-monetary items measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences 
arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the income statement for the period. 
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the income statement for the period. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 185
Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financials Additional information
Borrowing costs
All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences that exist at the reporting period date and that result in an obligation to pay more tax, 
or a right to pay less tax in the future. The deferred tax is measured at the rate expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are 
expected to reverse, based on the tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting period date. Timing differences arise 
from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the 
Company financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities, in respect of financial instruments, are recognised on the Company statement of financial position when the 
Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual 
interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets. 
The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Company’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates which it manages using derivative 
financial instruments.
The use of derivative financial instruments is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written 
principles on the use of derivative financial instruments consistent with the Group’s risk management strategy. Changes in values of all derivative 
financial instruments are included within the income statement unless designated in an effective cash flow hedge relationship when changes 
in value are deferred to other comprehensive income or equity respectively. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for 
speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each 
reporting date. The Company designates certain derivatives as hedges of the change of fair value of recognised assets and liabilities (‘fair value 
hedges’) or hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency or interest rate risks of firm commitments (‘cash flow 
hedges’). Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting or the Company chooses to end the hedging relationship.
Fair value hedges
The Company’s policy is to use derivative financial instruments (primarily interest rate swaps) to convert a proportion of its fixed rate debt to floating 
rates in order to hedge the interest rate risk arising, principally, from capital market borrowings. The Company designates these as fair value hedges 
of interest rate risk with changes in fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in the income statement for the period together with the 
changes in the fair value of the hedged item due to the hedged risk, to the extent the hedge is effective. Gains and losses relating to any ineffective 
portion are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Cash flow hedges
Cash flow hedging is used by the Company to hedge certain exposures to variability in future cash flows. The portion of gains or losses relating 
to changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as effective cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income; 
gains or losses relating to any ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement. However, when the hedged transaction 
results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-
financial liability. When the hedged item is recognised in the income statement, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income 
and accumulated in equity for the hedging instrument are reclassified to the income statement. When hedge accounting is discontinued, any gain 
or loss recognised in other comprehensive income at that time remains in equity and is recognised in the income statement when the hedged 
transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated 
in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Pensions
The Company is the sponsoring employer of the Vodafone Group pension scheme, a defined benefit pension scheme. There is insufficient 
information available to enable the scheme to be accounted for as a defined benefit scheme because the Company is unable to identify its share 
of the underlying assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis. Therefore, the Company has applied the guidance within IAS 19 
to account for defined benefit schemes as if they were defined contribution schemes and recognise only the contribution payable each year. 
The Company had no contributions payable for the years ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016.
New accounting pronouncements
T o the extent applicable the Company will adopt new accounting policies as set out in note 1 “Basis for preparation” in the consolidated 
financial statements. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 186
Notes to the Company financial statements (continued)
2. Fixed assets
Accounting policies
Shares in Group undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment and capital related to share-based payments. Contributions 
in respect of share-based payments are recognised in line with the policy set out in note 7 .
The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment 
may not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. If the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the value of the investment, the investment is considered to be impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.

7 . Share-based payments
Accounting policies
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment plans for the employees of subsidiaries using the Company’s equity 
instruments. The fair value of the compensation given in respect of these share-based payment plans is recognised as a capital contribution to the 
Company’s subsidiaries over the vesting period. The capital contribution is reduced by any payments received from subsidiaries in respect of these 
share-based payments.
The Company currently uses a number of equity-settled share plans to grant options and shares to the Directors and employees of its subsidiaries.
At 31 March 2017 , the Company had 41 million ordinary share options outstanding (2016: 24 million) and no ADS options outstanding (2016: nil).
The Company has made capital contributions to its subsidiaries in relation to share-based payments. At 31 March 2017 , the cumulative capital 
contribution net of payments received from subsidiaries was €53 million (2016: €91 million). During the year ended 31 March 2017 , the total capital 
contribution arising from share-based payments was €1 12 million (2016: €161 million), with payments of €150 million (2016: €131 million) received 
from subsidiaries. 
Full details of share-based payments, share option schemes and share plans are disclosed in note 27 “Share-based payments” to the consolidated 
financial statements.
8. Reserves
The Board is responsible for the Group’s capital management including the approval of dividends. This includes an assessment of both the level 
of reserves legally available for distribution and consideration as to whether the Company would be solvent and retain sufficient liquidity following 
any proposed distribution.
As Vodafone Group Plc is a Group holding company with no direct operations, its ability to make shareholder distributions is dependent on its ability 
to receive funds for such purposes from its subsidiaries in a manner which creates profits available for distribution for the Company. The major 
factors that impact the ability of the Company to access profits held in subsidiary companies at an appropriate level to fulfil its needs for distributable 
reserves on an ongoing basis include:
 – the absolute size of the profit pools either currently available for distribution or capable of realisation into distributable reserves in the 
relevant entities;
 – the location of these entities in the Group’s corporate structure;
 – profit and cash flow generation in those entities; and
 – the risk of adverse changes in business valuations giving rise to investment impairment charges, reducing profits available for distribution.
The Group’s consolidated reserves set out on page 101 do not reflect the profits available for distribution in the Group. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 189

Dividends
See pages 42 and 125 for details on dividend amount per share. 
Payment of dividends by direct credit 
We pay cash dividends directly to shareholders’ bank or building society 
accounts. This ensures secure delivery and means dividend payments 
are credited to shareholders’ bank or building society accounts 
on the same day as payment. A dividend confirmation covering 
both the interim and final dividends paid during the financial year 
is sent to shareholders at the time of the interim dividend in February. 
ADS holders may alternatively have their cash dividends paid by cheque.
Euro dividends 
Dividends are now declared in euros and paid in euros and pounds 
sterling according to where the shareholder is resident. Cash dividends 
to ADS holders are paid by the ADS depositary in US dollars. This aligns 
the Group’s shareholder returns with the primary currency in which 
we generate free cash flow. The foreign exchange rate at which 
dividends declared in euros are converted into pounds sterling and 
US dollars is calculated based on the average exchange rate of the five 
business days during the week prior to the payment of the dividend. 
See vodafone.com/ dividends for further information about dividend 
payments or, alternatively, please contact our registrar or the ADS 
depositary, as applicable. See page 191 for their contact information.
Dividend reinvestment plan 
We offer a dividend reinvestment plan which allows holders of ordinary 
shares who choose to participate to use their cash dividends to acquire 
additional shares in the Company. These are purchased on their behalf 
by the plan administrator through a low cost dealing arrangement. 
For ADS holders, Deutsche Bank, through its transfer agent, American 
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (AST) maintains a DB Global Direct 
Investor Services Program which is a direct purchase and sale plan for 
depositary receipts with a dividend reinvestment facility. 
Taxation of dividends 
See pages 194 to 196 for details on dividend taxation. 
Managing your shares via Investor Centre 
Computershare operates a portfolio service for investors in ordinary 
shares, called Investor Centre. This provides our shareholders with 
online access to information about their investments as well as a facility 
to help manage their holdings online, such as being able to:
 – update dividend mandate bank instructions and review dividend 
payment history;
 – update member details and address changes; and
 – register to receive Company communications electronically.
Computershare also offers an internet and telephone share dealing 
service to existing shareholders.

any queries regarding their holding should contact Computershare. 
See page 191 for their contact details.
Shareholders may also find the investors section of our corporate 
website, vodafone.com/investor, useful for general queries and 
information about the Company.
Shareholder communications 
A growing number of our shareholders have opted to receive their 
communications from us electronically using email and web-based 
communications. The use of electronic communications, rather 
than printed paper documents, means information about the 
Company can be received as soon as it is available and has the 
added benefit of reducing costs and our impact on the environment. 
Each time we issue a shareholder communication, shareholders who 
have elected for electronic communication will be sent an email alert 
containing a link to the relevant documents.
We encourage all our shareholders to sign up for this service 
by providing us with an email address. You can register your email 
address via our registrar at investorcentre.co.uk or contact them via the 
telephone number provided on page 191. See vodafone.com/investor

Warning to shareholders (“boiler room” scams) 
Over recent years we have become aware of investors who have 
received unsolicited calls or correspondence, in some cases 
purporting to have been issued by us, concerning investment matters. 
These callers typically make claims of highly profitable opportunities 
in UK or US investments which turn out to be worthless or simply do not 
exist. These approaches are usually made by unauthorised companies 
and individuals and are commonly known as “boiler room” scams. 
Investors are advised to be wary of any unsolicited advice or offers 
to buy shares. If it sounds too good to be true, it often is.
See the FCA website at fca.org.uk/scamsmart for more detailed 
information about this or similar activities.

Articles of Association and applicable 
English law
The following description summarises certain provisions 
of the Company’s Articles of Association and applicable English 
law. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 
Companies Act 2006 of England and Wales and the Company’s Articles 
of Association. See “Documents on display” on page 194 for information 
on where copies of the Articles of Association can be obtained. 
The Company is a public limited company under the laws of England 
and Wales. The Company is registered in England and Wales under the 
name Vodafone Group Public Limited Company with the registration 
number 1833679. 
All of the Company’s ordinary shares are fully paid. Accordingly, 
no further contribution of capital may be required by the Company 
from the holders of such shares. 
English law specifies that any alteration to the Articles of Association 
must be approved by a special resolution of the shareholders.
Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association do not specifically restrict the 
objects of the Company.
Directors 
The Directors are empowered under the Articles of Association 
to exercise all the powers of the Company subject to any restrictions 
in the Articles of Association, the Companies Act (as defined in the 
Articles of Association) and any special resolution.
Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 192
Shareholder information (continued) 
Unaudited information Under the Company’s Articles of Association a Director cannot 
vote in respect of any proposal in which the Director, or any person 
connected with the Director, has a material interest other than 
by virtue of the Director’s interest in the Company’s shares or other 
securities. However, this restriction on voting does not apply in certain 
circumstances set out in the Articles of Association.
The Directors are empowered to exercise all the powers of the Company 
to borrow money, subject to the limitation that the aggregate amount 
of all liabilities and obligations of the Group outstanding at any time 
shall not exceed an amount equal to 1.5 times the aggregate of the 
Group’s share capital and reserves calculated in the manner prescribed 
in the Articles of Association unless sanctioned by an ordinary 
resolution of the Company’s shareholders.
The Company can make market purchases of its own shares or agree 
to do so in the future provided it is duly authorised by its members 
in a general meeting and subject to and in accordance with section 
701 of the Companies Act 2006. Such authority was given at the 2016 
annual general meeting but no purchases were made during this 
financial year.
At each annual general meeting all Directors who were elected 
or last re-elected at or before the annual general meeting held in the 
third calendar year before the current year shall automatically retire. 
However, the Board has decided in the interests of good corporate 
governance that all of the Directors wishing to continue in office 
should offer themselves for re -election annually.
Directors are not required under the Company’s Articles 
of Association to hold any shares of the Company as a qualification 
to act as a Director, although the Executive Directors are required 
to under the Company’s remuneration policy. Further details are 
set out on pages 67 to 85. 
Rights attaching to the Company’s shares 
At 31 March 2017 the issued share capital of the Company was 
comprised of 50,000 7% cumulative fixed rate shares of £1.00 each 
and 26,622,078,509 ordinary shares (excluding treasury shares) 
of 20
20
⁄21 US cents each. As at 31 March 2017 , 2,192,064,339 ordinary 
shares were held in Treasury.
Dividend rights 
Holders of 7% cumulative fixed rate shares are entitled to be paid 
in respect of each financial year, or other accounting period of the 
Company, a fixed cumulative preferential dividend of 7% per annum 
on the nominal value of the fixed rate shares. A fixed cumulative 
preferential dividend may only be paid out of available distributable 
profits which the Directors have resolved should be distributed. 
The fixed rate shares do not have any other right to share in the 
Company’s profits.
Holders of the Company’s ordinary shares may, by ordinary resolution, 
declare dividends but may not declare dividends in excess of the 
amount recommended by the Directors. The Board of Directors may 
also pay interim dividends. No dividend may be paid other than out 
of profits available for distribution. Dividends on ordinary shares can 
be paid to shareholders in whatever currency the Directors decide, 
using an appropriate exchange rate for any currency conversions 
which are required. 
If a dividend has not been claimed for one year after the date of the 
resolution passed at a general meeting declaring that dividend or the 
resolution of the Directors providing for payment of that dividend, 
the Directors may invest the dividend or use it in some other way for 
the benefit of the Company until the dividend is claimed. If the dividend 
remains unclaimed for 1 2 years after the relevant resolution either 
declaring that dividend or providing for payment of that dividend, 
it will be forfeited and belong to the Company.
Voting rights 
At a general meeting of the Company, when voting on substantive 
resolutions (i.e. any resolution which is not a procedural resolution) each 
shareholder who is entitled to vote and is present in person or by proxy 
has one vote for every share held (a poll vote). Procedural resolutions 
(such as a resolution to adjourn a general meeting or a resolution on the 
choice of Chairman of a general meeting) shall be decided on a show 
of hands, where each shareholder who is present at the meeting has one 
vote regardless of the number of shares held, unless a poll is demanded. 
Shareholders entitled to vote at general meetings may appoint proxies 
who are entitled to vote, attend and speak at general meetings. 
Two shareholders present in person or by proxy constitute a quorum 
for purposes of a general meeting of the Company.
Under English law shareholders of a public company such as the 
Company are not permitted to pass resolutions by written consent. 
Record holders of the Company’s ADSs are entitled to attend, speak 
and vote on a poll or a show of hands at any general meeting of the 
Company’s shareholders by the depositary’s appointment of them 
as corporate representatives or proxies with respect to the underlying 
ordinary shares represented by their ADSs. Alternatively, holders 
of ADSs are entitled to vote by supplying their voting instructions to the 
depositary or its nominee who will vote the ordinary shares underlying 
their ADSs in accordance with their instructions.
Holders of the Company’s ADSs are entitled to receive notices 
of shareholders’ meetings under the terms of the deposit agreement 
relating to the ADSs.
Employees are able to vote any shares held under the Vodafone Group 
Share Incentive Plan and “My ShareBank” (a vested nominee share 
account) through the respective plan’s trustees.
Holders of the Company’s 7% cumulative fixed rate shares are only 
entitled to vote on any resolution to vary or abrogate the rights attached 
to the fixed rate shares. Holders have one vote for every fully paid 7% 
cumulative fixed rate share.
Liquidation rights 
In the event of the liquidation of the Company, after payment 
of all liabilities and deductions in accordance with English law, 
the holders of the Company’s 7% cumulative fixed rate shares would 
be entitled to a sum equal to the capital paid up on such shares, 
together with certain dividend payments, in priority to holders of the 
Company’s ordinary shares. The holders of the fixed rate shares do not 
have any other right to share in the Company’s surplus assets. 
Pre-emptive rights and new issues of shares 
Under section 549 of the Companies Act 2006 Directors are, with 
certain exceptions, unable to allot the Company’s ordinary shares 
or securities convertible into the Company’s ordinary shares without 
the authority of the shareholders in a general meeting. In addition, 
section 561 of the Companies Act 2006 imposes further restrictions 
on the issue of equity securities (as defined in the Companies Act 2006 
which include the Company’s ordinary shares and securities convertible 
into ordinary shares) which are, or are to be, paid up wholly in cash 
and not first offered to existing shareholders. The Company’s Articles 
of Association allow shareholders to authorise Directors for a period 
specified in the relevant resolution to allot (i) relevant securities 
generally up to an amount fixed by the shareholders; and (ii) equity 
securities for cash other than in connection with a pre-emptive 
offer up to an amount specified by the shareholders and free of the 
pre-emption restriction in section 561. At the 2016 annual general 
meeting the amount of relevant securities fixed by shareholders under 
(i) above and the amount of equity securities specified by shareholders 
under (ii) above were both in line with corporate governance guidelines. 
Further details of such proposals are provided in the 201 7 notice 
of annual general meeting.
Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 193
Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financials Additional information Disclosure of interests in the Company’s shares 
There are no provisions in the Articles of Association whereby 
persons acquiring, holding or disposing of a certain percentage of the 
Company’s shares are required to make disclosure of their ownership 
percentage although such requirements exist under rules derived from 
the UK Disclosure and Transparency Rules.
General meetings and notices 
Subject to the Articles of Association, annual general meetings are held 
at such times and place as determined by the Directors of the Company. 
The Directors may also, when they think fit, convene other general 
meetings of the Company. General meetings may also be convened 
on requisition as provided by the Companies Act 2006.
An annual general meeting needs to be called on not less than 21 days’ 
notice in writing. Subject to obtaining shareholder approval on an annual 
basis, the Company may call other general meetings on 14 days’ notice. 
The Directors may determine that persons entitled to receive notices 
of meetings are those persons entered on the register at the close 
of business on a day determined by the Directors but not later than 
21 days before the date the relevant notice is sent. The notice may 
also specify the record date, the time of which shall be determined 
in accordance with the Articles of Association and the Companies 
Act 2006.
Under section 336 of the Companies Act 2006 the annual general 
meeting of shareholders must be held each calendar year and within 
six months of the Company’s year end.
Variation of rights 
If at any time the Company’s share capital is divided into different classes 
of shares, the rights attached to any class may be varied, subject to the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006, either with the consent in writing 
of the holders of three quarters in nominal value of the shares of that 
class or at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class.
At every such separate meeting all of the provisions of the Articles 
of Association relating to proceedings at a general meeting apply, 
except that (i) the quorum is to be the number of persons (which 
must be at least two) who hold or represent by proxy not less than 
one third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class or, if such 
quorum is not present on an adjourned meeting, one person who holds 
shares of the class regardless of the number of shares he holds; (ii) any 
person present in person or by proxy may demand a poll; and (iii) each 
shareholder will have one vote per share held in that particular class 
in the event a poll is taken. Class rights are deemed not to have been 
varied by the creation or issue of new shares ranking equally with 
or subsequent to that class of shares in sharing in profits or assets 
of the Company or by a redemption or repurchase of the shares 
by the Company.
Limitations on transfer, voting and shareholding 
As far as the Company is aware there are no limitations imposed on the 
transfer, holding or voting of the Company’s ordinary shares other than 
those limitations that would generally apply to all of the shareholders, 
those that apply by law (e.g. due to insider dealing rules) or those that 
apply as a result of failure to comply with a notice under section 793 
of the Companies Act 2006. No shareholder has any securities carrying 
special rights with regard to control of the Company. The Company 
is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities that 
may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities.  
Documents on display 
The Company is subject to the information requirements of the 
Exchange Act applicable to foreign private issuers. In accordance 
with these requirements the Company files its Annual Report 
on Form 20-F and other related documents with the SEC. These  
documents may be inspected at the SEC’s public reference rooms

Taxation
As this is a complex area investors should consult their own tax 
advisor regarding the US federal, state and local, the UK and other 
tax consequences of owning and disposing of shares and American 
Depositary Shares (‘ADSs’) in their particular circumstances.
This section describes, primarily for a US holder (as defined below), 
in general terms, the principal US federal income tax and UK tax 
consequences of owning or disposing of shares or ADSs in the Company 
held as capital assets (for US and UK tax purposes). This section does 
not, however, cover the tax consequences for members of certain 
classes of holders subject to special rules including, for example, 
US expatriates and former long-term residents of the United States; 
officers and employees of the Company; holders that, directly, indirectly 
or by attribution, hold 5% or more of the Company’s voting stock; 
financial institutions; insurance companies; individual retirement 
accounts and other tax-deferred accounts; tax-exempt organisations; 
dealers in securities or currencies; investors that will hold shares or ADSs 
as part of straddles, hedging transactions or conversion transactions 
for US federal income tax purposes; investors holding shares or ADSs 
in connection with a trade or business conducted outside of the US; 
or investors whose functional currency is not the US dollar.
Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 194
Shareholder information (continued) 
Unaudited information A US holder is a beneficial owner of shares or ADSs that is for US federal 
income tax purposes: 
 – an individual citizen or resident of the United States;
 – a US domestic corporation;
 – an estate, the income of which is subject to US federal income tax 
regardless of its source; or
 – a trust, if a US court can exercise primary supervision over the 
trust’s administration and one or more US persons are authorised 
to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or the trust has validly 
elected to be treated as a domestic trust for US federal income 
tax purposes.
If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for US federal 
income tax purposes holds the shares or ADSs, the US federal income 
tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the 
partner and the tax treatment of the partnership. Holders that are 
entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for US federal income 
tax purposes should consult their tax advisors concerning the US federal 
income tax consequences to them and their partners of the ownership 
and disposition of shares or ADSs by the partnership. 
This section is based on the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 
as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations 
thereunder, published rulings and court decisions, and on the tax 
laws of the UK, the Double T axation Convention between the United 
States and the UK (the ‘treaty’) and current HM Revenue and Customs 
published practice, all as currently in effect. These laws are subject 
to change, possibly on a retroactive basis.
This section is further based in part upon the representations of the 
depositary and assumes that each obligation in the deposit agreement 
and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with 
its terms.
For the purposes of the treaty and the US–UK double taxation 
convention relating to estate and gift taxes (the ‘Estate T ax Convention’), 
and for US federal income tax and UK tax purposes, this section 
is based on the assumption that a holder of American Depositary 
Receipts (‘ADRs’) evidencing ADSs will generally be treated as the 
owner of the shares in the Company represented by those ADRs. 
Investors should note that a ruling by the first-tier tax tribunal in the 
UK has cast doubt on this view, but HMRC have stated that they will 
continue to apply their long-standing practice of regarding the holder 
of such ADRs as holding the beneficial interest in the underlying shares. 
Similarly, the US Treasury has expressed concern that US holders 
of depositary receipts (such as holders of ADRs representing our ADSs) 
may be claiming foreign tax credits in situations where an intermediary 
in the chain of ownership between such holders and the issuer of the 
security underlying the depositary receipts, or a party to whom 
depositary receipts or deposited shares are delivered by the depositary 
prior to the receipt by the depositary of the corresponding securities, 
has taken actions inconsistent with the ownership of the underlying 
security by the person claiming the credit, such as a disposition of such 
security. Such actions may also be inconsistent with the claiming of the 
reduced tax rates that may be applicable to certain dividends received 
by certain non-corporate holders, as described below. Accordingly, (i) 
the creditability of any UK taxes and (ii) the availability of the reduced tax 
rates for any dividends received by certain non-corporate US Holders, 
each as described below, could be affected by actions taken by such 
parties or intermediaries. Generally exchanges of shares for ADRs and 
ADRs for shares will not be subject to US federal income tax or to UK tax 
other than stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (see the section 
on these taxes on page 196).
Taxation of dividends
UK taxation
Under current UK law, no amount will be required to be withheld 
on account of UK tax from the dividends that we pay. Shareholders who 
are within the charge to UK corporation tax will be subject to corporation 
tax on the dividends we pay unless the dividends fall within an exempt 
class and certain other conditions are met. It is expected that the 
dividends we pay would generally be exempt.
Individual shareholders in the Company who are residents in the UK will 
be subject to the income tax on the dividends we pay. Dividends will 
be taxable in the UK at the dividend rates applicable where the income 
received is above the tax-free dividend allowance (currently £5,000 per 
tax year).
US federal income taxation
Subject to the passive foreign investment company (‘PFIC’) rules 
described below, a US holder is subject to US federal income taxation 
on the gross amount of any dividend we pay out of our current 
or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for US federal 
income tax purposes). However, the Company does not maintain 
calculations of its earnings and profits in accordance with US federal 
income tax accounting principles. US holders should therefore assume 
that any distribution by the Company with respect to shares will 
be reported as ordinary dividend income. Dividends paid to a non-
corporate US holder will be taxable to the holder at the reduced rate 
normally applicable to long-term capital gains provided that certain 
requirements are met. 
Dividends must be included in income when the US holder, 
in the case of shares, or the depositary, in the case of ADSs, actually 
or constructively receives the dividend and will not be eligible for the 
dividends-received deduction generally allowed to US corporations 
in respect of dividends received from other US corporations. 
The amount of the dividend distribution to be included in income 
will be the US dollar value of the pound sterling payments made 
determined at the spot pound sterling/US dollar rate on the date the 
dividends are received by the US holder, in the case of shares, or the 
depositary, in the case of ADSs, regardless of whether the payment 
is in fact converted into US dollars at that time. If dividends received 
in pounds sterling are converted into US dollars on the day they are 
received, the US holder generally will not be required to recognise any 
foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the dividend income. 
Where UK tax is payable on any dividends received, a foreign tax credit 
may be claimable under the treaty.
Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 195
Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financials Additional information Taxation of capital gains
UK taxation
A US holder that is not resident in the UK will generally not be liable for 
UK tax in respect of any capital gain realised on a disposal of our shares 
or ADSs. 
However, a US holder may be liable for both UK and US tax in respect 
of a gain on the disposal of our shares or ADSs if the US holder: 
 – is a citizen of the United States and is resident in the UK;
 – is an individual who realises such a gain during a period of “temporary 
non-residence” (broadly, where the individual becomes resident 
in the UK, having ceased to be so resident for a period of five years 
or less, and was resident in the UK for at least four out of the seven tax 
years immediately preceding the year of departure from the UK);
 – is a US domestic corporation resident in the UK by reason of being 
centrally managed and controlled in the UK; or
 – is a citizen or a resident of the United States, or a US domestic 
corporation, that has used, held or acquired the shares or ADSs 
in connection with a branch, agency or permanent establishment 
in the UK through which it carries on a trade, profession or vocation 
in the UK. 
In such circumstances, relief from double taxation may be available 
under the treaty. Holders who may fall within one of the above 
categories should consult their professional advisers.
US federal income taxation
Subject to the PFIC rules described below, a US holder that sells 
or otherwise disposes of our shares or ADSs generally will recognise 
a capital gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes equal to the 
difference between the US dollar value of the amount realised and 
the holder’s adjusted tax basis, determined in US dollars, in the shares 
or ADSs. This capital gain or loss will be a long-term capital gain or loss 
if the US holder’s holding period in the shares or ADSs exceeds one year. 
The gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the 
US for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. The deductibility of losses 
is subject to limitations.
Additional tax considerations
UK inheritance tax
An individual who is domiciled in the United States (for the purposes 
of the Estate T ax Convention) and is not a UK national will not 
be subject to UK inheritance tax in respect of our shares or ADSs on the 
individual’s death or on a transfer of the shares or ADSs during the 
individual’s lifetime, provided that any applicable US federal gift or estate 
tax is paid, unless the shares or ADSs are part of the business property 
of a UK permanent establishment or pertain to a UK fixed base used for 
the performance of independent personal services. Where the shares 
or ADSs have been placed in trust by a settlor they may be subject 
to UK inheritance tax unless, when the trust was created, the settlor was 
domiciled in the United States and was not a UK national. Where the 
shares or ADSs are subject to both UK inheritance tax and to US federal 
gift or estate tax, the estate tax convention generally provides a credit 
against US federal tax liabilities for UK inheritance tax paid.
UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax
Stamp duty will, subject to certain exceptions, be payable on any 
instrument transferring our shares to the custodian of the depositary 
at the rate of 1.5% on the amount or value of the consideration if on sale 
or on the value of such shares if not on sale. Stamp duty reserve tax 
(‘SDRT’), at the rate of 1.5% of the amount or value of the consideration 
or the value of the shares, could also be payable in these circumstances 
but no SDRT will be payable if stamp duty equal to such SDRT liability 
is paid. 
Following rulings of the European Court of Justice and the first-tier tax 
tribunal in the UK, HMRC have confirmed that the 1.5% SDRT charge 
will not be levied on an issue of shares to a depositary receipts system 
on the basis that such a charge is contrary to EU law.
No stamp duty should in practice be required to be paid on any transfer 
of our ADSs provided that the ADSs and any separate instrument 
of transfer are executed and retained at all times outside the UK. 
A transfer of our shares in registered form will attract ad valorem stamp 
duty generally at the rate of 0.5% of the purchase price of the shares. 
There is no charge to ad valorem stamp duty on gifts.
SDRT is generally payable on an unconditional agreement to transfer 
our shares in registered form at 0.5% of the amount or value of the 
consideration for the transfer, but if, within six years of the date of the 
agreement, an instrument transferring the shares is executed, any SDRT 
which has been paid would be repayable or, if the SDRT has not 
been paid, the liability to pay the tax (but not necessarily interest and 
penalties) would be cancelled. However, an agreement to transfer our 
ADSs will not give rise to SDRT.
PFIC rules
We do not believe that our shares or ADSs will be treated as stock 
of a PFIC for US federal income tax purposes for our current taxable year 
or the foreseeable future. This conclusion is a factual determination 
that is made annually and thus is subject to change. If we are treated 
as a PFIC, US holders of shares would be required (i) to pay a special 
US addition to tax on certain distributions and (ii) any gain realised 
on the sale or other disposition of the shares or ADSs would in general 
not be treated as a capital gain unless a US holder elects to be taxed 
annually on a mark-to-market basis with respect to the shares or ADSs.
Otherwise a US holder would be treated as if he or she has realised 
such gain and certain “excess distributions” rateably over the holding 
period for the shares or ADSs and would be taxed at the highest tax 
rate in effect for each such year to which the gain was allocated. 
An interest charge in respect of the tax attributable to each such 
preceding year beginning with the first such year in which our shares 
or ADSs were treated as stock in a PFIC would also apply. In addition, 
dividends received from us would not be eligible for the reduced rate 
of tax described above under “T axation of Dividends – US federal 
income taxation”.
Back-up withholding and information reporting
Payments of dividends and other proceeds to a US holder with respect 
to shares or ADSs, by a US paying agent or other US intermediary will 
be reported to the Internal Revenue Service (‘IRS’) and to the US holder 
as may be required under applicable regulations. Back-up withholding 
may apply to these payments if the US holder fails to provide 
an accurate taxpayer identification number or certification of exempt 
status or fails to comply with applicable certification requirements. 
Certain US holders are not subject to back-up withholding. US holders 
should consult their tax advisors about these rules and any other 
reporting obligations that may apply to the ownership or disposition 
of shares or ADSs, including requirements related to the holding 
of certain foreign financial assets.
Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 196
Shareholder information (continued) 
Unaudited information The Company was incorporated under English law in 1984 as Racal 
Strategic Radio Limited (registered number 1833679). After various 
name changes, 20% of Racal Telecom Plc share capital was offered

Regulation 
Unaudited information
Our operating companies are generally subject to regulation governing 
the operation of their business activities. Such regulation typically 
takes the form of industry specific law and regulation covering 
telecommunications services and general competition (antitrust) 
law applicable to all activities.
The following section describes the regulatory frameworks and the 
key regulatory developments at national and supranational level and 
in selected countries in which we have significant interests during the 
year ended 31 March 2017 . Many of the regulatory developments 
reported in the following section involve ongoing proceedings 
or consideration of potential proceedings that have not reached 
a conclusion. Accordingly, we are unable to attach a specific level 
of financial risk to our performance from such matters.
European Union (‘EU’) 
In January 2017 the Telecoms Single Market package was finalised 
when agreement was reached on the revised maximum wholesale 
rates for regulated roaming in the EU. The new rates will see the price 
of wholesale roaming fall on 15 June 2017 from 5 to 3.2 eurocents 
per minute for voice, from 2 to 1 eurocents for SMS and from 5 to 0.77 
eurocents per megabyte for data. In addition a glide path has been 
established reducing roaming data services to 0.25 eurocents per 
megabyte by 1 Jan 2022. In December 2016 the European Commission 
(‘the Commission’) published the implementing act in relation to the 
Fair Use Policy and the Sustainability Mechanism. As a result, from 
15 June 2017 all operators will be required to implement “Roam Like 
at Home”. Under this approach, all roaming customers will be able to use 
their home tariff whilst roaming. Operators will be able to apply fair use 
limits in line with the rules set out by the Commission. In exceptional 
circumstances operators will be able to apply for an exemption from 
implementing “Roam Like at Home” if it is demonstrably unsustainable 
from a financial perspective. 
In September 2016 the Commission published a set of initiatives and 
legislative proposals on connectivity. These include the European 
Electronic Communications Code (‘Communications Code’) 
and strategic communications documents, which sets EU-wide 
common rules and objectives for the regulation of providers of networks 
and communications services, common broadband targets for 2025, 
a 5G action plan (that foresees a common EU calendar for identification 
and allocation of spectrum and a coordinated 5G commercial launch 
in 2020) and a support scheme for public authorities who want 
to offer free Wi-Fi access to their citizens. The Communications Code 
covers the following five areas: access regulation, spectrum, rules 
for communications services, universal service, and the institutional 
set-up and governance. There is a clear focus on incentivising the 
investment required to meet the proposed broadband targets and 
ensure sustainable competition, the further harmonisation of spectrum 
regulation and the creation of a fair and level playing field for 
competing services.
The Commission has also published a number of proposals and reports 
on the online sale of goods and audiovisual services which are likely 
to impact e-commerce and the distribution of content across the 
European Single Market in a variety of areas. These include proposals 
on copyright, tangible goods and a new portability regulation, which 
will allow consumers access to online TV and Video on Demand (‘VoD’)
subscriptions while travelling across Europe. 
In September 2016 the Commission issued new proposals on the 
Satellite and Cable Directive, together with a Preliminary Report on the 
E-commerce Sector Inquiry which is also likely to lead to change 
in a variety of areas in and beyond competition that impact e-commerce 
across the European Single Market.

Germany
In September 2016 BNetzA’s vectoring proposals entered into 
force and after taking the Commission’s comments into account, 
the layer 2 bitstream product entered into force in December 2016. 
In addition to the layer 2 bitstream product, BNetzA has proposed 
to mandate a virtual unbundled local access (‘VULA’) product 
at street cabinets that will be under the obligations of a reference 
offer. Deutsch Telekom’s vectoring deployment is expected 
to commence in September 201 7 , once the existing unbundled 
local loop (‘ULL ’) reference offer updates have been finalised. 
Vodafone Germany’s very-high-rate digital subscriber line (‘VDSL ’) 
customers are due to be migrated on to the substitute products 
from mid-2018.

In July 2016 Hutchison 3G submitted an appeal to the EU’s General 
Court against the Commission’s competition authority (‘DGCOMP’) 
decision in May 2016 to prohibit the proposed Hutchison 3G acquisition 
of Telefónica UK (‘O2’).
In March 201 7 BT agreed to Ofcom’s proposal for the legal separation 
of Openreach.
In May 201 7 the Court of Appeal upheld the Competition Tribunal’s  
decisions against BT’s appeals on three matters relating to the charges 
for Ethernet services between 2004 and 201 1. The decisions are subject 
to any further appeals.
Spain 
The fines applied to Telefónica, Orange and Vodafone Spain 
in December 201 2 for abuse of dominant position by imposing 
excessive pricing of wholesale SMS/MMS services on mobile virtual 
network operators (‘MVNO’), remain suspended until the judicial review 
is concluded. The National Audience decision is awaited. 
In June 2016 following on from the National Markets and Competition 
Commission’s (‘CNMC’) draft decision on the regulatory ex ante price 
squeeze test run on Telefónica’s retail offers, it is proposed that there will 
be a maximum permissible discount for promotions on fixed broadband 
and TV content bundles incorporating national football content, in order 
to allow replicability for competitors. 
In September 2016 CNMC approved Masmovil’s proposed acquisition 
of Yoigo. 
In January 201 7 following a public consultation and subsequent 
notification to the Commission, CNMC’s decision requiring Telefónica 
to offer VULA products where there is insufficient network-based 
competition entered into force. 
In January 201 7 following a public consultation and subsequent 
notification to the Commission, CNMC’s decision to maintain the access 
component cost but reduce the traffic component cost of the CNMC-
approved wholesale broadband service (‘NEBA’) prices, for both NEBA 
Copper and fibre-to-the-home (‘FTTH’) by 40%, entered into force. 
In April 2017 following notification to the Commission on Market 15 
deregulation, the CNMC adopted the Resolution eliminating the ex-ante 
obligations imposed to Telefónica and Vodafone in providing wholesale 
tariffs to MVNOs.  Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 199

Netherlands 
In September 2016 the European Court of Justice (‘ECJ’) issued its 
ruling on the legal status of the recommendation to use pure bottom 
up long run incremental cost (‘BULRIC’). The ECJ confirmed that 
a national court is allowed to deviate from the European MTR/FTR 
recommendation prescribing pure BULRIC as a cost methodology. 
Based on the ECJ ruling, the Court of Appeal is expected to issue its final 
ruling on the national regulatory and competition authority’s (‘ACM’) 
proposed 2013-2016 MTR-FTR rates by September 2017 . ACM’s final 
decision on the proposed MTR-FTR rates for the period 201 7 -2020 
is expected to be published in June 201 7 , with rates due to enter into 
force on 1 July 2017 .
In April 201 7 the Court of Rotterdam ruled that the European 
rules on net neutrality prevail over the amendment to the 
Telecommunications Act that was passed by the Senate in 2016 that 
imposed an absolute ban on zero-rating. The ruling confirms that the 
European rules allow operators to offer zero rated services. ACM have 
a right to appeal the decision in the Court of Appeals in The Hague. 
In December 2016 following the Dutch Supreme Court’s February 
2016 ruling that bundled “all-in” mobile subscription agreements 
(i.e. device along with mobile services) are considered consumer 
credit agreements, Vodafone Netherlands was granted a consumer 
credit licence by the Dutch Financial supervisory body (‘AFM’) 
containing a phased compliance path. 
In December 2016 the Commission and ACM cleared Vodafone 
Netherlands and Liberty Global’s proposed joint venture, following the 
divestment of Vodafone’s fixed consumer business in the Netherlands, 
Vodafone Thuis. ACM has indicated that as a result of the joint venture 
it will start a new analysis of the ULL market in 2017 . This process 
is expected to take one to two years.
Ireland
In November 2016 the national regulatory authority (‘ComReg’) 
commenced its review of the wholesale access markets 3a and 3b. 
ComReg has proposed a move to cost oriented price control 
on Wholesale Local Access and (‘WLA’) and Wholesale Central Access 
(WCA) markets with the exception of FTTH wholesale products. 
The initial consultation closed in January 201 7 and responses 
to the subsequent pricing consultation are required by 2 June 2017 .
Portugal
In May 2016 Vodafone Portugal continued its challenge to payment 
notices totalling €9.8 million issued by the national regulatory authority 
(‘ANACOM’) regarding the extraordinary compensation of Universal 
Service Net Costs for 2012–2013. 
In September 2016 ANACOM approved the final decision 
on market 4 that identified the wholesale markets where Portugal 
Telecom’s Serviços de Comunicações e Multimédia (‘MEO’) 
has significant market power and requires ex-ante regulation 
in accordance with the principles of competition law. Wholesale markets 
for high-quality access in competitive areas will no longer require 
ex-ante regulation and the existing obligations will be withdrawn after 
a transition period of 12 months. 
In March 201 7 ANACOM rejected the Commission’s recommendation 
to open up MEO’s fibre network to competitors by providing regulated 
access in non-competitive areas. The Commission is yet to comment, 
however it had previously indicated that it could resort to legal measures 
if the recommendation was not adopted.
Romania
Vodafone Romania has no new material items to report in the year 
ending 31 March 2017 .
Greece
In August 2016 the Ministry of Infrastructure, Transport and Networks 
(‘MITN’) announced its decision in relation to Vodafone Greece’s expired 
spectrum licence. The 2x15MHz at 1800Mhz licence was extended 
by 18 months to February 2018 at a cost of €5.8 million.
In December 2016 following notification to the Commission, 
the national regulatory authority (‘EETT’) announced that the detailed 
specification requirements for the regulation of vectoring and other 
next generation access (‘NGA’) technologies will be determined 
by a public consultation that commenced in March 201 7 and 
is expected to be concluded in May 2017 . Areas will be allocated 
by auction, on a 28-month exclusive basis, to deploy VDSL vectoring 
or any alternative 100MBps or above, access network. The successful 
bidder will sell VULA services to other operators in that auction 
area. There is an asymmetrical coverage obligation of 80% applied 
to Hellenic Telecommunications Organization (‘OTE’) in each local 
exchange, whereas all others operators have a 50% minimum coverage 
requirement. At the end of the exclusive period, any other operator 
can request access to any street cabinets that have not been VDSL 
vectoring enabled.
Czech Republic 
In June 2016 the auction of the 1800MHz and 2.6GHz spectrum 
previously unsold in 2013 was concluded. Vodafone Czech Republic 
acquired an additional spectrum licence of 2x5MHz at 1800MHz, 
at a cost of €16.4 million, expiring in June 2029. The national regulatory 
authority (‘CTU’) has deferred the proposed auction for the 3.7GHz 
spectrum to 2017 . 
In October 2016 DG COMP opened an investigation into a network 
sharing agreement between O2 CZ/CETIN and T-Mobile 
CZ. The Commission will examine whether the cooperation 
restricts competition and thereby harms innovation in breach 
of EU antitrust rules.
In May 2017 CTU confirmed their intention to extend Vodafone 
Czech Republic’s existing 900MHz and 1800MHZ spectrum licences 
to June 2029. 
Hungary
In June 2016 Vodafone Hungary acquired a spectrum licence 
of 2x30MHz at 3.5GHz, at a cost of €2.1 million, expiring in June 2034. 
In August 2016 the national regulatory authority (‘NMHH’) commenced 
an investigation into a proposed agreement between Magyar Telekom 
and Telenor to share spectrum in the 900MHz band. This deal can 
be regarded as a second step in network collaboration after their 
800MHz network and spectrum sharing deal, that is still subject 
to an ongoing competition law investigation.
Albania 
In June 2016 Vodafone Albania renewed its 2x8MHz at 900MHz and 
2x9MHz at 1800MHz spectrum licences at a cost of €10.9 million, 
expiring in June 2031.

India
Vodafone India’s challenge in the Telecom Tribunal (‘TDSAT’) against the 
financial demands by the Department of Telecommunications (‘DoT’) 
for approving the transfer of Vodafone India telecom licences that were 
held under seven subsidiary companies to create two telecom licensed 
companies – Vodafone India Limited and its subsidiary Vodafone 
Mobile Services Limited, is pending. Vodafone India has deposited 
INR24.5 billion with DoT based on orders from the Supreme Court 
and TDSAT, this is without prejudice to its rights and contentions in the 
matter. The matter is listed for hearing in the TDSAT in due course.
In August 2016 in response to the Indian Supreme Court decision on  
call drops, TRAI launched a consultation on tightening benchmarks for 
network quality of service parameters, the outcome of which is awaited. 
In August 2016 TRAI initiated a review of termination charges and 
initiated a consultation on Internet Telephony and App to Public 
Switched Telephone Network and Public Land Mobile Network 
(‘PSTN/PLMN’) calling and a review of the Interconnection framework, 
the outcome of which are awaited. The current MTR regime introduced 
in February 2015 was challenged by Vodafone India in the Delhi High 
Court and the next hearing is currently scheduled in September 2017 . 
In August 2016 Vodafone India received 128 notices for financial 
demands (licence and spectrum fee) from the DoT of INR78.90 billion 
and INR0.94 billion for six notices concerning access and National and 
International Long Distance services based on the audit of Vodafone 
India’s telecom operations by the Do T appointed auditor and by the 
Comptroller & Auditor General of India (‘CAG’) for the years 2006/7 
to 2010/1 1. Vodafone India has submitted its response to the 
demand notices. 
In October 2016 Vodafone India acquired a total of 2x82.6MHZ and 
1x200MHz of spectrum across the 1800MHz, 2.1GHz and 2.5GHZ bands 
at a cost of INR200 billion, expiring in October 2036, enabling its 4G 
services to be expanded to a total of 17 circles. 
In October 2016 TRAI recommended to the DoT that a fine 
of INR10.5 billion should be levied against Vodafone India for failing 
to provide adequate points of interconnection to Reliance Jio (‘RJIL ’). 
Similar fines were also recommended against Bharti Airtel and Idea 
Cellular. Vodafone India has challenged TRAI’s recommendation in the 
Delhi High Court and the next hearing is scheduled on 24 October 
2017 . Vodafone India has filed a petition in the Delhi High Court on the 
basis that RJIL ’s zero/free mobile tariff offers are not compliant with 
TRAI’s tariff requirements for interconnect usage charges and that the 
promotion/free benefits is continuing beyond the 90 days permitted 
by TRAI. The matter was heard at the Delhi High Court in April 2017 
where it was adjourned. Similar petitions have been filed by Bharti 
Airtel and Idea Cellular in the TDSAT. 
In March 201 7 Vodafone India and Idea announced their proposal 
to merge. The transaction is expected to close during 2018, subject 
to customary approvals.
In May 2017 Vodafone India filed a challenge in TDSAT against 
DoT’s microwave spectrum interim guidelines issued in October 2015, 
and their letter of January 2017 , that conflict with the confirmations 
given to Vodafone India at the time of the 2014 and 2015 spectrum 
auctions that the microwave resources of expiring licences will 
be transferred to the Universal Licence.

Vodacom: South Africa
In April 201 7 the national competition authority (‘CompCom’) 
announced that it would not refer Cell C’s allegation against Vodacom 
and MTN of market dominance abuse. However, CompCom will engage 
the national regulatory authority (‘ICASA’) to explore the need for any 
regulatory interventions to ensure the market is competitive.
In October 2016 the Ministry of Telecommunications and Postal 
Services published the cabinet-approved National Integrated ICT Policy 
White Paper (‘White Paper’). The White Paper sets out a framework 
on how the government wants to provide access to modern 
communications infrastructure and services to facilitate the entry 
of new players and the meaningful participation of all citizens, including 
those in rural areas. Its adoption will require various amendments 
to existing laws and regulations flowing from the Electronic 
Communications Act. Engagements between the various stakeholders 
and Government to explore the possibility of finding an amicable way 
to implement the White Paper are ongoing. 
In November 2016 the Final Amended ICT Sector Black Economic 
Empowerment Codes were gazetted. The Codes contain variations 
to the draft ICT Sector Code, some of which are in conflict with that 
of the Revised Department of Trade and Industry Codes and will be used 
in May 201 7 to rate Vodacom’s and the other operators performance 
for the 2016/17 financial year. Due to the nature of the new Codes, 
the industry is engaging the BEE ICT Sector Council to resolve some 
of the concerns. 
In February 201 7 ICASA formally deferred the timeframe for the 
Invitation to Apply (‘ITA’) spectrum licensing process in the 700MHz, 
800MHz and 2.6GHz bands whilst the judicial review process in the 
High Court is ongoing.
Vodacom: Democratic Republic of Congo
In August 2016 the Minister of Communications and Minister of Finance 
issued a ministerial decree setting the new tax on mobile payments 
at 3% of annual service revenue. 
The Ministry of Finance DGRAD-T ax Administration has proposed 
a revision to the spectrum fees model which will result in a 69% increase 
in annual fees. Vodacom Congo and other industry participants have 
engaged the DGRAD and Minister of Communications to request the 
nullification of this change on the grounds that such a tax will negatively 
impact communication costs.
As of March 201 7 Vodacom Congo is implementing a compliance plan 
and continues to participate in industry association engagement with 
authorities to secure electronic SIM registration.
Vodacom: Tanzania 
In July 2016 the national regulatory authority (‘TCRA’) published 
an open invitation to apply for 3.5GHz spectrum. Vodacom Tanzania has 
submitted its application and the evaluation of all applications by TCRA 
is still pending. 
In July 2016 the national competition authority (‘FCC’) approved 
Vodacom T anzania’s acquisition of Shared Networks T anzania which 
holds 2x5MHz of 900MHz spectrum licences which will be used 
to support the provision of rural services. 
In March 201 7 the Initial Public Offering for Vodafone T anzania Public 
Company Limited was launched under the requirements of the Finance 
Act 2016, with the offer open until 1 1 May 2017 .
In March 201 7 the Ministry of Communications published its draft 
amendments to the Electronic and Postal Communications Act 2010 
with comments submitted by 14 April 2017 .  Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 201

In April 201 7 Vodafone T anzania received a non-compliance order from 
TCRA in relation to SIM registration tests conducted in December 2016. 
Vodafone T anzania will continue to work with TCRA to execute the SIM 
registration compliance actions.
Vodacom: Mozambique 
In July 2016 a new Communications Act was approved by Parliament, 
that required the national regulatory authority (‘INCM’) to issue 
new regulations under the Act by February 2017 . To date only draft 
regulations for Licensing Regulations and Infrastructure Sharing 
Regulations have been issued, to which Vodacom Mozambique has 
submitted its comments. 
In November 2016 Vodacom Mozambique complied with an order 
from INCM and blocked all existing unregistered users. 
Vodacom: Lesotho
In April 2016 the national regulatory authority (‘LCA’) finalised the 
approved renewal of Vodacom Lesotho’s service licence at a cost 
of ZAR5 million, expiring in May 2036. 
International roaming in Africa
In September 2016 an impact assessment carried out by TERA 
Consultants on East Africa Community (‘EAC’) Roaming was 
submitted to the T anzanian Ministry of Communications as part of the 
ongoing public consultation to implement Phase 1 price caps for 
EAC countries. Vodacom has engaged with the consultation process 
and presented its views at the February 201 7 East African Legislative 
Assembly conference.
As of March 201 7 no national regulatory authority in the Vodacom 
Group markets had fully complied with the Communications 
Regulators’ Association of Southern Africa (‘CRASA’) guidance on the 
Southern African Development Community (‘SADC’) roaming glide 
paths, that had been issued in September 2015. In the meantime, 
Vodacom Group has developed its new Africa Roaming Product 
across SADC which is being rolled out in 2017 . 
Turkey 
As of March 201 7 the national regulatory authority’s (‘ICTA’) proposed 
action to broaden the scope of the 3G coverage to include new 
metropolitan areas is still suspended by the Council of State motion, 
as Vodafone Turkey’s appeal to the administrative court is still pending.
Australia

at 700MHz band spectrum, at a cost of AU$285 million, expiring 
in December 2029. 
Egypt
The Administrative Court ruling in favour of Vodafone Egypt in the 
case filed against Telecom Egypt and the national regulatory authority 
(‘NTRA’), regarding the NTRA’s authority to set MTRs between 
operators, has been implemented with Orange Egypt (formerly Mobinil) 
and Telecom Egypt, however, the arbitration case with Etisalat Misr 
is still pending. 
In October 2016 Vodafone Egypt acquired a spectrum licence for 
2x5MHz at 2.1GHz and extended the existing 2G/3G licences a cost 
of US$335 million all expiring in October 2031, enabling the launch 
of 4G services. 
For information on litigation in Egypt, see note 30 “Contingent liabilities 
and legal proceedings” to the consolidated financial statements.
Ghana

In January 201 7 the New Zealand Government awarded contracts 
to extend the existing Ultra-Fast Broadband fibre to the premises 
(‘FTTP’) initiative from 75% to 85% of premises passed at a projected 
cost of NZ$210 million. The Government has also announced a further 
NZ$150 million of funding to improve broadband coverage in rural areas 
and address mobile blackspots, with competitive tenders expected 
to be awarded in late 2017 . 
In February 201 7 the Commerce Commission declined to clear the 
proposed merger between Vodafone New Zealand and Sky New 
Zealand under the New Zealand Commerce Act. 
Safaricom: Kenya 
In May 2016 the national regulatory authority (‘CA’) appointed 
Analysis Mason to conduct a study on competition within the

Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financials Additional information
Alternative performance measures 
Unaudited information
In the discussion of the Group’s reported operating results, alternative performance measures are presented to provide readers with additional 
financial information that is regularly reviewed by management. However, this additional information presented is not uniformly defined by all 
companies including those in the Group’s industry. Accordingly, it may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other 
companies. Additionally, certain information presented is derived from amounts calculated in accordance with IFRS but is not itself an expressly 
permitted GAAP measure. Such alternative performance measures should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to the equivalent 
GAAP measure.
Service revenue
Service revenue comprises all revenue related to the provision of ongoing services including, but not limited to, monthly access charges, airtime 
usage, roaming, incoming and outgoing network usage by non-Vodafone customers and interconnect charges for incoming calls. We believe that 
it is both useful and necessary to report this measure for the following reasons:
 – it is used for internal performance reporting;
 – it is used in setting director and management remuneration; and
 – it is useful in connection with discussion with the investment analyst community.
A reconciliation of reported service revenue to the respective closest equivalent GAAP measure, revenue, are provided in the “Operating results” 
section on pages 35 to 43 and the “Prior year operating results” on pages 177 to 181.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is operating profit excluding share of results in associates, depreciation and amortisation, gains/losses on the disposal of fixed 
assets, impairment losses, restructuring costs arising from discrete restructuring plans, other operating income and expense and significant items 
that are not considered by management to be reflective of the underlying performance of the Group. We use adjusted EBITDA, in conjunction 
with other GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted operating profit, operating profit and net profit, to assess our operating 
performance. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is an operating performance measure, not a liquidity measure, as it includes non-cash changes 
in working capital and is reviewed by the Chief Executive to assess internal performance in conjunction with adjusted EBITDA margin, which 
is an alternative sales margin figure. We believe it is both useful and necessary to report adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure as it enhances 
the comparability of profit across segments.
Because adjusted EBITDA does not take into account certain items that affect operations and performance, adjusted EBITDA has inherent limitations 
as a performance measure. To compensate for these limitations, we analyse adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with other GAAP and non-GAAP 
operating performance measures. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a GAAP measure of operating 
performance. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to the closest equivalent GAAP measure, operating profit, is provided in note 2 “Segmental 
analysis” to the consolidated financial statements.
Group adjusted EBIT, adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share
Group adjusted EBIT and adjusted operating profit exclude impairment losses, restructuring costs arising from discrete restructuring plans, 
amortisation of customer bases and brand intangible assets, other operating income and expense and other significant one-off items.  
Adjusted EBIT also excludes the share of results in associates and joint ventures. Adjusted earnings per share also excludes certain foreign exchange 
rate differences, together with related tax effects. We believe that it is both useful and necessary to report these measures as they are used for 
internal performance reporting, in setting director and management remuneration and in connection with discussions with the investment analyst 
community and debt rating agencies.
Adjusted EBIT is reconciled to the respective closest equivalent GAAP measure, operating profit, in the “Operating results” on page 35. 
A reconciliation of adjusted operating profit to the respective closest equivalent GAAP measure, operating profit, is provided in note 2 “Segmental 
analysis” to the consolidated financial statements. A reconciliation of adjusted earnings per share to basic earnings per share is provided in the 
“Operating results” on page 37 . 
201 7 financial year guidance
The adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow guidance measures for the year ended 31 March 2017 were forward-looking alternative performance 
measures based on the Group’s assessment of the global macroeconomic outlook and foreign exchange rates of €1:INR76.4, €1:ZAR16.5, €1:£0.79, 
€1:TRY3.2 and €1:EGP9.8. These guidance measures exclude the impact of licence and spectrum payments, material one-off tax-related payments, 
restructuring costs, and any fundamental structural change to the Eurozone. They also assume no material change to the current structure of the 
Group. We believe it is both useful and necessary to report these guidance measures to give investors an indication of the Group’s expected future 
performance, the Group’s sensitivity to foreign exchange movements and to report actual performance against these guidance measures.
Reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to the 2017 financial year guidance basis is shown below.

Cash flow measures and capital additions
In presenting and discussing our reported results, free cash flow, capital additions and operating free cash flow are calculated and presented even 
though these measures are not recognised within IFRS. We believe that it is both useful and necessary to communicate free cash flow to investors 
and other interested parties, for the following reasons:
 – free cash flow allows us and external parties to evaluate our liquidity and the cash generated by our operations. Free cash flow and capital 
additions do not include payments for licences and spectrum included within intangible assets, items determined independently of the ongoing 
business, such as the level of dividends, and items which are deemed discretionary, such as cash flows relating to acquisitions and disposals 
or financing activities. In addition, it does not necessarily reflect the amounts which we have an obligation to incur. However, it does reflect the 
cash available for such discretionary activities, to strengthen the consolidated statement of financial position or to provide returns to shareholders 
in the form of dividends or share purchases;
 – free cash flow facilitates comparability of results with other companies, although our measure of free cash flow may not be directly comparable 
to similarly titled measures used by other companies;
 – these measures are used by management for planning, reporting and incentive purposes; and
 – these measures are useful in connection with discussion with the investment analyst community and debt rating agencies.

Other
Certain of the statements within the Strategic Report contains forward-looking alternative performance measures for which at this time 
there is no comparable GAAP measure and which at this time cannot be quantitatively reconciled to comparable GAAP financial information.

at this time cannot be quantitatively reconciled to comparable GAAP financial information.
Organic growth
All amounts in this document marked with an “*” represent organic growth which presents performance on a comparable basis, in terms of both 
merger and acquisition activity and foreign exchange movements. While “organic growth” is neither intended to be a substitute for reported growth, 
nor is it superior to reported growth, we believe that the measure provides useful and necessary information to investors and other related parties for 
the following reasons: 
 – it provides additional information on underlying growth of the business without the effect of certain factors unrelated to its 
operating performance;
 – it is used for internal performance analysis; and
 – it facilitates comparability of underlying growth with other companies (although the term “organic” is not a defined term under IFRS and may not, 
therefore, be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies).
The Group’s organic growth rates for all periods excludes the results of Vodafone India (excluding its 42% stake in Indus Towers) which are now 
included in discontinued operations. 
For the quarter ended 31 March 2015 and the year ended 31 March 2015, the Group’s organic growth rate was adjusted to exclude the beneficial 
impact of a settlement of a historical interconnect rate dispute in the UK and the beneficial impact of an upward revision to interconnect revenue 
in Egypt from a re-estimation by management of the appropriate historical mobile interconnection rate. The adjustments in relation to Vodafone 
UK and Vodafone Egypt also impacted the disclosed organic growth rates for those countries. Organic growth rates for the quarter ended 31 March 
2016 and the year ended 31 March 2016 have been similarly adjusted to exclude these impacts. Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2017 207
Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financials Additional information
For the quarter ended 30 September 2015 and year ended 31 March 2016, the Group’s and Vodafone UK’s organic growth rates have been adjusted 
to exclude the beneficial impact of a settlement of another historical interconnect rate dispute in the UK. Organic growth rates for the quarter ended 
30 September 2016 and the year ended 31 March 2017 have been similarly adjusted to exclude these impacts.
The Group’s organic growth rate for the year ended 31 March 2017 and the quarters ended 31 December 2016 and 31 March 2017 have also 
been adjusted to exclude the results of Vodafone Netherlands following the disposal of its consumer fixed business and subsequent merger into 
VodafoneZiggo, as well as the results of VodafoneZiggo after the merger.
We have not provided a comparative in respect of organic growth rates as the current rates describe the change between the beginning and 
end of the current year, with such changes being explained by the commentary in this news release. If comparatives were provided, significant 
sections of the commentary from the news release for the prior year would also need to be included, reducing the usefulness and transparency 
of this document.

Forward-looking statements 
Unaudited information
This document contains “forward-looking statements” within the 
meaning of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 
with respect to the Group’s financial condition, results of operations 
and businesses, and certain of the Group’s plans and objectives.
In particular, such forward-looking statements include statements 
with respect to:
 – the Group’s expectations and guidance regarding its financial 
and operating performance, the performance of associates and 
joint ventures, other investments and newly acquired businesses, 
preparation for 5G and expectations regarding customers;
 – intentions and expectations regarding the development of products, 
services and initiatives introduced by, or together with, Vodafone 
or by third parties;
 – expectations regarding the global economy and the 
Group’s operating environment and market position, including future 
market conditions, growth in the number of worldwide mobile 
phone users and other trends;
 – revenue and growth expected from the Group’s Enterprise and total 
communications strategy;
 – mobile penetration and coverage rates, MTR cuts, the Group’s ability 
to acquire spectrum and licences, including 5G licences, expected 
growth prospects in the Europe and AMAP regions and growth 
in customers and usage generally;
 – anticipated benefits to the Group from cost-efficiency programmes, 
including their impact on the absolute indirect cost base;
 – possible future acquisitions, including increases in ownership 
in existing investments, the timely completion of pending acquisition 
transactions and pending offers for investments;
 – expectations and assumptions regarding the Group’s future revenue, 
operating profit, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash 
flow, depreciation and amortisation charges, foreign exchange rates, 
tax rates and capital expenditure;
 – expectations regarding the Group’s access to adequate funding for 
its working capital requirements and share buyback programmes, 
and the Group’s future dividends or its existing investments; and
 – the impact of regulatory and legal proceedings involving the Group 
and of scheduled or potential regulatory changes.
Forward-looking statements are sometimes, but not always, identified 
by their use of a date in the future or such words as “will”, “anticipates”, 
“aims”, “could”, “may”, “should”, “expects”, “believes”, “intends”, “plans” 
or “targets”. By their nature, forward-looking statements are inherently 
predictive, speculative and involve risk and uncertainty because they 
relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the 
future. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results 
and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied 
by these forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not 
limited to, the following:
 – general economic and political conditions in the jurisdictions in which 
the Group operates and changes to the associated legal, regulatory 
and tax environments;
 – increased competition;
 – levels of investment in network capacity and the Group’s ability 
to deploy new technologies, products and services;
 – rapid changes to existing products and services and the 
inability of new products and services to perform in accordance 
with expectations;
 – the ability of the Group to integrate new technologies, products and 
services with existing networks, technologies, products and services;
 – the Group’s ability to generate and grow revenue;
 – a lower than expected impact of new or existing products, services 
or technologies on the Group’s future revenue, cost structure and 
capital expenditure outlays;
 – slower than expected customer growth, reduced customer 
retention, reductions or changes in customer spending and 
increased pricing pressure;
 – the Group’s ability to extend and expand its spectrum resources, 
to support ongoing growth in customer demand for mobile 
data services; 
 – the Group’s ability to secure the timely delivery of high-quality 
products from suppliers;
 – loss of suppliers, disruption of supply chains and greater than 
anticipated prices of new mobile handsets;
 – changes in the costs to the Group of, or the rates the Group may 
charge for, terminations and roaming minutes;
 – the impact of a failure or significant interruption to the  
Group’s telecommunications, networks, IT systems or data 
protection systems;
 – the Group’s ability to realise expected benefits from acquisitions, 
partnerships, joint ventures, franchises, brand licences, platform 
sharing or other arrangements with third parties;
 – acquisitions and divestments of Group businesses and assets and 
the pursuit of new, unexpected strategic opportunities;
 – the Group’s ability to integrate acquired business or assets;
 – the extent of any future write-downs or impairment charges 
on the Group’s assets, or restructuring charges incurred as a result 
of an acquisition or disposition;
 – developments in the Group’s financial condition, earnings and 
distributable funds and other factors that the Board takes into 
account in determining the level of dividends;
 – the Group’s ability to satisfy working capital requirements;
 – changes in foreign exchange rates;
 – changes in the regulatory framework in which the Group operates;

Notes: 
1 See note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, “Earnings per share”. Earnings and dividends per ADS is calculated by multiplying earnings per ordinary share by ten, the number of ordinary 
shares per ADS. 
2 On 19 February 2014, we announced a “6 for 11” share consolidation effective 24 February 2014. This had the effect of reducing the number of shares in issue from 52,821,751,216 ordinary 
shares (including 4,351,833,492 ordinary shares held in Treasury) as at the close of business on 18 February 2014 to 28,811,864,298 new ordinary shares in issue immediately after the share 
consolidation on 24 February 2014. Earnings per share for the year ended 31 March 2013 has been restated accordingly.
3 The final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2017 was proposed by the Directors on 16 May 2017 and is payable on 4 August 2017 to holders of record as of 9 June 2016. The total dividends 
have been translated into US dollars at 31 March 2017 for purposes of the above disclosure but the dividends are payable in US dollars under the terms of the ADS depositary agreement.
4 For the purposes of calculating these ratios, earnings consist of loss or profit before tax adjusted for fixed charges, dividend income from associates, share of profits and losses from associates, 
interest capitalised and interest amortised. Fixed charges comprise one third of payments under operating leases, representing the estimated interest element of these payments, interest 
payable and similar charges, interest capitalised and preferred share dividends.
The selected financial data shown below for the years ended 31 March 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013 has 
been restated into euros following the change in the Group’s presentation currency and include the results 
of Vodafone India as discontinued operations following the agreement to combine it with Idea Cellular.
