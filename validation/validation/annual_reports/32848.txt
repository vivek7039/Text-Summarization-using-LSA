REPORT 02 03 04 Breedon Group is the only major quoted 
company offering a focused UK investment 
opportunity in the heavyside construction 
materials industry.
OUR INVESTMENT 
CASE
FAVOURABLE  
MARKETS
• Construction output is steadily 
recovering from the downturn in 2008, 
and is forecast to grow by 3.7 per cent 
over the three years to 2020.
• Aggregates, asphalt and ready-mixed 
concrete volumes are forecast to 
grow by three to five per cent over the 
same period.
• The most buoyant sectors are 
predicted to be infrastructure and 
housing, which are expected to 
grow by a further 23 per cent and 
seven per cent respectively over the 
next three years. Together these 
account for the majority of Breedon’s 
end-use sales. 
SCALE AND REACH
• Breedon has a business of significant 
scale and reach, with around 250 
locations stretching from the 
Hebrides to Essex, including the 
UK’s largest cement plant, around 
60 quarries, nearly 200 ready-
mixed concrete plants and 26 
asphalt plants.
• With the exception of cement, these 
are all essentially local businesses, 
equipped to serve a very diverse 
range of customers, in a large 
number of local markets, with 
products which need to be delivered 
rapidly after production.
• We benefit from significant 
economies of scale, with the 
advantages of vertical integration.

BREEDON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2017 
WWW.BREEDONGROUP.COM STRONG 
ASSET BACKING
• Our industry has significant barriers 
to entry, with consents for new rock 
quarries granted very rarely.
• Breedon has around 750 million 
tonnes of mineral reserves and 
resources, enough to last more 
than 42 years at current rates 
of production.
• We have consistently demonstrated 
our ability to add to our reserves 
and resources through planning 
extensions, efficiency improvements 
and reduction of waste.
• We continue to maintain our 
annual net reserves and resources 
position, against the background 
of an industry in which annual 
replenishment of crushed rock 
reserves in each year since 2013 has 
been lower than annual sales.
FINANCIALLY CONSERVATIVE  
WITH STRONG CASHFLOW
• We have a strong balance 
sheet, with plenty of 
financial flexibility.
• We are strongly cash-
generative, providing more 
than adequate resources 
for organic investment and 
bolt-on acquisitions.

It is our ability to secure 
sparingly-granted planning 
consents for new quarry 
reserves and extensions, and 
identify additional consented 
reserves to acquire, that ensures 
we continue to expand our 
mineral supplies.
Whether it is blasting, crushing 
and screening rock; extracting 
sand & gravel; or producing and 
importing high-grade cement, 
we do it as efficiently and  
cost-effectively as possible.
We mix aggregates and cement 
to produce concrete and 
mortar; combine aggregates 
and bitumen to make asphalt; 
and form our concrete into 
blocks, walling and paving 
products. We maximise the 
margin on every tonne of our 
minerals and cement through 
the manufacture of these 
downstream products.

WWW.BREEDONGROUP.COM We have a vertically-integrated business, which 
ensures a high level of self-sufficiency: from the 
extraction and processing of minerals; through the 
manufacture of cement, ready-mixed concrete, 
concrete blocks and asphalt; to nationwide 
distribution and regional surfacing contracting.
Restoration is as much a part 
of our business as extraction. 
Every year we return many 
hectares of land to the 
communities in which we 
operate, by landscaping and 
repurposing worked-out areas 
of our quarries.
We recycle substantial 
quantities of our aggregates 
through reprocessing of waste 
minerals, concrete and asphalt.

STRATEGIC  
REPORT 02 03 04 OUR BUSINESS MODEL –
A GROWING  
ASSET BASE
We work hard to secure planning consents 
for new reserves and resources.
O
ur mineral reserves and 
resources are literally the 
bedrock of our business. We 
seek continually to extend 
them both organically 
and through acquisition, aiming to 
replenish as much as possible of what 
we use and ensure that we always have 
a ready supply of raw material for our 
downstream operations. 
We begin by securing planning consents 
for new reserves and extensions. 
These are granted sparingly and our 
success in obtaining them depends in 
large measure on maintaining good 
relationships with local authorities, 
landowners and – perhaps most 
importantly – the local communities 
which are affected by, and in some cases 
depend upon, our operations. We have 
an excellent track record of working with 
local stakeholders to develop our sites 
sensitively and ensure that the lives of 
the people, flora and fauna around them 
are subject to the minimum possible 
disruption. (See more on our restoration 
activities on page 15.)
By the end of 2017 we had retained 
around 750 million tonnes of reserves 
and resources in our aggregates 
portfolio, including a new greenfield site 
in England, extensions to our existing 
quarries, and the acquisition of North 
Cave quarry which came with our 
purchase of Humberside Aggregates. 
Following our pending acquisition of 
additional quarries from Tarmac, this will 
be augmented by a substantial quantity 
of additional reserves and resources.
In the case of our cementitious business, 
our Hope cement plant in Derbyshire 
is dependent on a steady supply of 
limestone from its adjacent quarry, 
where we have at least 20 years of 
consented reserves, but are already 
test-drilling neighbouring deposits to 
ensure we can secure even longer-term 
supplies. A quantity of shale, or shale 
substitute, is also required in the cement 
manufacturing process. In the past, 
the plant has relied on Hope Works’ 
neighbouring shale quarry for this 
material, but we are increasingly using 
pulverised fly ash (PFA) as a sustainable 
alternative source of waste-derived raw 
material, which is helping to improve our 
husbandry of our shale resources.

BREEDON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2017 
WWW.BREEDONGROUP.COM OUR BUSINESS MODEL –
EFFICIENT 
PRODUCTION
We aim to extract the raw material from our 
quarries as efficiently and cost-effectively 
as possible.
I
n our core aggregates operations, we 
aim to extract the raw material – rock 
and sand & gravel – from our quarries 
as efficiently and cost-effectively as 
possible. Rock is blasted from the 
quarry face, crushed and screened 
into a variety of grades for a range of 
applications. Sand & gravel are extracted 
directly from the pit and similarly 
crushed and screened.
There are many determinants of 
a successful quarrying operation. 
For example, it is vital to configure the 
site in such a way that the maximum 
potential reserve is extracted, with as 
little waste as possible. The logistics 
of blasting, loading, transporting and 
processing the material are complex 
and require great technical proficiency, 
well-invested plant and smart utilisation 
of everything from the loading shovels 
and dump trucks to conveyors, crushers 
and screens.
In addition to operating as efficiently 
as possible, quality and environmental 
controls are paramount. Every tonne of 
aggregate needs to be fit for purpose, 
whether its destiny is as a raw material 
for concrete or asphalt, rail ballast, 
coastal armour rock or a multitude of 
other applications. Management of water, 
protection of wildlife, suppression of dust 
and noise and effective management 
of lorry movements are prerequisites 
for environmental licences and good 
community relations.
Close relationships with suppliers are 
essential to optimising use of the quarry 
plant, minimising downtime and ensuring 
that loading and crushing capacity is 
available as needed, particularly given the 
constraints commonly imposed on our 
operating hours by the planning authorities.
The same principles apply in our cement 
works. Although it is a more complex 
process, cement manufacturing requires 
the same mix of technical expertise, 
quality controls and operational 
efficiency, as well as adherence to 
even more stringent environmental 
compliance. We are proud of the fact 
that our Hope Cement Works ended 
the year with a reliability factor of 
97 per cent, which ranks as a world-
class performance.
More important than all these things is 
the safety of our colleagues. Quarries and 
cement plants are inherently dangerous 
places to work and we have a duty of 
care to everyone who works in or visits 
them. We go to great lengths to ensure 
that every area of our quarries is as safe 
as possible and that our colleagues not 
only follow the strict operational rules 
we lay down, but are encouraged to look 
after each other as well as themselves. 
(See pages 43 to 45 for more on our 
health & safety performance.)

STRATEGIC  
REPORT 02 03 04 OUR BUSINESS MODEL –
MAXIMUM 
VALUE ADDED
We aim to maximise the return from every 
tonne of aggregates we extract.
O
ne of our oft-quoted 
Golden Rules is that we will 
maximise the return from 
every tonne of material we 
produce, whether it is rock 
or sand & gravel from our quarries, or 
cementitious products from our cement 
works and import terminals. We achieve 
this through constant innovative product 
development.
For example, in addition to crushed rock 
and sand & gravel, we produce specialist 
decorative aggregates for creative 
landscaping, including Breedon Golden 
Amber self-binding gravel, for which we 
hold the Royal Warrant.
We have nearly 200 concrete plants 
across the UK, some in our quarries, 
some on standalone sites, which mix 
aggregates and cement to produce 
ready-mixed concrete and mortar 
for their local markets. We aim to 
generate the highest possible margin on 
these products by offering an above-
average service and by producing 
high-performance mixes for specialist 
applications, including our proprietary 
range of BREEDONFlow® self-
compacting concretes.
These are complemented by three 
concrete products plants which 
produce a range of concrete blocks 
and paving products, together with the 
highly-regarded Fyfestone range of 
walling products.
We also operate 26 asphalt plants, 
located mainly in our quarries, which 
mix aggregates and bitumen to produce 
coated stone. As with our ready-mixed 
concrete products, we augment a range 
of standard mixes for use on Britain’s 
major and minor roads with a portfolio 
of specialist high-performance, high-
margin asphalt products for applications 
as diverse as car parks, driveways, 
pathways, tennis courts, silos and animal-
house floors. 
Our Hope Cement Works in Derbyshire 
is the largest cement plant in the UK, 
producing quality-assured Portland 
Cement marked by its high quality and 
the distinctiveness and consistency of its 
composition and colour. We maximise 
the margin on our cement by internalising 
as large a proportion as possible to our 
ready-mixed concrete plants, and we also 
produce a range of packed cements, dry-
mixed cementitious mortars and screeds 
for the builders merchants market.

FIRST-CLASS  
DISTRIBUTION  
AND LOGISTICS
We move large quantities of cement, 
minerals, ready-mixed concrete and asphalt 
around the country at a competitive cost.
C
ost-effective delivery of 
heavyside construction 
materials from quarry or plant 
to site requires highly efficient 
logistics management, 
coupled with flexible and responsive 
customer service. Breedon has always 
prided itself on staying local and being 
easy to do business with, which means 
we have no national call centres or 
centralised shipping for our downstream 
products, but instead a network of local 
businesses with an uncompromising 
commitment to outstanding service. 
Our four rail-linked cementitious depots 
and five rail-linked aggregates depots 
enable us to move large quantities of bulk 
cement and minerals across the country 
at a competitive cost, using our own 
and third-party freight wagons. This rail 
distribution network is complemented by 
a fleet of more than 850 delivery vehicles, 
including cement tankers, articulated 
tipper lorries and ready-mixed concrete 
trucks, which deliver direct to customers’ 
sites anywhere from Stornoway in the 
Hebrides to the south coast of England.
The key to efficient distribution of our 
products is a keen understanding of 
our customers’ needs: knowing exactly 
what they want, when and where they 
want it – and adapting our logistics 
planning accordingly. This is particularly 
true of the ready-mixed concrete and 
asphalt markets, because these materials 
are time-limited and prompt delivery 
is crucial.
On-the-ground service standards need 
to be second to none. Our fleet livery is 
the most prominent and widespread face 
of our brand and our professionalism 
when making deliveries has a significant 
potential impact on that brand and 
therefore on our reputation. We pride 
ourselves on both the quality and 
closeness of our customer relations. Nationwide fleet

We are well placed to benefit from projected 
long-term growth in our key markets.
A
s the UK’s largest 
independent construction 
materials group, we are 
well placed to benefit from 
projected long-term growth 
in our key markets.
Industry activity continued to grow in 
2017, albeit at a slower rate, with the 
Construction Products Association (CPA) 
estimating that construction output 
increased by 3.0 per cent (compared 
to 3.8 per cent in 2016). Against this 
background, figures from the Mineral 
Products Association (MPA) indicate that 
sales of key construction materials (apart 
from mortar) remained broadly flat or 
were modestly down over the year. 
As always, there were marked regional 
variations, with some parts of the UK 
significantly outperforming others. 
Our Midlands heartland saw particularly 
healthy growth in volumes of some 
products, along with parts of the north-
west of England and Wales.
There remains substantial pent-up 
demand for construction materials to 
feed the UK building industry over the 
next few years, particularly in areas 
where the Government has signalled 
its commitment to invest for the future. 
Accordingly, construction output is 
expected to rise by 3.7 per cent in the 
three years to 2020, a trend which is 
reflected in MPA volume forecasts over 
the same period.
Significantly, housing and infrastructure 
are expected to grow by 7 .0 per cent 
and 22.8 per cent respectively over the 
next three years and, given that these 
account for the majority of our end-use 
markets, we are strongly positioned to 
take advantage of them.

RETURNING LAND 
TO COMMUNITIES
approx.
30
hectares of land restored 
in 2017
W
e see ourselves as 
stewards of the land 
we quarry. This means 
that environmental 
and safety compliance 
are crucial components of our licence 
to operate and we take them extremely 
seriously. It also means that we consider 
landscaping and restoration to be every 
bit as important as extraction, because 
we understand that we have a duty to 
return the land to our communities in the 
best possible condition when we have 
finished working it.
Over the years we have restored many 
hundreds of hectares of quarried land. 
Restoration has taken a variety of forms, 
from fields returned to agriculture or 
wildlife habitats, to lakes used for leisure 
pursuits – sometimes preceded by landfill 
where there is a pressing local need 
for additional waste disposal facilities. 
We have planted many trees and 
hedgerows and created many acres of 
grassland for grazing.
We begin thinking about how we will 
restore an area of land as soon as 
we begin preparing an application to 
quarry it. It forms a fundamental part 
of our long-term mineral planning 
strategy. We also maintain the closest 
possible links with our local communities 
throughout the life of the quarry to 
ensure we have a clear understanding of 
how they would eventually like the land 
to be repurposed.
We have a duty to return the land to our 
communities in the best possible condition 
when we have finished working it.

KEY  
PERFORMANCE 
INDICATORS 
WHY WE’VE CHOSEN THIS MEASURE:
This metric tracks the Group’s top-line 
growth. We also use it as a risk monitor.
See risks 1 – 8 inc.
HOW WE’VE PERFORMED:
Good progress was made through a 
combination of solid organic growth, 
supplemented by sales contributions from 
acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017.
WHY WE’VE CHOSEN THIS MEASURE:
This metric tracks improvements in the 
relative profitability of the Group and 
enables us to monitor progress against our 
stated objective of achieving a 15 per cent 
underlying EBIT margin by 2020. We also use 
it as a risk monitor.
See risks 1 – 8 inc.
HOW WE’VE PERFORMED:
Our underlying EBIT margin was, as expected, 
diluted by the impact of the acquisition of 
Hope, where historic EBIT margins were 
single-digit.  The impact of this dilution is now 
behind us and we are making good progress 
towards our target.
REMUNERATION LINK:
A component of this measure is used 
to determine award levels of our annual 
cash bonus.
WHY WE’VE CHOSEN THIS MEASURE:
This metric tracks improvements in the 
underlying earnings per share for our 
shareholders. We also use it as a risk monitor.
See risks 1 – 8 inc.
HOW WE’VE PERFORMED:
The 19 per cent annual increase in our 
underlying basic earnings per share in 2017 
reflects the improved performance of the 
business across all three divisions.
REMUNERATION LINK:
This measure is also used to determine award 
levels in our performance share plans.
WHY WE’VE CHOSEN THIS MEASURE:
This metric tracks the ability of the Group 
to generate sufficient cash flows to service 
the needs of the business and to pursue its 
bolt-on acquisition strategy, whilst covering 
its contractual debt-servicing obligations. 
We also use it as a risk monitor. 
See risks 3 & 4
HOW WE’VE PERFORMED:
The Group continued to generate strong 
cash flows in 2017, reducing our net debt by 
a further 31 per cent, to £109.8 million, and 
reducing our leverage to less than one times.
WHY WE’VE CHOSEN THIS MEASURE:
This metric tracks the ability of the Group  
to replenish its reserves and resources.  
We also use it as a risk monitor. 
See risks 3 & 5
HOW WE’VE PERFORMED:
We continued to preserve our asset base in 
2017 and ended the year with total reserves 
and resources of around 750 million tonnes.
WHY WE’VE CHOSEN THIS MEASURE:
This metric tracks our health & safety 
performance and enables us to maintain a 
strong health & safety culture. We also use  
it as a risk monitor. 
See risk 6
HOW WE’VE PERFORMED:
Whilst we reduced our LTIFR in 2017 by  
25 per cent, this fell short of our target 
reduction of 40 per cent, although there 
was a marked decrease in the severity of 
injuries sustained.
REMUNERATION LINK:
This measure is also used to determine the 
level of annual cash bonus.

BREEDON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2017 
WWW.BREEDONGROUP.COM MANAGING  
OUR RISKS AND 
OPPORTUNITIES
By identifying and managing our risks 
effectively we can focus on our long-term 
business opportunities.
T
he Group’s principal risks 
and uncertainties, together 
with examples of mitigants, 
are set out overleaf. They 
do not comprise all the risks 
associated with the Group and are 
not in any order of priority. Additional 
risks not presently known or currently 
deemed to be less material may also 
have an adverse effect on the Group’s 
business in the future.
Risk is an inherent and accepted 
element of doing business and effective 
risk management is fundamental to 
how we run our business. The Group’s 
approach to risk management is to 
identify key risks and then to develop 
actions or processes within the business 
to eliminate or mitigate those risks to an 
acceptable level.
During the year one of our risks 
increased, five remained the same and 
two of our risks reduced.
INCREASED RISKS
The risk that increased related to 
competition and margins. This increase 
recognises the current status of market 
conditions risk and the widely-held view 
that it will be difficult for construction 
to escape the impact that subdued 
economic growth, rising inflation and 
falling real wages will have on the 
industry over the next year or so.
REDUCED RISKS
The two risks that have reduced 
related to acquisitions and IT and 
cyber security. The acquisition risk 
reduction recognises the successful 
integration and performance in respect 
of the 2016 Hope acquisition. The IT 
& cyber security reduction reflects 
the successful migration of Hope 
onto the Breedon IT applications and 
infrastructure but also recognises the 
evolving cyber threat.
RISK APPETITE
The Group’s risk appetite is reviewed 
annually and approved by the Board in 
order to guide management. It defines 
the level of risk the Group is willing to 
accept in pursuit of its strategy.
RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
Risk-owners / Senior Management Team
Directors and senior managers ensure that the Risk Management Framework is  
implemented effectively within their respective business areas. Their key responsibilities 
include ensuring an effective risk culture is in place, with risk management embedded in 
the business.
Group Controls Manager
Works with the divisions to identify and assess the key risks and controls in their businesses 
and reports them to the Group Finance Director.
Facilitates the embedding and monitoring of the Board’s agreed Risk Management Process 
within the business, under the direction of the Group Finance Director.

CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
FINANCIAL RESULTS
2
017 was one of the most 
productive years in our history. 
We completed the integration 
of our largest-ever acquisition, 
concluded two bolt-on 
purchases and announced an important 
transaction with Tarmac Holdings 
Limited (Tarmac) that, subject to 
approval by the competition authorities, 
will see us streamline our ready-mixed 
concrete network in exchange for a 
substantial new reserve of minerals and 
a strategically valuable asphalt plant. 
This did not, however, distract us from 
our operational focus and we once again 
delivered a solid financial performance.
Group revenues for the year grew by 43 
per cent to £652.4 million and underlying 
earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) 
increased by 35 per cent to £80.4 million, 
including a full-year contribution from 
Hope Construction Materials Limited 
(Hope). This equates to an underlying 
EBIT margin of 12.3 per cent and we are 
making good progress towards our 2020 
target of 15 per cent.
Profit before tax rose by 52 per cent 
to £71.2 million and underlying basic 
earnings per share increased by 19 per 
cent to 4.14 pence. The Group continued 
to generate a healthy cash flow and, even 
after the substantial investments made 
during the year, we ended 2017 with a 
significantly stronger balance sheet than 
we entered it.
Your Group Chief Executive provides 
more details on our performance in the 
following pages.
A YEAR OF FURTHER GROWTH
We believe that what distinguishes us 
from our competitors is our willingness 
to go beyond reasonable expectations 
to deliver an exceptional service to our 
customers. This applies whether we 
are delivering a few metres of concrete 
for a garage floor, or servicing a major 
road scheme. In fact, as Breedon has 
matured, we have become increasingly 
involved in critical industrial, commercial 
and infrastructure projects which have 
demanded strategic partnerships 
with some of the country’s leading 
national companies. 
The foundations of the Group are our 
aggregates reserves and at the end of 
2017 we had around 750 million tonnes 
of mineral reserves and resources, with 
further reserves due to be added to 
our portfolio following completion of 
our planned acquisition of a number of 
quarries from Tarmac. 
We have a very straightforward mission:  
to be the safest and most profitable 
company in our industry. This ambition 
drives all our decision-making.”

many of our sites. Once again, organic 
growth was balanced with selected 
bolt-on purchases. We invested around 
£10 million in acquisitions during 2017, 
which extended our market reach and 
added further to our reserves and 
resources. The Group now has an even 
stronger platform for growth, with a 
national presence, enhanced product 
portfolio, robust central management 
functions and an exceptionally strong 
asset base.
PROGRESS ON SAFETY
Around 2,200 colleagues now work 
in the Breedon Group and in 2017 we 
intensified our efforts to ensure that they 
all go home safely at the end of every 
working day. This took on an even greater 
importance in light of the tragically high 
number of fatalities in our industry last 
year. We maintain our ambition to be 
the safest, as well as the most profitable, 
construction materials company in the UK 
and we firmly believe that with the right 
culture of safe behaviour, Zero Harm is a 
realistic goal. I am pleased to say that the 
number of serious injuries declined last 
year, as our new Safety Commitments 
became firmly embedded in the business 
and colleagues took greater care of 
themselves and each other.
SENIOR MANAGEMENT CHANGES
Ashley Bryan stepped down as 
Managing Director of Breedon Cement 
and left the Group in early 2017, to be 
succeeded by Interim Managing Director 
Tim Billingham.
Following the departure of Tim Hall 
from the Group in September, we 
were recently joined by Mike Pearce as 
Chief Executive of Breedon Southern. 
Mike was formerly Managing Director 
of the aggregates division of Aggregate 
Industries, where he had also been 
responsible at various times for the 
company’s building products, asphalt, 
ready-mixed concrete, contracting and 
commercial activities. 
I would like to take this opportunity to 
welcome Mike to the Group and to thank 
Colin Parke for his interim leadership 
of Breedon Southern over the past 
six months.
THE BOARD
We are today announcing Simon Vivian’s 
retirement from the Board and he will be 
stepping down with immediate effect. 
Simon and I worked closely together 
on the creation of Breedon and he did 
distinguished service as the Group’s chief 
executive from 2010 to 2015. He retires 
with our thanks for the significant 
contribution he made to the Group’s early 
development and we wish him well in all 
his future endeavours. Following Simon’s 
departure, and recognising the need 
to maintain the right mix of skills and 
experience, we have commenced a 
formal search process to seek two new 
independent non-executive directors.
LOOKING AHEAD
Our business is in great shape and we 
are well positioned to benefit from the 
medium-term growth in residential and 
infrastructure development, to which the 
majority of our material is supplied.
As I have said in the past, our dividend 
policy remains constantly under review. 
We still believe that continuing to deliver 
capital growth, by reinvesting our 
resources in the organic development 
of our business and in earnings-
enhancing acquisitions, is the best way 
of rewarding our shareholders for the 
foreseeable future.
We also keep our Alternative Investment 
Market (AIM) quotation under review. 
We feel no particular pressure to transfer 
to the main market whilst AIM continues 
to provide us with a platform from 
which to pursue our growth ambitions, 
but do not rule out a full listing in the 
longer term.
I would like to thank everyone in 
Breedon, together with all our contract 
hauliers and the many companies who 
do business with us, for their continued 
enthusiastic support for the Group. I am 
particularly pleased that so many of our 
colleagues are themselves shareholders 
in Breedon, thanks in part to widespread 
participation in our Sharesave scheme.
We look to 2018 and beyond with 
confidence and optimism.

STRATEGIC  
REPORT 02 03 04 TRADING PERFORMANCE
W
e made good 
progress in 2017, with 
volumes and revenues 
comfortably ahead of 
the prior year. These 
included a full-year contribution from 
Hope, which was fully integrated into 
the Group less than 12 months after 
completion of the acquisition, and from 
Sherburn Minerals Limited (Sherburn).
We delivered healthy growth in volumes 
of aggregates and ready-mixed concrete, 
with asphalt volumes broadly maintained, 
against the background of more difficult 
markets, exacerbated by some major 
project delays and challenging weather 
towards the end of the year. It is also 
important to note that our revenue 
growth reflects - and will continue to 
reflect - the increasing internalisation of 
aggregates and cement following the 
acquisition of Hope.
Group revenues rose by 43 per cent to 
£652.4 million, generating underlying 
EBIT of £80.4 million and an underlying 
EBIT margin of 12.3 per cent. We remain 
committed to achieving a medium-term 
underlying EBIT margin target of 15 per 
cent by 2020. The Group continued to be 
strongly cash-generative, with net debt 
reduced by a further 31 per cent to just 
under £110 million.
All three divisions delivered improved 
performances, reflecting a resolute 
emphasis on outstanding customer 
service, coupled with rigorous cost 
control and a sharpened focus on 
operating efficiency. The businesses are 
each reviewed by their respective leaders 
on pages 29 to 37 .
THE MARKET
Construction output continued to grow 
in 2017, rising by three per cent despite 
a softening of the market during the 
second and third quarters. As always, 
there were marked geographical 
disparities, with generally stronger 
demand in England than in Scotland 
and many regional variances within both 
countries. Growth was led by healthy 
increases in residential and infrastructure 
development, which together account for 
the majority of our end-use markets.
A summary of 2017 market conditions 
and the outlook for 2018 can be found on

BREEDON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2017 
WWW.BREEDONGROUP.COM ORGANIC DEVELOPMENT
Once again we invested well ahead 
of depreciation in mineral assets, 
capacity and operational improvements 
throughout the Group, including three 
new quarries, which will facilitate further 
internalisation of material to our concrete 
and asphalt plants.
We have a long-term ambition to 
strengthen our position in the UK 
asphalt market and to this end in 2017 
we commenced installation of a new 
plant at our rail-linked quarry at Dowlow 
in Derbyshire and a replacement plant 
at our Furnace quarry in Scotland. 
The planned acquisition of Minffordd 
quarry from Tarmac will give us another 
new plant, expanding our asphalt 
network to 28 plants nationwide.
Investments last year in equipment 
upgrades at Tom’s Forest and Dowlow 
quarries are already producing 
improved performances. We have also 
been operating formal OEE (Overall 
Equipment Effectiveness) and REE 
(Running Equipment Effectiveness) 
programmes for some time at selected 
sites in Breedon Southern and these are 
now being rolled out across Breedon 
Northern. They are enabling us to make 
clearly measurable improvements to 
the efficiency and running costs of our 
fixed plant and drive selective capital 
investment, thereby ensuring that all 
our operations are fit for purpose in the 
years ahead.
We completed a major planned 
programme of capital investment 
in Breedon Cement, encompassing 
significant upgrades to our Hope Cement 
Works, quarry equipment and road and 
rail fleets.
ACQUISITIONS
In May we secured another valuable 
route to market for our aggregates and 
cement with the purchase of Pro Mini Mix 
Concrete, Mortars and Screeds Limited 
(Pro Mini Mix), a mini mix operator in 
the West Midlands. This was followed in 
August by the acquisition of Humberside 
Aggregates Limited (Humberside 
Aggregates), bringing with it around 
three million tonnes of mineral reserves, 
opening up new markets for us in East 
Yorkshire and Humberside and enabling 
us to internalise supplies to our concrete 
plants in the region.
Q&A
Group CEO answers key 
questions on 2017
Q:
What were the highlights of 2017?
A:
The integration of Hope, which we completed shortly before the 
first anniversary of closing the deal, was a major achievement 
for everyone concerned. The entire Group is now on a common 
IT platform, with strong and well-structured central functions, 
well equipped to service Breedon through the next stage of 
its development. We were also very pleased to complete the 
acquisitions of Pro Mini Mix and Humberside Aggregates, 
which expanded our service network and brought us additional 
reserves of valuable minerals. Our planned acquisition of 
quarries and an asphalt plant from Tarmac is an elegant means 
of acquiring additional reserves and asphalt capacity, whilst 
simultaneously streamlining our ready-mixed concrete network.
Q:
How do you maintain Breedon’s unique culture as you 
continue to grow?
A:
It is obvious that, as the Group grows, we need more robust 
processes. But that does not mean making those processes 
lengthier. We will keep our reporting lines short, our central 
overhead to a minimum, and devolve as much responsibility as 
possible to our managers – giving them the training they need 
to assume accountability with confidence. Investment decisions 
will continue to be made quickly and we will remain close to 
our customers, continuing to give them the outstanding service 
they have come to expect from us, whether they are small local 
purchasers or one of the many major national concerns with 
which we are increasingly partnering.
Q:
What are you doing about succession-planning?
A:
We decided very soon after the acquisition of Hope to 
restructure our management on Regional and Area General 
Manager lines, in order to ensure that we had ambitious and 
capable people in those key roles on which the business 
depends. All our General Managers run substantial businesses 
in their own right and they provide us with an excellent pool 
of talent on which to draw in the future. We are supporting 
them with significant investment in training and leadership 
development, so that each of them is properly equipped to reach 
their full potential as future leaders of the business.
Q:
What criteria do you use to decide how and where to invest 
in the business?
A:
We have always said that Breedon will expand through 
a combination of acquisitions and organic growth. 
Acquisitions must be earnings-enhancing, bring tangible 
strategic benefits and deliver meaningful value for our 
shareholders. The same is true of organic investment: we apply 
rigorous tests to every item of capital expenditure, demanding 
a healthy rate of return and speedy payback. We also make 
decisions fast: if the case for expenditure is strong and 
well presented, we can give it approval within days or even 
hours. This approach has enabled us to deliver widespread 
performance improvements in our quarries and plants. 
27
01
STRATEGIC  
REPORT 02 03 04 We have a business of significant scale 
and national reach with fully vertically 
integrated operations, from cement 
production at the UK’s largest plant to 
an extensive network of downstream 
product units. The addition of two 
cementitious import terminals has also 
opened up new strategic relationships 
with European producers which will 
potentially bring valuable benefits in 
the future.
We have a tried and tested operational 
management team who have the 
experience and bandwidth to exploit new 
market and acquisition opportunities 
to the full in the years ahead, backed 
by robust processes which ensure that 
we can move quickly when potential 
investments become available. 
Furthermore, the consolidation of 
our back-office systems following the 
acquisition of Hope has given us capacity 
to further expand the Group without 
adding materially to our overhead.
There is no doubt that 2018 will continue 
to be challenging in some areas of the 
construction market. However, our bias 
towards housebuilding and infrastructure 
development will ensure that we are well 
positioned to take advantage of healthy 
forecast growth in these sectors and 
we also have further acquisitions in the 
pipeline. We therefore remain confident 
of our ability to continue delivering value 
for our shareholders in the current and 
future years.

In December, we announced the planned 
acquisition of four quarries and an 
asphalt plant from Tarmac, in exchange 
for 27 of our ready-mixed concrete plants 
and a cash payment of £4.9 million. 
This acquisition is in line with our strategy 
of expanding our aggregates portfolio 
and streamlining our concrete network, 
whilst enabling us to replace third-party 
aggregates providers with our own 
sources of supply. Subject to approval 
from the Competition and Markets 
Authority (CMA), the transaction is 
expected to be completed in the next 
couple of months.
SAFETY
We set out in 2017 to embed a culture 
of safer behaviour in the business, 
encouraging all our colleagues to 
recognise the importance of moving 
towards Zero Harm. This led to a 
further 25 per cent reduction in the 
frequency of employee lost-time injuries 
across the Group which, although 
not as great a reduction as we had 
targeted, is nonetheless an encouraging 
improvement. I am particularly pleased 
to note a significant fall in the severity of 
injuries reported, which signals that our 
colleagues are embracing the challenge 
to make Breedon a safer place to work.
A detailed review of our safety activities 
is provided within the Corporate Social 
Responsibility review on pages 43 to 45.
OUTLOOK
Breedon is an appreciably stronger 
and more strategically well positioned 
business today than it was two years 
ago. The acquisition of Hope, followed by 
Sherburn, Pro Mini Mix and Humberside 
Aggregates, have consolidated our 
position as the UK’s leading independent 
construction materials producer. Our  
planned acquisition of quarrying and 
asphalt assets from Tarmac will give us an 
even more powerful platform for growth.

OUR PERFORMANCE –
BREEDON 
NORTHERN
Alan Mackenzie
Chief Executive, Breedon Northern
TRADING SUMMARY
B
reedon Northern delivered 
a solid performance in 2017, 
underpinned by major projects 
and in the face of highly 
competitive market conditions, 
especially in the second half of the year, 
which were exacerbated by relatively 
low local authority expenditure and 
a subdued market around Aberdeen. 
Total revenues were ahead 13 per cent 
to £196.0 million, generating a three 
per cent increase in underlying EBIT to 
£20.4 million.
2017 ACHIEVEMENTS
• Solid performance in competitive market
• Integration of Hope & Sherburn completed
• New quarry opened in northern England
• Management strengthened
• Agreement on planned acquisition of 
quarries from Tarmac
KEY ACHIEVEMENTS
The integration of the northern 
operations of Hope was completed 
on 1 January, followed by Sherburn 
on 1 March. This was followed by the 
opening of a new North-East Regional 
Office at our Raisby quarry in County 
Durham, generating significant savings 
from the release of two office rentals 
and enabling us to bring the former 
Hope and Sherburn teams together in a 
single location.
We continued to supply material to 
both the first phase of the A9 dualling 
project, completed in the second half 
of the year, and the Aberdeen Western 
Peripheral Route (AWPR); major 
additional aggregates and concrete 
volumes were supplied directly and 
asphalt was supplied and laid to the latter 
through our Breedon Whitemountain Ltd 
(Breedon Whitemountain) joint venture. 
Subsequent to the year-end, Carillion 
– one of the three shareholders of the 
Aberdeen Roads Limited consortium 
responsible for the AWPR contract – 
entered liquidation. Due to the joint and 
several liability structure of the contract 
held by the consortium, we expect the 
project to be completed by the remaining 
parties with no adverse financial impact  
on Breedon Whitemountain or 
Breedon Northern.
Despite a temporary pause in investment 
in new energy projects in Scotland, 
Mobile Concrete Solutions, our 
unincorporated joint venture with TSL 
Contractors, ended the year well by 
securing a substantial concrete order 
from Morrison Construction for a new 
wind farm at Dorenell in Moray.

OUR PERFORMANCE –
BREEDON NORTHERN CONTINUED
MAJOR INVESTMENTS
New mineral reserves were secured 
during the year. We opened a new sand 
& gravel quarry at Low Harperley near 
Durham - the only active sand & gravel 
source in County Durham - which will 
enable us to internalise the supply of 
more material to our concrete plants. 
Further investments were made in 
commencing replacement of our asphalt 
plant at Furnace quarry near Inverary and 
installing a new wash plant at our Tom’s 
Forest quarry near Aberdeen, which will 
enable us to fully exploit a valuable sand 
resource in the overburden. In addition,  
we invested in new crushing and 
screening equipment to improve the 
performance of our mobile crushing 
trains and in a new mobile concrete 
plant which will support the supply of 
ready-mixed concrete to a potash mine 
in Yorkshire.
STRENGTHENED MANAGEMENT
Following the integration of the former 
Hope and Sherburn businesses, we 
restructured our Regional and Area 
Management teams to better serve 
the needs of the enlarged division. 
This included the appointment of a new 
Regional Director for the northern half of 
the division, together with a number of 
senior contracting operations managers. 
We also embarked on a programme 
of coaching and mentoring for our 
Area General Managers with a view to 
improving our succession planning. 
OUTLOOK
As we look to the remainder of 2018, 
we enter the final stages of the AWPR 
project and we expect Transport 
Scotland to begin preparations for the 
next phase of the A9 dualling project 
between Luncarty and Birnam, from 
which we hope to benefit in due course. 
We will also be preparing for BEAR 
Scotland’s new 5G highway maintenance 
contract, for which the tendering process 
will begin towards the end of the year.
The market is likely to continue to 
be challenging this year and, in the 
absence of significant market growth, 
we will focus on further cost control and 
operational efficiency improvements. 
Earlier this year we opened a new 
greenfield hard rock quarry at North 
Drumboy, about 10 miles from 
Glasgow and we have a new concrete 
plant proposed at Port Dundas, to 
serve the growing Glasgow market. 
We will continue to evaluate bolt-on 
acquisitions where we can secure value 
for shareholders.
Our planned acquisition of quarries from 
Tarmac will bring valuable benefits, 
plugging gaps in our mineral resources 
and providing us with strategically 
valuable new sources of aggregates.
Finally, I would like to thank all our 
colleagues for their efforts in 2017 and I 
look forward to making our business an 
even safer place to work in 2018.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS
2
017 was a year of major 
change for Breedon Southern, 
dominated by the full IT and 
operational integration of the 
former Hope operations, which 
was completed in less than a year and 
transformed the scale and reach of the 
division. Notwithstanding the challenges 
of the integration, Breedon Southern’s 
management remained focused on the 
commercial opportunities available to 
the business and recorded some marked 
successes during the year.
Major contract wins included the supply 
of materials to the six million square 
feet East Midlands Gateway scheme, 
the largest multi-modal project of its 
kind in the UK. We also won significant 
work at Manchester International 
Airport and from a wide range of 
groundwork specialists servicing the 
buoyant housebuilding industry. 
Supplies continued to the £53 million 
Newtown bypass through our Breedon 
Bowen Limited (Breedon Bowen) joint 
venture at Welshpool and to Jaguar Land 
Rover through our contracting business.
MAJOR INVESTMENTS
Our investments in 2017 were geared 
primarily to growing our mineral 
reserves and resources and improving 
the performance of our key strategic 
quarries. In August we completed the 
£9 million acquisition of Humberside 
Aggregates, giving us around three 
million tonnes of additional reserves in 
the important markets of East Yorkshire 
and Humberside, with the potential to 
secure additional reserves in the future. 
Works were also completed at Earls 
Barton quarry in Northamptonshire, 
which enabled us to open this new site  
in early 2018, providing access to 
a further source of scarce sand & 
gravel reserves.
We made substantial investments in 
our existing major quarries, notably 
at Dowlow, our flagship rail-linked 
quarry in Derbyshire, where we are 
seeing significant benefits flowing 
from improved operational efficiencies. 
Installation of a new asphalt plant at 
Dowlow is also well underway and we 
expect it to be operational in the first  
half of this year.
In May we invested in the expansion of 
our successful mini mix business, 1stMix, 
with the complementary acquisition of 
Pro Mini Mix, which extended our reach 
into the West Midlands. 
OUTLOOK
We expect the market to continue 
to be challenging this year. However, 
we already have a strong order book, 
including further work on the East 
Midlands Gateway and Newtown bypass, 
and will as always seek to exploit all the 
commercial opportunities available to us. 
We see potential for incremental 
development of our ready-mixed 
concrete portfolio in certain key markets, 
particularly in light of the planned 
streamlining of our network with the 
divestment to Tarmac of 25 of Breedon 
Southern’s peripheral plants.
2017 was a challenging year for all our 
colleagues and I would like to thank 
them personally for their hard work and 
dedication. As we look forward to the 
remainder of this year, our priority will be 
to ensure that they keep themselves and 
those they work with as safe as possible, 
as we aspire to achieve our target of 
Zero Harm.

Tim Billingham
Interim Managing Director, 
Breedon Cement
TRADING SUMMARY
B
reedon Cement traded 
strongly in 2017, with an 
accelerating performance 
in the second half following 
completion in the first six 
months of both annual maintenance and 
upgrade shutdowns. Total revenues rose 
to £141.6 million, generating underlying 
EBIT of £25.8 million. 
These results were delivered against 
the background of generally softer UK 
volumes of ready-mixed concrete, one of 
our principal routes to market, coupled 
with high levels of cement imports, which 
combined to intensify competition in the 
bulk cement market.
2017 ACHIEVEMENTS
• Strong trading performance
• Plant reliability ahead of budget
• Import terminals integrated
• Bagged cement building solid  
customer base
• Major investment programme completed
• Logistics and service functions streamlined
KEY ACHIEVEMENTS
As planned, we have internalised cement 
supplies to the great majority of Breedon 
Southern’s concrete plants.
One of our primary goals in 2017 was 
to further enhance the reliability of 
our cement plant in the Hope valley. 
Following two major kiln shutdowns, two 
kiln pit-stops and a cement mill shutdown 
– all completed safely, on time and on 
budget – the reliability factor of the plant 
at the year-end reached 97 per cent, a 
world-class level of performance.
Our two import terminals at Blyth and 
Dundee, which were acquired as part of 
the Sherburn acquisition in November 
2016, were successfully integrated into 
the division, enabling us to expand 
our cementitious business through the 
importation of cement and ground 
granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS). 
They also provide a complementary 
source of supply and back-up support to 
our main cement plant.
Our new bagged cement range, 
launched towards the end of 2016, has 
performed in line with our expectations, 
building a solid core customer base 
among builders merchants in the south-
east of England. We are seeking to 
establish a strong competitive advantage 
in this business through a fast and 
responsive service to customers, coupled 
with an innovative loyalty scheme for 
both merchants and builders.

CAPITAL INVESTMENT
We completed a major programme 
of capital investment during the year, 
including a fleet of new tractor units and 
powder tankers; upgrades to the pre-
heater riser, kiln feed and rail line at Hope 
Works; and a replacement excavator at 
the limestone quarry. 
IMPROVED LOGISTICS AND SERVICE
Another priority for 2017 was to 
streamline our logistics and customer 
service operations. We have now 
completed a restructuring of these 
functions, which will enable us to improve 
our service delivery and drive greater 
efficiencies through both our in-house 
and contracted fleets. 
OUTLOOK
Looking ahead to the remainder of 2018, 
we will be focused on maximising value 
from every tonne of cement we produce, 
delivering further efficiency gains and 
cost-savings through selective capital 
investment and pushing for continual 
improvements in the performance and 
reliability of our plant.
We will also be accelerating our shale 
replacement project, sourcing increased 
quantities of pulverised fly ash (PFA) 
as a shale substitute, to ensure that we 
have in place a sustainable alternative 
source of waste-derived raw material for 
the cement-making mix by the middle 
of 2019.
We will be paying close attention 
to customer segmentation and will 
further extend the geographical spread 
of our bagged cement customers, 
whilst ensuring that our service levels 
are maintained.

In light of the planned divestment of a 
number of the Group’s concrete plants 
to Tarmac, we are currently reviewing 
the configuration of our rail network to 
ensure that we optimise utilisation of our 
rail fleet. 
We recognise that none of our 
achievements would be possible without 
a supportive and collaborative workforce 
and we will be working hard in 2018 to 
ensure that all our colleagues are well 
engaged and – above all – that they keep 
themselves and each other safe as we 
continue our drive towards Zero Harm.

ACQUISITIONS
I
n May we acquired Pro Mini Mix, a 
mini mix concrete operator based 
at Oldbury in the Black Country 
and covering the West Midlands. 
In addition, in August we acquired 
Humberside Aggregates, a leading 
independent sand & gravel quarry and 
aggregates merchanting business based 
at North Cave near Hull in East Yorkshire.
The consideration in respect of these 
acquisitions was £9.7 million.
REVENUE AND UNDERLYING PROFIT 
FROM OPERATIONS
During the year we again delivered 
strong organic earnings growth, 
supplemented by healthy contributions 
from our recent acquisitions (those 
completed during 2016 and 2017), the 
most significant of these being the 
August 2016 acquisition of Hope.
Group aggregates volumes for 
the year were up 40 per cent at 
16.0 million tonnes, asphalt volumes were 
comparable at 1.9 million tonnes and 
ready-mixed concrete volumes were up 
74 per cent at 3.3 million cubic metres. 
Excluding acquisitions, aggregates 
volumes were up five per cent and 
asphalt and concrete volumes were flat. 
In accordance with the Cement Market 
Data Order 2016, cement volumes are 
not disclosed.
Revenue for the year at £652.4 million 
was 43 per cent ahead of 2016 
(£454.7 million). Excluding acquisitions it 
was broadly in line with the prior year.
Our volumes were delivered against the 
background of generally softer markets 
in 2017, coupled with major project 
delays and adverse weather conditions 
towards the end of the year. Our revenue 
was also impacted by the increasing 
internalisation of aggregates and cement 
only made possible as a result of the 
Hope acquisition in 2016. Internal cement 
sales grew by four percentage points 
to 41 per cent and internal aggregates 
sales into ready-mixed concrete by three 
percentage points to 19 per cent.
During the year we again delivered strong 
organic earnings growth, supplemented 
by healthy contributions from our recent 
acquisitions.”

BREEDON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2017 
WWW.BREEDONGROUP.COM Underlying EBIT was £80.4 million, 35 
per cent ahead of 2016 (£59.6 million). 
Underlying results are stated before 
acquisition-related expenses, redundancy 
and reorganisation costs, property items, 
amortisation of acquisition intangibles 
and related tax items.
Underlying EBIT improved in all three 
divisions, although the overall underlying 
EBIT margin for the Group at 12.3 per 
cent was, as expected, diluted by the 
impact of the acquisition of Hope, where 
historic EBIT margins were single-digit. 
The impact of this dilution is now behind 
us and we are making good progress 
towards our 2020 underlying EBIT margin 
target of 15 per cent.
EBIT includes our share of profit from 
associate and joint ventures (net of 
tax). We have three such entities: BEAR 
Scotland Limited, Breedon Bowen and 
Breedon Whitemountain.
NON-UNDERLYING ITEMS
Non-underlying items in the year 
amounted to a net pre-tax cost of 
£2.8 million (2016: £8.4 million), the 
major item being redundancy and 
reorganisation costs of £2.5 million 
primarily in respect of the integration of 
Hope, which has now been completed.
INTEREST
Net finance costs in the year totalled 
£6.4 million (2016: £4.5 million) and 
included interest on the Group’s 
bank facilities, amortisation of bank 
arrangement fees, interest on finance 
leases and the unwinding of discounting 
on provisions. The higher costs in 2017 
reflect the higher level of borrowings 
following the 2016 acquisition of Hope.
PROFIT BEFORE TAX
Profit before taxation was £71.2 million, 
52 per cent ahead of 2016 (£46.8 million). 
Underlying profit before tax was 
£74.0 million, 34 per cent ahead of 2016 
(£55.1 million).
TAX
The tax charge was £14.2 million 
(2016: £10.0 million). An underlying tax 
charge of £14.7 million (2016: £11.2 million) 
was recorded in the year, resulting in 
an underlying effective tax rate for the 
full year of 19.8 per cent, reflecting the 
effect of costs for which no tax relief can 
be obtained.
The Group’s tax strategy is to comply 
with all relevant regulations whilst 
managing the total tax burden and 
seeking to maintain a stable effective 
tax rate. The Group seeks to achieve this 
through operating an uncomplicated 
Group structure. 
The Group endeavours to structure its 
affairs in a tax-efficient manner where 
there is commercial benefit in doing so, 
with the aim of supporting investment in 
the business and its capital expenditure 
programmes. It seeks to ensure that all 
tax affairs are administered in a lawful 
and responsible manner, and its actions 
do not adversely impact its reputation as 
a responsible taxpayer. The parameters 
which govern the Group’s approach are 
set by the Board, which regularly reviews 
the Group’s tax strategy.
The Board and Audit Committee are kept 
informed of all material developments 
relating to the Group’s tax position on a 
regular basis. The Group Tax Manager 
oversees tax compliance activities 
on a day-to-day basis and reports to 
senior management.
There is an integrated approach to  
governance across the business through 
management control, policies, procedures 
and training. Risks inherent in the 
calculation, collection and payment of 
tax are mitigated by documented policies 
and procedures. On an annual basis, the 
Group carries out a review for the purpose 
of complying with the Senior Accounting 
Officer legislation.
The Group takes appropriate tax advice 
and support from reputable professional 
firms in relation to any tax planning 
considerations. It is open and transparent 
in its dealings with HM Revenue & Customs 
(HMRC) and deals with any queries in 
a timely and open manner and on a  
full-disclosure basis. In areas of complexity, 
it is proactive in engaging with HMRC.

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
The Group’s tax liabilities arise in the UK 
subsidiary companies. In terms of the  
UK corporation tax position, all years 
up to 2015 are agreed in respect of 
companies acquired prior to 2016. 
The Group is responsible for paying and 
submitting computations and returns 
in respect of Corporation Tax, National 
Insurance, Aggregates Levy and other 
taxes including VAT and PAYE. 
The Group makes a significant 
contribution to the economy through 
taxation, either borne by the Group 
or collected on behalf of, and paid to, 
HMRC. In 2017, the total taxes borne and 
collected by the Group amounted to over 
£110 million (2016: over £90 million).
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share (EPS) for the 
year were 3.98 pence (2016: 2.92 pence), 
reported after the non-underlying items 
mentioned above. Underlying basic 
EPS for the year totalled 4.14 pence 
(2016: 3.49 pence).
DIVIDENDS
Subject to availability of distributable 
reserves, dividends will be paid to 
shareholders when the directors 
believe it is appropriate and prudent 
to do so. However, at present the main 
focus of the Group continues to be on 
delivering continued capital growth 
for shareholders.
STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION
Net assets at 31 December 2017 were 
£528.1 million (2016: £467 .5 million).
The net assets continue to be 
underpinned by the mineral reserves 
and resources of the Group, which at the 
end of December 2017 totalled around 
750 million tonnes.
CASH FLOW
Cash generated from operating activities 
was £117 .2 million (2016: £80.8 million).
In addition to delivering short-term 
earnings growth and optimising working 
capital, we are positioning the Group 
for the longer term and, as part of that, 
we are investing in the business, adding 
acquisitions where these make sense 
both strategically and financially and 
investing further in plant and equipment.
During 2017 the Group spent £9.2 million 
cash on two acquisitions, Pro Mini 
Mix and Humberside Aggregates 
(2016: £57 .1 million on Hope and 
Sherburn), and incurred a cash spend 
on capital expenditure projects of 
£46.2 million (2016: £23.7 million). 
Further details of this expenditure can be 
found in the Business Reviews on pages 
29 to 37 .
Proceeds from the sale of property, 
plant and equipment totalled £3.2 million 
in 2017 (2016: £10.1 million). The 2016 
proceeds included an instalment of 
£2.8 million from the 2014 sale of the 
60-acre former concrete products plant 
site at Doseley near Telford in Shropshire, 
together with the proceeds of the 
Hope divestments that were required 
to be made by the Competition and 
Markets Authority.
Repayments of loans during the year 
totalled £26.6 million (2016: £205.1 million). 
The 2016 repayment (and proceeds from 
new loans raised) reflected the refinancing 
that took place on the acquisition of Hope. 
Repayment of finance lease obligations 
totalled £5.7 million (2016: £7 .2 million), 
which reflects the fact that the majority 
of property, plant and equipment 
purchases during the year were for cash.

WWW.BREEDONGROUP.COM NET DEBT
Net debt at 31 December 2017 was 
£109.8 million (2016: £159.3 million).
Key movements are shown in the chart 
above and include: underlying earnings 
before our share of associate and joint 
ventures, interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation (EBITDA) of £117 .0 million 
(2016: £83.7 million); tax paid of 
£12.1 million (2016: £8.3 million); purchase 
of property, plant and equipment of 
£46.2 million (2016: £30.7 million), 
including £Nil (2016: £7 .0 million) 
financed by way of new finance leases; 
and expenditure on acquisitions of 
£9.7 million.
Leverage (the ratio of net debt to 
EBITDA) at 31 December 2017 was less 
than one times which, after taking into 
account the acquisition of Hope in 2016, 
clearly demonstrates the cash-generative 
nature of the Group.
BANK FACILITIES
At the time of completing the acquisition 
of Hope in 2016, we entered into a new 
£300 million committed revolving credit 
facility agreement with Barclays Bank 
PLC, HSBC Bank plc, The Royal Bank 
of Scotland plc and Santander UK plc. 
This facility expires in November 2019 and 
contains a £100 million accordion option.
The facility is subject to a floating 
interest rate based on LIBOR plus 
margin. At 31 December 2017, the 
total undrawn facility available to the 
Group amounted to £173.0 million 
(2016: £148.0 million). The facility is 
subject to Group leverage and Group 
interest cover covenants which are tested 
half-yearly. At 31 December 2017, the 
Group comfortably complied with these 
two covenants. Based on our current 
estimates, we expect to comply with all 
our covenants for the foreseeable future. 
Lastly, the Group has in place an 
interest rate hedge which mitigates 
the risk of interest rate rises on the 
Group’s bank loans (see note 20 to the 
Financial Statements).

RESPONSIBILITY REVIEW
1. HEALTH  
& SAFETY
T
he safety of our colleagues is 
our top priority. It is the first 
item on the agenda at every 
meeting of the Board and 
Executive Committee. We 
have set ourselves the goal of achieving 
Zero Harm across the Group, which we 
can only hope to attain with the active 
cooperation of everyone in our business, 
starting with the senior leadership team 
whose responsibility it is to ensure that a 
safe environment is maintained at all our 
operations.
We of course comply with all relevant 
health & safety legislation, but go 
well beyond this requirement by 
encouraging all our colleagues to actively 
involve themselves in the pursuit of 
continuous improvement in health & 
safety standards.
HOW WE MEASURE AND MONITOR
We monitor and review our safety record 
continuously and comprehensive safety 
reports are produced regularly for the 
Board. Our principal KPI is our Employee 
Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR), 
which measures the number of lost-time 
injuries (those which result in time off work 
for at least one day or shift) per million 
hours worked, augmented by our Total 
Injury Frequency Rate (TIFR) and Total 
Lost Time Injury Severity Rate, which 
helps us to gauge the seriousness of those 
accidents which result in lost time. 
All these measures are essentially lagging 
indicators, and if we are to improve them, 
our focus must be on improving the 
embedded safety culture in our business. 
We strongly believe that the best way to 
do this is by enhancing the competence 
of our supervisors and encouraging 
our senior management to actively 
and regularly engage with colleagues 
employed or deployed on our sites. 
We therefore place a heavy emphasis 
on Visible Felt Leadership (VFL), led by 
the Executive Committee and requiring 
all our managers to spend a significant 
proportion of their time out in the 
business interacting with our operational 
teams. We closely monitor the number 
of VFL interactions carried out across 
the Group and the recommendations 
they contain for areas to improve, and 
we ensure consistent implementation of 
improvements in all three divisions.
We also formally report monthly on the 
number of Safety Observations made 
by colleagues throughout the business. 
These Observations record instances of 
unsafe behaviour or unsafe conditions 
and/or breaches of safety rules. Root-
cause analysis and consequence 
management are crucial elements of 
accident and near-miss reviews.
Our ambition is to be the safest, as well as 
the most profitable, construction materials 
company in the UK.

REPORT 02 03 04 KEY PRIORITIES 
FOR 2018
• Improve site standards 
and housekeeping
• Increase support for 
front-line managers  
and supervisors
• Improve driver, vehicle 
and traffic 
management
• Sharpen focus on 
contractor safety
• Enhance 
communication and 
engagement with 
colleagues
HOW WE PERFORMED
One of our main aims in 2017 was to 
significantly increase the number of 
VFL interactions across the Group, as 
we believe this has a direct impact on 
on-site behaviour. In this we were very 
successful, with a marked increase on 
the prior year, including substantially 
more interactions by the Group’s senior 
leadership team.
At the start of the year we set ourselves 
a tough target for 2017 of a 40 per cent 
reduction in our Employee LTIFR which, 
although it is the industry-standard 
mechanism for measuring safety 
performance, tends to be a somewhat 
blunt instrument and can mask 
underlying improvements. So although 
our Employee LTIFR fell more slowly 
than we would have liked - from 1.87 to 
1.41 - we were very encouraged by the 
fact that our increasingly visible VFL 
programme is having a marked impact 
on the absolute level of injuries in our 
business, which fell by 12 per cent over 
the year. In fact, there were no employee 
LTIs at all in Breedon Southern last year 
and by the year-end the vast majority of 
Breedon sites had been LTI-free for more 
than 12 months.
We also saw a continuing improvement 
in the reporting of Safety Observations 
(formerly known as near-misses), which 
increased by 16 per cent year-on-year. 
Every Safety Observation reported 
is a potential accident avoided, so 
we are pleased to see this continuing 
upward trend. As with VFLs, the key 
to a safer environment is ensuring that 
learnings from Safety Observations are 
communicated widely across the Group 
and that changes and improvements are 
implemented consistently and quickly.
ONLINE REPORTING 
SYSTEM LAUNCHED
By the autumn we had put in place a 
proprietary safety reporting process 
based on the Assure workplace 
management system, which means that 
colleagues in the business can now log 
VFLs, Safety Observations and other 
key safety information online in real 
time. This is enabling us to manage our 
safety learnings, actions and follow-up 
much more effectively and share them 
instantly around the Group, ensuring 
that no time is lost in taking action or 
recommending improvement following 
any safety incidents. 
OTHER GROUP INITIATIVES
Following the launch of the Safety 
Commitments at the beginning of 2017, 
a revised set of Group Health & Safety 
Standards is now being rolled out across 
the Group, setting clear expectations 
for the safe behaviour of all Breedon 
colleagues. They include the introduction 
of a new root-cause analysis system 
(employing the commonly used ‘Why-
Tree’ protocol), based on a ‘Fair & Just’ 
culture which prioritises learning and 
accountability over blame and judgment.
Among the safety improvements 
stemming from our VFL learnings in 2017 
were the replacement of all powered 
angle-grinders with cordless battery 
models, incorporating improved safety 
features, and a move to ‘cut-level-3’ 
general-purpose gloves to help prevent 
hand injuries. Pit covers were also fitted 
as standard to all workshop pits.
Towards the end of the year we began 
the roll-out of a new locally-based 
Site Improvement Plan scheme, which 
will bring much greater discipline to 
the monitoring and improvement of 
operational and safety performance  
on each of our sites.

WWW.BREEDONGROUP.COM SAFE SHUTDOWNS AT 
BREEDON CEMENT
Two major kiln shutdowns, two kiln pit-
stops and a mill shutdown were carried 
out at Hope Cement Works during 2017 
involving more than 200,000 additional 
man-hours of work, carried out mainly by 
a range of engineering sub-contractors, 
without a single incident being 
recorded. This graphically demonstrates 
that ‘Zero Harm’ is a realistic and 
achievable objective with meticulous 
planning and strong management and 
supervisory control.
HEALTH & SAFETY TRAINING
2017 kicked off with a series of ‘safety 
stand-down’ days at which our new 
Safety Commitments were introduced 
for the first time. These Commitments 
formed the primary focus of all our safety 
training during the year and are steadily 
becoming embedded in the business. 
We also undertook rigorous inductions 
with our colleagues at recently-acquired 
Sherburn, Humberside Aggregates and 
Pro Mini Mix to ensure that their safety 
practices meet the high standards 
expected of all our businesses.
In addition, we continue to invest heavily 
in improving the competence of our site 
managers, supervisors and operatives, 
using the Mineral Products skills courses 
which are specifically designed for 
our industry.
RAIL SAFETY
With the acquisition of Hope we inherited 
a major rail operation and immediately 
recognised that we needed additional 
expertise in this area if we are to ensure 
a safe working environment in our rail 
depots and sidings. We accordingly 
created a new Rail Infrastructure Manager 
role to manage these operations, with 
the primary remit of ensuring that safety 
practices are robust and any necessary 
improvements are quickly implemented.
LOOKING AHEAD
We continue to aim for further 
improvements in our Employee LTIFR 
and in 2018 we are targeting a reduction 
in this KPI from 1.4 to 1.0.

he implementation of 
rigorous site-by-site Overall 
Equipment Effectiveness 
(OEE) and Running 
Equipment Effectiveness 
(REE) programmes resulted in marked 
performance enhancements across 
our business, with a general rise in the 
maximum operating capacity of our 
plants and corresponding improvements 
in availability, utilisation and production 
rates – all of which combined to reduce 
our energy consumption.
A major expansion project at our 
West Deeping workshop provided 
compelling evidence of the benefits of 
applying a lifecycle perspective to our 
operations. By extending the workshop 
and expanding its activities to allow it 
to undertake refurbishment and repair 
work, we significantly reduced the need 
to buy new plant and equipment. Instead, 
we are now able to recycle and reuse key 
machinery, reducing scrap, waste and 
our need for raw materials. For example, 
a newly-refurbished mobile crushing 
plant is now back in service and looking 
as good as new.
This initiative is significant in the context 
of the new ISO 14001:2015 Environment 
Standard, which specifically required 
us to consider a lifecycle perspective. 
Breedon Southern achieved transition 
to the new standard late last year, using 
West Deeping as an example.
Our recently-refurbished Raisby quarry 
offices and laboratory provided an 
excellent example of our continuing 
commitment to environmental 
improvement, specifically through 
enhanced energy efficiency. 
The installation of low-energy lighting, 
occupancy sensors, highly efficient 
AAA+ rated heating units and ventilation 
units with heat recovery facilities helped 
to reduce Raisby’s carbon footprint, 
with a speedy payback. This provides 
the model for similar energy-efficiency 
schemes at other key sites around 
the Group.
The use of Reclaimed Asphalt Planings 
(RAP) continued to play a role in 
increasing our use of recycled product 
in our asphalt plants.
At our Hope cement plant we used 
around 135,000 tonnes of waste to 
replace virgin raw materials and fossil 
fuels, utilised more Solid Recovered 
Fuel (SRF) than ever before and almost 
doubled our year-on-year usage of 
Pulverised Fly Ash (PFA), thereby 
preserving more of our valuable shale 
reserves. The plant also increased 
its participation in National Grid’s 
Demand Side Response schemes, 
providing a valuable service to the UK’s 
electricity network.
Breedon Cement’s entire road fleet was 
replaced, moving from Euro 5 specified 
MAN vehicles to more efficient Euro 6 
specified DAF trucks, which will yield 
a five per cent fuel saving. In addition, 
new planning and tracking tools were 
introduced to improve our cement 
delivery planning and adding new JPA 
tankers to the rail fleet has helped to 
reduce rail movements to our depots 
at Theale and Dagenham.

are empowered to use their full range 
of skills and professional competencies 
is an increasingly important priority for 
us and during the year we made good

and apprenticeship opportunities.
SUPERVISORY AND MANAGEMENT 
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES
We have some extremely talented 
managers and supervisors in our

It comprises five modules: leading for 
success; interpersonal skills; developing 
people; managing & driving performance; 
and managing & driving change.
To ensure that we plan effectively for 
management succession, we have also 
created a trainee operations manager 
programme that will enable us to recruit 
and develop assistant site managers 
on a fast-track basis, providing the 
pool of talent we need to become 
tomorrow’s quarry and site managers. 
Recruitment for this programme is 
now underway.
APPRENTICESHIPS 
AND QUALIFICATIONS
We recruited four new apprentices in 2017 , 
bringing the total number throughout 
the Group to 15. Our HR team is working 
closely with the divisions to identify further 
apprentice recruitment opportunities, 
focusing in particular on drivers, operatives 
and fitters. We continue to provide training 
opportunities for people beginning careers 
in our industry, with a number of trainee 
quarry managers, technicians and fitters 
working across our three divisions. 
More of our colleagues than ever 
before studied for industry-recognised 
qualifications in 2017 and more than 100 
gained Level 2 qualifications in their core 
job roles, with another 47 gaining Level 3 
qualifications, 13 achieving Level 4, seven 
achieving Level 6 and six gaining Level 
7 qualifications. We have 25 colleagues 
currently enrolled at Derby University 
studying the various Foundation Degrees 
in Mineral Products and Certificate 
programmes. In 2017, 11 colleagues 
successfully completed Foundation 
Degrees and Diplomas. 
MPQC INSPIRING FUTURES
The Mineral Products Qualifications 
Council estimates that fewer than one in 
five of our industry’s workforce is aged 
18-34, with the average age at around 55. 
This means that we have approximately 
10 years to source a replacement 
workforce before the bulk of our present 
one retires. Inspiring Futures is a new 
initiative that aims to encourage young 
people to join our sector by recruiting 
and training a cohort of ambassadors 
who currently work in the sector 
to engage with the STEM (Science, 
Technology, Engineering & Mathematics) 
Learnings network of schools, colleges 
and universities.
Breedon has committed to the scheme 
by providing three of the first 13 STEM 
Ambassadors, including our new 
Learning and Development Manager 
and representatives from both Breedon 
Northern and Breedon Southern.

PRO MINI MIX AND

The need to strengthen and extend our 
formal induction programme became 
more pressing in 2017 as the Group 
continued to expand, both organically 
and with the acquisitions of Pro Mini Mix 
and Humberside Aggregates. Our new 
Welcome Programme combines a 
thorough introduction to our health & 
safety culture – with a particular focus 
on core safety elements such as risk 
assessment and manual handling – 
with in-depth product briefings and 
opportunities to network with the 
executive team and other colleagues 
around the business.

STRATEGIC  
REPORT 02 03 04 W
e aim to be the safest 
and most profitable 
construction materials 
company in the UK 
and our strategy is to 
achieve this principally by striving for the 
best customer service. It is self-evident 
that if we are loyal to our customers and 
give them a strong reason to do business 
with us, they will be loyal in return and 
we will profit from their custom.
We pride ourselves on going the extra 
mile for our customers, developing an 
intimate understanding of their needs, 
providing them with tailored solutions 
where they need them and ensuring that 
our production teams are as fast and 
responsive as possible.
Early in 2017 we launched an updated 
range of performance concretes, 
made possible in part by the increased 
internalisation of cement supplies 
following our acquisition of Hope. 
Later in the year we further expanded 
our portfolio with the introduction of 
BREEDONFlow Swiftscreed. This free-
flowing cementitious screed is ideal for 
applications where thinner sections are 
needed than traditional screeds, for 
example in underfloor heating systems 
and wet rooms, both increasingly 
popular applications.
Later in the year we were part of the 
team which was highly commended for 
work on the new V&A Museum of Design 
in Dundee, constructed by BAM Nuttall. 
Breedon created a bespoke dark-grey 
concrete for the project’s Japanese 
architects, Kengo Kuma Associates, 
which was poured into a series of curved 
and twisted shapes and needed to be 
almost self-compacting. The judges 
in the 2017 Concrete Society Awards 
commented that “the expectation of the 
material from both a structural integrity 
and external finish was very high and the 
contractor had to constantly redesign 
mixes and placing practicalities as the 
structure progressed.”
Among the other challenging and 
innovative projects worked on in 2017 
was the largest ever concrete pour in the 
Group’s history, supplying the material 
for new concrete flooring at a new Airbus 
facility in North Wales constructed 
by Jones Brothers and their sub-
contractor Wrexham Concrete Designs. 
The new facility is being used to produce 
components for the wings on Airbus’s 
flagship A380 aircraft and the job 
involved a major team effort, with a relay 
of 150 non-stop deliveries of concrete, 
enabling two pours of 900 cubic metres 
and 1,005 cubic metres over a 12-hour 
day starting at 5am.
Arguably the most demanding project 
in which Breedon has been involved in 
recent years is the Aberdeen Western 
Peripheral Route, currently the UK’s 
longest road construction project, with 
58 kilometres of dual carriageway, 
40 kilometres of side roads and 30 
kilometres of access roads. In addition 
to the original concrete order, we were 
asked to supply additional material to 
supplement the construction team’s own 
supply from their on-site batching plants, 
in particular for the construction of the 
two largest bridges in the project, over 
the Dee and Don rivers.
The concrete deck sections for the 
bridges had to be tensioned in order that 
they could be constructed one segment 
at a time, which required concrete 
that achieved a high early strength 
at low heat. This was achieved via an 
innovative mix with a unique combination 
of micro-silica, blended cement and 
special additives.

W
e are at the heart of 
the communities in 
which we operate 
and recognise our 
responsibility to 
be good, supportive and engaged 
neighbours.
We welcome and encourage visits to 
our sites and regularly go out into our 
communities to talk to teachers and 
schoolchildren. Where possible we 
donate products to help local people 
create better communities.
It is obviously vital that we maintain an 
open dialogue with the residents and 
businesses who live and operate around 
our quarries, so that we can tackle 
planning and development issues, discuss 
transport and road usage and generally 
consider how best to support them.
We undertook a wide range of 
community initiatives in 2017, some large, 
some small. Here are just a few examples:
• We created a new footpath and 
secure fencing on a permissive access 
route that joins two sections of the 
‘Cloud Trail’, at our Cloud Hill quarry. 
The footpath was made wider to 
accommodate horse-riders, cyclists 
and walkers. 
• We donated funds towards the next 
phase of a local Parish Council’s village 
traffic calming scheme, which hopes to 
bring many safety benefits to a village 
community near our Leinthall quarry 
in Herefordshire. 
• Many of our quarries held school visits 
or safety days throughout the year, 
including the first ever school visit to 
our Denbigh quarry in North Wales, a 
variety of road and cycle safety events 
in England and Scotland and numerous 
tours of our Hope cement plant.
• Our annual Hope Works bonfire and 
firework display was once again a 
hugely popular event, with many local 
residents attending and Hope was also 
a major participant, as always, in the 
local Hope Show.
• We supported both the South Wales 
Memorial Children’s Hospice and 
Ashgate Hospice Care in Derbyshire.
• Hope Cement was included in a 
compendium of case studies entitled 
Employers Engaging with Schools, 
produced by the CBI in conjunction 
with the Careers & Enterprise Company, 
which gives positive examples of how 
employers work with schools. Hope’s 
case study listed a number of initiatives, 
including supporting Key Stage 4 
option evenings, working with a local 
Wildlife Trust to help children interact 
with nature, and running a ‘Scrums & 
Sums’ programme, which links rugby 
with numeracy.
• We supported a major STEM 
(Science, Technology, Engineering 
& Mathematics) day in Scotland, 
at which pupils from primary and 
secondary schools across the Highlands 
and Islands had the opportunity to 
showcase their experiments, projects 
and other work to an expert panel 
of judges.
• We sponsored a number of local 
children’s football teams in a variety  
of ways around the country. 
KEY PRIORITIES 
FOR 2018
• Continue to extend our 
community 
programmes across 
our enlarged network
• Increase the number 
of community liaison 
meetings and visits at

he directors recognise 
the value of strong and

Company has therefore 
sought to comply, as far as it is 
appropriate to do so, with the 
Corporate Governance Code 
for Small and Mid-size Quoted 
Companies published by the 
Quoted Companies Alliance in 
2013 (the ‘QCA Code’), in respect 
of the accounting year ended 
31 December 2017. As an AIM-
listed company, the Company is 
not required to comply with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 
2016 (the ‘Code’) and it has not 
voluntarily elected to do so. The 
directors have, however, structured 
this report around the main 
principles of the Code in order 
to provide greater clarity of the 
governance framework adopted by 
the Company.
The purpose of this statement is 
to describe what the Board does 
and how it facilitates effective, 
entrepreneurial and prudent 
management with the aim of 
delivering the long term success of 
the Company.

LEADERSHIP
The Role of the Board 
The Board is collectively responsible 
for providing leadership of the 
Group within a framework of 
prudent and effective controls and 
constructively challenges and helps 
to develop and communicate its 
strategic aims. 
The Board has adopted a Schedule 
of Matters Reserved to the Board 
which is available to view on the 
Group’s website, and it keeps this 
under regular review. 
Six formal board meetings are held 
each year to enable the Board to 
discharge its duties effectively and 
to consider those matters which 
have been specifically reserved 
to it for review and decision. 
These include the management 
of the Group’s assets to maximise 
performance and the control of 
the operation of the business, to 
review corporate strategy and to 
monitor the progress of individual 
business units.
Board of Directors
The current Board comprises the 
Executive Chairman, two executive 
directors (one of whom is the Group 
Chief Executive), two independent 
non-executive directors (one of 
whom is the Senior Independent 
Director) and two non-executive 
directors who are not considered to 
be independent.

LEADERSHIP
EFFECTIVENESS
ACCOUNTABILITY
REMUNERATION
RELATIONS WITH 
SHAREHOLDERS Division of responsibilities
The roles of Chairman and Group 
Chief Executive are not exercised by 
the same individual. 
The primary role of the Chairman 
is to oversee the operation of 
the Board and the Company’s 
governance structures. He is also 
responsible for ensuring that 
the Company maintains an 
appropriate level of dialogue with 
its shareholders. The role of the 
Chief Executive is to oversee the 
operational management of the 
Group’s businesses, and the role of 
the Senior Independent Director is 
to act as a sounding board for the 
Chairman and other members of 
the Board and to be an alternative 
point of access for shareholders for 
matters that they do not wish to 
raise through other channels. 
The Chairman sets the Board’s 
agenda and the Board is provided 
with clear, regular and timely 
information on the financial 
performance of the businesses 
within the Group, and of the 
Group as a whole, together with 
other trading reports, contract 
performance and market reports 
and data, including reports 
on personnel-related matters 
such as health & safety and 
environmental issues. 
Non-executive directors
The Board considers that each of 
the non-executive directors brings 
a senior level of experience and 
judgement to bear on issues of 
strategy, performance, resources 
(including key appointments) and 
standards of conduct. The Chairman 
encourages and facilitates 
the contribution of the non-
executive directors.
Susie Farnon is the Company’s 
Senior Independent Director. 
All directors are given regular access 
to the Group’s operations and 
personnel as and when required. 
Biographical details of all the 
directors are set out on pages 
52 to 53.

EFFECTIVENESS
Composition of the Board
The composition and performance 
of the Board, and the skills, 
experience and independence 
of each director are regularly 
evaluated, to ensure that they 
best fit the evolution of the 
Group’s business.
Directors’ independence
As a consequence of David 
Williams’ financial investment in 
Marwyn Materials Limited (‘MML ’) 
(now Breedon Group plc), through 
Marwyn Investments, at the time 
when MML was created in 2008,  
and Amit Bhatia’s association with 
Abicad, which has a significant 
shareholding in the Company, the 
Board do not consider either of 
those directors to be independent. 
The Company has two independent 
non-executive directors on the 
Board: Susie Farnon and David 
Warr. The Board considers 
David Warr to be independent 
notwithstanding the fact that he 
was appointed as a director in June 
2008 and has therefore served 
on the Board for more than nine 
years. The Board believes that 
he continues to demonstrate an 
independence of character and 
judgement in the performance of 
his role as a non-executive director. 
In addition, his external experience 
as a member of the boards of other 
listed companies provides a valuable 
source of expertise and knowledge. 
Furthermore, the Company has 
stated that it intends to appoint two 
new independent non-executive 
directors to strengthen and diversify 
the Board.
Nomination Committee
The Board has a formal and 
transparent procedure for the 
appointment of new directors to the 
Board. This function is carried out 
by a Nomination Committee and 
its terms of reference (explaining 
its role and the authority delegated 
to it by the Board) are available 
on the Group’s website. A report 
on the activities of the Nomination 
Committee during 2017 is set out on 
page 69.
External advice
Where it considers it necessary to 
do so, the Board instructs external 
professional advisers to provide 
advice and guidance on any matter 
where it considers it prudent to 
seek such advice. All members 
of the Board are able to take 
independent professional advice 
at the Company’s expense in the 
furtherance of their duties.
Board evaluation
In 2017 the Board carried out 
an externally facilitated Board 
Effectiveness Review. The review 
consisted of each director 
participating in a one-to-one 
interview with the provider and 
the output of those interviews 
was then compiled in a report for 
consideration by the Board as a 
whole. While the review covered 
the whole spectrum of the Board’s 
activities, it had a particular focus on 
four key areas which the directors 
had identified in advance as being 
worthy of additional attention. 
Those areas related to the Board’s 
approach to strategy, succession 
planning, risk and employee 
management and development.
The review concluded that the 
Breedon Group Board is highly 
effective. It comprises well-
experienced individuals, has good 
reporting, little bureaucracy, 
conducts well controlled and open 
meetings and benefits from a 
high level of challenge. There is a 
high degree of trust amongst the 
directors and between the directors 
and senior management.
The review also highlighted some 
minor matters on which the 
Board should focus in its future 
development and the directors 
will therefore put plans in place to 
address those matters.

GOVERNANCE 01 03 04 Re-election
At the forthcoming AGM all 
current directors will be subject 
to re-election by shareholders, 
notwithstanding the provisions 
of the Company’s Articles of 
Association which only require one 
third of them to be so.

ACCOUNTABILITY
 Financial and  
Business Reporting
The Board recognises its 
responsibility for presenting a fair, 
balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Group’s financial 
performance, and for establishing 
and maintaining appropriate 
systems of risk management and 
internal control.
The directors explain their 
responsibilities for preparing 
the Financial Statements on 
page 74 and the Independent 
Auditor’s Report on page 76 to 
79 contains a statement of its 
reporting responsibilities.
Going concern
In the Directors’ Report on page 72 
the directors set out the basis on 
which they consider it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing the 
Financial Statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 .
Risk management 
The Board recognises its 
responsibility for determining the 
nature and extent of the principal 
risks it is willing to take in achieving 
its strategic objectives and 
maintains sound risk management 
and internal control systems. 
Risk management processes 
are embedded throughout the 
organisation and assist management 
in identifying and understanding 
the risk that they face in delivering 
business objectives and the key 
controls that they have in place to 
manage those risks.
The Board is responsible for 
the Group’s systems of risk 
management and internal 
control, and for reviewing their 
effectiveness. The Audit Committee 
reviews the suitability and 
effectiveness of risk management 
processes and controls on behalf of 
the Board. 
The Group Finance Director 
provides a twice-yearly update 
to the Board on the key risks 
and controls within the Group, 
highlighting the roles and 
responsibilities of key management 
in managing those risks.
The Group Controls Manager 
works with the divisions to identify 
and assess the key risks and 
controls in their businesses and 
reports them to the Group Finance 
Director. They also facilitate the 
embedding and monitoring of the 
Board’s agreed Risk Management 
Process within the business, 
under the direction of the Group 
Finance Director.
Directors and senior managers 
ensure that the Risk Management 
Framework is implemented 
effectively within their respective 
business areas. Their key 
responsibilities include ensuring 
an effective risk culture is in place, 
with risk management embedded in 
the business.
Internal control
The Board has reviewed the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system 
of internal control, including 
financial, operational, compliance 
and risk management controls, 
which mitigate the significant 
risks identified. It has concluded 
that the Group maintained sound 
risk management and internal 
control systems throughout the 
year. However, such systems are 
designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives, and 
can provide only reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Audit Committee
The Board has established, and 
throughout the year maintained, an 
Audit Committee. David Warr and 
Susie Farnon (both independent 
non-executive directors) served on 
the Audit Committee throughout 
the year. David Warr is Chairman 
of the Committee. The Board is 
satisfied that at least one member 
of the Audit Committee has relevant 
financial experience. Written terms 
of reference have been agreed for 
the Audit Committee and these are 
available on the Group’s website, 
and further details of the activities 
of the Committee are given in the 
Audit Committee Report on pages 
58 to 59. 
Whistleblowing
The Group has adopted a 
whistleblowing policy which gives 
its employees, or indeed any other 
third party, the means to raise 
concerns in confidence and (if they 
wish) anonymously. The Board 
ensures that arrangements are in 
place for the proportionate and 
independent investigation of such 
matters and for follow up action. 
4
REMUNERATION
The Board seeks to ensure 
that its executive remuneration 
practices are designed to promote 
the long-term success of the Group 
and align with its overall strategy.
Remuneration Committee
Throughout the year, the 
Remuneration Committee 
comprised solely of three non-
executive directors. David Williams, 
David Warr and Susie Farnon served 
on the Remuneration Committee 
throughout the year. David Williams 
is Chairman of the Committee.

 RELA TIONS 
WITH SHAREHOLDERS
Strong and effective relationships 
and communication with the 
Group’s shareholders are important 
in helping it achieve its objectives. 
The Board actively encourages 
such engagement.
Dialogue with shareholders
The Company is committed to 
maintaining good communications 
with its shareholders. Members 
of the Board have face-to-face 
meetings with representatives 
of institutional shareholders 
to aid understanding of the 
Group’s strategic objectives and 
performance, and all shareholders 
are encouraged to participate in the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting. 
The Executive Chairman ensures 
that the views of shareholders are 
communicated to the Board as 
a whole, and that non-executive 
directors develop an understanding 
of the views of major shareholders. 
Use of general meetings/AGM
At general meetings the Company 
proposes separate resolutions 
on each substantially separate 
issue. The Company provides 
shareholders with the opportunity 
to appoint a proxy. In addition, 
proxy votes will be counted and the 
results announced after any vote on 
a show of hands.
David Williams and David Warr, as 
Chairmen of the Remuneration and 
Audit Committees respectively, 
Susie Farnon, as Senior Independent 
Director, and all other directors will 
be available to answer questions 
at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting.
The Company arranges that notice 
of the Annual General Meeting 
and related papers are sent to 
shareholders at least 20 working 
days before the meeting.

GOVERNANCE 01 03 04 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
T
he role of the Audit 
Committee is to 
monitor the integrity of 
the Group’s Financial 
Statements and to ensure 
that the interests of shareholders 
are properly protected in relation 
to financial reporting and internal 
control.
The Audit Committee monitors 
and reviews the effectiveness 
of the internal financial controls, 
the internal control and risk 
management systems and the 
compliance environment operating 
within the Group.
The Audit Committee makes 
recommendations to the Board 
in respect of the appointment of 
the external auditor, reviews and 
monitors their independence and 
objectivity and approves their 
remuneration. The Audit Committee 
consults with the external auditor 
on the scope of their work and 
reviews all major points arising from 
the audit.
The Audit Committee was chaired 
by David Warr throughout the year 
and comprised David Warr and 
Susie Farnon. 
Both members of the Audit 
Committee have relevant and recent 
financial experience at a senior level 
as set out in their biographies on 
page 53. The Audit Committee met 
three times formally in 2017 and also 
held informal discussions with the 
external auditor as appropriate.
The principal activities of the Audit 
Committee in respect of the year 
ended 31 December 2017, and the 
manner in which it discharged its 
responsibilities, were as follows:
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Audit Committee reviewed 
and agreed the external auditor’s 
strategy and approach in advance 
of their audit for the year ended 
31 December 2017, and reviewed 
reports on the outcome of the audit.
The Audit Committee also reviewed 
the 2017 Preliminary Results 
Announcement, the 2017 Annual 
Report, the 2017 Interim Results 
Announcement and the 2017 
Interim Report.
SIGNIFICANT 
ACCOUNTING MATTERS
During the year, the Audit 
Committee considered key 
accounting issues, judgements and 
disclosures in relation to the Group’s 
Financial Statements, the most 
significant of which was impairment 
of goodwill.
DAVID WARR 
CHAIRMAN, AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee maintained its focus on 
ensuring high standards of financial governance 
during the year.
KEY ACTIVITIES

BREEDON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2017 
WWW.BREEDONGROUP.COM The Audit Committee also received 
communications from management 
and the external auditor on a 
number of matters, including the 
valuation of mineral reserves and 
resources, acquisition accounting, 
customer claims, restoration 
provisions, judgements made 
in respect of contract surfacing 
revenue recognition, the use of 
the going concern assumption 
to support the going concern 
statement on page 72 and in 
respect of the viability statement  
on page 73.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR
The external auditor, KPMG LLP, 
attends meetings of the Audit 
Committee. The Audit Committee 
has the opportunity to meet with 
the external auditor without the 
executive directors being present to 
provide a forum to raise any matters 
of concern in confidence. 
The Audit Committee discusses 
and agrees with the scope of the 
audit plan for the full year with 
the auditor. 
The external auditor reports on 
the control environment in the 
Group, key accounting matters 
and mandatory communications. 
The Audit Committee also receives 
and reviews a report from the 
external auditor setting out to its 
satisfaction how its independence 
and objectivity is safeguarded when 
providing non-audit services. 
The value of non-audit services 
provided by KPMG in respect of 
the year ending 31 December 
2017 amounted to £59,000 
(2016: £98,000) principally in 
respect of tax advisory and pension 
advisory services. 
During the year there were no 
circumstances where KPMG was 
engaged to provide services 
prohibited by the FRC’s 2016 ethical 
standard or which might have led to 
a conflict of interest. 
Tax services were subject to a 
tender process during the year, 
with PwC being appointed as tax 
advisory and compliance provider 
for the Group.
KPMG LLP either directly or via 
KPMG Channel Islands Limited has 
acted as auditor to the Group since 
its formation in 2008. The Audit 
Committee continues to be satisfied 
with the work of KPMG and that 
they continue to remain objective 
and independent. 
The lead audit partner rotates every 
five years to assure independence, 
with the current partner having 
served three years of his tenure.
The Audit Committee has therefore 
recommended to the Board that a 
resolution be put to shareholders 
for the reappointment of KPMG LLP 
as auditor at the Annual General 
Meeting of the Company.
INTERNAL AUDIT
The Group does not have an 
internal audit function. The Audit 
Committee presently consider 
this is appropriate given the close 
involvement of the executive 
directors and senior management 
on a day-to-day operational basis, 
the relatively small number of 
trading components, and that 
operations are solely within the 
United Kingdom. However the need 
for an internal audit function will 
be kept under review by the Audit 
Committee on behalf of the Board.
David Warr
Chairman, Audit Committee

Area of Judgement Detail Action taken
Impairment of goodwill
The Group has £190.7 million of Goodwill 
which it has recognised on acquisitions 
and which represents the excess of the fair 
value of the consideration paid over the 
share of identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed 
for impairment on an annual basis, or more 
frequently if there are indications that the 
goodwill may be impaired. This testing 
is performed at the lowest level at which 
management monitor Goodwill, being 
the groups of CGUs (‘Cash Generating 
Units’) which comprise the Group’s three 
operating segments.
The recoverable amounts for each group 
of CGUs to which goodwill has been 
allocated are calculated by determining 
the value in use of each group of CGUs, 
which is based on the net present value of 
projected cash flows.
The most significant judgements are in 
setting the assumptions for the calculation 
of the value in use, which includes the 
discount rate applied to cash flows, 
forecast financial performance and the 
longer term rate of growth.
Details of the assumptions used 
are provided in note 9 to the Group 
Financial Statements.
Cash flows for each CGU were calculated over a 30 
year period, starting with the 2018 budget approved by 
the Board, followed by forecast three year plan results 
for 2019 and 2020 and subsequently by a longer term 
growth assumption of two per cent for the remaining 
27 years. These cash flows were adjusted for the 
impact of working capital and capital expenditure, 
before being discounted at a pre-tax discount rate 
of 10.4 per cent which was calculated by an external 
expert. The recoverable amounts of each CGU show 
significant headroom compared to their carrying 
value when reasonably likely changes are made to 
key assumptions. 
The Audit Committee discussed the assumptions 
underlying the cash flow projections with both 
management and the external auditor, considered 
the appropriateness of the key assumptions and the 
adequacy of the disclosure provided in note 9 of 
the Financial Statements. Following discussion on 
headroom and sensitivity, the Committee was satisfied 
that no impairment of Goodwill was necessary.

REMUNERATION REPORT
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
I 
am pleased to present the 
Directors’ Remuneration 
Report for the financial year 
ended 31 December 2017. 
The Report is set out in two 
sections. The ‘Policy Report’ 
summarises our forward-looking 
Remuneration Policy. The ‘Annual 
Report on Remuneration’ shows 
the amounts earned by directors 
in 2017, and how we propose to 
apply the Remuneration Policy 
in 2018. 
2017 BUSINESS PERFORMANCE
2017 was an extremely busy year 
for the Group, with the focus 
on performance and driving the 
synergy benefits derived from the 
first full year of trading following the 
acquisition of Hope Construction 
Materials (Hope) in August 2016 
and Sherburn Minerals Limited 
(Sherburn) in November 2016. 
The planned transaction with 
Tarmac will see us streamline our 
ready-mixed concrete network 
in exchange for a substantial 
new reserve of minerals and a 
strategically valuable asphalt plant.
As reported in the Chairman’s and 
Group Chief Executive’s Statements 
and the business reviews on pages 
23 to 37, the Group continued to 
perform well, driving positive results 
throughout the integration phase of 
the Hope acquisition.

BREEDON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2017 
WWW.BREEDONGROUP.COM DECISIONS IN RELATION TO 
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION 
IN 2017
Having conducted an external 
review and benchmarking of 
executive remuneration in late 
2015 in the context of setting the 
pay and benefits of the incoming 
Group Chief Executive and other 
senior management, the 2017 
review focussed on the size of the 
Group relative to its peers in the 
sector and of its recent increase in 
size following the acquisitions of 
Hope, Sherburn, and Humberside 
Aggregates in August 2017 . 
The executive directors’ salaries 
were set for 2017 having regard 
to the significantly increased size 
of the Group as a result of these 
transactions. The base salaries set 
for 2017 were: 
• £400,000 for the 
Executive Chairman; 
• £525,000 for the Group Chief 
Executive; and 
• £335,000 for the Group 
Finance Director.
The bonuses earned in the year 
by the directors reflect the 
performance of the business. 
Further information is given on  
page 66. 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The responsibility for establishing 
the Group’s overall Remuneration 
Policy lies with the Board. The role 
of the Remuneration Committee 
is broadly to determine the terms 
of employment for the Executive 
Chairman, other executive directors 
and senior management of the 
Group within the framework agreed 
by the Board. The Remuneration 
Committee works within agreed 
terms of reference to make 
recommendations to the Board 
on that framework. The terms of 
reference for the Remuneration 
Committee are available on the 
Group’s website. 
The Remuneration Committee 
was chaired by me throughout the 
year and my co-members were 
David Warr and Susie Farnon. 
The Committee met four times 
formally in 2017 .
LOOKING FORWARD TO 2018
No significant changes are 
proposed to our executive 
remuneration arrangements for 
2018. In accordance with Breedon’s 
usual salary review timetable for 
the Group as a whole, executive 
directors’ salaries for 2018 will 
be determined in March 2018. 
Any increases to executive directors’ 
salaries are expected to be broadly 
in line with the range of increases 
awarded to the wider workforce, 
other than where a larger increase 
is considered appropriate to reflect 
any additional responsibilities 
arising as a result of the increase 
in the size of the Group, and will 
be reported in the 2018 Directors’ 
Remuneration Report. A summary 
of our approach to other elements 
of executive remuneration is set out 
on pages 62 to 68.

GOVERNANCE 01 03 04 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT  
CONTINUED
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Board seeks to ensure that the Group manages to attract and retain a management team with sufficient skills 
to produce results which drive the maximum shareholder value. To do this, the Group’s pay and benefits are set at 
competitive levels, but are also consistent with the Group’s circumstances, are motivational for its employees at all 
levels and appropriately recognise and reward high levels of performance.
In the table below we have set out a summary of our Remuneration Policy for executive directors. 
BASE SALARY
To provide a competitive base salary reflective of the particular skills and experience of an individual.
Operation
Reviewed annually or on a significant 
change of responsibilities.
Salaries are determined by reference to 
the skills and personal performance of the 
individual.
The Remuneration Committee also takes 
into account external market data and pay 
and employment conditions elsewhere in 
the Group when considering increases to 
base salary levels.
Maximum opportunity
Whilst there is no maximum salary, 
increases will normally be broadly in line 
with the range of salary increases awarded 
(in percentage of salary terms) to the 
wider workforce. Salary increases above 
this level may be awarded to take into 
account individual circumstances, including 
a change in the scope or responsibilities 
of the role, a change in market practice, 
a change in the size or complexity of the 
business or to reflect development and 
performance in role.
Performance conditions
None
ANNUAL CASH BONUS
To incentivise the delivery of annual financial, strategic and safety objectives.
Operation
Executive directors may participate in the 
annual bonus scheme.
Performance measures and targets are 
set by the Remuneration Committee at 
the start of the financial year and, based 
on performance, bonuses are paid in cash 
shortly after the completion of the audit 
of the annual results.
Maximum opportunity
For executive directors, the maximum 
opportunity is 125 per cent of salary. This 
level of incentive opportunity reflects 
the Committee’s desire to retain a high 
proportion of remuneration on variable pay. 
Bonuses are not pensionable.
Performance conditions
Performance is assessed against financial 
targets. A moderator may also be applied 
to increase or decrease the outturn 
dependent on average capital employed 
performance against targets, subject to the 
125 per cent of salary limit. 
The bonus may be reduced or eliminated 
if safety performance or accident records 
reach unacceptable levels.
PERFORMANCE SHARE PLANS (PSPs)
To drive superior performance of the Group and delivery of the Group’s long-term objectives, aid retention and align 
directors’ interests with those of the Company’s shareholders.
Operation
Annual share-based awards with a three-
year performance period.
Maximum opportunity
In line with best and market practice, it 
is currently intended that rolling annual 
awards will be made.
The maximum award limit in any financial 
year under the plan rules is 250 per cent 
of base salary.
In 2017 awards with a face value of 100 
per cent of salary were made to executive 
directors and it is expected that a similar 
level of award will be made in 2018.
Performance conditions
The vesting of awards is subject to the 
satisfaction of performance conditions, 
typically measured over a period of at least 
three years. Performance conditions, and 
their weightings where there is more than 
one metric, are reviewed annually to maintain 
appropriateness and relevance. Awards 
are based on financial measures which may 
include, but are not limited to, EPS.
Awards will usually vest between 20 per cent 
and 100 per cent for performance between 
‘threshold’ (the lowest level of performance 
which results in any level of vesting) and 
‘maximum’ performance.
62
BREEDON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2017 
WWW.BREEDONGROUP.COM PENSION
To aid recruitment and retention by allowing the directors to make provision for long-term retirement benefits 
comparable with similar roles in similar companies.
Operation
A salary supplement equivalent to the 
contribution that would otherwise be made 
to a defined contribution pension plan.
Maximum opportunity
The Group Chief Executive and the 
Group Finance Director receive a salary 
supplement of 17.5 per cent of their base 
salary in lieu of a pension contribution.
The Executive Chairman does not receive a 
contribution towards his pension.
Performance conditions
None.
OTHER BENEFITS
To provide market-competitive, cost-effective benefits.
Operation
Other benefits may include private medical 
insurance, a company car or car allowance, 
executive medical screening and the 
reimbursement of certain travel costs.
The Company also operates a ShareSave 
scheme on an annual basis. This scheme 
is open to all employees of the Group who 
have completed the requisite length of 
service at the launch of each invitation to 
participate.
Maximum opportunity
Based on costs determined by third-party 
providers. 
ShareSave contribution limits and the 
ShareSave option exercise price are set as 
permitted by the applicable tax legislation 
and apply in the same way to all qualifying 
employees. 
Performance conditions
None.
APPROACH TO PERFORMANCE MEASURES
The Committee’s approach to the setting of performance measures for the annual bonus and PSPs is to select 
measures that are aligned with the Group’s key performance indicators and the interests of shareholders. Targets are 
set at levels which require stretching performance to be achieved for maximum payout, but without encouraging 
excessive risk-taking. When setting targets, the Committee considers a number of reference points, including the 
Company’s own plans, external expectations and the overall economic environment. 
The annual bonus targets for 2017 were set by reference to underlying EBIT, which tracks improvements in the 
profitability of the Group.
A moderator enables the Remuneration Committee to adjust the formulaic outcome of the EBIT performance 
measure to reflect the efficiency with which capital is employed. 
Health & safety performance is fundamental to the Group. We are committed to maintaining a safe environment at 
all of our operations and have set ourselves the goal of achieving Zero Harm across the entire business; to reflect this, 
the annual bonus may be reduced or eliminated if safety performance or accident records reach unacceptable levels. 
The current performance measure for the PSPs is based on EPS, reflecting our focus on profitability and the delivery 
of value to shareholders, whilst maintaining simplicity and line-of-sight for the participants. 
The Committee retains the ability to adjust or set different performance measures or targets if events occur (such 
as a change in strategy, a material acquisition and/or disposal of a Group business, or a change in prevailing market 
conditions) which cause the Committee to consider that the measures are no longer appropriate and that an 
amendment is required to enable them to achieve their original purpose. 
The PSPs are operated in accordance with their terms, which includes the ability of the Committee to adjust awards in 
the event of a variation of share capital. 
63
02 
GOVERNANCE 01 03 04 NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
To provide market-competitive, cost-effective benefits.
Operation
Non-executive directors each receive a basic fee for holding the office of non-executive director, and may also receive an additional fee 
for further responsibilities (such as holding the office of Senior Independent Director or chairing a Board committee). Fees are set by the 
Board as a whole, taking into account market rates and the required time commitment. 
Non-executive directors do not participate in any incentive scheme, share scheme or pension arrangement, but may be eligible to 
receive benefits such as the use of secretarial support, travel costs or other benefits that may be appropriate. 
SERVICE AGREEMENTS/LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT OF THE DIRECTORS AND LOSS OF OFFICE 
Each of the directors has a service agreement or letter of appointment with the Company as follows:
Director
Notice period
Date of contract/letter of appointment
From the 
Director
From the 
Company
Peter Tom CBE 5 June 2008* 12 months 12 months

Susie Farnon 25 October 2010 N/A N/A
David Warr 5 June 2008 N/A N/A
David Williams 5 June 2008 N/A N/A
* The service agreement is entered into with Rise Rocks Limited for the purposes of procuring the services of Peter Tom as a consultant to the Company in the role of 
Executive Chairman.
The Board’s overriding approach to payments for loss of office is to act in shareholders’ interests. The principles on 
which payments for loss of office will be approached are set out below:
Notice periods 
and payments 
in lieu of notice
The maximum notice period for executive directors is 12 months. The Committee retains the 
right to terminate an executive director’s service agreement by making a payment in lieu of 
notice, consisting of salary, benefits and loss of pension provision for the notice period (or 
the unexpired portion of it). 
It is the Company’s policy to have regard to the executive director’s duty to mitigate his loss 
in respect of those contractual rights that he would otherwise be entitled to receive. 
Annual bonus The payment of bonus for the year in which the executive director leaves is determined by 
the Board, taking into consideration their contribution up to the leaving date and normal pro-
rating for time in service during the year.
PSP PSP awards will usually lapse on cessation of employment. However, if a participant leaves 
due to death, ill health, injury, retirement with the agreement of the Committee, or any other 
reason at the discretion of the Committee, his award shall either vest on the normal vesting 
date or at the date of cessation. In either case, the extent of vesting will be determined by 
reference to the extent the performance conditions are satisfied and, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise, the proportion of the vesting period that has elapsed.
Other payments Payments may be made in the event of a loss of office under the ShareSave scheme, which is 
governed by its rules and the applicable legislation and which does not provide discretion in 
the case of leavers. 
In appropriate circumstances, other payments may also be made, such as in respect of 
accrued holiday and outplacement and legal fees.

BREEDON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2017 
WWW.BREEDONGROUP.COM SUCCESSION PLANNING
The Board recognises the requirements of the QCA code that it should, through periodic review, ensure that plans 
for an orderly succession to Board and senior management positions are regularly reviewed and updated. It will 
continually monitor the composition of the senior management team, including the executive directors, and taking 
into account factors such as age, experience and career progression opportunities, it will formulate plans well in 
advance of potential vacancies arising.
During 2017, the Group has further strengthened the senior management teams in the three operating divisions, with 
appointments in Breedon Northern, Breedon Southern and Breedon Cement. The Nomination Committee of the 
Board reviewed these appointments and the succession for each role in September 2017 and the outcome of that 
review is reported on page 69.
RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION POLICY
When appointing a new executive director, the Committee will seek to ensure that his/her remuneration 
arrangements are in the best interests of the Company, and not more than is appropriate. The Committee will 
typically determine a new executive director’s remuneration package in line with the policy set out above. However, 
the Committee retains discretion to award different elements of remuneration in appropriate circumstances, such as:
• if an interim appointment is being made to fill a role on a short-term basis. 
• if, in exceptional circumstances, a non-executive director is required to take on an executive function. 
• if the circumstances of the recruitment make it appropriate to provide relocation, travel and subsistence payments. 
where it is considered appropriate to reflect remuneration arrangements provided by a previous employer, including 
that the Committee may grant ‘buy-out’ awards to reflect remuneration forfeited on leaving a previous employer. 
Any such buy-out award would be determined taking into account relevant factors of the forfeited award – including 
the period over which it would have vested and any applicable performance conditions.
• where it is considered appropriate to reimburse the new director for any costs he/she may have incurred as a 
consequence of resigning from their previous employment.

GOVERNANCE 01 03 04 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY IN 2018
No significant changes to the Remuneration Policy are currently proposed in 2018, but the Remuneration Committee 
will continue to keep the salaries and benefits of the executive directors under review during the year.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ SALARIES
In accordance with Breedon’s usual salary review timetable for the business as a whole, executive directors’ salaries 
for 2018 will be determined in March 2018. Any increases to executive directors’ salaries are expected to be broadly 
in line with the range of increases awarded to the wider workforce, other than where a larger increase is awarded to 
reflect any additional responsibilities arising as a result of the increase in the size of the Group, and will be reported in 
the 2018 Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ FEES
Following a review of non-executive directors’ fees, it is proposed to increase non-executive directors’ fees for 
2018 to: 
Basic fee: £50,000;
• Additional fee for holding the office of Senior Independent Director or for chairing the Audit or Remuneration 
Committee remains at: £10,000.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ BONUS OPPORTUNITY
For 2018, the executive directors will continue to have the opportunity to earn a bonus of up to 125 per cent of salary. 
The bonus will be subject to stretching performance conditions based on underlying EBIT. The performance targets 
contain confidential information and so are not disclosed on a prospective basis. However, the Committee proposes 
to disclose the targets, and performance against them, retrospectively as has been done for the bonuses earned 
in 2017.
PSP AWARDS
The Committee proposes to grant the executive directors awards under the PSP in 2018 at the level of 100 per cent 
of salary. 
The awards will vest subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition assessed over 2018, 2019 and 2020

WWW.BREEDONGROUP.COM NOMINATION COMMITTEE 
REPORT
The Nomination Committee is 
chaired by the Chairman of the 
Company (unless the business under 
discussion includes the appointment 
of his own successor) and the 
quorum for Committee meetings is a 
minimum of two directors and must 
comprise a majority of independent 
directors. The Committee meets as 
required. The terms of reference of 
the Committee are available on the 
Group’s website.
During the year the Committee met 
once, together with members of the 
Group’s senior management team, 
and considered the latest succession 
plans for senior management 
within the business. In 2017, the 
Group recruited additional key 
senior managers in each of its three 
operating divisions and promoted 
several of its own managers to 
senior executive levels. 
These appointments were noted 
by the Nomination Committee and, 
in accordance with its terms of 
reference, it will continue to keep 
succession planning for all senior 
executives under review, and it will 
receive an update on the plan on at 
least an annual basis.
As a consequence of its review, the 
Committee recommended that the 
Group should increase its focus on 
its identification and development of 
its future managers. Further details 
of the Group’s response to that 
recommendation are given on 
page 47.
During 2018, in addition to its work 
on succession planning, meetings 
of the Committee may be convened 
to review the size and composition 
(including the skills, knowledge, 
experience and diversity) of the 
Board and, if appropriate, make 
recommendations to the Board on 
possible changes.

EMPLOYEES
The Group recognises the importance of employee involvement in the operation and development of its business 
units, which are given autonomy, within a group policy and structure, to enable management to be fully accountable 
for their own actions and gain maximum benefit from local knowledge. Employees are informed by regular 
consultation, intranet, and internal newsletters of the progress of both their own business units and the Group as 
a whole. 
The Group is committed to providing equal opportunities for individuals in all aspects of employment, and considers 
the skills and aptitudes of disabled persons in recruitment, career development, training and promotion. If existing 
employees become disabled, every effort is made to retain them, and retraining is arranged wherever possible.
POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS
The Group did not make any contributions to political parties during either the current or the previous year.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
Shareholders are being asked at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting to grant the directors authority to allot up 
to 480,000,000 ordinary shares, being approximately one third of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company 
as at 7 March 2018. Shareholders are also being asked to grant the directors authority to allot, for cash otherwise 
than in connection with a rights issue, up to 72,334,777 ordinary shares, being five per cent of the issued ordinary 
share capital of the Company without first offering the securities to existing shareholders. Shareholders are being 
further asked to grant the directors authority, in addition to the general disapplication of pre-emption rights referred 
to above, to allot up to 72,334,777 ordinary shares, being five per cent of the issued share capital of the Company 
without first offering such shares to existing shareholders but only for the purpose of funding one or more acquisitions 
or specified capital investments. The Company did not purchase any of its ordinary shares during the year. However, 
the approval of shareholders is being sought to renew the existing authority to purchase its own shares.
If granted, and unless previously renewed, varied or revoked, each of the authorities described above shall expire at 
the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in 2019 or 15 months after being granted 
if earlier.
GOING CONCERN
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital and other funding requirements through its banking facility, which 
includes an overdraft facility, which expires in November 2019. Further details of the Group’s bank facilities are given 
on page 41.
The Group actively manages its financial risks as set out in note 20 to the Financial Statements and operates Board-
approved financial policies, including interest rate hedging policies, that are designed to ensure that the Group 
maintains an adequate level of headroom and effectively mitigates financial risks.
On the basis of current financial projections and facilities available, the directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, 
consider that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these Financial Statements.

BREEDON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2017 
WWW.BREEDONGROUP.COM VIABILITY STATEMENT
The directors have assessed the viability of the Group over a period to December 2020. This is the period over which 
financial projections have been prepared for the Group’s strategic financial plan.
In making their assessment the directors have taken into account the Group’s current position and the potential 
impact of the principal risks and uncertainties set out on pages 19 to 21 on its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity. They have also stress-tested their analysis by running a number of credible scenarios and 
considered the availability of mitigating actions.
Based on this assessment, the directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period to December 2020. In making this 
statement, the directors have assumed that financing remains available and that mitigating actions are effective.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITOR

audit information of which the Company’s Auditor is unaware, and each director has taken all steps that he or she 
ought to have taken to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s Auditor is aware of that information.

GOVERNANCE 01 03 04 STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN 
RESPECT OF THE DIRECTORS’ REPORT AND THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The directors are responsible for preparing the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group Financial Statements for each financial year which give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that year. In preparing those 
Financial Statements, the directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant and reliable; 
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the Financial Statements;
• assess the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern; and 
• use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or 
have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with 
the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of 
the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

£99.9 million allocated to the Cement 
business. This goodwill is at risk of 
recoverability as the Cement business 
is at an early stage in its trading life 
cycle under the Group’s ownership, 
the estimated recoverable amount 
is subjective due to the inherent 
uncertainty involved in forecasting and 
discounting future cash flows and there 
is limited headroom available.
Our procedures included:
 — Benchmarking assumptions: Comparing 
the Group’s assumptions to externally 
derived data in relation to key inputs such as 
long-term growth rates and discount rates.
 — Our experience: Assessing the 
appropriateness of the forecasted cash 
flows within the budgeted period based 
on our understanding of the business and 
sector experience.
 — Historical comparisons: Considering 
historical forecasting accuracy, by 
comparing previously forecasted cash flows 
to actual results achieved.
 — Comparing valuations: Comparing the 
sum of the discounted cash flows to the 
Group’s market capitalisation to assess the 
reasonableness of those cash flows.
 — Sensitivity analysis: Performing sensitivity 
analysis in relation to the key assumptions.
 — Assessing transparency: Assessing whether 
the Group’s disclosures regarding the 
sensitivity of the impairment assessment to 
changes in key assumptions, appropriately 
reflected the risks inherent in the valuation 
of goodwill.

STATEMENTS 01 02 04 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS 
OF BREEDON GROUP PLC CONTINUED
3.  OUR APPLIC A TION OF MA TERIALITY AND AN 
OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
The materiality for the Financial Statements as a whole 
was set at £3.5 million (2016: £2.7 million). This has 
been determined with reference to a benchmark of 
£73.8 million (2016: £55.0 million) being Group profit 
before tax of £71.2 million adjusted for redundancy 
and reorganisation costs, acquisition costs and gains 
on property disposals of £2.6 million. The materiality 
represents 4.7% (2016: same basis, 4.9%) of 
this benchmark.
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected 
or uncorrected misstatements exceeding £175,000 
(2016: £135,000), in addition to other identified 
misstatements that warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds.
Of the Group’s 15 (2016: 14) reporting components, 
5 (2016: 9) were subject to full scope audits for group 
reporting purposes whilst 1 (2016: 3) was subject to 
a review of financial information (including enquiry). 
The components within the scope of our work 
accounted for 99% (2016: 100%) of total Group revenue; 
97% (2016: 100%) of Group profit before taxation; and 
100% (2016: 98%) of total Group assets.
The Group audit team performed all the work carried 
out in each component.
The remaining 1% of total Group revenue and 3% 
of group profit before tax is represented by the 
remaining reporting components, none of which 
individually represented more than 3% of any of total 
Group revenue or Group profit before tax. For these 
residual components, we performed analysis at an 
aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment 
that there were no significant risks of material 
misstatement present.

BREEDON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2017 
WWW.BREEDONGROUP.COM 4.  WE HA VE NO THING T O REPORT ON 
GOING CONCERN
We are required to report to you if we have concluded 
that the use of the going concern basis of accounting 
is inappropriate or there is an undisclosed material 
uncertainty that may cast significant doubt over the use 
of that basis for a period of at least 12 months from the 
date of approval of the Financial Statements. We have 
nothing to report in these respects.
5.  WE HA VE NO THING T O REPORT ON THE O THER 
INFORMATION IN THE ANNUAL REPORT
The directors are responsible for the other information 
presented in the Annual Report together with the 
Financial Statements. Our opinion on the Financial 
Statements does not cover the other information and, 
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, 
in doing so, consider whether, based on our Financial 
Statements audit work, the information therein is 
materially misstated or inconsistent with the Financial 
Statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that 
work we have not identified material misstatements in 
the other information.
6.  WE HA VE NO THING T O REPORT ON THE O THER 
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO 
REPORT BY EXCEPTION
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 — proper accounting records have not been kept by 
the Company; or
 — returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 — the Group accounts are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
 — we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.
We have nothing to report in these respects.
7. RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES
Directors’ responsibilities
As explained more fully in their statement set out 
on page 74, the directors are responsible for: the 
preparation of the Financial Statements including being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal 
control as they determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of Financial Statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; 
assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern; and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate 
the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of the financial statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided 
on the FRC’s website at  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.
8.  THE PURPO SE OF OUR A UDIT W ORK AND T O 
WHOM WE OWE OUR RESPONSIBILITIES
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept 
or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members, as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.

BREEDON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2017 
WWW.BREEDONGROUP.COM NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal activities of the business are the quarrying of aggregates and the production of cement and other 
added value products, including asphalt and ready-mixed concrete, together with related activities in Great Britain. 
Breedon Group plc (the Company) is a company domiciled in Jersey. The address of the Company’s registered office 
is 28 Esplanade, St Helier, Jersey, JE2 3QA. 
1.1 Basis of preparation 
These Financial Statements consolidate the results of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings, and equity 
account for the Group’s interest in its associate and its joint ventures (collectively the Group). 
The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis based on the assessment made by the 
directors as described in the Directors’ Report on page 72.
These consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the EU (Adopted IFRSs). The consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention except for the revaluation to fair value of certain financial instruments.
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with Adopted IFRSs requires the use of certain critical 
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s 
accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and 
estimates are significant to the consolidated Financial Statements, are disclosed in note 27 .
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently throughout the year 
presented in this financial information.
These Financial Statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Group’s functional currency. All financial 
information presented in pounds sterling has been rounded to the nearest thousand.
Parent company information has not been provided in accordance with Article 105 (11) of the Companies (Jersey) 
Law 1991.
1.2 New IFRS Standards and Interpretations 
The following standards have been adopted by the Group during the year:
• Amendments to IAS 12 - Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses
• Amendments to IAS 7 - Disclosure Initiative 
The adoption of these standards has not had a material impact on the Financial Statements. 
1.3 New IFRS Standards and Interpretations not adopted
At the date on which these Financial Statements were authorised, the following Standards, Interpretations and 
Amendments had been issued but were not effective for the year ended 31 December 2017 (and in some cases had 
not yet been adopted by the EU) and have not yet been adopted by the Group:
Effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018:
• IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The Group will adopt IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers for the financial year starting 1 January 
2018. An impact assessment exercise was completed during the current year which considered all revenue streams, 
but in particular focussed on revenues which are currently accounted for on a percentage of completion basis. 
The conclusion reached is that, with the exception of the additional disclosure requirements, the new standard will not 
have a significant impact on the Group’s Financial Statements.
• IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments
The Group will adopt IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments for the financial year starting 1 January 2018. The Group does not 
hold complex financial instruments and therefore the majority of changes to the standard do not change the existing 
accounting for assets or liabilities held. The change in the standard to an ‘expected loss’ model of impairment may 
result in a slight increase in the overall level of bad debt provision, but this will not have a significant impact on the 
Group’s Financial Statements.

STATEMENTS 01 02 04 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
1.3 New IFRS standards and interpretations not adopted continued
Effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019:
• IFRS 16 - Leases
IFRS 16 - Leases will be adopted by the Group for the financial year starting on 1 January 2019. The impact of the new 
standard will be to bring operating lease arrangements on balance sheet, with a right of use asset and corresponding 
financial liability recognised on transition. An impact assessment commenced during 2017 which will be completed 
in the first half of 2018. The Group has material operating leases (see note 21) and therefore the adoption of the 
standard is expected to have a material impact on the Financial Statements of the Group.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective subsequent to the 31 December 2017 year-end 
that are expected to materially impact the Group’s Financial Statements.
1.4 Basis of consolidation
Subsidiary undertakings are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group is exposed to or has 
rights to variable returns from its investment with the investee and has the ability to effect those returns through its 
power over the investee. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are 
taken into account. Ordinarily, the Group considers a company a subsidiary when it holds more than 50 per cent of 
the shares and voting rights. The Financial Statements of subsidiary undertakings are included in the Group’s Financial 
Statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Associates are those entities in which the Group holds more than 20 per cent of the shares and voting rights and 
has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Joint ventures are those entities 
over whose activities the Group has joint control, requiring unanimous consent for strategic financial and operating 
decisions. The Group’s Financial Statements includes the Group’s share of the total comprehensive income of its 
associate and joint ventures on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence or joint control 
commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds 
its interest in an associate or joint venture, the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to £Nil and recognition of further 
losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made 
payments on behalf of an associate or joint venture. 
1.5 Financial instruments
Financial instruments are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument. The principal financial assets and liabilities of the Group are as follows:
Trade receivables and trade payables
Trade receivables and trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and then are stated at amortised cost.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, including bank deposits with original maturities 
of three months or less. For the purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, bank overdrafts are also 
included as they are an integral part of the Group’s cash management.
Bank and other borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts and other loans are recognised initially at fair value less attributable 
transaction costs. All borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost with the difference between initial net 
proceeds and redemption value recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the period to redemption on 
an effective interest basis.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses financial instruments to manage financial risks associated with the Group’s underlying business 
activities and the financing of those activities. The Group does not undertake any trading in financial instruments.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date that the contract is entered into and subsequently re-
measured in future periods at their fair value. The gain or loss on the re-measurement of fair value is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss. However, where the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting, recognition of the 
resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
86
BREEDON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2017 
WWW.BREEDONGROUP.COM 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
1.5 Financial instruments continued
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset 
or liability, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income and in the cash flow hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is 
recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Amounts recorded in the cash flow hedging reserve are subsequently reclassified to the Consolidated Income 
Statement when the interest expense is actually recognised.
To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship must meet several conditions with respect to 
documentation, probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement. At the inception of 
the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well 
as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. This process includes linking 
all derivatives designated as hedges to specific assets and liabilities or to specific firm commitments or forecast 
transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, at hedge inception and on an annual basis, as to whether 
the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been, and are likely to continue to be, effective in offsetting 
changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items.
1.6 Mineral reserves and resources
Mineral reserves and resources are stated at cost and are depreciated based on the physical unit-of-production 
method over their estimated commercial lives. 
The value of mineral reserves and resources recognised as a result of business combinations is based on the fair value 
at the point of acquisition.
Costs incurred to gain access to mineral reserves and resources are capitalised and depreciated over the life of the 
quarry, which is based on the estimated tonnes of raw material to be extracted from the reserves.
1.7 Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised 
impairment loss.
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are 
classified as finance leases. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower 
of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses. 
Depreciation is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives 
to write off the cost or deemed cost of assets. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
• Freehold buildings   – 50 years
• Long leasehold land and buildings – life of the lease
• Fixtures and fittings   – up to 10 years
• Office equipment   – up to 5 years
• Fixed plant    – up to 30 years
• Loose plant and machinery  – up to 10 years
• Motor vehicles    – up to 10 years
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.

1.8 Intangible assets and goodwill
The Group measures goodwill as the fair value of the purchase consideration transferred including the recognised 
amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date. Fair value adjustments are always considered to be 
provisional at the first reporting date after the acquisition to allow the maximum time to elapse for management to 
make a reliable estimate.
The Group measures non-controlling interests at a proportionate share of the recognised amount of the identifiable 
net assets at the acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings is recognised as an asset in the Consolidated Statement 
of Financial Position and is subject to annual impairment review. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associated 
undertakings is included within the carrying value of the investment. When the excess is negative, a gain on bargain 
purchase is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group as part of a business combination are stated at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Cost reflects management’s judgement of the fair value of the 
individual intangible asset calculated by reference to the net present value of future economic benefits accruing to 
the Group from the utilisation of the asset, discounted at an appropriate discount rate. Other intangibles arising on the 
acquisition of associated undertakings are included within the carrying value of the investment.
Amortisation is based on the useful economic lives of the assets concerned, currently being the consumption of 
economic benefits over a period up to 25 years. 
1.9 Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets (see 
separate accounting policies), are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of 
impairment. Impairment reviews are undertaken at the level of each significant cash generating unit, which is no larger 
than an operating segment as defined by IFRS 8 - Operating Segments. If any such indication exists then the asset’s 
recoverable amount is estimated. 
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less 
costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to 
the asset. 
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised 
in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer 
exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had 
been recognised.
1.10 Non-current assets held exclusively with a view to resale
Non-current assets acquired exclusively with a view to subsequent disposal are classified as assets held for resale at 
the acquisition date only where all criteria set out in IFRS 5 are satisfied within a short period following the acquisition. 
When acquired as part of a business combination, non-current assets acquired exclusively with a view to subsequent 
disposal are initially measured at fair value less costs to sell. Subsequently, these non-current assets are measured 
at the lower of their current carrying value and current fair value less costs to sell. Subsequent gains or losses on 
re-measurement are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. Gains are not recognised in excess of any 
cumulative loss.
1.11 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on the first-in first-out principle and 
includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition. 
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based 
on normal operating capacity.

1.12  Emissions rights
Emission rights are accounted for such that a liability is recognised only in circumstances where emission rights have 
been exceeded from the perspective of the Group as a whole and will require the purchase of additional allowances to 
settle the emissions liability. Assets and liabilities arising in respect of emission credits are accordingly netted against 
one another in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
1.13 Retirement benefits
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated 
Income Statement as incurred.
1.14 Provisions
Restoration provisions
Where a legal or constructive obligation exists, the Group provides for the costs of restoring a site and of  
decommissioning associated property, plant and equipment. The initial cost of creating a provision on 
commencement of the exploitation of the raw materials is included in property, plant and equipment and depreciated 
over the life of the site. Changes in the measurement of a provision that result from changes in the estimated timing or 
amount of cash outflows are added to, or deducted from, the cost of the related asset. All provisions are discounted 
to their present value at a rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the liability. 
Other provisions
A provision is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when the Group has a present legal 
or constructive obligation, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
1.15 Revenue
Group revenue arises from two primary revenue streams, sale of goods and contract surfacing. IAS 18 requires 
the identification of components of revenue and the allocation of consideration to each component, with revenue 
recognised by the Group when the significant risks and rewards associated with the transaction have been transferred 
to the customer and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Revenue from the sale of goods represents the amount (excluding value added and sales taxes) invoiced to third 
party customers in respect of those goods and the costs of distribution, net of provisions recognised for returns, 
remedial work arising in the normal course of business and trade discounts & rebates. For sale of goods, the point of 
revenue recognition is typically the point at which products have been delivered to, or collected by, the end customer. 
As all components of this transaction are effected simultaneously, revenue relating to all components of the sale is 
recognised immediately. 
Contract surfacing revenues typically relate to short-term contracts. Revenue is recognised by reference to the 
degree of completion based on quantity surveyor reports of volumes of product laid.
1.16 Expenses
Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as an 
integral part of the total lease expense.
Finance lease payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. 
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Financial income and expense
Financial income and expense comprises interest payable, finance charges, finance lease charges, interest 
receivable on funds invested, and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement.
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method.

STATEMENTS 01 02 04 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
1.17 Warranties and customer claims
The Group provides assurance type warranties over the specification of products, but does not provide extended 
warranties or maintenance services in its contracts with customers. Additionally, claims with customers may arise 
in the usual course of business. Both customer claims and warranties are accounted for under IAS 37 Provisions, 
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
1.18 Income tax
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which 
case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as 
reported in the Consolidated Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are not taxable 
or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date and includes any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
1.19 Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided in full using the Statement of Financial Position liability method and represents the tax 
expected to be payable or recoverable on the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary 
differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities 
that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and differences relating to 
investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of 
deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets 
and liabilities using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which the asset can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date 
and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part 
of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by 
the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
1.20 Share-based transactions
Equity-settled share-based payments to directors, key employees and others providing similar services are measured 
at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. The fair value is expensed, with a corresponding increase 
in equity, on a straight line basis over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards. 
At each Statement of Financial Position date, the Group revises the amount recognised as an expense to reflect the 
number of awards for which the related service and non-market performance conditions are expected to be met, 
such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related 
service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards with market 
based performance conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such 
conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
1.21 Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
1.22 Alternative performance measures
The following non-GAAP performance measures have been used in the Financial Statements. 
i. Underlying EBIT 
ii. Underlying EBIT margin
iii. Underlying EBITDA
iv.  Underlying basic earnings per share
Management uses these terms as it believes they allow a better understanding of underlying business performance, 
are consistent with its communication with investors and reflects the way in which the business is managed. 
A reconciliation between underlying EBIT, EBITDA and reported profit is included within note 28.

BREEDON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2017 
WWW.BREEDONGROUP.COM 2 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
The principal activity of the Group is the quarrying of aggregates and the production of cement and other added 
value products, including asphalt and ready-mixed concrete, together with related activities in Great Britain. For the 
purpose of management reporting to the chief operating decision maker, the Group previously split into three 
reportable units: Breedon Northern, Breedon Southern and Hope Cement. From 1 January 2017, the aggregates 
and concrete operations of Hope Cement were transferred into Breedon Northern and Breedon Southern according 
to geographic location, and the remaining cementitious operations rebranded as Breedon Cement. The prior year 
segmental analysis has been restated to reflect the new structure.
A description of the activities of each segment is included on pages 29 to 37 . There are no other operating segments.

(2016: 20.00 per cent).
**  A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 20 per cent to 19 per cent (effective from 1 April 2017) was substantively enacted on 26 October 2015, and an additional 
reduction to 17 per cent (effective 1 April 2020) was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016. This will reduce the Group’s future current tax charge accordingly. 
The deferred tax liability at 31 December 2017 has been calculated based on these rates.
**  The adjustment in respect of prior years arises as a result of the difference between tax relating to acquired companies calculated for provisioning purposes in the prior year 
Financial Statements and the submission of final tax returns for 2016.

Other intangible assets at 31 December 2017 relate to acquisition intangibles, being the fair value of certain customer 
lists and contracts. These intangible assets are being amortised over the anticipated life of the underlying asset 
as appropriate, with the amortisation charge being recognised in non-underlying administrative expenses in the 
Consolidated Income Statement. The balance at 31 December 2016 included emissions rights of £3,813,000 which 
were utilised during the year.
Impairment tests for cash generating units containing goodwill
Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or 
more frequently if there are indications that the goodwill may be impaired. Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash 
generating units (CGUs) according to the level at which management monitor that goodwill. 
A summary of the carrying value allocated to each CGU is shown below:
2017

Breedon Southern 75,801 71,017
Breedon Cement 99,845 99,845
190,668 185,884
*Following the reorganisation of operating segments in the year, goodwill has been reallocated between CGUs. See note 2 for further details.
The key assumptions used in performing the impairment review are set out below:
Cash flow projections
Cash flow projections for each CGU are derived from the annual budget approved by the Board for 2018 and the 
three year plan for 2019 and 2020. The key assumptions on which budgets and forecasts are based include sales 
growth, product mix and operating costs. These cash flows are then extrapolated forward for a further 27 years,  
with the total period of 30 years reflecting the long term nature of the underlying assets. Budgeted cash flows  
are based on past experience and forecast future trading conditions.

03 
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS 01 02 04 9 INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED
Long-term growth rates
Cash flow projections assume a 2.0 per cent (2016: 2.0 per cent) annual growth rate from year 4 to 30 of the cash flow 
projections. This reflects forecast rates of growth in the UK.
Discount rate
Forecast pre-tax cash flows for each CGU have been discounted at a pre-tax rate of 10.4 per cent (2016: 10.7 per 
cent) and a post-tax rate of 8.0 per cent (2016: 8.3 per cent) which was calculated by an external expert based on 
market participants’ cost of capital and adjusted to reflect the risks specific to the CGU. As each CGU is considered to 
have similar risks and similar long-term prospects, the same discount rate has been applied to each of them. 
Sensitivity
The Group has applied sensitivities to assess whether any reasonable possible changes in assumptions could cause 
an impairment that would be material to these consolidated Financial Statements. This demonstrated that neither a 
1.0 per cent point increase in the discount rate, nor a 1.0 per cent reduction in the annual growth rate would cause 
an impairment.
The directors have therefore concluded that no impairment to goodwill is required.

The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set 
appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and 
systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through 
its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control 
environment in which all employees understand their role and obligations.
Treasury activities are managed on a Group basis under policies and procedures approved and monitored by the 
Board. These are designed to reduce the financial risks faced by the Group which primarily relate to movements in 
interest rates. Where appropriate, the Group uses financial instruments to manage these risks. No speculative use of 
derivatives, currency or other instruments is permitted.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet 
its contractual obligations, and arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and, principally, 
from the Group’s receivables from customers.
Management has a credit policy in place and exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. The Group has 
credit insurance covering the majority of its private sector customers. At the reporting date, there were no significant 
concentrations of credit risk.
Exposure to credit risk
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit 
risk at the reporting date was:

STATEMENTS 01 02 04 20 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
Exposure to credit risk continued
Credit risk associated with cash balances and derivative financial instruments is managed by transacting with financial 
institutions with high quality credit ratings. Accordingly, the Group’s associated credit risk is limited.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date, by reportable segment, was:
Carrying amount

Breedon Southern 61,028 55,309
Breedon Cement 11,211 8,112
102,128 94,311
Management considers that the credit quality of the various receivables is good in respect of the amounts 
outstanding. The Group has no individually significant customers. The majority of the Group’s customers are end-
user customers. The Group’s credit insurance covers the majority of its private sector UK trade receivables subject 
to an aggregate first loss. The Group has fully provided for all its doubtful debt exposure. The remaining credit risk is 
therefore considered to be low.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations as they 
fall due. The Group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecasts and cash flows and negotiating 
appropriate bank facilities. The Group uses term and revolving bank facilities and sufficient headroom is maintained 
above peak requirements to meet unforeseen events.

Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risk of changes in interest rates. The Group’s operations trade 
predominantly in their functional currency and accordingly, minimal translation exposures arise in trade receivables or 
trade payables.
Interest rate risk
The Group currently borrows at floating and fixed interest rates. The Group uses interest rate caps to manage its 
exposure to changes in floating interest rates. Since July 2016, the Group has had an interest rate cap covering 
£90,000,000 of debt which caps interest rates (excluding margins) at 3.17 per cent to July 2018. The Group classifies 
interest rate caps as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value. The fair value of the cap at 31 December 2017 
was £Nil (2016: asset of £1,000). This amount was recognised as a fair value derivative and the effective portion of the 
fair value is recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve.
At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments was:

Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. 
Therefore a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss.
Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments
An increase of 100 basis points in interest rates in respect of variable rate instruments at the reporting date 
would have decreased equity and income and expenditure for a full year by £1,125,000 (2016: £1,454,000). 
A decrease of 100 basis points would have increased equity and income and expenditure for a full year by £625,000 
(2016: £380,000). These analyses assume that all other variables remain constant.
Fair values versus carrying amounts
The directors consider that the carrying amounts recorded in the financial information in respect of financial assets 
and liabilities, which are carried at amortised cost, approximates to their fair values. 
Derivative financial are carried at fair value. The following table analyses financial instruments carried at fair value by 
valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:
• Level 1 – unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
• Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
as a direct price or indirectly derived from prices
• Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data

Capital management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and 
to sustain the future development of the business. The Board closely monitors the shareholder base and earnings per 
share. Subject to the availability of distributable reserves, dividends will be paid to shareholders when the directors 
believe it is appropriate and prudent to do so. However, for now, the main focus of the Group will be on delivering 
capital growth for shareholders.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of 
borrowing and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
The financial covenants associated with the Group’s borrowings are a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest 
cover. The Group complied with its covenants at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016.

24 EARNINGS PER SHARE
The calculation of earnings per share is based on the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of 
£56,927,000 (2016: £36,719,000) and on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 
1,428,956,906 (2016: 1,257,812,971).
The calculation of underlying earnings per share is based on the profit for the year attributable to ordinary 
shareholders, adjusted to add back non–underlying items, of £59,222,000 (2016: £43,885,000) and on the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year as above.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share is based on 1,454,185,019 shares (2016: 1,299,537,417). The adjustment for 
dilution of 25,228,113 (2016: 41,724,446) potential ordinary shares comprises 15,768,587 (2016: 29,279,278) in respect 
of warrants (detailed in note 18) and 9,459,526 (2016: 12,445,168) in respect of share based payments.
25 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
The Group has guaranteed its share of the banking facilities of BEAR Scotland Limited, the Company’s associated 
undertaking. The maximum liability at 31 December 2017 amounted to £1,838,000 (2016: £1,838,000).
The Group has also guaranteed the performance of BEAR Scotland’s contracts in respect of the maintenance of trunk 
roads in the North West and North East of Scotland and in respect of the M80 Operating and Maintenance contract.
26 ACQUISITIONS 
Current year acquisitions
During the year, the Group acquired the entire share capital of the following companies:
• Pro Mini Mix Concrete, Mortars and Screeds Limited (2 May 2017)
• Humberside Aggregates Limited (1 August 2017)
These transactions were accounted for as business combinations. The fair value of the consideration paid and the 
consolidated net assets acquired, together with the goodwill arising in respect of these were as follows:

The fair value adjustments primarily comprised adjustments to:
• revalue certain mineral reserves and resources to reflect the fair value at date of acquisition;
• impairment adjustments in respect of certain items of plant and equipment;
• inventories to reflect fair value;
• restoration provisions to reflect costs to comply with environmental, planning and other legislation; and
• deferred tax balances.

BREEDON GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2017 
WWW.BREEDONGROUP.COM 26 ACQUISITIONS CONTINUED
Current year acquisitions continued
The goodwill arising represents the potential to access further reserves of mineral subject to obtaining the necessary 
permissions, the strategic geographic location of the assets acquired and the skills of the existing workforce. 
Following careful consideration, in the view of the directors, no intangible assets arose in respect of these acquisitions.
In total the Group incurred acquisition related costs of £626,000 (2016: £3,119,000) in the year relating principally to 
external professional fees and due diligence costs. These have been included as non-underlying administrative costs 
(see note 3). 
During the year, these acquisitions contributed revenues of £4,409,000 and underlying EBIT of £735,000 to the Group.
Cash flow effect
The cash flow effect of the current year acquisitions can be summarised as follows:
£000
Consideration paid (9,732)
Cash acquired with the businesses 531
Net cash consideration shown in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (9,201)
If both the Pro Mini Mix Concrete, Mortars and Screeds Limited acquisition and the acquisition of Humberside 
Aggregates Limited had occurred on 1 January 2017, the results of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2017 
would have shown revenue of £660,200,000 and underlying EBIT of £80,900,000.
Prior year acquisitions
In 2016 the Group acquired Hope Construction Materials Limited and Sherburn Minerals Limited. No adjustments have 
been made in respect of either acquisition within the measurement period, and the provisional fair values reported in 
the prior year are now considered final.
Acquisitions announced but not completed at balance sheet date
On 13 December 2017, the Group announced its agreement to acquire from Tarmac Holdings Limited four quarries 
and an asphalt plant for £16.5 million, to be satisfied by the transfer to Tarmac of 27 ready-mixed concrete plants and 
payment of £4.9 million in cash. The deal is expected to complete in 2018 subject to CMA approval. As this approval 
was pending at the balance sheet date, no reclassification adjustment has been made to treat the assets to be 
disposed of as ‘held for sale’. 
27 ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of financial information requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying 
accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial information are 
described below:
Accounting estimates
Fair values of assets on business combinations
In determining the fair valuation of assets acquired under business combinations, including the valuation of other 
intangibles, a number of estimates are made. These include the market value of minerals, property, plant and 
equipment, associated liabilities for contractual restoration provisions and the valuation of intangible assets, including 
customer lists and contracts. The reasons for any residual excess of consideration over the net asset value, being 
goodwill arising, are then identified. The Group utilises independent experts, where appropriate, to assist with the 
determination of the market value of certain minerals, property and plant and equipment. 
111
03 
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS 01 02 04 27 ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS CONTINUED
Accounting estimates continued
Restoration provisions
Restoration provisions principally comprise provisions for the cost of restoring and decommissioning sites where 
an obligation arises to comply with contractual, environmental, planning and other legislation. This is an inherently 
subjective calculation requiring the use of experts where appropriate. 
Estimated future cash flows have been determined on a site by site basis through expert evaluation of the present day 
cost of restoration, which is then inflated to the point that the cash flow is expected to occur and discounted at an 
appropriate rate to reflect the net present value of the obligation as at the year end. Estimated restoration dates have 
been determined as the earlier of the date at which reserves are expected to be exhausted or planning permission on 
reserves is expected to expire, which fall over the next 25 years. 
Accounting judgements
Mineral reserves and resources
Mineral reserves and resources are the principal asset available to the Group. Mineral reserves and resources are 
acquired either in the normal course of business or through business combinations.
Mineral reserves and resources acquired in the normal course of business are held at historic cost on initial 
recognition. When mineral assets arise through business combinations, these are initially recognised at fair value as 
part of the acquisition accounting under IFRS 3. This fair value is based on expert geological surveys which provide 
an estimate of the accessible reserves and resources. The assessment of cost is therefore not  considered to be a 
significant estimate.
Subsequent to initial recognition, mineral assets are held at amortised cost and are expensed to reflect their use over 
time through an annual depletion charge. Mineral assets are subject to impairment testing if impairment triggers 
are identified, which include elements outside of the Group’s control such as potential changes in the planning and 
regulatory environment, geological and archaeological factors. The identification of impairment triggers therefore 
requires the Group to exercise judgement. 
Customer claims
Customer claims arise in the normal course of business. The majority of these claims are small in nature, and whilst 
estimation uncertainty arises in quantifying the possible range of a settlement or value of remedial works needing 
to be performed, this is not considered to be a significant estimate as claims are typically low in value. The group 
exercises judgement in determining the recognition or disclosure of any larger claims in line with IAS 37 - Provisions, 
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.

ADDITIONAL 
INFORMATION 01 03 02 Notes
1.  Under Jersey law a special resolution requires a two thirds rather than three quarters majority of those voting at the Meeting in person or by 
proxy to vote in favour of the resolution.
2.   Every member who is present in person shall on a show of hands have one vote and every member present in person or by proxy shall on a poll 
have one vote for each share of which he or she is the holder.
3.   A member entitled to attend and vote at the Meeting convened by this notice is also entitled to appoint one or more proxies. If a proxy other 
than the Chairman is desired, strike out ‘the Chairman of the Meeting or’ and insert the name or names preferred and initial the alteration. 
A proxy need not be a member of the Company but must attend the Meeting in person.
4.   A form of proxy is enclosed. To be valid, this form and the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed, or a notarially 
certified copy of such power or authority must reach the Registrar at Link Asset Services, PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham BR3 4TU not 
less than forty-eight hours before the time appointed for holding the Meeting or adjournment or the taking of a poll at which the person named 
in the proxy form proposes to vote.
5. As an alternative to completing your hard-copy proxy form, you can appoint a proxy electronically at www.signalshares.com. For an electronic   
 proxy appointment to be valid, your appointment must be received by no later than 2:00pm on 22 April 2018 .
6.   If you wish your proxy to speak on your behalf at the Meeting, you will need to appoint your own choice of proxy (which is not the Chairman) 
and give instructions directly to the proxy. The completion and return of a form of proxy will enable you to vote at the Meeting without having 
to be present at the Meeting, but will not preclude you from attending the Meeting and voting in person if you should subsequently decide to 
do so.
7.   You may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. You may not appoint 
more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. To appoint more than one proxy you may photocopy the form of proxy. 
Please indicate the proxy holder’s name and the number of shares in relation to which they are authorised to act as your proxy (which, in 
aggregate, should not exceed the number of shares held by you). Please also indicate if the proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions 
being given. All forms must be signed and should be returned together in the same envelope. If you wish to appoint the Chairman as one of 
your multiple proxies, leave the words ‘Chairman of the Meeting’ on the relevant proxy form.
8.  Shares held in uncertificated form (i.e. in CREST) may be voted through the CREST Proxy Voting Service in accordance with the procedures set 
out in the CREST manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a 
voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on 
their behalf.
9.  In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a ‘CREST Proxy 
Instruction’) must be properly (under CREST participant ID RA10) authenticated in accordance with CRESTCo’s specifications and must 
contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the 
appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so 
as to be received by the issuer’s agent by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments by 2.00 pm on 22 April 2018. For this purpose, 
the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Application Host) from 
which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of 
instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
10.  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that CRESTCo does not make available 
special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input 
of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal 
member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) 
take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this 
connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) are referred, in particular, to those 
sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
11.  In the case of a corporation, the form of proxy must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer or attorney duly 
authorised. In the case of an individual, the form of proxy must be signed by the individual or his or her duly authorised attorney.
12.  In the case of joint holders, the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy will be accepted to the exclusion of the 
votes of any other joint holders and for this purpose seniority will be determined by the order in which the names are recorded in the Register 
of Members.
13.  The directors of the Company will interpret any ambiguous proxy appointments. The Chairman of the Meeting will, in his capacity as proxy, 
interpret any voting instructions he receives. Their respective determinations shall be final.
14. Any alterations made to the form of proxy must be initialled by the person who signs it.
15.  The Company, pursuant to Article 40 of the Companies Uncertificated Securities (Jersey) Order 1999, specifies that only those members 
registered in the register of members of the Company as at 6.00pm on 22 April 2018 or, in the event that the Meeting is adjourned, in the 
register of members 48 hours before the time of any adjourned meeting(s), shall be entitled to attend or vote at the Meeting or any adjournment 
thereof in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at that time. Changes to the register of members after these times will be 
disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the Meeting or any adjournment thereof.

ADDITIONAL 
INFORMATION 01 03 02 UNSOLICITED MAIL, INVESTMENT ADVICE AND FRAUD
The Company is obliged by law to make its share register publicly available and, as a consequence, some shareholders 
may receive unsolicited mail. In addition, many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received 
unsolicited phone calls or correspondence, typically from overseas ‘brokers’, concerning investment matters.
These callers can be very persistent and extremely persuasive and their activities have resulted in considerable losses 
for some investors. It is not just the novice investor that has been deceived in this way; many victims have been 
successfully investing for several years. Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to 
buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports.
Please keep in mind that firms authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) are unlikely to contact you out of 
the blue with an offer to buy or sell shares.
If you receive any unsolicited mail or investment advice:
• Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation.
• Check the Financial Services Register at www.fca.org.uk.
• Use the details on the Financial Services Register to contact the firm.
• Call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768 if there are no contact details on the Register or you are told they 
are out of date.
• Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised firm, copying its website or giving you false contact details.
• Use the firm’s contact details listed on the Register if you want to call them back.
• Search the list of unauthorised firms and individuals to avoid doing business with at www.fca.org.uk/scams.
• Report a share scam by telling the FCA using the share fraud reporting form in the Consumers section of the 
FCA website.
• If the unsolicited phone calls persist, hang up.
• If you wish to limit the amount of unsolicited mail you receive, contact the Mailing Preference Service on 020 7291 
3310 or visit the website at www.mpsonline.org.uk.
If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme. If you have already paid money to share fraudsters you should contact Action Fraud on 0300 
123 2040.
