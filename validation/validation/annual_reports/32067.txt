What We Do
The Group’s competitive advantage 
lies in its market positioning, 
operational process and flexibility.
Our sales
The Discount market represents 16% of the overall tissue market and is the 
fastest growing sector at over 10% per annum. Accrol’s decision to focus 
on this sector in 2008, has delivered sales CAGR of 15.9% since 2013. 
Accrol is the market leader in the Discount segment with 50% share by 
market value.
Technology and converting lines
The Group currently has 17 converting lines in operation which includes  
2 recently commissioned lines at Leyland. This provides a total converting 
capacity of approximately 143,000 tonnes per annum. The Group’s 
operating machinery allows conversion of a wide variety of tissue grades, 
adding flexibility to the Parent Reel sourcing process and allowing 
manufacture of a wide range of product types.

Product range
Accrol is able to manufacture toilet rolls, kitchen rolls, facial tissue and AFH 
products, providing a ‘one stop shop’ solution for customers. We believe the 
ability to produce all 4 key segments is a competitive advantage.
Discounters’ tissue offerings are skewed towards Private Label and this is driving 
the growth of Private Label in the market as a whole. Discounters typically look  
for lower prices and suppliers that offer high, sustainable volumes. Discounters 
typically dedicate 3% of their shelf space to tissue products, compared to 2% in 
the Multiples. The majority of Accrol’s products are Private Label.

Chairman’s Statement
Overview of the year
I am delighted to report that FY17 was another successful 
year for the Group. Our revenue grew to £135.1 million, 
increasing 14% compared to FY16 and in line with market 
expectations.
Adjusted EBITDA increased to 16.1 million, up 7%, and 
adjusted profit before tax increased £4.8 million to £13.0 
million, up 58%. Profit after tax has risen to £7.4 million,  
up 29%.
With Grocery inflation rising during the year, consumer 
footfall in the Discount Sector showed no signs of 
slowing down as shoppers continued to look for ways of 
offsetting rising household prices and switching to lower 
cost alternatives. As a result of new contract wins starting 
in late 2016, our value market share in the Discount 
Sector grew to over 50%, firmly endorsing Accrol as the 
soft tissue supplier of choice for the sector.
The year was not without its challenges. In anticipation 
of Sterling weakness and volatility following the UK’s 
decision to leave the European Union, we moved to 
protect ourselves from adverse exchange rate 
fluctuations by significantly hedging our exposure to help 
mitigate raw material cost price increases. However, we 
have continued to look ahead, positioning ourselves for 
growth, investing in both our facilities and our team to 
help us capitalise on the market opportunity.   
During the year, we opened our new production facility 
at Leyland, Lancashire, which gives us the opportunity to 
install a total of 6 tissue converting lines and the potential 
to generate revenues in excess of £100 million from the 
site, and £250 million in aggregate. We currently have 2 
lines installed and recently announced the addition of a 
3rd line which will be installed towards the end of 2018 as 
we seek to extend our reach into the Major Multiples. 
We also embarked on an ambitious plan to reorganise 
our warehousing and logistics operations, creating a 
centralised finished goods hub next to the M58 in 
Skelmersdale, Lancashire. This will enable us to better 
service our customers and prepare for future growth.
Accrol’s founders, the Hussain family, have now fully 
exited the business in line with the strategy we set out at 
IPO, and we have made a number of new senior 
management hires across the business. I would like to 
thank the Hussain family for a smooth and successful 
transition to new management.
Strategy and outlook
The continued oversupply of Parent Reels shows no sign 
of abating and as of January 2017, a further 111 tissue 
mills were on order or in their final stages, keeping 
pricing competitive and supporting our strategy to 
procure Parent Reels versus own manufacture. We will 
continue to source reels from around the globe, taking 
advantage of new technology and spare capacity. 
The majority of Private Label retail shelf prices for soft 
tissue are still at pre-EU referendum levels. There are 
positive signs that this is changing, albeit slower than we 
expected, and we expect the industry as a whole to pass 
on the effects of the weaker pound as currency 
contracts unwind.

Dividend policy
The Board remains committed to a 
progressive dividend policy. The interim 
dividend of 2.0p per share was paid in 
February 2017. The Board has proposed a 
final dividend of 4.0p per share, which 
together with the interim dividend represents 
a 6% yield at the IPO listing price. 
The final dividend is subject to the approval 
of the Company’s shareholders and will be

POSITIONING 
FOR FUTURE 
GROWTH
Market overview
FY17 has been a year of delivery and positioning for  
future growth of Accrol, with the UK tissue market 
currently worth £2.2 billion at retail selling price. 
Although there has been a small decline, due to 
promotional activity, in the value of consumer sales 
through Multiples and Discounters, down 1.5% to £1.5 
billion, the Discount Sector continues to demonstrate 
the most significant growth at over 10% per annum. 
Brands continue to be slowly eroded with Own-Label 
within the Major Multiples reaching 47% of the total 
market by March 2017. Inflation, driven by a fall in the 
value of Sterling following the EU referendum, first 
appeared in the tissue category in early 2017 and is 
expected to accelerate as the year continues.
In anticipation of exchange rate volatility immediately 
ahead of, and following, the EU Referendum, Accrol 
entered into a significant number of forward contracts  
to hedge its currency exposure. This, along with 
favourable Parent Reel pricing dynamics, enabled Accrol 
to minimise the impact of foreign exchange rate volatility 
on its financial performance through FY17. As exchange 
rates continue to be weak in favour of the US Dollar, 
tissue manufacturers and convertors are facing rising raw 
material prices as pulp is traded in US Dollars on global 
markets. Accrol is well advanced in conversations with 
customers regarding inflation recovery but they are 
challenging and will take time to conclude.
Strategy
Throughout the year we have focused on our long-term 
strategy of increasing our share of the Discount Sector as 
increasing inflation encourages UK shoppers to search out 
quality and value and further accelerates the growth of the 
Discount Sector. Evidence of this can already be seen with 
Aldi and Lidl both recently reporting market share growth 
of almost 20%. Increasing product prices will also see 
further moves in sales from brands into Own-Label within 
the Major Multiples as they all seek to re-set their ranges 
and shopper offering. Our aim of gaining further Own-
Label business with the Major Multiples therefore remains  
a key strategic objective. 
Our sourcing strategy of purchasing Parent Reels globally 
from partner paper mills will continue to be a key point of 
difference. Leveraging strong commercial terms, flexibility 
on sourcing new technologies and better use of cash 
remain the key advantages of this sourcing strategy as 
opposed to a vertically-integrated model. There is still 
significant over capacity in the world pulp and tissue 
markets, as new paper mills come online, which appears 
set to continue through to 2019.
Contracts
We won a number of new contracts in FY17, the most 
significant being the launch of Lidl’s Floralys range in 
November 2016. The account has continued to trade 
above the original expected levels of circa £10 million 
per annum.
Relationships with key customers remain positive and 
our investment for future growth by increasing capacity 
and improving our supply chain has been well-received. 
Our relationship with Booker, Accrol’s largest customer, 
continues to be strong and we have recently signed a 
new supply agreement.
Conversations with the Major Multiples continued 
throughout the year and all outlined the need for an 
increase in Accrol’s manufacturing capacity in order  
to move major tranches of volume, underlying the 
importance of our continued investment in the business. 
Increased input costs driven by exchange rates have 
prompted inflation recovery conversations and, 
subsequently, more tender processes across the 
industry. Accrol Group Holdings plc / Annual Report and Accounts 7

Investment
Significant progress has been made on 
building a platform for future growth during 
the year. A suitable 168,000 sq ft site was 
quickly identified and secured at Leyland, 
Lancashire. From moving into the building  
in late October 2016, the premises were 
modified for manufacturing use with the 2 
converting lines installed from January 2017 
onwards. Commissioning on the first line 
was completed in April 2017 and on the 
second line in June 2017. Ramp up of 
volume has continued with the addition of 
new shift patterns and will continue into 
FY18. We recently announced the purchase 
of a further tissue conversion line which will 
take the total business capacity to 158,000 
tonnes for FY18 or circa £200 million per 
annum sales. The Leyland site has space for 
a further 3 conversion lines in addition to the 
3 lines that will be in place.
In addition to laying down new capacity,  
an investment programme commenced in 
the year on the existing Blackburn sites to 
improve operational efficiency, and hence 
overall capacity. This includes staff training 
and a new rotating shift pattern that is more 
employee friendly.
The final part of the investment for growth 
strategy in FY17 was the implementation of  
a Supply Chain Optimisation plan to improve 
and simplify warehousing and logistics, 
creating additional capacity for growth.  
A more efficient single ‘big shed’ solution 
was adopted and a site quickly identified  
on the M58 at Skelmersdale in Lancashire.  
This 368,000 sq ft warehouse is newly 
refurbished and will house finished goods 
and provide central distribution facilities to  
all UK customers. Warehouse management 
and national logistics will be contracted  
out to a 3rd-party provider, NFT, enabling  
the Accrol management team to focus  
on its core competencies of sourcing and 
manufacturing. 
People
Following our IPO in June 2016, a new PLC 
Board was put in place and a review of our 
organisational structure was undertaken. Key 
gaps were identified and have subsequently 
been filled with highly experienced industry 
experts. The new team helped transition  
the Hussain family out of the business by 
October 2016 as agreed in a collaborative 
and controlled manner.
People remain our most important asset  
and further investment continues to be 
made into their working environment 
through a focus on equipment and health 
and safety, into their welfare through more 
employee-friendly rotating shift patterns,  
and into respecting their views and opinions 
through employee engagement.
Market opportunities/outlook
The Directors believe that Accrol’s strategy 
remains relevant for the marketplace and that 
there continue to be opportunities for further 
growth. The move toward Discounters and 
Own-Label will be accelerated as shoppers 
try to reduce the inevitable impact of inflation 
without compromising on quality. Despite 
the exchange rate driven inflationary 
pressures and the slower than expected 
consumer price increases which the whole 
industry faces, the Directors remain confident 
that when price increases do come through, 
our sourcing policy and investment in 
capacity, supply chain efficiency and people 
has positioned Accrol to take advantage of 
the marketplace dynamics.

represent 16% of the consumer sector which is the fastest growing 
sector at over 10% per annum*.
The total market value is in slight decline by 1.5% pa* due to

rolls.Brands continue to be eroded with Private label products 
reaching 47% of the overall market by March 2017*.
* Kantar to March 2017
Our focus
Changes in consumer attitudes towards Discounters have driven 
the rise in their market share in the overall grocery sector in the  
last 5 years, at the expense of the big 4 Multiples, all of which have 
lost revenues directly to Discounters such as Aldi and Lidl.
Management’s decision in 2008 to focus on the Discount market 
has driven contract wins in the sector and has led to Accrol 
becoming the market leader, holding 50% share of the  
Discount market.
Future growth
We are under-represented in the biggest sector of the market 
where Multiples have invested into Private Label and offer a greater 
range of such products compared to other retailers. Multiples are 
expected to continue to increase their Private Label offerings and 
Private Label market share.

Business Model
OUR
MODEL
Our vision is to be the leading 
independent supplier of Private 
Label tissue products to both the 
Discount and Multiples sectors. 
Dynamic Sourcing
The UK consumes 1.2 million 
tonnes of tissue paper per 
annum, of which c. 0.3 million 
tonnes is imported. Accrol does 
not operate a paper mill and 
instead it imports Parent Reels 
from around the world. As such, 
the UK is a net importer of Parent 
Reels, of which Accrol takes 32% 
of all imports. 
There is a global over-supply of 
both pulp and Parent Reels and 
additional capacity is forecast to 
be brought on stream through  
to 2019. Parent Reel prices are 
driven by pulp prices and excess 
capacity in both the pulp and 
Parent Reel production. Excess 
global supply has suppressed 
Parent Reel prices allowing 
Accrol to compete on price 
compared to those competitors 
that operate mills. 
Low capital model
Our model of purchasing  
and converting Parent Reels  
(as opposed to manufacturing 
the Parent Reels from pulp  
and recycled fibre), requires 
lower fixed overhead and 
provides flexibility in sourcing to 
capitalise on favourable pricing 
opportunities and production 
technology advancements.
 
Modern, efficient machinery
Investment in state-of-the-art 
lines (>60% of the lines are less 
than five years old) has reduced 
our operating cost per unit to  
a market leading position.
Production flexibility
Our operating machinery allows 
conversion of a variety of input 
tissue grades, adding flexibility to 
the Parent Reel sourcing process 
and allowing manufacture of a 
wide range of product types.

Winning new contracts – Lidl
• Drawing on our experience in the Discount Sector, we pitched  
for the Lidl own-label tissue contract. The Lidl team visited our 
Blackburn site to review our credentials and facilities, and reassure 
themselves we had available capacity for growth. 
• We carried out a marketplace review and made recommendations 
to Lidl on range and price points. We also presented a variety of 
embossing options for the product tiers (good/ better/ best) and 
made recommendations for each tier. Our new NTT toilet tissue 
was proposed for their Supersoft products on an exclusive basis.
• Following a tender process and approval of samples we made  
a value-added proposal to reconfigure Lidl’s current pallets to 
become front facing, maximising product visibility – making them 
more shopper-friendly and potentially boosting sell through.
• We were awarded supply contracts for 10 products (3 promotional) 
with deliveries to commencing in September 2016. Design, artwork 
and pack formats were agreed and capacity booked to ensure 
successful delivery of this significant contract win. 
• This win accelerated the need for new capacity which would 
require new factory space – our Leyland site. 
• The contract kicked off with a four week, 18 pack toilet roll 
promotion, followed in November 2016 by the full range. Accrol Group Holdings plc / Annual Report and Accounts 15

stream in April, will produce kitchen roll. Both lines will be fully 
manned on a rotating shift pattern, employing 80 new staff and 
management.
• A third line has been ordered and will be commissioned in March 
2018, adding a further 15,000 tonnes pa capacity. This creates 
significant spare capacity allowing Accrol to bid for further Multiple 
contracts.
• We have also invested further in our Blackburn sites to enhance 
key lines, train staff and implement a new, employee friendly, 
rotating shift system. This will increase our existing capacity by 
12,000 tonnes pa by October 2017. 
CAPABILITY
• Our Supply Chain Review was challenged with finding an optimal 
solution to match the growth ambitions and a ‘Big Shed’ solution 
was presented to the Board in November 2016. The plan was to 
exit our current 6 warehouses and move to a simpler, more 
efficient central distribution system.
• A 368,000 sq ft. warehouse was found near Skelmersdale and NFT 
awarded a 5 year, £60m contract in March 2017 to provide world 
class logistics and warehouse management. The transition of 
stock and distribution commenced during April and will be 
complete for August 2017.
• A combination of investment in new capacity at Leyland, 
improving efficiency at Blackburn, and adopting the ‘Big Shed’ 
solution in Skelmersdale provides a robust platform for growth 
which matches the sales opportunity. Accrol Group Holdings plc / Annual Report and Accounts 16

Chief Financial Officer’s Report continued
Revenues
Revenues grew by 14.2% or £16.8m year on year with the majority  
of the growth coming from the Discounters. The Discount segment 
of the UK tissue market has increased from 14% to 16%, taking share 
from the Multiples. In terms of products, toilet tissue revenues 
showed the highest year on year growth of 27.3% or £14.6m. As a 
proportion of revenue, toilet tissue has increased from 44% in the 
prior year to 49% in the current year. 
Gross margin
Adjusted gross margin decreased marginally by 0.2% from 28.1% for 
the year ended 30 April 2016 to 27.9% for the year ended 30 April 
2017. Adjusted gross margin excludes the impact of unrealised gains 
and losses on outstanding forward foreign currency contracts valued 
at the Balance Sheet date. The decrease of 0.2% is mainly due to:
• In order to reduce the impact of the adverse movements in both 
the US$ and Euro exchange rates, we entered into a significant 
volume of forward currency contracts ahead of, and following,  
the EU referendum, selling Sterling and purchasing both US$  
and Euros. This coupled with favourable Parent Reel pricing 
delivered a 0.3% improvement in adjusted gross margin.
• We have continued to invest in production head count to support 
the sales growth at a cost of 0.5% of adjusted gross margin. 
Administration costs
Administrative costs have increased year on year by £2.6m to £15.6m 
mainly due a £1.1m increase in exceptional costs, £0.6m due to 
increased wage costs as we continue to invest in people to support 
the sales growth, £0.3m due to plc related running costs  
and £0.6m due to insurance, depreciation and utilities.
Exceptional costs of £1.6m in the current year relate to AIM flotation 
costs of £0.2m (balance of £1.6m is included in the share premium 
account), consulting costs of £0.6m, an early settlement fee on 
finance leases of £0.4m and the write-off of previous deal related 
costs attached to the previous debt structure of £0.4m. 
Distribution costs
Distribution costs as a percentage of revenue has increased year on 
year by 0.5% to 8.5%. The increase is mainly due to destination mix 
change with an increased number of southern depots coupled with 
an increased usage of packaging materials. 
Finance costs
Finance costs have decreased significantly year on year by £3.8m  
to £1.1m mainly due to the restructuring of the debt at listing on  
AIM in June 2016. The 10% fixed rate secured manager loan notes, 
the 10% fixed rate secured investor loan notes and the majority  
of the finance leases were repaid at listing. A new Revolving Credit 
Facility of £18.0m was put in place at IPO with a drawdown at IPO  
of £13.0m. 
Taxation
The effective tax rate for the year was 21.5% which is higher  
than both the standard rate of taxation and the prior year (18.3%) 
primarily as a result of non-deductible expenses which largely 
relate to professional fees and to an element of interest charges  
on loan notes which are not deductible for tax purposes. The 
change in the statutory tax rate to 19.92% (2016: 20%) is due to  
the reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from 20% 1 April 
2016 to 19% from 1 April 2017.
Balance sheet
Property, plant and equipment
In the previous financial year, we acquired 2 further converting  
lines at a cost of £3.2m. In the current year, we have installed  
both of these machines in our new production facility at Leyland. 
Start-up costs of £3.4m are included in assets under construction 
with deprecation of the 2 lines and the start-up costs starting from  
May 2017.
Intangibles
Intangibles comprise mainly of goodwill and customer relationships. 
Under IFRS, goodwill is not amortised but is subject to an impairment 
review on at least an annual basis. Consequently, during the year, the 
Directors performed a review, which involved making assumptions 
about the future performance of the business. After carefully 
considering various scenarios that could occur and after looking at 
sensitivities on these scenarios, the Directors concluded that no 
impairment was required. Customer relationships have been 
recognised at fair value and are amortised over 10 years.

Raw material stocks have increased by £2.1m with the majority of the

Finished goods stocks have increased by £2.9m year on year with 
last year significantly lower than expected due to higher sales 
demand around year end. Finished goods stock levels at 30 April 
2017 are of an appropriate level to ensure we provide good service  
to our customers. 
Trade receivables have increased by £3.4m in line with the sales 
growth, showing our continued tight control of cash collection.

As part of the AIM flotation process, shareholder loan notes, bank

Revolving Credit Facility of £18.0m was put in place with a day  
1 draw down of £13.0m. The opening day net debt position following 
flotation was £23.1m with the above position representing a 
reduction of £4.1m to 1.18 times the FY17 adjusted EBITDA. 
Net cash flows from operating activities increased £2.7m or 57.2%  
to £7.4m mainly due to higher adjusted EBITDA year on year, lower 
relative investment in working capital and lower interest paid 
following the debt restructuring noted above. 
Looking forward
After completing our first year on AIM, we are looking forward to 
consolidating the investments in our new production facility in 
Leyland and our new distribution centre in Skemersdale. As before, 
our goal is to provide shareholder value through the provision of 
quality products and services to our existing and new customers. 
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 4p per Ordinary share 
giving a total of 6p per Ordinary share for the full year. The Board 
remains committed to a progressive dividend policy.

Risk and Mitigation
In order to gain an understanding of the risk exposure of the Group 
we review each area of our business annually and use a methodology 
that will assist the Group in measuring, evaluating, documenting and 
monitoring its risks within all areas of its operations. 
We use our risk management process as described to identify, monitor, evaluate and escalate risks as they emerge, enabling 
management to take appropriate action wherever possible in order to control them and also enabling the Board to keep risk 
management under review. The risk factors addressed below are those which we believe to be the most material to our business 
model, which could adversely affect the operations, revenue, profit, cash flow or assets of the Group and which may prevent us 
from achieving the Group’s strategic objectives. Additional risks and uncertainties currently unknown to us, or which we currently 
believe are immaterial, may also have an adverse effect on the Group.
Principal risk Impact Mitigation
Customer concentration
The loss of a major customer.
• The loss of a major customer and/or being 
too dependent on a small number of high 
value customers could seriously impact 
the sales revenue and hence profitability  
of the business.
• Nurture relationships with key customers. 
• Understand our customers’ business in 
order to identify opportunities.
• Ensure customer service levels are high. 
• Be ready to take advantage of market 
opportunities to take on new customers.
Cost of input goods and 
materials
Parent Reel and pulp capacity  
and pricing.
• If prices rise above management 
expectations this could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s ability  
to achieve strategic objectives.
• Nurture relationships with key suppliers. 
• Buy ahead. 
• Take favourable spot opportunities when 
available. 
• Remain close to market dynamics on 
pulp price and capacity. 
• Increase knowledge of overall capacity 
in market to identify new opportunities. 
• Remain flexible with regard to new 
suppliers.
Market and production capacity
New entrant into Market.
• A new entrant into the market creating 
extra capacity and competition.
• Ensure that Group remains cost 
competitive, delivering best quality  
and service to customers. 
Winning a large  
customer contract.
• The winning of a large contract could 
absorb all capacity headroom and  
could lead to supply issues if not  
managed closely.
• Ensure that we optimise the 
performance from our current 
production capacity and have clear 
plans to establish new production lines 
in line with business growth/winning 
new contracts.
Installation of new  
converting capacity.
• As the Group grows it needs to install new 
converting capacity to supply customers.
• We have done this on numerous 
occasions, most recently on the 2 new 
machines purchased in the previous 
financial year. Accrol Group Holdings plc / Annual Report and Accounts 21
Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report 
Principal risk Impact Mitigation
Financial
Volatility of foreign exchange rates.
• The majority of our Parent Reel purchases 
are in US$ or Euros. Fluctuations in the 
exchange rates could adversely affect 
input costs and hence profitability.
• We have a hedging policy.
• Currency purchased in line with hedging 
policy and budgets/forecasts.
• Flex purchasing towards US$, Euro or 
Sterling where appropriate.
• Significant adverse weakening of Sterling 
will impact the entire market with a market 
price increase most likely required.
Information technology 
dependency
The Group relies on IT systems in 
its day to day operations.
• Disruption in critical IT systems could 
have a negative impact on production and 
important business processes. 
• A recent detailed IT review and mapping 
exercise has been undertaken. The IT 
Strategy is in place and is reviewed on  
an ongoing basis.
• Critical business continuity plans and 
Disaster recovery contingencies are  
in place.
Human resources 
Key person dependency.
• Loss of key individuals could impact 
the Company’s ability to deliver its 
strategic goals and, resulting in declining 
performance and loss of investor 
confidence.
The Group uses a variety of techniques to 
attract, retain and motivate its staff, with 
particular attention paid to those in key roles 
to help ensure the long-term success of the 
Group. These techniques include: 
• The regular review of remuneration 
packages, including share incentive 
schemes, 
• Regular communication with staff; and 
• An annual performance review process.
Regulatory
Failure to adhere to regulatory 
requirements such as taxation,  
the Data Protection Act, Health 
and Safety and Fire safety 
regulations in particular.
• A major fire would lead to production 
loss and even factory loss. Due to the 
inflammable nature of tissue and the dust 
created during the converting process; the 
Group is at a greater risk of fire than many 
other industries.
• Non-compliance to Data Protection and 
Health & Safety regulations could result in 
fines, litigation and reputational damage.
• The Board has oversight over the 
management of regulatory risk and 
compliance and designates specific 
responsibilities to senior management who 
will seek external advice where relevant.
• Ensure Group have robust operational 
policies, procedures, risk assessments 
and contingencies around fire safety 
regulations.
• Update and test the Disaster Recovery 
Plan annually.

Corporate Governance Statement
Peter Cheung
Executive Chairman
The Directors place a significant emphasis on ensuring 
that Accrol has the appropriate governance structures  
in place. The Board recognise that the structure for a 
publicly listed entity looks very different to that required 
for an entrepreneurial business. As part of the preparatory 
work that was undertaken prior to our Initial Public 
Offering (IPO) on the AIM market in June 2016, a review 
of the kind of governance structure that was required and 
appropriate for Accrol, was undertaken and implemented.
This process is ongoing and will be continued by a  
Board that is committed to upholding the appropriate 
standards of corporate governance to ensure that there 
is an effective and efficient approach to managing the 
Group for the benefit of all shareholders.
The Committees noted below were formed upon our 
IPO and therefore commenced operating during the 
current April 2017 year end.
Peter Cheung

10 July 2017
I am pleased to introduce the second 
Corporate Governance Report for Accrol 
Group Holdings plc for the year ended 
30 April 2017. This report includes my 
statement, an introduction to the 
members of the Accrol Board and the 
Corporate Governance Report.

GOVERNANCE Accrol Group Holdings plc / Annual Report and Accounts 25
Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report 
Governance statement
As an AIM listed business, the Group is not required to comply with the provisions or report in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. The Board is, however, committed to the principles of good corporate governance and applies the Quoted Companies 
Alliance (QCA) Corporate Governance Code for Small and Mid-Size Quoted Companies 2013, as far as is practicable and appropriate for a 
public company of the Group’s size and nature.
Role of the Board
The role of the Board is to establish the vision and strategy for the Group, to deliver shareholder value and be responsible for the long-term 
success of the Group. Individual members of the Board have equal responsibility for the overall stewardship, management and performance 
of the Group and for the approval of its long-term objectives and strategic plans.

The Non-Executive Directors
Each of the Non-Executive Directors are free from any relationship with the Executive Management of the Group and are free from  
any business or other relationship that could affect or appear to affect the exercise of their independent judgment.
Accordingly, the Non-Executive Directors are each considered by the Board to be independent, in both character and judgement.
The operation of the Board
The Board has the authority for ensuring that the Group is appropriately managed and achieves the strategic objectives it sets. To achieve 
this, the Board reserves certain matters for its own determination including matters relating to Group strategy, approval of interim and annual 
financial results, dividend policy, major capital expenditure, budgets, monitoring performance, treasury policy, risk management, corporate 
governance and the effectiveness of its internal control systems. It has a schedule of matters specifically reserved for its approval. The Board 
performs its responsibilities through an annual programme of meetings and by continuous monitoring of the performance of the Group.
Matters considered by the Board during the year ended 30 April 2017 
included:
• Finance and operations review
• Annual budget and forecasts
• Risk review
• Strategic plans
• Health & safety
• Potential merger and acquisition targets
• Reports from the Board Committees
• Board evaluation

Corporate Governance Statement continued
Board Committees
The Board has delegated specific authority to the Audit Committee, 
Remuneration Committee and the Nomination Committee. 
Joanne Lake is Chairman of the Audit Committee which also 
comprises Peter Cheung and Steve Hammett. The Audit Committee 
has the primary responsibility for monitoring the quality of internal 
controls, ensuring that the financial performance of the Group  
is properly measured and reported on, and reviewing reports  
from the Group’s auditors relating to the Group’s accounting and  
internal controls, in all cases having due regard to the interests of 
shareholders. The Audit Committee meets at least 3 times a year. 
Peter Cheung is Chairman of the Nomination Committee which  
also comprises Joanne Lake and Steve Hammett. The Nomination 
Committee will identify and nominate, for the approval of the Board, 
candidates to fill Board vacancies as and when they arise. The 
Nomination Committee meets as required given the infrequency  
of senior appointments. 
Steve Hammett is Chairman of the Remuneration Committee which 
also comprises Peter Cheung and Joanne Lake. The Remuneration 
Committee reviews the performance of the Executive Directors and 
determines their terms and conditions of service, including their 
remuneration and the grant of options, having due regard to the 
interests of shareholders. The Remuneration Committee meets at 
least once a year.
Board and Committee meetings
The Board meets on a formal basis regularly and met formally 8 times 
in the year ended 30 April 2017. Members are supplied with financial 
and operational information in good time for review in advance of 
the meetings. 
The Directors attended the following meeting in the year ended  
30 April 2017:
Board Audit Remuneration Nomination
Peter Cheung 8 3 – –
Steve Crossley 8 n/a – –

Total meetings 8 3 – –
The Remuneration and Nomination Committees have not met in  
the current financial year as the recent IPO process had already 
determined the placement and remuneration of the Executive 
Directors and other members of the Board. 
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary. The Board approves the appointment and removal of the 
Company Secretary. The Non-Executive Directors are able to contact 
the Executive Directors, Company Secretary or Senior Managers at 
any time for further information.
Effectiveness
Board composition
The Board comprises the Executive Chairman, the Chief Executive 
Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and 2 Non-Executive Directors. 
The Directors’ profiles appear on pages 22 to 23 and detail their 
experience and suitability for leading and managing the Group. 
Together they bring a valuable range of expertise and experience to 
the Group. No individual or group of individuals dominate the Board’s 
decision-making process. The Executive Chairman fosters an 
atmosphere of debate and challenge in the boardroom, built on his 
challenging but supportive relationship with the Chief Executive 
Officer which sets the tone for Board interaction and discussions.
Diversity
Vacancies on the Board will be filled following a rigorous evaluation 
of candidates who possess the required balance of skills, knowledge 
and experience, using recruitment consultants where appropriate. 
The process for the appointment of Non-Executive Directors is 
managed by the Nomination Committee. The Group recognises  
the importance of diversity at Board level and the Board comprises 
individuals with a wide range of skills and experiences from a variety 
of business backgrounds. The current female representation on the 
Board is 20%.
Appointment of Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors are appointed to the Board following  
a formal, rigorous and transparent process, involving external 
recruitment agencies, to select individuals who have a depth and 
breadth of relevant experience, thus ensuring that the selected 
candidates will be capable of making an effective and relevant 
contribution to the Board. The process for the appointment of 
Non-Executive Directors is managed by the Nomination Committee.
Terms of appointment and time commitment
All Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial term of  
6 months after which the appointments are terminable by either  
the Group or the Non-Executive Director on 1 month’s notice. All 
Non-Executive Directors are expected to devote such time as is 
necessary for the proper performance of their duties. Directors are 
expected to attend all Board meetings and committee meetings of 
which they are members and any additional meetings as required.
Further details of their terms and conditions are summarised in  
the Remuneration Report on pages 29 to 33 and the terms and 
conditions of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are 
available at the Company’s Registered Office.
Induction and professional development
New Directors are given a formal induction process including  
details of how the Board and Committees operate, meetings with 
Senior Management and information on Group strategy, products 
and performance. Training and development needs of Directors are 
reviewed regularly. The Directors are kept appraised of developments 
in legal, regulatory and financial matters affecting the Group from 
the Company Secretary, the Chief Financial Officer and the Group’s 
external auditors and advisers.
Professional advice, indemnities and insurance
There is provision for Directors to take independent professional 
advice relating to the discharge of their responsibilities should they 
feel they need it. The Group has arranged Directors’ and Officers’ 
liability insurance against certain liabilities and defence costs. 
However, the Directors’ insurance does not provide protection  
in the event of a Director being found to have acted fraudulently  
or dishonestly.
Board and Committee evaluation
The performance evaluation of the Board, its Committees and 
Directors is undertaken by the Executive Chairman annually and 
implemented in collaboration with the Committee Chairmen. 
Election and re-election of Directors
At each Annual General Meeting the shareholders shall vote on 
resolutions to both elect any Director who has been appointed  
since the last Annual General Meeting and also to re-elect any 
Director who has not been appointed, elected or re-elected at  
one of the 2 previous Annual General Meetings. Accrol Group Holdings plc / Annual Report and Accounts 27
Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Steve Hammett, Peter 
Cheung and Joanne Lake. The Committee has Terms of Reference 
that are reviewed at least annually. 
The role of the Committee is to:
• Set the remuneration policy for all Executive Directors and the 
Chairman.
• Recommend and monitor the level and structure of senior 
management remuneration.
• Ensure that the remuneration payments made to any Director  
are consistent with the approved policy.
• Oversee incentives-based remuneration for Senior Management 
or employees.
In carrying out these duties the Committee shall ensure the 
appropriateness, relevance and market practice in respect of  
such remuneration policy. 
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises Peter Cheung, Joanne Lake 
and Steve Hammett and will meet as and when it is necessary to do 
so. The Committee has Terms of Reference that are reviewed at least 
annually. 
The Committee’s role is to:
• Ensure that appropriate procedures are in place for the nomination 
and selection of candidates for appointment to the Board 
considering the balance of skills, knowledge and experience  
of the Board.
• Make recommendations to the Board regarding re-election  
of Directors, succession planning and Board composition,  
having due regard for diversity, including gender.
• Consider succession planning for Senior Management and 
membership of the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
Audit Committee
The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and external audit 
partner attend a number of these meetings. The Audit Committee 
also meets with the external audit partner without the Executives 
present. The role of the Committee is to:
• Consider the appointment, fees, independence and effectiveness 
of the auditor and the audit process, and discuss the scope of the 
audit and its findings.
• Review audit and non-audit services and fees.
• Monitor the Group’s accounting policies.
• Review and challenge the Group’s assessment of business risks 
and internal controls to mitigate these risks.
• Review the annual and interim statements prior to their submission 
for approval by the Board.
• Review and challenge the going concern assumptions for the 
Group.
• Review the Group’s whistle-blowing policy.
• Annually assess the performance of the external auditor.
It is the task of the Audit Committee to ensure that auditor  
objectivity and independence is safeguarded when non-audit 
services are provided by the auditor. To ensure auditor objectivity  
and independence there is a process in place to approve any 
non-audit work.
The Audit Committee provides advice to the Board on whether  
the Annual Report is fair, balanced and provides the necessary 
information shareholders require to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy. In doing so, the following issues have 
been addressed:
• Review of key strategic risks – the Audit Committee conducts  
a review of the key strategic risks every 6 months. The review 
highlights the key risks based on a combination of likelihood and 
impact and then also considers what appropriate mitigation has 
been and should be implemented. The key risks are included in 
the Strategic Review.
• Review of judgements made by management, including the 
discount rate used in determining whether there has been an 
impairment of goodwill and any other key considerations such  
as the accounting for the IPO.
• Going Concern – the conclusion of the review of the going 
concern assessment is included below.
The Board is confident that the collective experience of the  
Audit Committee enables them to continue to act as an effective 
committee. The Audit Committee has access to the financial 
expertise of the Group and its auditors and can seek professional 
advice at the Group’s expense if required.
Risk management
The Group’s corporate objective is to maximise long-term 
shareholder value. In doing so, the Directors recognise that creating 
value is the reward for taking and accepting risk. The Directors 
consider risk management to be crucial to the Group’s success and 
give a high priority to ensuring that adequate systems are in place to 
evaluate and limit risk exposure.
Management reports to the Audit Committee regularly on their 
review of risks, how the risks are managed and monitored, and  
what actions have been assigned in relation to those risks. The Audit 
Committee reviews the inherent risks, including the key risks and  
the system of control necessary to manage such risks. The Audit 
Committee reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s procedures in 
managing risk. The business risks and controls to mitigate the risks 
are formally reviewed by the Audit Committee and the Board at least 
twice a year. The Board are satisfied that this process identifies, 
evaluates and manages the significant risks faced by the Group.
Internal control
The Board are responsible for the Group’s system of internal control 
and for reviewing its effectiveness, taking guidance from the Audit 
Committee. In the context of the Group’s business any such system 
can only reasonably be expected to manage rather than eliminate 
risks arising from its operations. It can therefore only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material loss  
or misstatement.
Key features of the internal control system are as follows:
• The Group has an organisational structure with clear 
responsibilities and lines of accountability. The Group promotes 
the values of integrity and professionalism. The members of  
the Board are available to hear, in confidence, any individual’s 
concerns about improprieties.
• The Board has a schedule of matters expressly reserved for its 
consideration. This schedule includes potential acquisitions,  
major capital projects, treasury, risk management policies, 
approval of budgets and health & safety.
• The Board monitors the activities of the Group through the 
management accounts, monthly forecasts and other reports  
on current activities and plans. The Senior Management Team 
regularly monitors financial and operational performance in detail. Accrol Group Holdings plc / Annual Report and Accounts 28
Corporate Governance Statement continued
• The Group has set appropriate levels of authorisation which must 
be adhered to as the Group concludes its business.
• The Group operates a whistle-blowing policy which is 
communicated to all employees via the Employee Handbook.
Going concern
In carrying out their duties in respect of going concern, the Directors 
have carried out a review of the Group’s financial position and cash 
flow forecasts for the forseeable future. These have been based on  
a comprehensive review of revenue, expenditure and cash flows, 
taking into account specific business risks and the current economic 
environment and financial covenants.
With regard to the Group’s financial position, it had cash and cash 
equivalents at the year end of £3.9m (2016: £2.5m). Net debt was 
£19.0m (2016: £60.6m).
Having taken the above into consideration, the Directors have 
reached the conclusion that the Group is well placed to manage its 
business risks in the current economic environment. Accordingly, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
Remuneration
The level of remuneration of the Directors is set out in the 
Remuneration Report on page 30.
Relations with shareholders
The Board appreciates that effective communication with the 
Group’s shareholders and the investment community as a whole  
is a key objective. The Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s 
Statement and the Strategic Report and Financial Review, together 
with the information in the Annual Report of the Group, provides a 
detailed review of the business. The views of both institutional and 
private shareholders are important, and these can be varied and 
wide-ranging, as is their interest in the Group’s strategy, reputation 
and performance. The Executive Directors have overall responsibility 
for ensuring effective communication and the Group maintains  
a regular dialogue with its shareholders, mainly in the periods 
following the announcement of the interim and final results, but  
also at other times during the year. The views of shareholders are 
sought through direct contact and via feedback from advisers and 
are communicated to the Board as a whole. The Board encourages 
the participation of shareholders at its Annual General Meeting, 
notice of which is sent to shareholders at least 14 working days 
before the meeting. The Group’s website ‘www.accrol.co.uk’ is 
regularly updated and provides additional information on the Group 
including information on the Group’s products and technology.
Annual General Meeting
This year’s Annual General Meeting includes a presentation by  
the Chief Executive on the current progress of the business and 
allows the opportunity for questions on this or any of the resolutions 
before the meeting. The Company proposes separate resolutions  
for each issue and specifically relating to the Reports and Financial 
Statements. The Company ensures all proxy votes are counted and 
indicates the level of proxies on each resolution along with the 
abstentions after it has been dealt with on a show of hands.
After the meeting, shareholders have the opportunity to talk 
informally to the Board and raise any further questions or issues they 
may have. The outcome of the Annual General Meeting, a copy of 
the Annual General Meeting presentation and details of the poll 
results will be posted on the Group’s website after the meeting.

Remuneration Committee
Steve Hammett
Chairman of the  
Remuneration Committee
The Directors acknowledge the importance of the 
principles set out in the Quoted Companies Alliance 
(QCA) Corporate Governance Code and we intend to 
apply this Code as far as we consider appropriate given 
the size of the Company. As part of this we have chosen 
to include information in this report which we believe  
is important to shareholders, notwithstanding that this 
goes beyond what we are required to disclose. 
Our Directors’ remuneration policy
In the current financial year, the remuneration policy  
has not altered from that described in our previous 
Annual Report when we undertook a forward-looking 
and thorough review of the underlying policy and 
remuneration structures of companies in the competitive 
marketplace in which we operate. We considered the 
approach necessary to attract and retain individuals with 
the relevant experience and skills to help drive future 
value creation and the achievement of our strategic 
goals and objectives.
Our overall goal is to have a remuneration strategy which 
stimulates sustainable value creation for the business and 
rewards the performance of management accordingly. 
I am pleased to introduce the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for Accrol Group 
Holdings plc for the year ended  
30 April 2017. This report includes  
my statement, the Annual Report on 
remuneration for the year and sets out 
our Directors’ remuneration policy which 
has been in place since the Group’s 
Admission onto AIM on 10 June 2016.
STATEMENT FROM THE 
CHAIRMAN OF THE 
REMUNERATION 
COMMITTEE Accrol Group Holdings plc / Annual Report and Accounts 30
Remuneration Committee continued
The policy is set out in the following pages, with a summary of key 
principles provided below:
• Fixed levels of remuneration will be set at an appropriate level  
for each individual and in doing so the Remuneration Committee 
will take into account the levels of fixed remuneration for similar 
positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills. This will 
ensure we can attract and retain the individuals needed to grow 
the Company.
• Recognising our growth aspirations and the need to deliver 
ongoing superior returns for shareholders, the Executive  
Directors are eligible to participate in market competitive  
incentive arrangements. They will have the opportunity to  
receive appropriate levels of remuneration based on achievement 
of quantitative and qualitative objectives and measures as relevant  
for their role.
Business context and Remuneration Committee decisions 
on remuneration
The following factors have been identified as key areas of focus  
for improving the Group’s performance going forward:
• organic growth through Discounters;
• increasing market share through multiples; and
• operational improvements and capacity utilisation.
In addition to these key areas, the Board will also consider 
complementary acquisitions.
It is intended that our remuneration policy reflects, and is aligned  
to, the Company’s long-term strategy and facilitates the achievement 
of the objectives set out above. 
During the previous financial year, the Board considered and 
approved the implementation of an annual bonus plan and 
management incentive plan to incentivise key management  
to generate growth in line with our long-term strategies. There  
have been no revisions to these plans in the current financial year. 
Further details on these are set out in the remuneration policy 
section of this report.
The remainder of this report is split out into the following 2 sections:
• Annual Report on remuneration providing details of the payments 
made to Directors in the year ending 30 April 2017, pages 30 to 31.
• Directors’ remuneration policy setting out the Company’s 
remuneration policy, pages 31 to 33.

Annual remuneration report for 2017
Remuneration Committee
On Admission, the Company established a Remuneration Committee comprising of the following members: 
– Steve Hammett
– Peter Cheung
– Joanne Lake 
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for setting the remuneration policy for all Executive Directors and the Chairman of the Board, 
including pension rights and any compensation payments. This includes reviewing the performance of the Executive Directors and determining 
their terms and conditions of service, their remuneration and the grant of any options, having due regard to the interests of shareholders. Where 
the Executive Chairman’s remuneration is reviewed, he will not be present for these considerations.
In setting the remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee takes into account the objective to attract, retain and motivate executive 
management of the quality required to run the Company successfully without paying more than is necessary. The remuneration policy also 
has regard to the risk appetite of the Company and alignment to the Company’s long-term strategic goals. 
The Remuneration Committee also recognises that a significant proportion of remuneration should be structured so as to link rewards to 
corporate and individual performance, and designed to promote the long-term success of the Company. 
The Remuneration Committee meets at least once a year and otherwise as required. In the current financial year, the Remuneration Committee 
has met nil times as the Committee met twice just prior to the commencement of this financial year and in preparation for the IPO.

Remuneration policy
The remuneration policy has been applied from the time of Admission. The Remuneration Committee will periodically review the policy  
to confirm the remuneration framework continues to align with the strategy and objectives of the business.
In developing the policy, the Remuneration Committee has taken into account the best interests of the business and the agreed terms  
and conditions of employment for each Director of the Company. The overall remuneration philosophy aims to:
• recognise the importance of ensuring that employees of the Group are effectively and appropriately incentivised;
• operate a remuneration policy that is a mix of fixed and variable pay. Variable pay is both short term and long term;
• align Directors’ interests with those of the Company; 
• have a pay for performance approach; and
• provide a market competitive level of remuneration to enable the Company to attract and retain high-performing individuals, to support 
the ongoing success of the Company. 
As part of this an annual bonus plan has been introduced which took effect from the start of this financial year. The Company has also 
adopted a Management Incentive Plan (“MIP”), to align the interests of Senior Management with those of the shareholders. There are no 
other employee share plans currently in place, however, the Company may, in the future, look to introduce an employee share plan for the 
broader employee base. 
Remuneration policy summary – Executive Directors 
Purpose and link to strategy Operation
Base salary 
To reflect market value of the role and individual’s performance 
and contribution and enable the Group to recruit and retain 
Directors of sufficient calibre required to support achievement  
of both short- and long-term value creation.
The salary of each Executive Director will be reviewed annually by 
the Remuneration Committee without any obligation to increase 
such salary.
Base salaries are benchmarked against the AIM companies of a 
comparable size with a targeted approach of median positioning 
against the market, subject to satisfactory performance.
There may be reviews and changes to base salary during the year  
if considered appropriate by the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee will take account of relevant 
comparator group data as well as pay increases awarded to  
other groups of employees within the Company.
Benefits
To attract and retain the right individuals and level of talent  
required to support achievement of both short- and long-term 
value creation.
Benefits include but may not be limited to private medical 
insurance, cash car allowance and life assurance cover. 
Other benefits may be provided to the Directors if considered 
appropriate by the Committee. Accrol Group Holdings plc / Annual Report and Accounts 32
Remuneration Committee continued
Purpose and link to strategy Operation
Pension 
To attract and retain the right individuals and level of talent  
required to support achievement of both short- and long-term 
value creation.
An annual pension allowance equivalent to 12.5% of base salary 
which is paid either into a pension scheme operated by the 
Company or a personal pension held by the individual, with the 
balance paid as an additional cash payment through payroll.
Consideration of the new rules applying to pensions, taking into 
account the individual lifetime and annual allowances, are made 
when determining the most appropriate mix of pension and cash 
contributions for each individual on an annual basis.
Annual Bonus Plan 
To incentivise delivery of the Group’s annual financial and  
strategic goals.
The annual bonus payment will depend on the level of 
performance delivered against specific targets, with a threshold 
level being set below which no bonus will be paid. The 
performance range is outlined below:
• Threshold performance – achieving 90% of the relevant target – 
payout of 25% of the relevant part of the award.
• Budget performance – achieving 100% of the relevant target –  
pay out of 60% of the relevant part of the award.
• Maximum performance – achieving 110% of the relevant target 
– payout of 100% of the relevant part of the award.
In measuring performance, the following performance measures 
will be used:
• Profit before tax – 80% of award.
• Cash generation – 20% of the award.
The maximum bonus available is 100% of base salary per annum. 
This would only be paid out if the maximum targets are met.
The Remuneration Committee will review the bonus plan each 
year and may amend the terms of the plan to ensure it remains fit 
for purpose.
Management Incentive Plan (“MIP”)
To incentivise the delivery of key performance measures over  
the long term.
To retain key executives and ultimately increase their share 
ownership in the Company, thus aligning their interests with  
those of shareholders.
The MIP is a one-off award in connection with the Admission; 
there is no intention to make ongoing annual awards.
The MIP involves the use of shares (“MIP Shares”) which entitles  
the holders to a proportion of the value of the business above a 
pre-determined hurdle level. The hurdle has been set at a premium 
of 30% to the share price of the Company on Admission.
The MIP has a 3-year vesting period after which a participant can 
choose to sell their MIP Shares to the Company (or the Company 
could choose to call for their MIP Shares). 
MIP participants will also be able to sell their MIP Shares prior to 
the end of the vesting period should the Company be acquired  
by a third party.
The Company may, at its discretion, purchase the MIP Shares for 
cash or by way of the issue of Ordinary shares in the Company  
as consideration. The number of Company shares that can  
be acquired in exchange for the vested growth shares will be 
calculated based on the value of the growth shares held by an 
individual at the time of the exchange and the share price of the 
Company on that date.
Footnotes to the remuneration policy 
• Ancillary benefits include private medical insurance expenses, life assurance cover (at 4 times basic salary), provision of a £10,000 per annum car allowance  
(Steve Crossley only) and the reimbursement of all reasonable and authorised expenses (including, for Peter Cheung only, the reimbursement of reasonable  
travel expenses to and from the Company’s offices in Blackburn). Accrol Group Holdings plc / Annual Report and Accounts 33
Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report 
Termination of employment 
Each Executive Director has a service agreement which may be terminated by either party serving 12 months written notice. However, 
payment of remuneration during the notice period will be made monthly and terminated at the discretion of the Company should the 
individual take-up alternative employment.
Annual bonus plan
Payment of the bonus is conditional upon notice to terminate the employment not having been served by either party for any reason on  
or prior to the relevant bonus payment date.
MIP 
During the vesting period, if a participant ceases to be a Director or employee of a member of the Group other than in certain ‘Good Leaver’ 
circumstances, participants can be required to transfer their MIP shares at the lower of fair value and the cost value of the MIP shares (subject 
to a minimum amount of £2,000). 
A Good Leaver is someone who ceases employment as a result of death, ill health, injury or disability evidenced to the satisfaction of the 
Board with Remuneration Committee consent; retirement at the normal retirement age in accordance with the Group’s internal policies; or 
any other reason the Board (acting with Remuneration Committee consent) permits. 
If the participant’s employment is deemed to have ceased in any of these ‘Good Leaver’ circumstances, they will be permitted to retain  
their MIP Shares until the expiry of the normal vesting period. They will then be able to transfer their MIP shares to the Company at their  
fair value, pro-rated by reference to the period of employment as a proportion of the vesting period. The Company will have flexibility to 
buy back the relevant proportion of MIP Shares that have not vested, at cost (subject to a minimum amount of £2,000), at the end of the 
vesting period or at an earlier date.

On 10 June 2016, Accrol Group Holdings plc was admitted to the 
AIM market of the London Stock Exchange.

Directors against any liability that attaches to them in defending 
proceedings brought against them, to the extent permitted by English 
law. This third party indemnity was in place during the financial  
year and also at the date of approval of the financial statements. In 
addition, Directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries 
are covered by Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance.

In respect of the year ended 30 April 2017, the Directors have 
approved and paid an interim dividend of 2p per share (2016: £nil). 
The Directors intend to approve a final dividend of 4p per share 
which is subject to approval at the Annual General meeting on  
22 September 2017.
Financial instruments
Details of the Group’s financial risk management objectives and 
policies are disclosed in Note 18 to the financial statements. 
Admission to AIM
On Admission, the net proceeds of the Placing receivable by the 
Company were £41.4m being the gross proceeds of £43.3m less 
estimated fees and expenses related to the Placing of £1.9m. 
The Directors believe that this has:
• strengthened the Company’s capital structure and positioned  
it for the continued implementation of its growth strategy;
• given the Company access to a wider range of capital-raising 
options which may be of use in the future; and
• further improved the ability of the Company to recruit, retain  
and incentivise its key management and staff.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Company is in a 
strong financial position to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future.

Company can be found in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 21

Employee involvement and policy regarding disabled 
persons 
The Company operates an equal opportunities policy that aims  
to treat individuals fairly and not to discriminate on the basis of sex, 
race, ethnic origin, disability or on any other basis. The Company’s 
policy and procedures are designed to provide for full and fair 
consideration and selection of disabled applicants, to ensure  
they are properly trained to perform safely and effectively and to 
provide career opportunities that allow them to fulfil their potential. 
Where a member of staff becomes disabled in the course of their 
employment the Company will actively seek to retain them wherever 
possible by making adjustments to their work content and 
environment or by retraining them to undertake new roles. 
The Group provides staff with information on the Group’s 
performance and on matters concerning them on a regular  
basis. Considerable value is placed on the involvement of its staff; 
regular, open, fair and respectful communication; zero tolerance  
for human rights violations; fair remuneration and, above all, a safe 
working environment.
In the current year we have improved and formalised our 
communications to all employees. These communications ensure 
that all have an awareness of the major economic and financial 
factors that impact upon the performance of the business. We are 
currently undertaking our first employee engagement survey which 
will help shape our future strategy with regards to employee 
involvement.
Share capital
The details of the issued share capital at the beginning of the 
financial year can be found in Note 20 to the consolidated financial

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in Respect of the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulation.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and Company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure 
Framework”, and applicable law). Under company law the directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and Company 
for that period. In preparing the financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
have been followed for the Group financial statements and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101, have been 
followed for the Company financial statements, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Company 
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy  
at any time the financial position of the Group and Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of  
the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps  
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group and 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the 
Directors’ Report confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the Company financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 
101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law), give  
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Company;
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, give  
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Group; and
• the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the Group 
and Company, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that it faces. 
In the case of each Director in office at the date the Directors’ Report 
is approved:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Group and Company’s auditors are 
unaware; and
• they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a 
Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group and Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of Accrol Group Holdings plc  
(formerly Accrol Group Holdings Limited)
For year ended 30 April 2017
Report on the group financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, Accrol Group Holdings plc’s group financial 
statements (the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 30 
April 2017 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European 
Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report and 
Accounts (the “Annual Report”), comprise:
• the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 30 April 
2017;
• the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended;
• the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the year then ended;
• the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then 
ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, and applicable law.
In applying the financial reporting framework, the directors have 
made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they 
have made assumptions and considered future events.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the 
audit:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared 
in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the group 
and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we are 
required to report if we have identified any material misstatements in 
the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report. We have nothing to 
report in this respect.
Other matters on which we are required to report 
by exception
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion, we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to 
report arising from this responsibility. 
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from 
this responsibility. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We 
do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is 
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An 
audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by 
the directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial 
statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit 
evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in 
the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With 
respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we consider 
whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable 
legal requirements.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Information
For the year ended 30 April 2017
1. General information 
Accrol Group Holdings plc (formerly Accrol Group Holdings Limited), 
(the “Company”) was incorporated in England 30 April 2014 with 
company number 09019496. It is a public company limited by shares 
and it is domiciled in England in the United Kingdom. The registered 
address of the Company is the Delta Building, Roman Road, 
Blackburn, Lancashire, BB1 2LD. 
The Company’s subsidiaries are listed in Note 22, which together 
with the Company form the Accrol Group Holdings plc Group 
(the “Group”).
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
A summary of the significant accounting policies is set out below. 
These have been applied consistently in the financial statements.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted for use in the EU, IFRS Interpretation 
Committee (‘IFR IC’) interpretations and with those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on  
a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as 
modified by financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) 
at fair value through profit or loss. The consolidated financial 
statements are presented in pounds Sterling and all values are 
rounded to the nearest thousand pounds, except where 
otherwise indicated.
Standards issued not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of this financial information, the  
following new standards and interpretations which have not  
been applied in this financial information were in issue but not yet 
effective (and in some cases, had not yet been adopted by the EU):
• IAS 16 and IAS 38 amendments – Clarification of Acceptable 
Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation (effective 1 January 
2016)
• IFRS 11 amendments – Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests  
in Joint Operations (effective 1 January 2016)
• IAS 16 and IAS 41 amendments – Agriculture: Bearer Plants 
(effective 1 January 2016)
• IAS 27 amendments – Equity Method in Separate Financial 
Statements (effective 1 January 2016)
• IFRS 10 and IAS 28 amendments – Sale or Contribution of Assets 
between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (effective  
1 January 2016)
• IAS 1 amendments – Disclosure Initiative (effective 1 January 2016)
• Annual Improvements 2012-2014 Cycle (effective 1 January 2016)
• IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective  
1 January 2018)
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2018)
The adoption of these standards and interpretations is not expected 
to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements  
of the Group in the year of initial application when the relevant 
standards come into effect.
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ is a new standard that has been published and is 
effective from 1 January 2019 but has not been early adopted by  
the Group and could have a material impact on the Group financial 
information. At the time of preparing this financial information, the 
Group continues to assess the possible impact of the adoption of 
this standard in future years.
Going concern
The Directors have made appropriate enquiries and formed a 
judgement at the time of approving the financial information that 
there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial information.
Consolidation
Subsidiaries
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, either directly or indirectly, by  
the Company. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or 
has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee 
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the 
investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if  
the Group has:
• power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current 
ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee);
• exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with 
the investee; and
• the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
When the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar 
rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and 
circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, 
including:
• the contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the 
investee;
• rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and
• the Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights.
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts 
and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of 
the 3 elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when 
the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the 
Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are 
included in the statement of comprehensive income from the date 
the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control 
the subsidiary. 
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
information of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into  
line with the Group’s accounting policies. All intra-group assets  
and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to 
transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full 
on consolidation.
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities)  
over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more 
than one half of the voting rights. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated 
from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are 
de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report 
Accrol Group Holdings plc / Annual Report and Accounts 43
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the 
acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition  
is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments 
issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their  
fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any 
minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair 
value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is 
recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair 
value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is 
recognised directly in the income statement.
Segments
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the 
internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. 
The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating 
resources and assessing performance of the operating segment,  
has been identified as the Board of Directors. The Group’s activities 
consist solely of the conversion of paper products, primarily within 
the United Kingdom. It is managed as one entity and management 
have consequently determined that there is only one 
operating segment.
Segment results are measured using adjusted earnings before 
interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, gain/(loss) on derivative 
financial instruments and exceptional items. Segment assets are 
measured at cost less any recognised impairment. Revenue is 
attributed to geographical regions based on the country of residence 
of the customer. All revenue arises in and all non-current assets are 
located in the United Kingdom. The accounting policies used for 
segment reporting reflects those used for the Group.
Revenue
Revenue representing sales to external customers, which is stated 
excluding Value Added Tax and trade discounts, is measured at the 
fair value of the consideration receivable for goods supplied.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised at the point of 
dispatch of goods from the warehouse as this reflects the transfer  
of risks and rewards of ownership. 
Revenue is presented net of trade spend, including customer 
rebates, which consists primarily of customer pricing allowances, 
listing fees and promotional allowances (overriders) which are 
governed by agreements with our trade customers. Accruals are 
recognised under the terms of these agreements, to reflect the 
expected promotional activity and our historical experience.  
These accruals are reported within trade and other payables.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales comprise costs arising in connection with the 
conversion of paper products. Cost is based on the cost of a 
purchase on a first in, first out, basis and includes all direct costs  
and an appropriate portion of fixed and variable overheads where 
they are directly attributable to bringing the inventories into their 
present location and condition.
Exceptional items
Items that are material in size or unusual or infrequent in nature  
are included within operating profit and disclosed separately as 
exceptional items in the consolidated income statement.
The separate reporting of exceptional items, which are presented as 
exceptional within the relevant category in the consolidated income 
statement, helps provide an indication of the Group’s underlying 
business performance.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
Earnings before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation and Amortisation 
(EBITDA) and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures used by 
management to assess the operating performance of the Group. 
EBITDA is defined as profit before finance costs, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation. Depreciation is the write-down of fixed assets  
and amortisation of the write-down of customer relationships held  
in intangibles. Exceptional items and gains/(losses) on derivative 
financial instruments are excluded from EBITDA to calculate 
Adjusted EBITDA.
The Directors primarily use the Adjusted EBITDA measure when 
making decisions about the Group’s activities. As these are 
non-GAAP measures, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measures  
used by other entities may not be calculated in the same way  
and hence are not directly comparable.
Foreign currency 
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial information are measured using  
the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
Group operates (‘the functional currency’). The financial information  
is presented in Sterling, which is the functional currency of all 
companies in the Group.
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the 
functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate ruling at the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate 
of exchange ruling at the statement of financial position date. All 
differences are taken to the income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in 
a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the 
dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair 
value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at 
the date when the fair value was determined.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are included at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. Depreciation is 
calculated to write-down the cost of the assets on a straight-line  
or reducing balance basis over the estimated useful lives on the 
following bases:
• Leasehold land and Buildings   straight line over term  
of lease
• Plant and Machinery   10% straight line, 
40% residual value
• Motor vehicles  30% straight line
• Fixtures, fittings and office  25% reducing balance 
equipment
Assets under construction are not depreciated, but transferred  
into the appropriate asset class when they are ready for use. The 
estimated useful lives are reviewed at the end of each reporting 
period and adjusted if appropriate. The carrying values of tangible 
fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Accrol Group Holdings plc / Annual Report and Accounts 44

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition  
over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable  
assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill 
on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in ‘intangible assets’. 
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are 
not reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include 
the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Customer relationships, customer order books and other 
Customer relationships are shown at fair value as part of acquisition 
accounting. Customer relationships have finite useful lives and are 
carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is 
calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of 
customer relationships over their estimated useful lives of 10 years.
Customer order books relate to orders for goods awaiting dispatch  
at the date of acquisition on 14 July 2014. Amortisation is calculated 
using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of customer  
order books over their estimated useful lives up to 1 year.
The other intangible asset relates to a Management Services 
Agreement between Accrol Papers Limited and Accrol Group 
Holdings Plc (formerly Accrol Group Holdings Limited). This 
agreement has an infinite life and therefore is not amortised.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and when circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Assets that  
are subject to depreciation and amortisation are reviewed for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment 
loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying 
amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is 
the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. 
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent 
from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of 
the cash-generating unit (“CGU”) to which the asset belongs. All 
tangibles and intangibles are allocated to the Group’s sole CGU 
(see Note 11). 
Any impairment charge is recognised in the income statement in  
the period in which it occurs. Impairment losses relating to goodwill 
cannot be reversed in future periods. Where an impairment loss on 
other assets, subsequently reverses due to a change in the original 
estimate, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount.
Financial instruments
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets as loans and receivables. 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed  
or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 
12 months after the end of the reporting date, which are classified  
as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise 
‘trade and other receivables’ and cash and cash equivalents in the 
balance sheet. Subsequent to initial recognition, these assets are 
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Income from these financial assets is calculated on an effective  
yield basis and is recognised in the income statement.
Financial liabilities
The Group initially recognises its financial liabilities at fair value net  
of transaction costs where applicable and subsequently they are 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Transaction costs are amortised using the effective interest rate 
method over the maturity of the loan.
Derivative financial instruments and cash flow hedges
The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its  
foreign currency exposures. These derivatives, classified as cash 
flow hedges, are initially recognised at fair value and then re-
measured at fair value at the end of each reporting date. Hedging 
instruments are documented at inception and effectiveness is  
tested throughout their duration. Changes in the value of cash flow 
hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income and any 
ineffective portion is immediately recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income. Amounts deferred in other comprehensive 
income are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 
in the same period in which the hedged items affect profit.
All derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair  
value on the contract date and are also measured at fair value at 
subsequent reporting dates. 
Share-based payments
The Group may issue equity-settled share-based payments in the 
Parent Company to certain employees in exchange for services 
rendered. These awards are measured at fair value on the date of the 
grant using an option pricing model and expensed in the statement 
of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period after making an allowance for the number of shares that it  
is estimated will not vest. The level of vesting is reviewed and 
adjusted annually.
Leases
Finance leases
Assets funded through finance leases are capitalised as property, 
plant and equipment, and are depreciated over their estimated useful 
lives or the lease term, whichever is shorter. The amount capitalised 
is the lower of the fair value of the asset or the present value of the 
minimum lease payments during the lease term at the inception of 
the lease. The resulting lease obligations are included in liabilities  
net of finance charges. Finance costs on finance leases are charged 
directly in the income statement on an effective interest rate basis.
Material lease arrangements do not include any contingent rental 
conditions, options to purchase or escalation clauses. There are no 
restrictions imposed by these lease arrangements.
Operating leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives 
received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Government grants
Government grants relating to tangible fixed assets are treated as 
deferred income and released to the income statement over the 
expected useful lives of the assets concerned. Other grants are 
credited to the profit and loss account as the related expenditure 
is incurred. Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report 
Accrol Group Holdings plc / Annual Report and Accounts 45
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable  
value. Cost is based on the purchase on a first in, first out, basis  
and includes all direct costs and an appropriate portion of fixed  
and variable overheads. Net realisable value is the estimated selling 
price reduced by all costs of completion, marketing, selling and 
distribution. Supplier rebates are credited to the carrying value of 
inventory to which they relate. Once the inventory is sold, the rebate 
amount is then recognised in the income statement.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables relate mainly to the sale of paper 
products to trade customers.
Cash and cash equivalents (excluding bank overdraft)
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash  
at bank, short-term deposits held at call with banks and other 
short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of 
3 months or less, excluding any bank overdrafts which are  
disclosed separately within borrowings within current liabilities.
Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that  
have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from 
suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if 
payment is due within 1 year or less. If not, they are presented  
as non-current liabilities.
Current taxation
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are 
measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to 
the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute 
the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
Income tax relating to items recognised in comprehensive income  
or directly in equity is recognised in comprehensive income or equity 
and not in the income statement.
Deferred taxation
Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on all 
temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial 
reporting purposes, with the following exceptions:
• where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 
of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination that at the time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
• in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the 
temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; 
and
• deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that  
it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or 
tax losses can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed  
at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to  
allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected 
manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets 
and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured 
at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the 
asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past event; it is probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and 
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures 
expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due 
to the passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
3. Significant accounting judgements, estimates 
and assumptions
The preparation of the financial information in accordance with IFRS 
requires estimates and assumptions to be made that affect the value 
at which certain assets and liabilities are held at the balance sheet 
date and also the amounts of revenue and expenditure recorded in 
the year. The Directors believe the accounting policies chosen are 
appropriate to the circumstances and that the estimates, judgements 
and assumptions involved in its financial reporting are reasonable. 
Accounting estimates made by the Group’s management are based 
on information available to management at the time each estimate  
is made. Accordingly, actual outcomes may differ materially from 
current expectations under different assumptions and conditions. 
The estimates and assumptions for which there is a significant risk  
of a material adjustment to the financial information within the next 
financial year are set out below.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying  
the entity’s accounting policies
Goodwill and intangible asset impairment
The Group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether goodwill 
has suffered any impairment based on the recoverable amount of  
its sole CGU. The recoverable amount is determined based on value 
in use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation  
of future cash flows and the determination of a pre-tax discount  
rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows. More 
information including carrying values is included in Note 11.
Customer rebates
The Group provides for amounts payable to customers in relation  
to rebates and promotional activity. Whilst the Directors do not 
consider the Group’s rebates to be highly complex as they are 
predominantly volume related, there is judgement required in 
calculating amounts due, as terms vary by customer. 
Accounting for IPO
The successful completion of the IPO has resulted in a significant 
change in the Group’s financing structure, both in terms of equity  
and debt and has had a significant impact upon the Group financial 
statements. Accounting for the IPO and, in particular, for the 
transaction fees incurred requires an element of judgement as costs 
determined to be directly related to the IPO are deducted from  
the share premium account. Non directly related are expensed  
as incurred. Accrol Group Holdings plc / Annual Report and Accounts 46

Year ended 30 April 2017
Professional fees of £208,000 incurred as part of the IPO process have been classified as exceptional as they do not directly relate to the 
raising of the equity for the AIM flotation so cannot be charged against share premium. In addition, part of the funds raised in the IPO were 
used to reduce the debt in the business with the majority of the finance leases being repaid which attracted an early redemption charge of 
£454,000. 
Fees totalling £352,000 relating to the acquisition of the Accrol Group in July 2014 by Accrol Group Holdings Limited, were also required to 
be written-off as part of the accounting for the IPO. 
Consultancy costs totalling £567,000 were incurred as part of the restructuring. These related mainly to the Hussain family consultancy, 
manufacturing consultancy and human resourcing consultancy.
Year ended 30 April 2016
One-off consultancy fees totalling £334,000 were incurred in relation to a market, competitor, customer and working capital review to 
support the growth strategy following the acquisition in July 2014.
In September 2015, there was a fire within the embossing unit of one of the converting lines. The line was back up and running within one 
week with no disruption to customer orders. The cost of repair was £159,000. Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report

Note 1: In the year ended 30 April 2016 and 2017, the basic weighted average number of shares was calculated by excluding the D class of shares (see Note 20) as this class 
is subject to a dividend cap that does not materially impact upon the profit due to the remaining Ordinary equity shareholders.
The share option scheme in operation post flotation is dependent upon share price movements and could therefore result in future dilution

The deferred tax asset was recognised on the loss on cash flow hedges and the credit has been taken to the hedging reserve.
Deferred tax expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date is approximately £58,000 (2016: £186,000).
The Finance Act 2016 reduced the main rate of corporation tax to 20% from 1 April 2016 and to 19% from 1 April 2017. A future rate reduction 
to 18% from 1 April 2020, was substantively enacted on 26 October 2015. A further change to reduce the rate from 1 April 2020 from 18% to 
17% was announced on 16 March 2016. This change was substantively enacted as part of the Finance Bill 2016 on 15 September 2016. 
Therefore, the rate of 20% (2016: 20%) has been reflected in the consolidated financial statements and deferred tax assets and liabilities have 
been measured at the rate expected to be in effect when the deferred tax asset or liability reverses. Deferred tax has been provided at the 
rate of 18% as at 30 April 2017 (2016: 18%)

The balance for goodwill, customer relationships and order book arose on the Group’s acquisition of Accrol Holdings Limited and are 
attributed to the sole cash-generating unit (CGU).
The intangible addition during the year, relates to a Management Services Agreement between Accrol Papers Limited and Accrol Group 
Holdings Plc which provides a mechanism for a recharge of salary costs between the 2 entities.
Impairment test for goodwill
Goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes at the Group’s sole CGU level. The recoverable amount of the CGU has been 
determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the Board covering  
a 5-year period. Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated in the key assumptions.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are a pre-tax discount rate of 13% (2016: 16%) and a long-term growth rate of 2% 
(2016: 2%). The discount rate is derived from the Group’s weighted average cost of capital and is calculated with reference to latest market 
assumptions for the risk free rate, equity market risk premium and the cost of debt. The values reflect both past experience and external 
sources of information.
Goodwill is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstance indicate that the 
carrying value may be impaired. In the years under review management’s value in use calculations have indicated no requirement to impair.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The estimates of the recoverable amounts associated with these CGU affords significant headroom over the carrying value, consequently 
only significant adverse changes in these key assumptions would cause the Group to recognise an impairment loss.

Trade and other receivables which are less than 3 months past due are not considered impaired unless specific information indicates 
otherwise. Trade and other receivables greater than 3 months past due are considered for recoverability, and where appropriate, a provision 
against bad debt is recognised. There are no trade receivables’ amounts more than 6 months past due.
Included in the Group’s trade receivables balance are debtors which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided 
as there has not been a significant change in the credit quality and the amounts are considered recoverable.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables is approximately equal to their fair value.

The Group’s bank borrowings are secured by way of fixed and floating charge over the Group’s assets.
HSBC Revolving Credit Facility agreement (‘Bank facility’)
At 30 April 2016, the Group had borrowings under a committed bank loan facility of £4m provided by HSBC plc, a factoring facility of £20m 
and finance leases of £8m. Subsequent to the year end, on 13 June 2016, the bank loan facility and the finance leases have been repaid from 
a new Revolving Credit Facility (‘RCF’). The RCF is a 5 year £18m facility with a day 1 drawdown of £13m. The RCF reduces to £10m subject to 
the following profile
30 April 2017: £16m
30 April 2018: £14m
30 April 2019: £12m
30 April 2020: £10m
The minimum drawing is: £500,000 with the maximum number of outstanding drawings at any one time being 10. Interest is charged on 
the RCF at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.0% subject to the below ratchet:
≥2.0x Net Debt: EBITDA = 2.25 basis points 
≥1.5x Net Debt: EBITDA = 2.00 basis points
≥1.0x Net Debt: EBITDA = 1.75 basis points
<1.0x Net Debt: EBITDA = 1.50 basis points Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report 
Accrol Group Holdings plc / Annual Report and Accounts 53
An arrangement fee of 1.5% of the RCF is payable at inception. An annual commitment fee of 40% of applicable margin on any undrawn  
RCF commitment is also payable. There is no commitment fee or ticking fee arising between signing and Admission. The facility is subject  
to financial covenants and each of Accrol Group Holdings plc (formerly Accrol Group Holdings Limited), Accrol UK Limited, Accrol Holdings 
Limited and Accrol Papers Limited will enter into a guarantee and the security each have previously granted in favour of HSBC shall remain in 
respect of all liabilities arising under the RCF agreement.
HSBC £20m factoring credit facility (‘Factoring facility’) 
On 8 August 2014 the Group entered into a £20.0m multi-currency revolving credit facility to provide factoring financing for general  
working capital requirements for a minimum period of 3 years. Under the terms of this facility the drawdown is based upon gross debtors 
less a retention with 90% of the remaining debt funded. Each drawing under the facility is repayable within a maximum of 90 days from date 
of invoice for jurisdictions within the United Kingdom and 120 days for other countries. 
Covenants
The Group is subject to financial covenants in relation to the Bank facility and the Factoring facility. The covenants in relation to the Bank 
facility cover the following ratios: a) interest cover; and b) leverage. The covenants in relation to the Factoring facility cover the following: a) 
debt dilution; b) disputed debt; and c) tangible net worth. The Group has been in compliance with all of the covenants during the year under 
review. Breach of the covenants would render any outstanding borrowings subject to immediate settlement.
Finance fees
Finance fees are not included in the Loan Maturity Analysis table. As at 30 April 2017, finance fees relating to the arrangement of the 
Revolving Credit Facility have been capitalised and are being amortised. As at the 30 April 2016, the finance fees were incurred upon the 
arrangement of the shareholder loans by the Group’s lenders.

Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments represent the Group’s forward foreign exchange contracts. The assets and liabilities representing the 
valuations of the forward foreign exchange contracts at the year end are:

2016
£’000
Current assets 841 –
Current liabilities (3,235) (190)
Non-current liabilities (474) –
(2,868) (190)
The fair value of a derivative financial instrument is split between current and non-current depending on the remaining maturity of the 
derivative contract and its contractual cash flows. The foreign currency swaps are designated as fair value through profit or loss at initial 
recognition. The fair value of the Group’s foreign currency derivatives is calculated as the difference between the contract rates and the  
mark to market rates which are current at the balance sheet date. This valuation is obtained from the counterparty bank and at each year  
end is categorised as a Level 2 valuation, see below. The maximum exposure to credit risk is the fair value of the derivative as a financial asset.
Fair value hierarchy
IFRS 7 requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in the 
value measurements:
Level 1: inputs are quoted prices in active markets.
Level 2: a valuation that uses observable inputs for the asset or liability other than quoted prices in active markets.
Level 3: a valuation using unobservable inputs i.e. a valuation technique.
There were no transfers between levels throughout the years under review. Accrol Group Holdings plc / Annual Report and Accounts 54

18. Capital and financial risk management objectives and policies
(a) Capital risk management
The Group’s objective when managing capital is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns 
for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order to 
maintain or adjust capital the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new 
shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors net debt. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash 
equivalents.

(b) Financial risk management
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
• Foreign currency risk
• Interest rate risk 
• Liquidity risk
• Credit risk 
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, and the Group’s objectives, policies and procedures 
for measuring and managing risk. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk 
management framework. Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report 
Accrol Group Holdings plc / Annual Report and Accounts 55
(i) Foreign currency risk
The Group has transactional currency exposures arising from purchases in currencies other than the Group’s functional currency. These 
exposures are forecast on a monthly basis and are monitored by the Finance Department. Under the Group’s foreign currency policy, such 
exposures are hedged on a reducing percentage basis over a number of forecast time horizons using forward foreign currency contracts.
The Group’s largest exposures are the US dollar and Euro forward contracts. The derivative analysis below had been prepared by 
reperforming the calculations used to determine the balance sheet values assuming a 1% strengthening of Sterling:

Euro – (loss) (79) –
USD – (loss)/gain (844) 135
(923) 135
(ii) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest 
rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s Factoring facility and Bank facility, 
both of which have floating interest rates.
The Group manages its interest rate risk by holding the majority of borrowings in fixed rate secured loan notes. The exposure to the 
remaining risk is deemed to be manageable and is reviewed on a continual basis. The Group are not expecting any reduction in interest rates 
over the next 12 months, the impact of 0.5% increase in interest rates on profit before tax is shown below:

Change in interest rate 94 56
(iii) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk 
management rests with the Board of Directors. The Group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, 
matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and operational liabilities and by maintaining adequate cash reserves.

(iv) Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and investments. The Group’s credit risk is low. 
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings 
assigned by international credit-rating agencies. Accrol Group Holdings plc / Annual Report and Accounts 56

The weighted average fair value of options granted during the period determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton model valuation was

The volatility is based on statistical analysis of the volatility of comparable companies over a 5-year period as the historical data is not 
available due to Accrol Group Holdings plc’s recent listing on AIM.
See Note 7 for the total expense recognised in the income statement for share options granted to Directors and employees.

Report on the company financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, Accrol Group Holdings plc’s company financial 
statements (the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 
30 April 2017 and of its cash flows for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
• The financial statements, included within the Annual Report and 
Accounts (the “Annual Report”), comprise:
• the Company Statement of Financial Position as at 30 April 2017;
• the Company Cash Flow Statement for the year then ended;
• the Company Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then 
ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, and applicable law, and as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
In applying the financial reporting framework, the directors have 
made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they 
have made assumptions and considered future events.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the 
audit:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared 
in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the 
company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we are required to report if we have identified any material 
misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report. We 
have nothing to report in this respect.
Other matters on which we are required to report 
by exception
Adequacy of accounting records and information and 
explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, 
or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from 
this responsibility.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We 
do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is 
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An 
audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by 
the directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial 
statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit 
evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in 
the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With 
respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we consider 
whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable 
legal requirements.

Notes to the Company Financial Information
For the year ended 30 April 2017
1. General information
Accrol Group Holdings plc (formerly Accrol Group Holdings Limited), (the “Company”) was incorporated in England 30 April 2014 with 
company number 09019496. It is a public company limited by shares and it is domiciled in England in the United Kingdom. The registered 
address of the Company is the Delta Building, Roman Road, Blackburn, Lancashire, BB1 2LD The Company’s subsidiaries are listed in Note 22 
to the consolidated financial statements, which together with the Company form the Accrol Group Holdings plc Group (the “Group”). The 
Company acts as a holding company for the remainder of the Accrol Group.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
A summary of the significant accounting policies is set out below. These have been applied consistently during the financial year.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as 
adopted for use in the EU, International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations and with those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention. The financial statements are 
presented in pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds, except where otherwise indicated.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in Section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual profit and 
loss account and related notes that form part of the approved Company financial statements. The retained profit of the Company is shown 
in the statement of changes in equity.
Standards issued not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of this financial information, the following new standards and interpretations which have not been applied in  
this financial information were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases, had not yet been adopted by the EU):
• IAS 16 and IAS 38 amendments – Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation (effective 1 January 2016)
• IFRS 11 amendments – Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations ( effective 1 January 2016)
• IAS 16 and IAS 41 amendments – Agriculture: Bearer Plants ( effective 1 January 2016)
• IAS 27 amendments – Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements (effective 1 January 2016)
• IFRS 10 and IAS 28 amendments – Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (effective 
1 January 2016)
• IAS 1 amendments – Disclosure Initiative ( effective 1 January 2016)
• Annual Improvements 2012-2014 Cycle (effective 1 January 2016)
• IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( effective 1 January 2018 )
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2018 )
The adoption of these standards and interpretations is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company  
in the year of initial application when the relevant standards come into effect.
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ is a new standard that has been published and is effective from 1 January 2019 but has not been early adopted by the 
Company. It is unlikely to have a material impact on the Company. At the time of preparing this financial information, the Company 
continues to assess the possible impact of the adoption of this standard in future years. 
Going concern
The Directors have made appropriate enquiries and formed a judgement at the time of approving the financial statements that there is a 
reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Exceptional items
Items that are material in size or unusual or infrequent in nature are included within operating profit and disclosed separately as exceptional 
items in the consolidated income statement.
The separate reporting of exceptional items, which are presented as exceptional within the relevant category in the consolidated income 
statement, helps provide an indication of the Group’s underlying business performance. Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report 
Accrol Group Holdings plc / Annual Report and Accounts 67
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Investments
On initial recognition, investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost, which is the fair value of the consideration paid. Where consideration 
is paid by way of shares, the excess of fair value of the shares over nominal value of those shares is recorded in share premium. Investments 
in subsidiaries are reviewed for impairment at each balance sheet date with any impairment charged to the income statement.
Financial instruments
Financial assets
The Company classifies its financial assets as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets. The Company’s loans and receivables 
comprise debtors and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet. Subsequent to initial recognition, these assets are carried at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method. Income from these financial assets is calculated on an effective yield basis and is recognised in the 
income statement.
Financial liabilities
The Company initially recognises its financial liabilities at fair value and subsequently they are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
