A great British food company
As one of Britain’s biggest listed food companies 
we’re committed to the UK, employing over 4,000 
dedicated colleagues at 15 manufacturing sites 
and offices up and down the country. More than 
97% of what we sell is made in the UK from quality 
ingredients, wherever we can sourced sustainably 
from British suppliers and farmers. We’re also working 
hard to expand internationally by finding new markets 
for our brands around the world.  
Expanding internationally
Our International business is expanding rapidly.  
We’re finding increasing consumer interest in our  
Mr Kipling and Cadbury cake brands and Sharwood's 
cooking sauces in a number of markets including 
Australia, the USA and the Middle East. And we 
continue to focus on building momentum closer  
to home in Ireland.  
Strategic partnerships 
Since we entered into a co-operation agreement 
with Nissin Foods in 2016 we've launched Batchelors 
Super Noodles in a new pot format using Nissin’s 
noodle technology and manufacturing expertise, 
taken on distribution of Nissin’s Soba brand of 
noodles in the UK and we’re now working with Nissin 
to expand international opportunities for our brands 
using Nissin’s global network.
In May 2017, we signed a non-binding Heads of 
Terms with Mondelez International for a Strategic 
Global Partnership for Cadbury cake. Once finalised, 
this agreement will extend the Group's long-standing 
partnership for at least another five years and be 
expanded to cover a total of 46 countries with the 
potential to use additional brands.
Our key customers are the major UK supermarkets but we also serve a wide 
range of other channels including: discounters; convenience stores; online; 
wholesale and food service.

Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 02 INTRODUCTION
Chairman's statement
Dear shareholder, 
2016/17 was a challenging year for the food industry 
generally and for the categories in which we operate.   
As a consequence, we announced in January 2017, 
that our financial results would be below expectation. 
However, management have moved quickly to adapt 
to the changing environment and refine our strategy to 
deliver more balanced progress in terms of revenue, 
cost efficiency and cash generation in the future.
Performance over the year
Group underlying sales for the financial period  
were £790.4m (-1.4%) and underlying Trading profit 
was £117.0m (-9.3%). Our performance was impacted 
by a change in retailer promotional strategies which 
reduced category volumes, a time lag in recovering 
input cost inflation and a period of warmer than  
usual weather which impacted Grocery in the  
second quarter.
We did nevertheless manage to grow market share 
for most of our core brands during the year and our 
International business continued to deliver excellent 
double-digit growth. As a result we have outperformed 
the majority of our peer group in the UK ambient 
grocery market during the last six months of the period. 
I’m also encouraged with the progress we’ve 
made with Nissin Foods following the co-operation 
agreement we signed in 2016. We’ve already started 
to distribute Nissin’s Soba brand of noodles in 
the UK and recently launched Batchelors Super 
Noodles in a pot format using Nissin’s technology 
and manufacturing expertise. Early signs are very 
encouraging. I’m also very pleased that we’ve been 
able to announce the signing of non-binding Heads 
of Terms with Mondelez International to renew our 
long-standing licence to produce Cadbury cakes  
in the coming years. 
After a period of lower food prices, rising commodity 
costs, compounded by the devaluation of Sterling 
following the EU referendum last year, led to the  
re-emergence of food price inflation in the UK.   
Management have worked hard to recover these 
cost increases through a combination of internal 
efficiencies, adjustments to promotional mechanics 
and, where necessary, limited price increases 
although it’s true to say this has not been easy and 
has taken longer than expected. 
To help us adapt to the challenging market,   
management announced a cost reduction and 
efficiency programme in January 2017, including 
both operational efficiencies in the supply chain and 
our head office functions. This is targeted to deliver 
cost savings of £20m over the next two years. As a 
consequence, we’ve streamlined our organisational 
structures and this has regrettably resulted in some 
colleagues leaving the business. I would like to thank 
them for their contribution, as well as thanking all 
colleagues for their hard work and commitment  
over the year.
I’m pleased to say that despite a changing market 
environment our commitment to sustainability has 
remained strong. We’ve made good progress in 
delivering the health commitments we announced 
in 2016, for instance in removing sugar from our 
products and launching healthier options. We’ve 
also been recognised externally for the progress 
we’ve made on animal welfare and sustainable palm 
oil and, encouragingly, we exceeded many of our 
environmental targets through improving our focus 
and efficiency.
Board changes
We welcomed Tsunao Kijima to the Board as 
a representative of Nissin Foods, our largest 
shareholder. Tsunao, who is Managing Executive 
Officer of Nissin, was appointed as a non-executive 
director in July 2016. 
In March 2017 we also announced the appointment 
of Daniel Wosner as a representative director of 
Oasis, an international investment firm who are now 
our second largest shareholder. Daniel is Managing 
Director and Head of Europe at Oasis and oversees 
the firm’s UK and Continental European investments. 
Both Tsunao's and Daniel’s experience will be  
a valuable addition to the Board as we look to 
enhance the Company’s long-term value for all  
our shareholders. 
Finally, you will be aware that in September 2016, I 
notified the Board of my intention to step down as 
Chairman during 2017, having spent nine years as a 
non-executive Director and the last five as Chairman. 
The search for a successor is underway led by Ian 
Krieger, Senior Independent Director and further 
details can be found on page 29.
Outlook
The last year has clearly been difficult for the 
business and the market looks to remain challenging 
in the year ahead. I believe management have moved 
swiftly to adapt to the current situation and put in 
place a robust plan which targets to deleverage the 
business to below 3x Net debt to EBITDA in the next 
three to four years through a more balanced focus on 
revenue growth, cost efficiency and cash generation.   
I would like to thank shareholders for their significant 
support for the Company during my tenure as 
Chairman. I remain confident in the effectiveness of 
our strategy, the strength of our brands, the quality  
of our customer relationships and the experience of 
our management team. I look forward to a bright  
future for Premier Foods.

Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 04 STRATEGIC REPORT
Chief Executive's review
It’s difficult to remember a year when there’s been 
as much change in the food market as we’ve seen 
in the last twelve months. The rapid switch from 
food price deflation to inflation, changing retailer 
promotional strategies and the surprise result of the 
EU referendum have all combined to make this past 
year a difficult one, not only for Premier Foods but 
right across the UK food and drink industry.
Like others, our results have been adversely affected 
although I’m encouraged that we still out-performed 
the majority of our peer group, particularly in the 
latter half of the year. 
Fundamentally we’re doing the right things and our 
strategy is delivering in important key areas. We’ve 
continued to invest in our brands in line with consumer 
trends for snacking, convenience and health and 
six out of our eight key brands grew market share in 
2016/17. Our International business continues to grow 
strongly quarter after quarter and is now 34% larger 
in terms of revenue than it was when we started to 
invest in this area two years ago. And our strategic 
partnership with Nissin Foods is progressing well 
with the launch of Batchelors Super Noodles in a pot 
format in February together with our distribution of 
Nissin’s Soba brand of noodles in the UK. 
But in today’s challenging marketplace we can’t stand 
still. Together with the Board we’ve therefore taken 
the opportunity to review our strategy and agreed to 
adjust the balance of priorities between our strategic 
objectives of delivering revenue growth, driving 
cost and efficiency savings and cash generation. 
Previously this balance has been weighted more 
towards delivering category and revenue growth but 
in future will be more evenly balanced with a specific 
focus on reducing our net debt/EBITDA ratio to below 
3.0x, helping ensure we generate best value for our 
shareholders over the medium-term.
Our rebalanced strategy has three main pillars:
Protect and drive revenues 
We plan to continue investing in our brands but 
in a more focused way supporting innovation that 
is closer to our core brand offering and making 
sure that our marketing spend is used in the most 
efficient way to get the best return on investment. 
We’ll also continue to build on our strong customer 
relationships through closer collaboration, category 
management expertise and shopper insights helping 
us drive growth ahead of category levels.
Our plans in the UK will be enhanced by the strong 
momentum we’ve built in our International business. 
We’ve made great progress in key markets, notably 
Australia, and we aim to continue delivering double-
digit revenue growth in the medium-term through these 
markets and others. 
Our strategic partnerships will add further to our 
growth plans in the UK and internationally. The first 
products we’ve been working on together with Nissin 
are exceeding expectations with more to come, both 
in the UK and through tapping into Nissin’s broad 
global network. I’m also delighted that we’ve agreed 
Heads of Terms with Mondelez International for a 
new strategic global partnership for Cadbury cakes. 
This partnership is a significant improvement on our 
current licence arrangements and opens up exciting 
new growth opportunities in a much wider range of 
countries representing a further boost to our fast-
growing International business. It also gives us the 
potential to access the full Cadbury brand family in 
addition to the Oreo brand.
Cost and efficiency 
Closely managing our costs is imperative in the 
current environment and will be key to funding future 
investment in the business and supporting the profit 
needed to be able to accelerate our debt reduction. 
In January we announced a major cost reduction 
and efficiency programme designed to deliver 
savings of £20m over the next two years. 
A major part of this will come from combining our 
separate Sweet Treats and Grocery warehousing 
and logistics operations into one consolidated 
warehousing and transport solution helping drive 
greater efficiencies, improved customer service 
and fewer road miles. And we’re continuing to 
drive our continuous improvement programmes in 
manufacturing and procurement via both capital  
and non-capital cost reduction projects.
We’ve also streamlined our overhead cost base, 
reducing duplication and complexity and creating 
a leaner and more agile management structure. 
Regrettably this has meant over 50 valued 
colleagues have had to leave the business and  
we wish them well in their future careers. 
Cash generation 
We plan to keep a tight focus on managing cash. 
Our capital expenditure will be held to £20–£25m 
over the medium-term. Additionally, in March we 
announced an agreement with the trustees of our 
pension schemes to reduce our deficit payments to 
the schemes by £32m over the next three years. And 
we’re continuing to maintain diversified sources of 
financing through an extension of the maturity of our 
revolving credit facilities and launch of a new 5 year 
floating rate note due 2022. 
Whilst it’s been a difficult year overall, I believe we’ve 
continued to make progress in many important 
areas helping us out-perform the marketplace. By 
rebalancing our strategy to give equal focus to revenue 
growth, cost efficiencies and cash generation I’m 
confident we can be successful in this environment, 
reduce our leverage and deliver shareholder value.

Strategy
Recent developments in the external environment have adversely affected the Group’s performance. As a result, the 
Board has reviewed its strategy and decided to adjust the balance of priorities between existing strategic objectives.

revenue growth, achieving cost and efficiency savings and reducing net debt.

Strategy in action
In the UK, growing ahead of our categories continues to be a core objective for us and our plans for International are 
for further strong growth. We are excited by our global strategic relationships with Cadbury and Nissin and our recently 
announced cost savings programme is expected to deliver £20m over the next two years.
UK 
Invest in  
innovation and 
marketing to drive 
growth ahead of 
category levels
We have a portfolio of great British 
brands which are leaders in their 
respective categories. We aim to 
deliver revenue growth of these 
brands ahead of category trends 
through advertising and marketing 
these brands and by introducing new 
branded products to the market.
We use our UK specific consumer 
insights to identify the key consumer 
trends relevant to our product 
categories through consumer usage 
and attitude studies and other 
consumer research. This helps us 
identify key consumer trends such as 
convenience, health & wellness and 
indulgence which in turn informs our 
product innovation strategy. Recent 
examples of new branded product 
ranges which illustrate this approach 
to innovation include OXO Stock Pots, 
Cadbury Amaze Bites and Ambrosia 
Deluxe custard.
International
Strong double- 
digit growth over  
the medium-term 
 
Our International business currently 
accounts for nearly 6% of total Group 
revenue. Over the last two and a half 
years the International business unit 
has delivered revenue growth for ten 
consecutive quarters and this growth 
trend is expected to continue in the 
medium-term.
The Australian business has 
performed particularly strongly over 
the last two years. We are now the 
leading branded cake supplier in 
Australia with Mr Kipling and Cadbury 
cakes and Sharwood's sauces has 
grown its market share to 12% of the 
Indian Foods category.
In the USA we are extending 
distribution of Sharwood's to the West 
Coast and we have now launched a 
range of Cadbury cake in the United 
Arab Emirates.
Strategic  
partnerships
Our partnership  
with Nissin has  
the potential to create 
significant long-
term value for both 
organisations through 
strategic co-operation
 
In February 2017, we launched 
Batchelors Super Noodles in a new 
pot format. This is a great example 
of how we can combine the power of 
our leading British brand with Nissin’s 
leading noodle technology and 
manufacturing expertise. The product 
is being distributed across the major 
retailers in the UK and initial results 
have been very encouraging. 
In addition, we have taken on 
distribution of Nissin’s Soba brand 
of noodles in the UK. And looking 
forward we are working with Nissin 
to leverage their international scale to 
accelerate the distribution of Premier’s 
products in key overseas markets.

The Group has previously operated 
a distinct central warehousing and 
distribution operating model for each 
of its Grocery and Sweet Treats 
business units. Following an in-depth 
review of its logistics operations, the 
Group has decided to consolidate 
its warehousing and distribution 
solutions into one location. This 
review has identified the optimal 
location for a central warehousing 
and distribution hub for the whole 
business which will help us serve 
customers more efficiently.
The Group expects to deliver 
significant financial benefits as a result 
of this re-organisation. The majority 
of these benefits are expected to 
be realised in 2018/19, while the 
restructuring costs associated with 
this re-organisation are predominantly 
planned to be incurred during the 
2017/18 financial year.

07 STRATEGIC REPORT INTRODUCTION GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We use a large number of performance indicators to monitor financial, operational and responsibility performance. 
These are reviewed on a regular basis by our senior management teams and the Board. Performance indicators are used to encourage focus and measure 
performance across a range of areas and to highlight areas for attention and corrective action, as well as recognising good performance and celebrating success. 
As set out in the Chief Executive's review (on page 05) we have rebalanced our strategy to focus on the delivery of revenue growth, driving cost and efficiency 
savings and cash generation. To support this we have replaced the previous recurring cash flow measure with free cash flow, as this reflects all cash outflows of the 
business and provides clarity on targeting absolute net debt reduction.

(2015/16: £55.7m)
Why is this important?
Delivering sales growth is one of our 
strategic priorities. This captures 
both branded and non-branded 
performance across all channels  
we operate in.
Progress we’ve made
Overall Group underlying sales fell 
slightly to £790.4m in the period. 
Branded sales were impacted 
by changing retailer promotional 
activities and a period of unseasonally 
warm weather, both of which reduced 
category volumes. However, we 
grew market share in 6 of our 8 
largest brands and there were strong 
performances from non-branded 
and International.
Progress we’ve made
Underlying Trading profit declined by 
9.3% in the period. This was primarily 
driven by a time lag in the recovery 
of increased input cost inflation 
and changing retailer promotional 
strategies which reduced gross 
profit. In response to the changing 
commercial environment we have re-
balanced our strategy, further details 
are set out in the Chief Executive’s 
review on page 05.
Progress we’ve made
Net debt reduced by £11m from 
£534.2m in 2015/16 to £523.2m in 
2016/17. The Net debt/ EBITDA ratio 
was adversely affected by weaker 
Trading profit in the period. Following 
the rebalancing of our strategy 
over the year we have announced a 
strategic target to reduce leverage to 
below 3.0x in 3–4 years time.
Progress we’ve made
Free cash flow reduced largely as 
a result of the £38.8m increase in 
pension contributions paid during 
the period. As part of the rebalancing 
of our strategy in the year cash 
generation has been highlighted 
as a strategic priority as we look to 
deleverage the business.
Why is this important?
This measure reflects the revenues 
and costs associated with the 
operational performance of the 
business and is also a good proxy  
for the cash generative capacity of  
the business.
Why is this important?
The ratio is tied with the Group’s 
priority to organically deleverage  
the business. 
Why is this important?
Free cash flow is a good indicator of 
the underlying quality of earnings and 
the overall health of the business. It 
also identifies cash available to pay 
down debt.

Progress we’ve made
Overall market share fell during the 
year. In Grocery good progress was 
made in Quick meals, soups and 
Flavourings & seasonings offset by 
a weaker performance in Cooking 
sauces & accompaniments. Within 
Sweet Treats a strong performance 
from Cadbury was offset by softer 
sales from Mr Kipling. 
Progress we’ve made
Over the year SG&A costs rose slightly 
reflecting investment in sales, marketing 
and product development resource. 
In January 2017 we announced a new 
cost saving and efficiency programme 
which is focused on SG&A costs and 
further manufacturing and procurement 
efficiency savings. This is targeted to 
deliver savings of £20m over the next 
two years.
Progress we’ve made
Overall performance was broadly 
in line with prior year. The review 
covered 73% of our branded portfolio 
(by retail sales value) as part of a 
two year rolling programme. We will 
continue to focus on consumer quality 
benchmarking and reformulate any 
products testing below par.
Progress we’ve made
Over the course of the period 78% 
of new product launches within our 
Grocery portfolio delivered a claimable 
nutritional benefit and none of these 
products were high in fat, saturated 
fat, sugar or salt (no red traffic light 
on front of pack). As one of our 
Commitments to Healthier Choices 
we have set a three year target to 
ensure that at least 75% of new 
product launches each year across 
our Grocery portfolio will provide these 
kind of ‘better-for-you’ choices. 
Why is this important?
As part of our cost and efficiency 
strategy we intend to maintain a lean 
organisational structure; ensuring 
complexity and duplication are kept  
to a minimum. 
Why is this important?
This is an important measure of the 
quality of our product portfolio. 
It drives recipe improvements and 
ensures focus on consistent  
product quality.
Why is this important?

09 STRATEGIC REPORT INTRODUCTION GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Group underlying sales for the 52 weeks ended 1 
April 2017 were £790.4m, a decrease of (1.4%) on 
the prior year. Branded sales were (3.5%) lower in the 
year while Non-branded underlying sales increased 
by 11.1% to £130.9m. 
On a statutory basis, revenue grew from £771.7m in 
the year to £790.4m, an increase of 2.4%, reflecting 
the inclusion of results from Knighton Foods in 
2016/17.
In the fourth quarter of the year, Group underlying 
sales declined by (1.0%) to £191.0m compared to the 
equivalent quarter a year ago. While Branded sales 
were (2.9%) lower, six of the Group’s eight largest 
brands gained value market share in the quarter, with 
Batchelors a particularly strong performer.
The Grocery business unit reported full year 
underlying sales of £563.1m, which were (2.6%) lower 
than a year ago. The year started strongly, with the 
first quarter of the year displaying both Branded and 
Non-branded sales growth, however a particularly 
warm end to the second quarter in the UK resulted 
in a sharp slowdown in some of the key Grocery 
categories such as gravy, stocks and soups, which 
resulted in lower sales.
Additionally, the Grocery business has been 
impacted by changing retailer promotional strategies 
during the course of the year, and particularly in 
the second half. A variety of different promotional 
deals for products sold in major retailers have long 
been a feature of the grocery landscape in the UK.

This financial year has been a challenging one for the industry, with the return of food inflation and changing retailer 
promotional strategies. Despite this, the Group grew market share in six of its eight largest brands, outperformed many of its 
peers in the latter part of the year and grew International sales by 18%. The Group has continued to invest in brand innovation 
and marketing, customer relationships remain strong and the Group recently agreed a £32m reduction in cash payments to its 
pension schemes over the next three years.
In 2016/17, the number of multi-buy promotional 
deals, by aggregate sales value, reduced by 24% 
across the Group’s categories, according to Kantar 
Worldpanel. In categories which are considered to be 
expandable, this has resulted in lower sales volumes 
compared to the comparative period. The Group 
expects this effect to continue into the first half of 
2017/18, and then stabilise thereafter. The Group 
is introducing multipack formats such as Ambrosia 
custard 4 packs to mitigate the adverse effect of this 
change in retailer promotional strategies.
The Group’s strategy of bringing new innovative 
products to market continued during the course of 
the year, with OXO Stock Pots, Ambrosia Deluxe 
custard and Batchelors Super Noodles in a pot 
format all contributing to market share gains for their 
respective brands. In particular, Batchelors delivered 
volume growth in the year due to both the Super 
Noodles pot product launched in the fourth quarter 
and a refreshed range of Pasta ‘n’ Sauce products 
with new contemporary flavours such as Smoky 
Cheese and Pancetta.
The Batchelors Super Noodles Pot product, which 
launched to market earlier than expected, was the 
first product which demonstrates the benefits of 
working closely with the Group’s strategic partner 
and major shareholder, Nissin. Specifically, the 
access to Nissin’s research & development teams 
and their manufacturing base in Hungary was pivotal 
in launching this exciting, convenient new product 
which has already delivered over £1m retail sales 
value in a short period of time.
Grocery Non-branded underlying sales increased 
by £7.8m in the year to £81.1m. Business to 
business sales performance at Knighton Foods 
was a key contributor to this growth, with volumes 
increasing as this business transitioned through its 
recovery phase.
Note: 2015/16 statutory revenue excludes Knighton Foods revenue of £29.6m, which is consolidated in the results 
for the Grocery business in 2016/17.
Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 10 Sweet Treats delivered sales growth of 1.9% in the 
year to £227.3m, and grew sales in the first three 
quarters of the year. Branded sales were £1.0m or 
(0.5%) lower at £177.5m and Non-branded sales 
grew by 11.6% to £49.8m. Cadbury cake performed 
very strongly in the year, with volumes, sales and 
market share all ahead of the prior year, while Mr 
Kipling experienced lower sales due to lower levels 
of promotional activity. Cadbury Amaze Bites, a 
convenient tub of bite sized chocolate brownies is 
now worth approximately £5m in terms of retail sales 
value (Source: IRI, 31 December 2016).
Growth in Sweet Treats Non-branded sales reflected 
new contract wins across a broad range of retail 
customers and in both seasonal and all year 
round ranges. In particular, the business unit was 
successful in gaining some premium Mince Pie 
contracts for the first time.
The Group’s International business unit continues 
to demonstrate excellent progress and has now 
delivered ten successive quarters of sales growth. 
In the year, sales were 18% ahead and up 11% on 
a constant currency basis
12
. This was largely due 
to a very strong performance in Australasia where 
sales increased nearly 70% reflecting growth in 
Sharwood's cooking sauces and Mr Kipling and 
Cadbury cakes. The Group launched a digital 
marketing campaign for Sharwood's cooking 
sauces in the year which has received over 21 million 
impressions and over 1 million video views to date.

The Group’s underlying Trading profit in 2016/17 
was £117.0m compared to £129.1m in the prior year. 
Divisional contribution was £149.7m in the year, of 
which £129.9m was generated from the Grocery 
business and £19.8m from Sweet Treats. 
Group & corporate costs were £3.4m lower in the 
year. Following a weaker trading performance by 
the Group during the year, no provisions were  
made for management incentive scheme payments 
to colleagues.
The decline in Underlying Trading profit performance 
was impacted by a time lag in recovering input cost 
inflation; the impact of changing retailer promotional 
strategies and category declines in the Grocery 
business following a warmer than usual second 
quarter. Partly offsetting these impacts were SG&A 
savings, manufacturing cost efficiencies and slightly 
lower marketing investment in the year.
The Group has experienced material input cost 
inflation in the past year, notably in commodities 
such as sugar, chocolate, dairy, wheat and palm oil. 
Input costs have also been driven up by currency 
devaluation. The Group takes a blended approach 
to managing these cost increases, managing its 
own efficiencies, adjusting promotional mechanics 
and formats where appropriate and finally looking 
at limited price increases where these cannot be 
avoided. The Group has worked collaboratively with 
customers to agree these changes and appropriate 
settlements were concluded. This collaborative 
approach, while the most beneficial approach in the 
long-term, took longer than originally foreseen.
During the course of the year, and particularly in 
the second half, the Group’s Grocery categories 
have been affected by changing retailer promotional 
strategies, notably a reduction in multi-buy 
promotions which has the effect of reducing 
category volumes. In the short-term the Group offset 
this adverse volume impact by upweighting other 
promotional mechanics such as reduced price deals. 
However, these mechanics are more costly than 
multi-buys and resulted in reduced sales per unit.
In the second quarter of the year, a number of the 
Grocery business’s categories were adversely 
impacted by warmer weather compared to the 
prior year. In this quarter, categories such as Gravy 
and Stocks and Soup declined in volume terms by 
(13.0%) and (16.3%) respectively, while Chilled Salads 
and Ice Cream, which the Group has no major 
presence in, grew by 13.7% and 17.3% respectively 
(Source: IRI, 12 weeks ended 24 September 2016). 
As a result, and after a strong first quarter when 
six Grocery brands grew sales, none of the major 
Grocery brands grew in the second quarter.
Manufacturing overhead costs were lower in the year 
following the completion of a programme to improve 
labour flexibility at some of the Group’s Grocery 
manufacturing sites.
During the year, the Group announced a substantial 
two year cost reduction and efficiency programme. 
One part of this programme is a significant logistics 
restructuring which will combine the warehousing 
and distribution operations of both the Grocery 
and Sweet Treats businesses into one centralised 
location. This programme is expected to reduce 
transport miles by 15% and reduce pallet transfers 
by 43,000 per annum.
Additionally, the Group has concluded a process 
which will deliver significant cost savings across 
its SG&A cost base and has involved its Group 
Executive team reducing from ten to seven and over 
50 roles removed from the Group’s head office. 
This programme is expected to deliver incremental 
cost savings of £10m, of which approximately 60% 
relate directly to colleague headcount. The total 
restructuring costs associated with the logistics and 
SG&A programmes are expected to be £8–£10m in 
2017/18.

Underlying adjusted EBITDA for 2016/17 was 
£133.2m and depreciation in the year of £16.2m  
was £1.2m lower than the comparative period.
Operating profit was £61.5m in the year, an increase 
of £7.0m on the prior year. Amortisation of intangible 
assets was broadly in line with the comparative year 
at £37.9m. Intangible assets amortisation included 
£25.7m relating to brands, trademarks and licences 
and £12.2m relating to software. Restructuring costs 
in the year were £15.8m, £4.6m higher than 2015/16, 
and which relate to corporate activity costs in April 
2016 and restructuring charges associated with the 
Group’s logistics restructuring and overhead cost 
reduction programmes.
Net interest on pensions and administrative 
expenses were £0.8m in the year, a £13.7m reduction 
compared to the prior year. This was composed of 
administrative expenses incurred of £6.3m, partly 
offset by a net interest credit of £5.6m owing to an 
opening combined pension schemes surplus. In the 
prior year an impairment charge of £13.6m due to the 
write down of associate investments was reported; 
there were no impairments in 2016/17.

Net regular interest for 2016/17 was £42.8m, a 
little ahead of the Group’s expectations and £2.1m 
lower than the prior year. The largest component of 
net regular interest was £30.6m of interest due to 
holders of the Group’s senior secured notes. Bank 
debt interest of £8.1m was £1.6m lower in the year 
due to lower levels of average debt and slightly lower 
LIBOR levels.
Net finance cost was £49.5m in the year, £4.6m 
higher than 2015/16. The main driver of the change 
was a decrease in the discount rate used to value 
long-term property provisions the Group holds, 
which is disclosed in Other interest, and increased 
from £0.3m in 2015/16 to £7.2m in the year. This 
increase in the discount unwind, which has no cash 
effect, is a result of changes in government gilts over 
the last twelve months.
Associate investments
The Group holds a 49% interest in Hovis Limited 
('Hovis'). In the prior year, the Group wrote down 
its investment in Hovis to £nil. On 1 April 2016, the 
Group gained control (as defined under IFRS 10) 
of Knighton, in which the Group already held 49% 
of the ordinary share capital and associated voting 
rights, and hence the results of Knighton were 
consolidated in the Group’s financial statements for 
the period ended 2 April 2016. On 24 May 2016, the 
Group acquired the remaining 51% of the ordinary 
share capital of Knighton.

included a current period charge of £6.4m, an 
adjustment to restate opening deferred tax of £1.2m, 
partly offset by a prior period credit of £1.1m. The 
current period charge comprised a tax charge at 
20.0% on profit before tax of £2.4m, non-deductible 
items of £1.0m, an adjustment for share based 
payments of £0.9m and a credit due to a current 
period deferred tax adjustment of £0.3m.
Deferred tax assets at 1 April 2017 were £32.4m 
compared to £25.9m at 2 April 2016.

Depreciation, at £16.2m, was £1.2m lower than the 
prior year, and non-cash items of £4.3m principally 
comprised the addition of share based payments. 
Interest paid in the year was £39.8m; £1.9m lower 
than the comparative period due to lower average 
levels of debt. Capital expenditure was £4.5m lower 
at £20.9m and pension contributions (including 
pension administration costs) increased from £12.9m 
to £51.7m. An inflow of £4.8m from working capital 
was reported and restructuring costs increased 
from £7.5m to £13.7m. This was due to cash costs 
associated with corporate activity in April 2016 and 
redundancy costs relating to the cost reduction and 
efficiency programmes, the majority of which were 
incurred in the first half of the year.
On a statutory basis, cash generated from 
operations was £76.8m compared to £137.1m 
in the comparative period. This was largely due 
to increased pension deficit contributions, as 
identified in the table above, and lower Operating 
profit before (non-cash) impairment charges. Cash 
generated from operating activities was £37.0m, after 
deducting net interest paid of £39.8m. Repayment 
of borrowings was £34.6m in the year, £33.0m of 
which related to lower drawings against the Group’s 
revolving credit facility.
At 1 April 2017, the Group held cash and bank

The Group has extended the term of its revolving 
credit facility with its lending syndicate from March 
2019 to December 2020. The £272m facility, which 
was £22m drawn at 1 April 2017, is expected to 
reduce by £55m to £217m, subject to the issue of new 
£210m Senior Secured floating rate notes outlined 
below. The facility will further reduce to approximately 
£184m in March 2019. The interest margin under the 
revolving credit facility is unchanged and covenants 
under the facility, which are tested bi-annually, have 
been updated to ensure appropriate headroom 
against future reporting periods.
The Group has also announced the issue of new five 
year £210m Senior Secured floating rate notes due 
2022, to replace its £175m Senior Secured floating 
rate notes, due to mature March 2020. Pricing of the 
new £210m Senior Secured floating rate notes will 
be confirmed following completion of the transaction 
and the notes are expected to be callable at 101% 
after one year. The Group’s £325m Senior Secured 
fixed notes which attract a coupon of 6.5%, mature 
in March 2021 and there are no immediate plans to 
call or refinance these notes.

£489.1m in relation to the Premier Foods schemes. Assets in the combined schemes increased by £521.7m in 
the year from £4,342.9m to £4,864.6m. RHM scheme assets increased by £432.2m mainly due to an increase  
in interest rate swaps and equities, while the Premier Foods’ schemes assets increased by £89.5m. The increase 
in asset movements in the year have been offset by an increase in the combined schemes liabilities of £547.8m. 
This is principally due to a reduction in the discount rate from 3.55% at 2 April 2016 to 2.65% at 1 April 2017.

Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 14 The Accounting Standards Board under IFRIC 14, 
are currently reviewing the recognition of a pensions 
surplus in the financial statements of an entity. 
Dependent upon the final published standard, there 
is potential that any future defined benefit surplus 
may not be recognised in the financial statements 
of the Group and additionally, the deficit valuation 
methodology may also change.
During the year, the Group finalised the 2016 
combined pension schemes’ triennial actuarial 
valuation, displayed in the table below, which 
confirms a combined schemes’ deficit of £421m. 
This is a £641m reduction compared to the previous 
triennial valuation in 2013.

Premier Foods (551) (538) (13)
Irish schemes (5) (20) 15
Total schemes (421) (1,062) 641
On 28 March 2017, and following the finalisation 
of the triennial actuarial valuation, the Group 
announced it had agreed a revised schedule of 
pension payments with the Trustees of the pension 
schemes. Overall, the total cash payments for the 
three financial years from 2017/18 to 2019/20, to 
the RHM and Premier Foods Pension Schemes 
will be approximately £32m lower than outlined in 
our Interim Results on 15 November 2016. A full 
schedule of the scheduled payments for the next  
six financial years are set out in the table below.
As part of these overall reductions, the Group has 
also agreed with the Premier Foods schemes a 
mechanism (including limited changes to the existing 
dividend matching agreement) to allow the schemes 
limited further cash contributions in the event the 
Group outperforms certain agreed profit targets. 
These targets are materially ahead of current market 
expectations for the Group.
The net present value of future deficit payments, to 
the end of the respective recovery periods remains  
at c.£300–320m.
Outlook
The industry in which the Group operates has 
undergone recent and rapid change. Reflecting 
these changes, the Board has updated the Group’s 
strategy to give an equal focus to revenue growth, 
cost efficiencies and cash generation. In the UK, 
growing ahead of its categories continues to be 
a core objective for the Group and its plans for 
International are for further strong double-digit 
growth. The global strategic relationships presented 
by the Cadbury and Nissin partnerships are 
exciting and the recently announced cost savings 
programme is expected to deliver £20m over the 
next two years. The Group is focused on reducing 
its leverage ratio to below 3.0x in the next 3-4 years 
through profit improvement and debt reduction.
The 2017/18 financial year has started on a solid 
footing. The Group expects the effect of changing 
retailer promotional strategies to reduce through 
the first half of the year and then stabilise thereafter. 
Accordingly, quarter 2 sales are expected to deliver 
an improved year on year sales trend relative to 
quarter 1. In the full year, the Group plans to deliver 
progress which is expected to be weighted more to 
the second half.

17 STRATEGIC REPORT INTRODUCTION GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT
Our responsibilities
Being responsible and sustainable 
underpins our business strategy and 
is crucial to how we drive growth, 
productivity and reputation in the 
longer-term interest of our shareholders, 
colleagues and all those who touch  
our business.
Over the past year we’ve developed a new theme 
for our sustainability agenda – Bringing Britain 
Together – to better reflect the values inherent in our 
brand portfolio and provide a stronger identity and 
focus for our activities. In the same way our brands 
bring people together, whether it’s dinner with the 
family or cake with friends, we bring our colleagues, 
suppliers and stakeholders together to address issues 
important to the sustainability of our company, our 
communities and our country. 
Building on our previous achievements we’ve 
developed five core commitments under our new 
theme of Bringing Britain Together: 
• encourage healthier food choices for our 
consumers and our colleagues;
• develop the skills our industry needs for the future;
• collaborate with our suppliers to drive higher 
ethical and environmental standards;
• deliver environmental improvements across  
our operations; and
• support our communities on a local and  
national level.
Encouraging healthier food choices
Health and nutrition continue to be important issues 
both for our consumers as they seek to make the 
right food choices and for society more broadly 
given the obesity challenge facing the UK. In 2016, 
we refreshed our nutrition strategy and developed 
ten new commitments to encourage healthier food 
choices for our consumers and colleagues. These 
included a commitment to remove 1,000 tonnes 
of sugar from our portfolio in the next three years, 
control portion sizes, provide informative labelling, 
launch additional healthy options and tighten our 
marketing codes.
During the year we removed more than 200 tonnes 
of sugar, primarily from our cake, desserts and 
cooking sauce brands. For example, we developed 
a new recipe for Mr Kipling Viennese Whirls which 
not only contains lower sugar, but lower saturated fat 
levels and calories too. As a result, we’ve removed 
450 million calories, 50 tonnes of saturated fat and 
50 tonnes of sugar from the market.
We also launched a number of healthy choices in the 
year, including Batchelors high protein and high veg 
pots and High Protein Cup a Soup. And we tightened 
our existing marketing to children policy to prohibit 
all marketing and advertising to children under 16 
years of age. 
On a broader level, we continue to work with others 
in our industry, our suppliers, our customers and 
the government on how we can best contribute to 
addressing the obesity issue, particularly amongst 
children. This includes supporting the government’s 
Childhood Obesity Plan launched in 2016. 
Developing the skills our  
industry needs
The food industry is facing a serious skills shortage 
in the UK especially in the engineering, food science 
and technical areas. To make sure we have the 
skills needed to drive productivity, innovation and 
growth in the future we’re continuing to invest in 
apprenticeships and supporting higher education 
initiatives as well as engaging with schools to 
encourage students to think about the world of work 
and a career in the food industry. 
Over the last year, we continued our regular intake of 
new apprentices and additionally developed a plan 
to maximise the benefits of the government’s new 
Apprenticeship Levy. The plan balances offering 
new recruits the opportunity to gain new skills and 
providing further development for existing colleagues. 
In total we expect to create around 100 new 
apprenticeships across the business in the coming 
year in a broad range of disciplines, from engineering 
to food science to information technology.
During the year we also continued our support 
for the Institute of Grocery Distribution’s (IGD) 
Feeding Britain’s Future schools campaign. Along 
with others in the food manufacturing and retailing 
sector, we provided volunteers to support structured 
pre-employment skills training sessions for year 9 
and year 12 students. In 2016/17 Premier Foods’ 
volunteers took part in 75 training sessions in a 
variety of schools across the country. We also 
formed partnerships with local schools to provide  
CV writing, confidence building and interview skills, 
and importantly, introduce students to the many 
career opportunities in the food and drink sector.
Collaborating with our suppliers  
to drive higher standards
Whatever we buy, it’s important we understand the 
impact the product has on the environment, animal 
welfare and the people that produce it. Where it 
makes sense, we look for ingredients certified to 
meet recognised environmental and ethical standards 
whether this be palm oil from producers that meet the 
Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) criteria, 
egg products that are certified from cage-free hens or 
cardboard boxes and other paper products that meet 
the Forestry Stewardship Council requirements.
Last year we were again recognised by the World 
Wide Fund For Nature (WWF) for our positive action 
to support sustainable palm oil sourcing, scoring top 
marks in WWF’s 2016 Palm Oil Buyers Scorecard. 
We were also commended for our approach to 
farm animal welfare, moving up to the third tier in 
the Business Benchmark on Farm Animal Welfare’s 
annual rankings (from tier 5 two years before) in 
recognition of our commitments and 2025 goals to 
support improved animal welfare.
We also continued to champion high ethical standards 
at our own sites and through our supply chain. For the 
second year running all of our manufacturing sites have 
become Stronger Together 2017 business partners, 
meaning they’ve been recognised for addressing 
modern day slavery and third party exploitation in 
the workplace. We also ask all of our ingredient and 
packaging suppliers to become members of Sedex 
(the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange) supported by our 
own Sedex Member Ethical Data audits covering areas 
such as health & safety and labour rights. At year end, 
more than 94% of our direct spend was covered by 
Sedex registered suppliers (excludes Knighton Foods).

Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 18 Supporting our communities  
on a local and national level
Supporting the communities in which we operate 
locally and nationally is part of the DNA of our 
business and a powerful way to engage our 
colleagues. Since 2015, we’ve collectively raised 
more than £360,000 to support our corporate charity 
partner, Cancer Research UK (CRUK), far exceeding 
our original target of £250,000. 
This has been achieved through numerous fund 
raising activities across the country and with the 
generous support of our suppliers. Last year’s 
highlights included a company-wide charity 
challenge in the Brecon Beacons, which saw 
colleagues either trek 24 miles or cycle 100 miles 
raising an impressive £50,000 in the process and a 
Christmas in-store campaign to raise awareness of 
CRUK’s life-saving work to beat cancer. 
In addition, we won a significant number of awards 
for our Bisto social marketing campaign focused on 
bringing people together and combatting loneliness 
under the banner of the Bisto Together Project. 
This included the Spare Chair Sunday programme 
encouraging people to invite an elderly person to 
Sunday lunch which was expanded during the 
course of the year to the Open Door programme 
encouraging people to get to know their neighbours. 
Delivering environmental improvements 
across our operations
We’re continually looking for ways to improve our 
environmental performance. All colleagues are 
encouraged to play their part through our ‘Green 
Matters’ initiative, an internal environmental campaign 
supported by 54 Environmental Champions across 
our sites. 
During the year we successfully completed the 
certification of all our manufacturing sites (excluding 
Knighton Foods) to meet globally recognised standards 
of environmental management through ISO 14001. 
We also reduced our CO
2
 emissions per tonne in 
eight out of our nine manufacturing sites achieving a 
10.2% reduction in emissions overall compared to the 
previous year as a result of greater efficiency and focus.
Higher production volumes meant our non-ingredient 
water usage was higher in the period although overall 
usage intensity on a per tonne basis reduced by 
3.6% through greater investment in leak prevention 
and improved clean down practices, particularly at 
our bakeries. 
We also maintained our zero waste to landfill 
achievement and further reduced the amount of 
waste sent for incineration by 6.9% as a result of 
improved segregation and awareness. 
The following charts set out our environmental 
performance for the financial period on both a per

Food waste Send zero food waste to landfill from direct operations and beyond and contribute to reducing 
food waste across the whole supply chain from farm to fork, including within our operations.
Packaging Minimise the impact of used packaging associated with food and drink products and encourage 
innovation in packaging technology and design that contributes to overall product sustainability.
Water Deliver continuous improvement in the use of water across the whole supply chain and take 
action to ensure sustainable water management and stewardship.
Contribute to an industry-wide target to reduce water use by 25% by 2020 compared to 2007.
Transport Reduce the environmental impact of our transport operations, whether from own fleet operations  
or third party hauliers, in terms of both carbon intensity and air quality aspects.
Embed a fewer and friendlier food miles approach within food transport practices.

19 STRATEGIC REPORT INTRODUCTION GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Board accountability
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the effective 
risk management of the Group’s strategic objectives. 
The Group has a well-established process which 
has operated throughout the year that identifies and 
monitors the key strategic and operational risks, 
ensures appropriate mitigating activities and reports 
on their effectiveness.
The Board has considered and approved the risk 
management policy, the risk appetite of the Group 
(discussed below) and has delegated the review 
of the risk management process to the Audit 
Committee. The Audit Committee receives regular 
reports from management and internal audit detailing 
the risks that are relevant to our business activity, the 
effectiveness of our internal controls in dealing with 
these risks and any required remedial actions along 
with an update on their implementation.
The Audit Committee reports to the Board on the 
effectiveness of the risk management process. 
Day-to-day risk management is the responsibility 
of senior management as part of their everyday 
business processes and is underpinned by the 
Group’s policies and procedures to ensure this is 
fully embedded.
There is a structured business review process 
that operates across all business areas which 
management report to the Board and this, along 
with the corporate governance framework, further 
underpins the ongoing management of risk.
Management controls
The internal control system provides senior 
management with an ongoing process for the 
management of the risks that could impact on 
the fulfilment of the Group’s business objectives. 
The system is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve our business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable, not 
absolute, assurance against material misstatement. 
Our internal controls cover all areas of operations. 
The system also supports senior management’s 
decision making processes improving the reliability 
of business performance.
Corporate oversight
Risk management – The Group operates a formal 
risk management process designed to provide 
information to the Board, drive internal audit activities 
and support the executive and senior management 
in identifying and mitigating the key risks facing the 
business on an ongoing basis. Collective top down 
executive reviews are conducted, as a minimum 
twice per annum.
Financial control – The Group maintains a strong 
system of accounting and financial management 
controls. Our accounting controls ensure data in the 
Group’s financial statements are reconciled to the 
underlying financial systems. A review of the data is 
undertaken to provide assurance that the position of 
the Group is fairly reflected, through compliance with 
approved accounting practices. 
The Group has a dedicated team of finance 
managers aligned to business areas, supported 
by systems to provide the best available decision 
making information to management on an ongoing 
basis. This is reflected in an annual budgeting 
process, monthly management reporting and 
ongoing investment appraisal.
Treasury risk management committee – This 
Committee focuses on the commodities purchased 
by the Group, reviewing our policies and operational 
delivery with respect to forward trading and foreign 
exchange exposures.
Health & Safety – The Group maintains an ongoing 
programme of Health & Safety audits and has 
established internal Health & Safety compliance 
tours at all factory sites.
Food safety – The Group has developed and 
implemented corporate technical standards and 
established an ongoing food quality and safety 
compliance programme which audits all factory 
sites and major suppliers. This supplements internal 
testing facilities established as part of our internal 
control system which confirm food quality, safety  
and authenticity.
Internal audit
The Audit Committee annually reviews and approves 
the internal audit programme for the year. The 
Committee reviews progress against the plan on a 
quarterly basis considering the adequacy of audit 
resource, the results of audit findings and any 
changes in business circumstances which may 
require additional audits.
The results of internal audits are reported to the 
Executive Leadership Team and senior management 
and where required corrective actions are agreed. 
The results of all audits are summarised for the  
Audit Committee along with progress against  
agreed actions.
Risk appetite
The organisation’s approach is to minimise exposure 
to reputational, financial and operational risk, whilst 
accepting and recognising a risk/reward trade-
off in the pursuit of its strategic and commercial 
objectives. 
As a food manufacturing company, with many well-
known brands, the integrity of the business is crucial 
and cannot be put at risk. Consequently, it has a 
zero tolerance for risks relating to Health & Safety 
and food safety. The business, however, operates 
in a challenging and highly competitive market 
place and as a result it recognises that strategic, 
commercial and investment risks will be required to 
seize opportunities and deliver results at pace.
It is therefore prepared to make certain financial 
and operational investments in pursuit of growth 
objectives, accepting the risk that the anticipated 
benefits from these investments may not always 
be fully realised. Its acceptance of risk is subject to 
ensuring that potential benefits and risks are fully 
understood and sensible measures to mitigate risk 
are established.

Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 20 Changes since last year
The business has reviewed its strategy during the 
year to be more evenly balanced between delivering 
revenue growth, driving cost and efficiency savings 
and cash generation rather than being weighted to 
category and revenue growth. During the financial 
period Grocery revenue growth targets were not 
met largely due to weather impacts and changes in 
major customers' promotional strategies. However, 
we are confident that the latter is a short-term trend 
which will stabilise over the next 12 months. We 
aim to reduce weather impacts in the longer-term 
by prioritising product innovations which are less 
sensitive to, or benefit from, warmer weather.
The Group has experienced material input cost 
inflation in the past year. Input costs have also 
been driven up by currency devaluation. The Group 
takes a blended approach to managing these 
cost increases, managing its own efficiencies, 
adjusting promotional mechanics and formats 
where appropriate and finally looking at limited price 
increases where these cannot be avoided.
The focus on cost efficiency has led to an extensive 
cost and efficiency programme, including a 
streamlining of our organisational structure. 
Unfortunately this has also necessitated a number 
of redundancies across commercial and central 
functions. The business will need to manage 
process changes as well as challenges around staff 
engagement and retention in the short-term. A major 
logistics consolidation programme is underway 
which will provide significant cost savings but carries 
some operational risk during the transition.
Since the last report the UK has voted to exit the 
EU and seen a sharp devaluation of Sterling and 
cyclical cost inflation. This has adversely impacted 
commodity prices which makes our products more 
expensive to produce. 
A number of risks highlighted in our previous report 
have reduced in likelihood and/or impact. We have 
recently signed a non-binding Heads of Terms to 
be a Strategic Global Partner with Mondelez for 
Cadbury cake. Trading performance at our Hovis 
Joint Venture has improved. Negotiations on the 
2016 pension fund revaluations have been positive, 
resulting in reduced cash outflows until March 
2020. We are also starting to see positive outcomes 
from our collaboration with Nissin, including the 
successful launch of our Batchelors Super Noodles 
product in a pot format. 
In addition the Group has extended the term of its 
revolving credit facility with its lending syndicate from 
March 2019 to December 2020. The Group has also 
announced the proposed issue of a new five year 
£210m Senior Secured floating rate notes due 2022, 
to replace its £175m Senior Secured floating rate 
notes, due to mature March 2020.
Summary of major strategic & 
operational risks 
We have focused on six key strategic risks which 
pose the greatest threat to the delivery of our 
strategy. We have also highlighted a number of 
operational risks which we believe are common  
to all food manufacturers under the headings; 
Operational continuity and Legal compliance.  
These risks are identified on the heat map below and 
are described in more detail on pages 22 and 23, 
together with a discussion of the mitigating activities 
we are taking to reduce the likelihood or potential 
impact of these risks. Our website also contains a 
more detailed discussion of operational risks seven 
and eight below.

21 STRATEGIC REPORT INTRODUCTION GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT
Managing our risks continued
Strategic risks Mitigating activities
1. Delivery of Strategy
Our revenue growth strategy is taking longer than anticipated to deliver and the 
business has reviewed its strategy with a more balanced focus on revenue, cost 
efficiency and cash generation. Marketing spend is targeted at certain key brands 
and consequently there will be parts of our portfolio that receive only modest 
marketing investment and support. We expect that some of the categories in which 
we operate will continue their current trend of decline and so the delivery of our 
growth strategy is dependent on us growing share in our markets and aligning our 
product portfolio with consumer trends. This needs to be delivered through effective 
innovation and marketing activity. 
2. Corporate risks
During 2017 the Group has renegotiated elements of its debt capital structure. 
Capital availability may be impacted by market trends which are outside the Group's 
control e.g. US interest rate volatility and global political uncertainty. The Group's 
pension fund deficit also remains a significant risk due to the materiality of the liability 
on the balance sheet. 
Deficit payments post 2019 are subject to the outcome of the 2019 actuarial 
revaluation and if the pension schemes underperform over this period there is a 
risk that requested contributions become unaffordable. In certain circumstances 
(such as significant corporate events or the disposal of certain businesses) the 
RHM Trustees have the capability to exercise enhanced powers (including in 
respect of funding). 
3. Commodity prices / Foreign exchange (FX)
Commodity prices have undergone significant increases driven by Brexit, indirect FX 
impacts and cyclical cost inflation. There is a risk of further unbudgeted commodity 
inflation or sterling devaluation against the Euro. This could impact margins and/or our 
ability to invest in other areas of the business such as marketing or capital expenditure.
4. Weather 
The business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and lacks a warm weather product 
portfolio. This, along with changes to customer promotional strategy, was a 
contributory factor to recent trading performance issues. Initiatives to de-seasonalise 
our portfolio will only have a material effect over the longer-term. Longer-term climate 
change patterns could also undermine our business model if the product portfolio 
does not evolve over this period.
We are continuing to invest in our core brands. There are no changes to our 
investment strategy for International and the collaboration initiatives with Nissin, 
which are both delivering strong results. We have excellent relationships in place with 
the major retailers through our strategy of supporting customer growth, providing 
new shopper insights and exclusive customer ranges. As a result we have been 
able to outperform the market in many of our categories. The results of retailer 
range reviews have been positive and a number of de-listed products are now back 
in store. We also have strong non-branded offerings in place and are growing our 
convenience, online and international businesses which reduces our dependence  
on the major retailers. 
We have strong relationships in place with our banking group and have now 
extended the maturity of our revolving credit facility and announced the proposed 
issue of a new 5 year floating rate note due 2022.
Our executive directors are actively engaged with the pension trustees on scheme 
funding and investment matters and we have engaged Mercer to assist in formal 
dialogue with the trustees over the risk profile of the RHM scheme. An integrated 
risk management review has been initiated with the major UK schemes following the 
2016 valuation and the Premier Foods pension scheme has an agreed de-risking 
programme in place. We have negotiated reduced pension payment contributions 
until March 2020 and as a result total cash payments will be approximately £32m 
lower than outlined in our Interim Results on 15 November 2016 (see page 15 for a 
breakdown of scheduled payments).
Hedging activity and ongoing supplier risk management is in place to mitigate the 
impact of commodity price and FX driven inflation. Initiatives to mitigate inflation 
through price increases, cost efficiencies and supply chain optimisation are well 
advanced. We have also undertaken a restructuring of the business to significantly 
reduce our SG&A expenditure, effective from 2017/18.
We are continuing to preferentially invest in programmes to de-seasonalise our 
Grocery product portfolio. The Sweet Treats side of the business is also less 
sensitive to weather fluctuations. In the long-term, the growth of our International 
business will also help to reduce our dependence on cold weather focused 
categories in Grocery.

5. Commercial arrangements
The delivery of our strategic objectives is dependent on strong 
relationships with key customers, suppliers and distributors. A 
number of our brands are licensed; in respect of our use of the 
Cadbury brand our agreement is now operating on a rolling 12 month 
notice period and consequently we are in advanced discussions 
to secure a longer-term arrangement. In addition our licensing 
agreement with Loyd Grossman includes performance targets. 
The business is undergoing a major transformation of its logistics 
operations which will combine the existing Grocery and Sweet Treats 
warehousing and distribution activities under a single supplier. This is 
expected to deliver significant long-term cost savings but gives rise 
to some operational risks during the transition period and will result in 
dependence on a single supplier and site for operations.
7. Operational continuity
Delivery of our strategy is dependent on the organisation’s ability 
to minimise operational disruption from issues with facilities, IT and 
factory infrastructure, as well as procurement and logistics functions.
8. Legal compliance
The business is subject to a number of legal and regulatory 
compliance requirements and must continually monitor new and 
emerging legislation, in areas such as Health & Safety, the listing 
regime, competition law, food safety, labelling regulations and 
environmental standards.
6. Business restructuring
The business has recently restructured its commercial and central 
functions in order to deliver cost savings. This may result in loss of 
experience and capability in certain parts of the business, particularly 
at a senior level. There are also some short-term risks around our 
ability to maintain staff engagement and retain key talent. There may 
also be continuity and succession planning issues for certain roles, as 
individual responsibilities are combined and expanded. 
The Group has recently signed non-binding Heads of Terms to be a Strategic Global Partner with 
Mondelez for Cadbury cake. Once finalised, this agreement will extend the Group’s long standing 
partnership for another five years with the option to the Group of extending this for an additional 
three years. Additionally, the licence will cover a total of 46 countries with the potential to use other 
brands in the Cadbury family. The Loyd Grossman brand is well set for growth with a strong pipeline 
of NPD, including a new range of premium pouch sauces, Indian sauces and desserts. 
The logistics consolidation programme is being managed through a strong project governance 
framework including transition planning and risk management activities. The supplier contract has 
been agreed following appropriate due diligence checks and effective contractual protections are 
in place. 
We have crisis management processes in place and business continuity plans are reviewed and 
refreshed on an ongoing basis. The financial impact of material site issues is mitigated by insurance cover. 
Operational control over sites has been consolidated with one senior manager providing a consistent level 
of discipline. Knighton Foods has been reintegrated into the business, providing stronger commercial 
and operational control. This has been further enhanced through the implementation of SAP in 2016/17 . 
Systems resilience is built in through the deployment of dual data centres and has been enhanced following 
the completion of a re-hosting initiative in 2016. Greater operational efficiency will be introduced to our 
Logistics function through the warehousing and distribution consolidation programme over the next two 
years. Procurement category strategy plans are in place to monitor and mitigate risk around key suppliers.
Leading food industry processes are in place to manage Health & Safety and food safety issues, 
including an ongoing programme of internal and external audits. There are dedicated Legal 
and Regulatory teams in place to monitor changes in legislation, ensure compliance across the 
organisation and defend against litigation where necessary.
The restructuring of roles has been completed swiftly to provide clarity to colleagues. Certain areas 
of the business such as International and the graduate teams, as well as operational sites, have not 
been impacted. The business will continue to invest in staff development and engagement initiatives 
on a focused basis. The new structure will also reduce 'silos' in the business and enable more 
cross-divisional activities and staff development opportunities.

Dear shareholder,
We believe that good corporate 
governance is essential for building a 
successful and sustainable business in 
the long-term interests of shareholders. 
An effective governance framework is also 
designed to ensure accountability, fairness 
and transparency in the Company’s 
relationships with all of its stakeholders 
whether customers, suppliers, employees, 
the government or the wider community. 
Areas of focus in the year
Over the year the Board has reviewed the 
Group's three year strategic plan in light of 
the changing commercial environment. The 
Board has regularly reviewed new product 
development and customer relations.
In addition the Board undertook an 
external evaluation exercise, a detailed 
review of risks facing the business and has 
received regular updates on shareholder 
communication.
Compliance with the UK 
Governance Code 2014 
The Board supports the principles laid down 
by the UK Governance Code 2014 (the Code) 
as issued by the Financial Reporting Council 
which applies for the financial year ended  
1 April 2017 (available at www.frc.org.uk).  
Subject to not all directors being able to 
attend the 2016 AGM (as outlined under 
Board Attendance) I am pleased to confirm 
that over the course of the year we complied 
with all the provisions of the Code.
AGM
Our AGM will again be held at the offices 
of Gowling WLG (UK) LLP, 4 More London 
Riverside, London, SE1 2AU on Thursday 
20 July 2017 at 11.00 am and I look forward 
to seeing you then.
David Beever
Chairman 
16 May 2017
Board tenure
The average appointment of 
our non-executive directors is 
3.6 years. Tenure of individual 
appointments can be seen 
in the adjacent graph. Our 
Board evaluation determines 
if individual directors continue 
to be effective and considers if 
new appointments are needed 
to refresh the balance of skills on 
the Board.
Board independence
Under the Code at least half the 
Board, excluding the Chairman, 
should comprise non-executive 
directors determined by the 
Board to be independent. The 
Chairman was considered 
independent on appointment. 
Tsunao Kijima and Daniel 
Wosner were both appointed 
pursuant to Relationship 
Agreements with our 
shareholders Nissin and Oasis, 
respectively and, whilst fully 
independent of management, 
are not considered independent 
under the Code.
Board attendance
The Board held nine scheduled Board 
meetings during the year and a number of other 
meetings and calls were convened for specific 
business. In addition there were three meetings 
of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees during the year. All directors are 
expected to attend the AGM, scheduled Board 
meetings and relevant Committee meetings, 
unless they are prevented from doing so by 
prior commitments. Where a director is unable 
to attend a meeting they have the opportunity 
to read the papers and ask the Chairman to 
raise any comments. They are also updated on 
the key discussions and decisions which were 
taken at the meeting. Non-executive directors 
also have the opportunity to meet without 
management present. 
Details of Board and Committee membership 
and attendance at scheduled Board and 
Committee meetings are set out in the table 
below. Tsunao Kijima was unable to attend 
two Board meetings and the AGM (held on 
the same day) for personal reasons and Pam 
Powell missed one meeting due to illness. 
David Beever absented himself from meetings 
of the Nomination Committee which discussed 
the Chairman succession process. All 
directors, except Tsunao Kijima, attended the 
2016 AGM.

STRATEGIC REPORT INTRODUCTION GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 25 Corporate governance 
The UK Governance Code 2014 (the Code) states 
that the purpose of corporate governance is to 
facilitate effective, entrepreneurial and prudent 
management that can deliver the long-term 
success of the company. The Board of directors is 
responsible for the governance of the Company. The 
shareholders’ role in governance is to appoint the 
directors and the auditor and to satisfy themselves 
that an appropriate governance structure is in place. 
The responsibilities of the Board include setting the 
Company’s strategic aims, providing the leadership 
to put them into effect, supervising the management 
of the business, monitoring performance and 
reporting to shareholders on their stewardship. 
Board Committees 
The Board delegates responsibility for the oversight 
of Board composition, financial performance, internal 
controls and remuneration strategy to its three 
Committees. Their terms of reference are available 
on the Company’s website. Details of the work of the 
Nomination, Audit and Remuneration Committees 
are set out on pages 29, 30 and 35, respectively.
In addition the Board delegates day-to-day 
responsibility for managing the business to the 
Executive Leadership Team ('ELT') and its sub-
committees. The ELT comprises the heads of the 
commercial businesses and key corporate functions. 
The ELT meets monthly and members regularly 
present to the Board. To read more about the work 
of these Committees go to governance section of our 
website www.premierfoods.co.uk/about/governance
Board roles and responsibilities
The Chairman is responsible for the leadership of the 
Board and ensuring its effectiveness and promoting 
the highest standards of corporate governance. He 
chairs Board meetings ensuring timely and accurate 
distribution of information and full review and 
discussions of agenda items. The CEO is responsible 
for the day-to-day management of the Company 
working with the ELT to ensure the implementation of 
the agreed strategy. The Senior Independent Director 
(SID) supports the Chairman and leads the non-
executive directors in the oversight of the Chairman 
and CEO. He is also available to shareholders if they 
have concerns that cannot be raised through normal 
channels. Further information on these roles can be 
found on our website.
Director appointments
The Board has the power to appoint one or more 
additional directors. Under the Articles any such 
director holds office until the next AGM when they 
are eligible for election. Shareholders may appoint, 
re-appoint or remove, directors by an ordinary 
resolution. In accordance with the Code all our 
directors offer themselves for re-election every 
year. In addition, the appointments of Tsunao Kijima 
and Daniel Wosner are subject to the terms of 
shareholder Relationship Agreements (see Conflicts 
of interest below).
Conflicts of interest
The Group has procedures in place for managing 
conflicts of interest and directors have continuing 
obligations to update the Board on any changes 
to these conflicts. This process includes relevant 
disclosure at the beginning of each Board meeting 
and also the Group’s annual formal review of 
potential conflict situations which includes the use 
of a questionnaire. 
Under our Relationship Agreement with Nissin 
they are entitled to nominate an individual for 
appointment to the Board so long as they retain 
an interest in shares in the Company representing 
15% of issued share capital. Under our Relationship 
Agreement with Oasis they are entitled to nominate 
an individual for appointment to the Board so long 
as they retain an interest in shares in the Company 
representing 7% of issued share capital. During the 
period ended 1 April 2017 no other director had 
a material interest at any time in any contract of 
significance with the Company or Group other than 
their service contract.
Induction 
All directors receive a tailored induction on joining 
the Board covering their duties and responsibilities 
as directors. Non-executive directors also receive 
a full briefing document on all key areas of the 
Group’s business and they may request further 
information as they consider necessary. A typical 
non-executive director induction would include 
meetings with the ELT and key management, site 
visits and an induction and governance pack.
Board information
The main source of information is via the Board 
pack which is designed to keep directors up-to-
date with all material business developments in 
advance of Board meetings. In addition training on 
specific issues is provided as and when required. 
Non-executive directors also meet with senior 
management outside of Board meetings to discuss 
specific areas of interest in more detail e.g. brand 
and marketing plans, customer strategy and pension 
investment strategy The Board pack generally 
contains the following standing items:
• CEO introduction;
• H&S and employee issues;
• Commercial updates;
• New product development;
• Customer service levels; 
• Operations
• Strategic projects; 
• Capital expenditure; 
• CFO report;
• Legal report;
• Investor Relations; and 
• Treasury Report. 
Board and Committee Evaluation
During the financial period an externally facilitated 
board effectiveness review was undertaken 
by Springboard Associates (an independent 
consultancy firm with no other connection to the 
Group). Springboard had previously carried out 
an effectiveness review of the Board in 2013 and 
consequently were able to provide insights on how 
well Board and Committee practices had evolved 
since that time.
Scope of the review 
The scope of the review included a review of Board 
and Committee papers and individual meetings 
with directors and senior management which took 
place in confidence, with Springboard noting that 
all participants engaged willingly and expressed 
their views openly. Springboard then attended, as 
observers, a main Board meeting, plus an Audit and a 
Remuneration Committee meeting. A comprehensive 
report of their findings and resulting recommendations 
was presented at a subsequent Board meeting. 
GOVERNANCE
Governance
Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 26 Overview of findings
It was noted that the Company had been through 
a significant period of change since 2013 with 
some transformational events such as a major 
refinancing and disposal of the Hovis business 
into a Joint Venture. Good progress had been 
made in addressing the recommendations of the 
2013 effectiveness review and subsequent internal 
evaluations in 2014 and 2015 had built further on 
some of the key findings and actions. 
During this period there had been a strong focus 
on developing a well-defined and robust strategy, 
underpinned by detailed and comprehensive 
budget plans. Board papers were generally felt to 
be comprehensive and well prepared with increased 
focus on streamlining the process with clear 
executive summaries. The composition of the non-
executive directors was considered satisfactory with 
a reasonable balance of skills and diversity. 
During their individual meetings with directors 
Springboard questioned Board processes during 
the bid approach from McCormick & Company 
Inc. in March 2016 and noted that the Board had 
met regularly and it felt that it had been fully briefed 
throughout (including with their external advisory 
team), enabling it to respond quickly, decisively and 
proactively to events.  
Summary of actions for 2017/18
Strategy
It was noted that during the evaluation, the Board 
was actively looking to 'rebalance' its strategic focus 
in the light of significant currency depreciation follow 
the EU referendum result and the cyclical inflationary 
environment that was impacting the food industry.
Board challenge and focus
There was consensus that time was frequently short 
and should be optimised for rigorous discussion of 
the key strategic challenges, priorities and choices 
facing the business. Board papers and presentations 
should continue to focus on the key issues with even 
greater use of precise executive summaries.
Post evaluation reviews
Post evaluation investment reviews take place  
on an ad hoc basis and it was agreed that these 
reviews should be formalised and built into the 
annual Board agenda.
Review of non-executive director 
performance
Over the course of the year, the Chairman 
reviewed the performance of the non-executive 
directors including: attendance; preparation for 
and contribution at meetings; their knowledge and 
understanding of the business; and any training and 
development requirements. 
Following this review it was agreed that the Board 
has an appropriate balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge of the Company to 
enable them to discharge their respective duties 
and responsibilities effectively. It was concluded that 
each non-executive director continued to make an 
effective contribution to the Board and consequently 
the Nomination Committee recommended the re-
election of all directors at the 2017 AGM. 
Assessment of Chairman’s 
performance
The Chairman's performance was reviewed as part 
of the external Board evaluation process. Following 
the review the Board concluded that David Beever 
continued to perform an effective role as Chairman, 
had no other significant external commitments and 
was able to dedicate sufficient time to the role.
Shareholders and other  
stakeholders
Shareholders
An important role of the Board is to represent and 
promote the interests of its shareholders as well as 
being accountable to them for the performance and 
activities of the Group. 
The Board believes it is very important to engage 
with its shareholders and does this in a number 
of ways through presentations, conference calls, 
investor road shows, face-to-face meetings and the 
AGM. Following the announcement of the Group’s 
half year and year end results, presentations are 
made to analysts, banks and major shareholders to 
update them on the progress the Group has made 
towards its goals and invite them to ask questions. 
An Investor Relations report is prepared for each 
Board meeting to update the directors on feedback 
from shareholders and analysts and changes in the 
shareholder register. Currently around six equity 
research analysts publish research on the Group. 
Copies of press releases, investor presentations, 
webcasts, conference calls and Fact Sheets are 
available on the Group’s website.
An Investor Day is held most years to provide 
investors and analysts with a more detailed insight 
into the business. This year the event was held at our 
Ambrosia Creamery in Lifton and was attended by 
the Chairman, CEO, CFO and senior management. 
This focused on the Grocery business; in particular 
the Desserts strategy, new product development and 
operational capability.
The Chairman, Senior Independent Director and 
Remuneration Committee chair each held meetings 
with a number of shareholders over the period to 
discuss governance and remuneration issues. 
The main channels of communication with private 
shareholders are via this annual report, our website

27 STRATEGIC REPORT INTRODUCTION GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Other stakeholders
Bondholders
Management hold conference calls with holders 
of the Group's Senior Secured Notes following the 
release of half year and full year results. Additionally, 
management attend bond investor conferences at 
least twice a year. 
Pensions
Premier management attend the Trustee and 
Investment Committee meetings for each of the 
pension schemes, at which funding and investment 
matters are monitored and discussed. The Company 
also regularly reports on the Group's trading 
performance. Additional ad hoc meetings have 
been held this year in order to finalise the funding 
arrangements following the 2016 actuarial valuations.
Banks
Regular updates are provided to the Group’s 
current banking syndicate on the Group’s  
financial performance.
Suppliers
The Group works with over 1,200 active suppliers 
and develops close partnerships with its key 
suppliers to deliver mutual benefit. 89% of products 
we purchase are from UK based suppliers and our 
top 250 suppliers now account for in excess of 90% 
of our total spend on the goods and services that 
we purchase. 
We have an online supplier innovation portal which 
seeks to leverage our suppliers’ unique capabilities 
and strengths to feed into our product development 
pipeline with the aim of creating new products which 
will drive growth in both our businesses. Since 
launching in September 2014 our suppliers have 
presented more than 318 ideas through the portal, 
of which a number have now been launched into the 
market place.
The Group conducts an annual 'Voice of the 
Supplier' survey with suppliers to help maintain 
and strengthen supplier relationships, listen to their 
feedback and benchmark progress. In 2016, our 
anonymous survey was sent to our top 500 suppliers 
representing over 96% of our total spend. 
Of those suppliers who responded, 100% of strategic 
suppliers confirmed our relationship was ‘Good’ or 
‘Very Good’, with 90% of suppliers who are SMEs 
(Small or Medium Sized Enterprises) saying Premier 
Foods was a ‘Customer of Choice’. The outcome 
of this survey was discussed at our annual Supplier 
Conference, this forum being a key method to 
communicate with our suppliers and to update them 
on the Group's strategy and growth plans.
Colleagues
The Group is committed to ensuring that the people 
who work for us are treated with respect, and that 
their health, safety and basic human rights are 
protected and promoted. 
Communication and engagement
The Group recognises the value of good 
communication in engaging our colleagues to 
achieve common goals. Our suite of communications 
channels include large digital news screens at every 
site, our mobile-enabled intranet, monthly printed 
and digital newspaper, weekly news round-up email 
and posters. We also video stream our CEO-led 
monthly briefing sessions directly to all sites in 
addition to cascading through local briefings. We 
continued to encourage colleagues to engage with 
their local communities through supporting local 
charities and by fund-raising for our corporate 
charity partnership with Cancer Research UK. Senior 
management road shows were held at all sites. In 
addition, we consult colleagues where appropriate 
on major changes to the business, and with most 
colleagues being shareholders, we encourage them 
to vote in advance of our AGM.
Health & Safety
Health & Safety is taken extremely seriously by 
management at all levels in the Group, and we are 
proud to have one of the lowest accident rates in 
the food industry. Our unique, inclusive approach 
to hazard identification and control, our ‘Total 
Observation Process’, is a vital preventative tool in 
making our factories safer places to work and is a 
key ingredient of our industry leading performance 
as indicated by the chart below.
Premier Foods Health & Safety record 
(as at 1 April 2017)
RIDDOR 
The Board reviews Health & Safety performance at 
every scheduled Board meeting, this includes two 
important measures; Lost Time Accidents (LTA), 
which represent accidents that result in a colleague 
having to take any time off work and Reporting of 
Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences 
Regulations (RIDDOR) which is the standard 
regulatory measure of identifiable, unintended 
incidents, which cause physical injury.
LTAs
Our Safety Leadership Plus programme has been 
successful in improving safety at sites and has 
increased engagement across our factories, which 
has helped to further reduce the LTA rate. In addition, 
our Behavioural Safety programme is now being 
rolled out at each site to ensure safety is embedded 
at all levels.

On behalf of your Board, I am pleased to present the 
Nomination Committee report for the period ended 1 
April 2017. The Committee is responsible for: 
• considering the size, structure and composition 
of the Board; 
• leading the formal, rigorous and transparent 
process for the appointment of directors; 
• making appointment recommendations so as 
to maintain an appropriate balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience on the Board; and
• ensuring a formal and rigorous Board and

Board evaluation 
Details of the external Board and Committee 
evaluation that was carried out in the period and the 
review of non-executive performance is set out on 
pages 26 and 27.
Board balance and diversity 
When selecting a new director the Board considers 
a broad range of skills, backgrounds and experience 
reflecting both the type of industry and the 
geographical locations in which we operate. In 2011 
the Board adopted a policy to have at least two 
female Board directors by 2015 and this target was 
successfully achieved in May 2013. 
The Committee is also mindful of the benefits that 
an inclusive culture can bring to our organisation 
as a whole. We have strengthened our approach 
with the introduction of a new Diversity & Equality 
action plan which was approved by the Board in 
March 2017. In addition, a diversity working group has 
been established, which will formalise the Group’s 
diversity reporting and KPIs and make sure we are fully 
prepared for the requirement to report on gender pay 
(which comes into force in 2018). 
The Group's aim is to create a work environment 
that promotes equality, dignity and respect for all 
colleagues when it comes to promotion, progression, 
training and development and when we select 
candidates for employment.
Details of our gender diversity across the Board of 
directors, senior management, central functions and 
the Group as at 1 April 2017 are set out below.

29 STRATEGIC REPORT INTRODUCTION GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Dear shareholder,
On behalf of your Board, I am pleased to present 
the Audit Committee report for the period ended 
1 April 2017. The Committee has responsibility, on 
behalf of the Board, for reviewing the effectiveness 
of the Company’s financial reporting systems and 
the internal control policies and procedures for the 
identification, assessment and reporting of risk.
The Committee also keeps under review the 
relationship with the external auditor, including 
the terms of their engagement and fees, their 
independence and expertise, resources and 
qualification, and the effectiveness of the audit process. 
The Committee met with the internal and external 
auditor on three occasions in the year without the 
presence of management. Committee membership 
and meeting attendance is set out on page 24. 
I was appointed as Audit Committee Chairman 
in April 2013 following my retirement as a senior 
partner of Deloitte in 2012. All members of the 
Committee are considered to be independent, with 
a broad range of FMCG, commercial and marketing 
experience relevant to the Group's business. The 
qualifications of Committee members are set out on 
page 25. In addition to the Committee members the 
CEO, CFO, Director of Internal Audit and Risk and 
external audit lead partner are regularly invited to the 
Committee’s meetings. 
Areas of review
During the financial period the Committee:
• Monitored financial reporting, including the annual 
report and the full year, half year and quarterly 
results announcements;
• Considered the viability statement for the Group 
which can be found on page 33;
• Approved a new policy on external auditor 
independence and non-audit services;
• Conducted a review of the external auditor's 
effectiveness;
• Received regular reports from the internal audit 
function, ensured it was adequately resourced, 
monitored its activities and effectiveness, and 
agreed the annual internal audit plan; and
• Received updates on calls received from the 
whistle blowing helpline and on the Group’s 
Speaking Up policy.
Auditor appointment, independence 
and non-audit services
KPMG were appointed as external auditor in 
September 2015 following a comprehensive tender 
process. During the period the Audit Committee 
reviewed and approved a new policy on external 
auditor independence and non-audit services. This 
was to bring the Group's current policy into line with 
the EU Regulation and Statutory Audit Directive which 
came into force in June 2016 and encompasses audit 
firm rotation and restrictions on non-audit services. 
The restrictions on non-audit services will not fully 
impact the Group until the financial period 2020/21, in 
the intervening period non-audit spend up to £100k 
must be approved by the Audit Committee chairman 
and spend in excess of £100k requires approval by the 
full Audit Committee. A copy of the policy is available 
to view on the Group's website: www.premierfoods.
co.uk/about/governance.
In accordance with our Auditor Independence 
Policy the Committee has continued to review the 
level of non-audit fees with management during 
the year. The Committee also received an update 
from KPMG’s lead partner on the internal controls 
which they employ to safeguard their independence, 
integrity and objectivity.
The Group has undergone a very significant 
transformation over the last few years as management 
have implemented the turnaround of the business. 
This had resulted in the external auditor being 
engaged to perform a number of non-audit services. 
Now that the business has returned to a more stable 
footing I am pleased to see that the level of non-audit 
fees has reduced significantly. Non-audit fees for the 
period were £20,221 (2014/15: £120,032) representing 
5% of the audit fee. 
Committee effectiveness
An external Board and Committee evaluation was 
carried out in the period (see pages 26 and 27).
External audit effectiveness
Given that KPMG were newly appointed during 
the period ended 2 April 2016, it was deemed 
appropriate to defer the review of their effectiveness 
until the completion of the 2015/16 audit cycle. 
Accordingly an effectiveness review was carried out 
in September 2016. This was conducted by way of a 
questionnaire sent to the Audit Committee members 
and management involved in the audit process. 
The review concluded that KPMG had performed 
well and delivered a highly effective service. A good 
working relationship had been established with clear 
communication and appropriate focus on material 
issues. A number of areas for development were 
identified and these were incorporated into the 
Audit plan for the period ended 1 April 2017. The 
Committee has therefore concluded that KPMG 
provide an effective audit service.
Risk management
Details of our risk management process are set out 
in the risk management section on pages 20 to 21. 
Internal controls
In accordance with the FRC guidance on audit 
committees an annual review of internal controls is 
conducted. The Board has delegated authority to 
the Audit Committee to regularly monitor internal 
controls and conduct the full annual review. This 
review covers all material controls such as financial, 
operational and compliance, and also the overall risk 
management system in place throughout the year 
under review up to the date of this annual report. 
The Committee reports the results of this review 
to the Board for discussion and, when necessary, 
agreement on the actions required to address 
any material control weaknesses. The Committee 
confirms that it has not been advised of any failings 
or breaches which it considers to be significant 
during the financial period and found the internal 
controls to be effective.

Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 30 Internal Audit effectiveness
The effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit 
function is reviewed on an annual basis. The review 
was conducted with the Committee and the ELT and 
covered the function’s independence, resource, the 
scope of the annual audit plan, the reports issued 
and the identification of issues. In addition, feedback 
from post completion questionnaires for internal 
audits undertaken during the period were also 
reviewed. The Committee concluded that the internal 
audit function remained effective.
Fair, balanced and understandable
The Board requested that the Audit Committee 
confirm whether the annual report and accounts taken 
as a whole were fair, balanced and understandable 
and whether it provided the necessary information 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy. The Audit Committee 
recommended that the Board make this statement 
which is set out on page 34.
In making this recommendation the Committee 
considered the process for preparing the annual 
report which included regular cross functional 
reviews from the teams responsible for preparing the 
different sections of the report, senior management 
review and verification of the factual contents. 
It also considered the balance and consistency 
of information, the disclosure of risk and the key 
messages presented in the report. 
Significant issues in relation to the 
financial statements 
The Committee considered the following significant 
issues in relation to the financial statements with 
management and the internal and external auditor 
during the year:
Commercial arrangements
Commercial payments to customers in the form of 
rebates and discounts represent significant balances 
in the income statement and balance sheet. 
Calculations of these balances require management 
assumptions and estimates. In the previous financial 
period the Group introduced an integrated SAP 
solution to its commercial functions which helped 
reduce complexity and improve management 
of trade promotions. The Committee reviewed 
the assumptions and estimates and the level of 
accruals and provisions in detail. The Committee 
also reviewed management’s internal processes 
and controls. During the financial period internal 
audit conducted a review of trade promotions to 
assess planning, analysis of profitability, approval, 
data entry and post evaluation reviews. In addition 
commercial arrangements for the Knighton business 
were also reviewed by the internal audit team as a 
part of a wider review of financial controls following 
the acquisition of the business in the financial period. 
Further information is set out in note 3.3 on page 67. 
Carrying value of goodwill and brands
Goodwill and brands represent a significant item on 
the balance sheet and their valuation is based on 
future business plans whose outcome is uncertain. 
The value of goodwill is reviewed annually by 
management and the Committee and brands are 
reviewed where there is an indicator of impairment. 
The impairment testing for goodwill and brands is 
based on a number of key assumptions which relies 
on management judgement. 
The brands, trademarks and licences are deemed 
to be individual CGUs. For the purpose of goodwill, 
the Group has four CGUs - Grocery, Sweet Treats, 
International and Knighton. The Committee reviewed 
the results of impairment testing of the CGUs. The 
entire carrying value of goodwill in the Sweet Treats 
CGU was written off in a prior financial period 
and the International business has no goodwill or 
intangible assets. The results of the impairment 
testing included management’s assumptions in 
respect of cash flows, long-term growth rates and 
discount rates. The Committee also considered 
sensitivities to changes in assumptions and related 
disclosure as required by IAS 36. This year’s review 
concluded that whilst headroom had reduced, 
reflecting the fall in revenue and profit in the financial 
period, no impairment was required. Further 
information is set out in notes 12 and 13 on pages 
77 to 79.
Defined benefit pension plans
The Group operates a number of defined benefit 
schemes. The main schemes are closed to future 
accrual but hold substantial assets and liabilities. 
Valuation of the scheme liabilities is based on a 
number of assumptions such as inflation, discount 
rates and mortality rates, each of which could have 
a material impact on the valuation under IAS 19 
included in the balance sheet. The Group’s RHM 
Pension Scheme also holds assets for which quoted 
prices are not available. On a combined basis the net 
IAS19 valuation reported a surplus of £104.8m as at 
1 April 2017 (2015/16: surplus of £130.9m), largely 
driven by the fall in the discount rate on corporate 
bond yields. The Committee reviewed the basis for 
management’s assumptions and the movements 
in the IAS 19 valuation in detail over the year. With 
the exception of the discount rate, the financial 
assumptions were based on the same methodology 
as last year. The change in the discount rate 
methodology was reviewed and it was concluded 
that it was appropriate and the assumptions 
were within the acceptable market range. Further 
information is set out in note 23 on pages 93 to 98. 
Deferred tax assets
A deferred tax asset is an asset on a Group’s 
balance sheet, which may be used to reduce future 
taxable income. Valuation of the asset involves a 
number of assumptions including forecasts of future 
taxable profits and growth rates and an assessment 
of historic forecasts. The current year asset of 
£32.4m was in line with £25.9m in 2015/16 as the 
Group continued to have a net pension surplus. The 
Committee will continue to keep under review any 
tax volatility between the income statement and 
other comprehensive income and management’s 
policy relating to the order in which deferred tax 
assets are recognised. Further information is set out 
in note 8 on pages 72 to 74.

Other statutory information
Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 32 Access to external advice
Directors are allowed to take independent 
professional advice in the course of their duties. 
In addition, all directors have access to the advice 
and services of the Company Secretary. If any 
director were to have a concern over any unresolved 
business issue following professional advice, they 
are entitled to require the Company Secretary to 
minute that concern. Should they later resign over 
a concern, non-executive directors are asked to 
provide a written statement to the Chairman for 
circulation to the Board.
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
reporting
The Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013 requires quoted 
companies to report on environmental matters 
to the extent it is necessary for an understanding 
of the company’s business within their annual 
report, including where appropriate the use of key 
performance indicators (KPIs). In the table below we 
have detailed our scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions for the 
period 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016 from 
a 2011 baseline year. While the financial year end 
of the Company has changed from 31 December, 
the regulations permit environmental reporting 
for a period outside of a company’s financial year. 
The figures for both 2016 and 2015 include the 
performance of Knighton Foods and the 2015 
figures have been restated accordingly. The intensity 
increases over the 2011 base year have arisen from 
the divestment of low energy use/high production 
tonnage sites, such as flour mills.

Methodology
Premier Foods’ GHG emissions were assessed and 
calculated using internal data and emission factors 
from Defra’s Conversion Factors for Company 
Reporting 2016 for converting energy usage to 
carbon dioxide equivalent (CO
2
(e)) emissions. 
We have followed the methodology in the GHG 
Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard (revised edition). The analysis has used an 
operational control approach. This assessment takes 
into account all of the emission sources required 
under the Companies Act 2006. The emissions data 
relates to all production sites within the control of the 
Company during the period. 
Employment of disabled persons
It’s our policy to give full and fair consideration to 
applications for employment received from disabled 
persons, having regard to their particular aptitudes 
and abilities. Wherever possible we will continue the 
employment of, and arrange appropriate training 
for, employees who have become disabled persons 
during the period of their employment. The Group 
provides the same opportunities for training, career 
development and promotion for disabled people as 
for other colleagues.
Political donations
The Company's policy is not to make political 
donations and no such donations were made in  
the financial period.
Financial Risk Management
Details relating to financial risk management in relation 
to the use of financial instruments by the Group can 
be found in note 21 of the financial statements.
Going concern 
The directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Company and Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the next 
12 months and therefore continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the consolidated 
financial statements. Further information on the 
basis of preparation is set out in note 2.1 on pages 
62 and 63.
Viability Statement
In accordance with provision C2.2. of the 2014 
revision of the Code, the directors have assessed 
the prospect of the Company over a longer period 
than the 12 months required by the 'Going Concern' 
provision. The Board conducted this review for 
a period of 3 years, which was selected for the 
following reasons:
• The Group’s detailed strategic review covers a 
three year period.
• The Group’s current financing arrangements are in 
place for the next 3 years and pension deficit cash 
contributions are largely fixed for this period.
The directors’ assessment has been made with 
reference to the Group’s current position and 
prospects, the Group’s strategy, the Board’s risk 
appetite and the Group’s principal risks and how 
these are managed, as detailed in the annual report. 
The Group has reviewed its funding arrangements 
and underlying financial models, including short 
and long-term covenant and headroom positions. It 
has concluded that it would take a significant profit 
reduction to adversely impact funding availability. 
Based on the risk profile of the organisation this 
would require several high impact risks to materialise 
at the same time with minimal mitigation in response, 
which is considered very unlikely. Such an event 
could also be mitigated by reducing Capex and / 
or Consumer Marketing expenditure. The directors 
therefore confirm that they have reasonable 
expectation that the Group will continue to operate 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due, for the next 
three years.

33 STRATEGIC REPORT INTRODUCTION GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
in respect of the Annual Report and 
the financial statements 
The directors are responsible for preparing the 
annual report and the Group and parent company 
financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare 
Group and parent company financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law they are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU 
and applicable law and have elected to prepare the 
parent company financial statements in accordance 
with UK Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework. 
Under company law the directors must not approve 
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs  
of the Group and parent company and of their profit 
or loss for that period. In preparing each of the  
Group and parent company financial statements,  
the directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently; 
•  make judgements and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; 
•  for the Group financial statements, state whether 
they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU; 
•  for the parent company financial statements, state 
whether applicable UK Accounting Standards 
have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the parent 
company financial statements; and 
•  prepare the financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to 
presume that the Group and the parent company 
will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the parent company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time  
the financial position of the parent company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets  
of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors 
are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, 
Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report 
and Corporate Governance Statement that complies 
with that law and those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and financial 
information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement of the 
directors in respect of the annual 
financial report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance 
with the applicable set of accounting standards, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the directors’ report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the issuer and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
We consider the annual report and accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.
Independent auditor
KPMG LLP (‘KPMG’) `have indicated their willingness 
to be re-appointed as auditor of the Company. 
Upon recommendation of the Audit Committee the 
re-appointment of KPMG and the setting of their 
remuneration will be proposed at the 2017 AGM.
Auditor and the disclosure of 
information to the auditor
The Companies Act requires directors to provide 
the Company’s auditor with every opportunity 
to take whatever steps and undertake whatever 
inspections they consider to be appropriate for the 
purpose of enabling them to give their audit report. 
The directors, having made appropriate enquiries, 
confirm that:
• so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s auditor 
are unaware; and
• he/she has taken all the steps that he ought to 
have taken as a director in order to make himself/
herself aware of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the Company’s auditor are aware 
of that information.

Directors’ Remuneration report
Committee Chairman’s Letter
Dear shareholder,
On behalf of your Board, I am pleased to present  
the Directors’ Remuneration report for the period 
ended 1 April 2017.
Overview of remuneration strategy
The focus of our remuneration strategy is on rewarding 
performance – the majority of executive remuneration 
(approximately 70% at maximum) is variable and only 
payable if demanding performance targets are met. 
The performance measures are firmly linked to our 
strategy and ultimately aligned with shareholders’ 
interests to deliver earnings growth and improved 
shareholder value in the medium-term. The majority of 
variable pay is payable in the form of shares.
Further information on how executive remuneration 
links to our strategy is set out in the table on page 42.
2017 Remuneration Policy
The Committee's main focus over the year has 
been to approve the Company's new Remuneration 
Policy. During the design of the new policy, the 
Committee consulted with the major shareholders. 
As Chairman of the Committee, I wrote to the 
Company's largest shareholders, the Investment 
Association (IA) and Institutional Shareholder 
Services (ISS) in order to update them on the 
proposed changes and seek feedback.
The main principles applied to the review process 
were to simplify remuneration arrangements, ensure 
arrangements were in line with general market 
practice and to retain flexibility to respond to future 
requirements. No increases to overall quantum or 
opportunity have been proposed and as a result there 
are no material changes in remuneration arrangements.
Annual bonus plan
Structure
The current opportunity is 150% of salary for the 
CEO of which 25% is paid in shares (not subject to 
compulsory deferral) and a total of 105% of salary  
for the CFO which comprises 75% of salary under  
the annual bonus plan and 30% under the 2011 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan ('DSBP') which is 
subject to the same performance conditions as the 
element under the annual bonus plan but deferred 
for two years.
To simplify the bonus structure, it is proposed that 
the annual bonus and DSBP are consolidated with 
no change in quantum so that the annual bonus 
opportunity is 150% of salary for the CEO and 105% 
for the CFO. 
Deferral
At the same time the Committee intends to introduce 
bonus deferral for all executive directors, with not 
less than 1/3rd of the total bonus awarded being 
deferred into Premier Foods' shares for three years. 
This will increase alignment between executive 
directors and shareholders and will increase the 
bonus payable in shares as a percentage of salary 
for both CEO and CFO (which is currently 25% and 
28.5%, respectively). In order to facilitate this deferral 
the Company is seeking shareholder approval to 
introduce a new Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) at the 
2017 AGM.
The deferred amount will be subject to recovery 
provisions. Executive directors are required to 
retain 50% of post-tax shares from the vesting of 
LTIP awards until such time as their shareholding 
guidelines have been met. Shares from the DBP will 
be subject to the same retention requirement.
Long-Term Incentive Plan ('LTIP')
Structure
The current LTIP is comprised of performance 
shares and matching shares. There have been 
annual grants of performance shares under the 
current plan, however, matching shares have not 
been granted in recent years. Given matching shares 
are minority practice, to simplify the structure and 
align with market practice, matching shares will be 
removed from the plan under the new policy.
In addition, to further align with best practice, a 
two year post vesting holding period will apply and 
current recovery provisions will be extended to 
recovery and withholding provisions.
Executive shareholdings and external 
directorships
Finally, the Company's guidelines on executive 
directors' shareholdings and external directorships 
have been incorporated into the Remuneration Policy.
Performance outcome for 2016/17
The Committee reviewed the CEO’s and CFO’s 
performance over the financial period and assessed 
the extent to which their annual bonus targets had 
been achieved. Whilst significant progress was made 
in respect of key Strategic and Personal objectives, 
trading performance was below target. No bonus 
awards have been made for the financial period, 
details of the performance assessments are set out 
on pages 43 to 45.
Arrangements for the coming period
Targets for the annual bonus and LTIP awards 
for 2017/18 are aligned with the Group's strategic 
priorities highlighted in the Chief Executive's review 
on page 05.
As part of the Company's cost reduction programme 
it was agreed that there would be no salary increase 
for colleagues not involved in collective bargaining 
for 2017/18 and consequently no salary increases are 
proposed for the CEO and CFO. The CEO's salary 
therefore remains unchanged since his appointment 
in 2013. 
I look forward to your continuing support.

Provides an appropriate level 
of fixed income.
Set at levels to attract and 
retain talented individuals 
with reference to the 
Committee’s assessment of:
•  The specific needs of the 
Group by reference to the 
size and complexity of the 
business, acknowledging 
the Group is currently in a 
turnaround situation; 
•  The specific experience, 
skills and responsibilities  
of the individual; and
•  The market rates for 
companies of comparable 
size and complexity 
and internal Company 
relativities.
Normally reviewed annually (currently with 
effect from 1 April) in conjunction with 
those of the wider workforce.
Salaries for the relevant year are detailed 
in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Whilst the Company does not have a 
cap on salaries, increases are normally 
expected to be in line with increases 
across the management grades, subject 
to particular circumstances such as a 
significant change in role, responsibilities 
or organisation. An explanation of 
differences in remuneration policy for 
executive directors compared with 
other employees is set out later in this 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
Group performance is taken into consideration 
when determining an appropriate level of base 
salary increase for the Group as a whole and 
personal performance is taken into account when 
determining an appropriate level of base salary 
increase for the executive.
Performance Period: N/A.
Benefits Help to recruit, retain and 
promote the efficient use of

to allow the CEO to work while 
commuting to business appointments;
• Private health insurance;
• Life insurance;
• Telecommunication services;
• Professional memberships;
• Allowance for personal tax and

Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 36 Link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures
Annual 
Bonus
Designed to incentivise 
delivery of annual financial and 
operational goals and directly 
linked to delivery of the Group 
strategy.
An annual bonus is earned based 
on performance against a number of 
performance measures which are linked to 
the Group’s strategy. Maximum of 2/3rds 
of the bonus is paid in cash and a minimum 
of 1/3rd deferred into shares under the 
Premier Foods Deferred Bonus Plan 
('DBP') which are released after three years 
subject to continued employment.
The rules of the DBP contain a dividend 
equivalent provision enabling payments 
to be made (in cash or shares) at the time 
of vesting, in an amount equivalent to the 
dividends that would have been paid on 
the participant's vested shares between 
the date of grant of the relevant award and 
the date of vesting.
Recovery provisions apply for the cash and 
share elements.
Maximum (as a percentage of salary):
• CEO: 150%
• CFO: 105%
Performance conditions are designed to promote the 
delivery of the Group’s strategy and can be made up 
of a range of:
• Financial targets (e.g. turnover, trading profit and 
cash flow) representing not less than 50% of the 
total bonus opportunity, subject to the delivery of 
a threshold level of trading profit;
• Short to medium-term strategic targets including 
financial and non-financial Key Performance 
Indicators, subject to the delivery of a threshold 
level of profitability; and
• Personal performance representing not more 
than 20% of the total bonus opportunity.
No more than 20% of the bonus will vest for 
threshold performance with full vesting taking place 
for equalling or exceeding the maximum target.
Specific details of the performance measures for 
the relevant year can be found in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration to the extent that they are not 
commercially sensitive.
Performance Period: One year
Long-Term 
Incentive 
Plan (LTIP)
The Premier Foods Long-
Term Incentive Plan ('LTIP') 
provides a clear link to our 
strategic goal of returning 
to profitable growth with 
sustainable share price 
growth over the long-term.
Annual grant of Performance Share 
Awards.
Performance Share Awards are the 
conditional award of shares or nil cost 
options which normally vest after three 
years subject to performance conditions. 
Awards under the LTIP, including the 
determination of any relevant performance 
conditions, will be considered and 
determined on an annual basis at the 
discretion of the Committee.
The rules contain a dividend equivalent 
provision enabling payments to be made 
(in cash or shares) at the time of vesting, in 
an amount equivalent to the dividends that 
would have been paid on the participant's 
vested shares between the date of grant of 
the relevant award and the date of vesting. 
Recovery and withholding provisions apply
Maximum individual limit of 200% of 
salary.
Currently award levels are (as a 
percentage of salary):
• CEO: 200%
• CFO: 150%
Performance conditions are based on a range 
of targets focused on the delivery of increased 
shareholder value over the medium to long-term. 
Currently these include a combination of total 
shareholder return and adjusted earnings per share.
No more than 20% of the LTIP award will vest for 
threshold performance with full vesting taking place  
for equalling or exceeding the maximum target.
Performance Period: Three years
Holding Period: Two years (post vesting)
Sharesave 
Plan
To offer all employees 
the opportunity to build a 
shareholding in a simple and 
tax-efficient manner.
The Company’s Sharesave Plan is a 
HMRC compliant scheme which is usually 
offered annually to all employees. The key 
terms of the plan will only be changed to 
reflect HMRC changes.
Participants may save up to the statutory 
limit (currently £500 per month but 
subject to any lower limit set by the 
Committee) over a three year period, 
following which they have the opportunity 
to buy Company shares at a price set at 
the beginning of the savings period.

Provides an appropriate level 
of fixed fee to recruit and 
retain individuals with a broad 
range of experience and skill 
to support the Board in the 
delivery of its duties.
Fees are reviewed annually.
The remuneration of non-executive 
directors is determined by the Chairman 
and executive directors. The remuneration 
of the Chairman is determined by the 
Remuneration Committee.
Includes a Chairman’s fee and standard 
non-executive fee. Additional fees are 
payable for additional responsibilities for 
example the roles of Committee Chairs and 
the Senior Independent Director.
Any reasonable business related expenses 
(including tax thereon) which are determined 
to be a taxable benefit can be reimbursed.
Increases are normally expected to 
be in line with the market, taking into 
account increases across the Group 
as a whole, subject to particular 
circumstances such as a significant 
change in role, responsibilities or 
organisation.
The current aggregate maximum under 
the Company's Articles of Association 
for the Chairman and the non-
executive directors is £1,000,000.

1. Notes to the policy table 
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors’ 
Remuneration policy, authority is given to the Company 
to honour any commitments entered into with current 
or former directors that have been disclosed to 
shareholders in previous remuneration reports. Details 
of any payments to former directors will be set out in 
the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise as 
required under the Remuneration Regulations.
The Committee operates the Annual Bonus plan, DBP, 
and LTIP according to their respective rules which 
include flexibility in a number of areas. These include:
• the timing of awards and payments;
• the size of an award, within the maximum limits;
• the participants of the plan;
• the performance measures, targets and weightings 
to be used for the annual bonus plan and long-term 
incentive plans from year to year;
• the assessment of whether performance conditions 
have been met;
• the treatment to be applied for a change of control 
or significant restructuring of the Group;
• the determination of a good/bad leaver for 
incentive plan purposes and the treatment of 
awards thereof; and
• the adjustments, if any, required in certain 
circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate 
restructuring, corporate events and 
special dividends).
Choice of performance measures and 
approach to target setting
The Committee reviews the performance measures 
used in the incentive arrangements on an annual basis 
to ensure that they remain appropriate and aligned to 
the delivery of the annual business plan and Group 
strategy. The majority of annual bonus measures 
will be focused on financial performance with the 
remainder linked to individual performance and/or 
strategic objectives. This approach is adopted in order 
to link pay to the delivery of overall Group performance 
measured across a balance of key strategic aims. The 
targets will be set by reference to internal budgeting 
and strategic plans for the financial and strategic 
measures and key objectives identified by the 
Committee for the personal performance measures.
Currently, the LTIP uses a combination of adjusted 
earnings per share and total shareholder return based 
measures to reflect both an internal measure of Group 
performance as well as the delivery of shareholder 
value. Targets are set taking into account both internal 
and external assessments of future performance 
and what constitutes good and superior returns for 
shareholders. The Committee also retains the discretion 
within the policy to adjust the targets and/or set different 
measures and/or alter weightings for future awards. 
In addition, the Committee also retains the discretion 
within the policy to amend the existing performance 
conditions for the incentive plans if events happen that 
cause it to determine that the conditions are unable to 
fulfil their original intended purpose.
The Committee will consider the bonus outcomes 
against all of the pre-set targets following their 
calculation and in exceptional circumstances 
may moderate (up and down) these outcomes to 
take account of a range of factors including the 
Committee’s view of overall Group performance for 
the year. No upward moderation would be undertaken 
without first consulting with major shareholders.
Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 38 2. Remuneration scenarios & weighting 
The chart below shows executive director remuneration at three different levels of performance (minimum, mid-point and maximum) as set out previously: 
3. Service contracts
Executive directors have rolling service contracts. The current executive directors’ service contracts contain the key terms shown in the below table. In the event that 
any additional executive directors are appointed, it is likely that their service contracts will contain broadly similar terms.
Provision Detailed terms
Remuneration Salary, bonus, share incentives, expenses and pension entitlements in line with the above Directors’ Remuneration Policy Table.
Change of Control The service agreements do not provide for any enhanced payments in the event of a change of control of the Company.
Notice Period Standard notice periods are set at 12 months from the executive directors and Company.
Payment in lieu of notice The Company may, at its discretion, pay a sum equal to base salary, benefits, and pension contributions which would have been earned 
during the Notice Period as payment in lieu of notice. This payment is payable in two six monthly instalments or until such earlier date 
alternative employment is secured, subject to mitigation. 
In the event of the Company serving notice within 12 months following a change of control then employment will terminate immediately and 
the Company will make a payment in lieu of notice. 
There is no entitlement to a pro rata bonus payment in lieu of notice.
The terms and conditions for the Chairman and non-executive directors are set out in their letters of appointment, which are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office and will be available at the AGM, as are executive service contracts. The letters of appointment entitle the non-executive directors and the Chairman 
to receive fees but do not have provisions on payment for early termination. The appointment of non-executive directors is for a fixed term of three years which 
may be terminated by three months' notice from either party, with the exception of Tsunao Kijima and Daniel Wosner whose appointments are governed by the 
Relationship Agreements with Nissin Foods Holdings Co., Ltd and Oasis Management Company Limited, respectively.

within this segment.
2.  The value of share awards does not include any 
assumptions on share price movements.
3.  The executive directors can participate in the 
Sharesave Plan on the same basis as other employees. 
For simplicity, the value that may be received from 
participating in the Sharesave Plan has been excluded 
from the scenario charts.
4.   Assumptions when compiling the charts are:
  Minimum = fixed pay only (base salary, benefits  
and pension).
  Mid-point = fixed pay plus 50% of Annual Bonus  
payable and 50% of LTIP vesting.
  Maximum = fixed pay plus 100% of Annual Bonus  
payable and 100% of LTIP vesting
STRATEGIC REPORT INTRODUCTION GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 39 4. External directorships 
The Company recognises that its executive 
directors may be invited to become non-executive 
directors of companies outside the Company and 
exposure to such non-executive duties can broaden 
experience and knowledge, which would be of 
benefit to the Company. Any external appointments 
are subject to board approval (which would not 
be given if the proposed appointment was with 
a competing company, would lead to a material 
conflict of interest or could have a detrimental effect 
on a director’s performance).
5. Policy on payment for loss of office 
The Committee aims to deal fairly with cases of 
termination, while attempting to limit compensation 
and honour contractual remuneration entitlements. 
The principles that would be followed are:
• The executive directors have rolling contracts with 
12 months’ notice periods.
• The Company may elect to terminate employment 
immediately in circumstances where it considers 
it to be appropriate by making a payment in lieu 
of notice equivalent to the executive director’s 
salary, pension and benefits for the notice period 
in two equal instalments (the first within 28 days of 
termination and the second six months following 
the date of termination). These payments are 
subject to the executive director’s duty to mitigate 
his loss by finding alternative employment. If the 
executive director finds an alternative position, 
future payments will be reduced by the amount of 
remuneration received by the executive director 
pursuant to that alternative remunerated position.
• Salary, pensions and benefits will generally not 
be paid to a 'bad leaver' in lieu of notice. The 
Company may terminate an executive director’s 
employment without notice (or payment in lieu) in 
certain circumstances including where he commits 
an act of dishonesty, is guilty of gross misconduct 
or a serious breach of his service agreement.
• A time pro-rated bonus (where relevant in respect 
of that bonus year) may be payable (and for the 
current CEO will be payable) for the period of 
active service from the start of the bonus year 
to the date on which the director’s employment 
terminates for ‘good leavers’. Any unpaid bonus 
for the preceding completed bonus year may 
also be payable (and for the current CEO will be 
payable) to a ‘good leaver’. The amount of such 
bonus will be determined at the discretion of the 
Committee taking into account performance. 
Any bonus payable could at the discretion of 
the Remuneration Committee, be paid entirely 
in cash. There is no entitlement to any bonus 
(in respect of that or any previous bonus year) 
following notice of termination (or cessation of 
employment) for ‘bad leavers’ and they will not 
receive any bonus in such circumstances.
• Any share-based entitlements granted to an 
executive director under the Company’s share 
plans will be determined based on the relevant 
plan rules or award agreement. The default 
treatment is that any outstanding awards lapse 
on cessation of employment. However, in certain 
prescribed circumstances, such as death, 
disability, injury, redundancy (not in respect of 
the DBP), transfer of the employing company or 
business out of the Group or other circumstances 
at the discretion of the Committee (taking into 
account the individual’s performance and the 
reasons for their departure) ‘good leaver’ status 
can be applied. The ‘good leaver’ treatment under 
the various plans is as follows:
 – DBP and LTIP awards will vest on the normal 
vesting date (unless the Remuneration 
Committee decides that the awards should 
vest on the date of cessation) subject to, 
in the case of LTIP awards, performance 
conditions (measured over the original time 
period or a shorter period where the LTIP 
awards vest on cessation of employment) and 
are reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion 
of the period from grant actually served. The 
Remuneration Committee has the discretion 
to disapply time pro-rating if it considers it 
appropriate to do so. However, it is envisaged 
that this would only be applied in exceptional 
circumstances. In determining whether an 
executive should be treated as a ‘good leaver’ 
or not, the Committee will take into account the 
performance of the individual and the reasons 
for their departure.
 – The Company may enable the provision of 
outplacement services to a departing executive 
director, where appropriate.
 – Where it is necessary to discharge an existing 
legal obligation (or by way of damages for 
breach of such an obligation) or by way of 
settlement or compromise of any claim arising 
in connection with the termination of a director’s 
office or employment the Committee may make 
a payment to a departing executive director.
 – In the event of change of control of the 
Company, if the Company gives notice 
to terminate or the executive director is 
constructively dismissed, his employment shall 
terminate immediately and he will be entitled 
to a payment in lieu of notice equivalent to the 
executive director’s salary, pension and benefits 
for the 12 month notice period. Any share based 
entitlements will be dealt with in accordance 
with the rules of the relevant schemes.

Directors’ Remuneration report continued
Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 40 6. Recruitment policy
On the recruitment of an executive director the Committee will aim to align the executive’s remuneration package with the approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy. 
In arriving at a remuneration package the Committee will take into account the skills and experience of the individual and the market rate for a candidate. The details 
of the recruitment policy are set out below:
Reward Element Detailed terms
Base Salary In line with the above Directors’ Remuneration Policy table. However, includes discretion to pay lower base salary with incremental increases as new 
appointee becomes established in the role.
Pension and benefits In line with the above Directors’ Remuneration Policy table.
Performance based pay Executive directors are entitled to participate in the Company’s Annual Bonus, DBP and Long-Term Incentive Plans in line with the above Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy table. The maximum variable pay for the CEO will be 350% of the base salary and 255% of base salary for the CFO and other 
directors. In its discretion the Committee may set different performance measures to apply to awards made in year of appointment if it considers that to 
be appropriate.
Buy Outs In order to facilitate external recruitment of executive directors, it may be necessary for the Committee to consider buying out existing incentive awards 
which would be forfeited on the individual leaving their current employment. The Committee would seek, where possible, to provide a buy-out structure 
which was consistent with the forfeited awards in terms of quantum, vesting period and performance conditions. 
The buy out award may necessitate the use of the flexibility in the Listing Rules to make such awards outside the existing LTIP.
Footnotes:
1. Should an executive appointment be made for an internal candidate, such an individual would be allowed to retain any and all provisions of their current remuneration package.
2. The Committee has discretion to authorise the payment of reasonable relocation costs (and tax thereon) which may be necessary to secure the appointment of an executive director.
7. Consideration of employees/wider Group 
In line with current market practice, the Group does not actively consult with employees on executive remuneration. However, the Committee is kept updated during 
the year on salary increases within the Group, and the level of annual bonus awards, as well as overseeing participation in long-term incentives for below Board 
level senior management. As a result, the Committee is aware of how typical employee total remuneration compares to the potential total remuneration packages of 
executive directors. The Group HR Director is a regular attendee at meetings of the Remuneration Committee and is able to brief the Committee on meetings which 
have been held with employee representative bodies.
Differences in Remuneration Policy for executive directors compared to other employees
The executive directors’ remuneration policy is set within the wider context of the Group's remuneration policy for the wider workforce. The key differences of 
quantum and structure in pay arrangements across the Group reflect the different levels of responsibilities, skill and experience required for the role. Executive 
directors have a much greater emphasis on performance based pay through the annual bonus and the LTIP. Salaries for management grades are normally 
reviewed annually (currently in April each year) and take account of both business and personal performance. Specific arrangements are in place at each site and 
these may be annual arrangements or form part of a longer term arrangement linked to the delivery of efficiency targets.
The majority of management grades participate in the Annual Bonus plan to ensure alignment with the Group’s strategic priorities. Senior management participate in 
long-term incentive arrangements reflecting their contribution to Group performance and enhancing shareholder value. All employees are encouraged to own shares 
in the Company via the Sharesave Plan and executive directors through the shareholding guideline.
8. Consideration of shareholders’ views
The Remuneration Committee and the Board considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year at a meeting immediately following the AGM 
and any action required is incorporated into the Remuneration Committee’s action plan for the ensuing period. This, and any additional feedback received from 
shareholders from time to time, is then considered by the Committee and as part of their annual review of remuneration arrangements.
Specific engagement with major shareholders may be undertaken when a significant change in remuneration policy is proposed or if a specific item of remuneration 
is considered to be potentially contentious. During the design of the new policy, the Committee consulted with the major shareholders.

Directors’ Remuneration report continued
Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 42 Base salary and fees (executive directors) (audited)
The Committee sets base salary by reference to the size and complexity of the business based on factors such as revenue, market share, and total enterprise value 
rather than just market capitalisation, which can be volatile as a result of the Group’s capital structure. Given the challenges facing the business in 2013, the Board 
felt it was important to appoint a CEO and CFO with significant experience to lead the Company through a period of significant change and consequently their 
salaries were set at the upper quartile for the FTSE 250. The business turnaround has involved the establishment of a joint venture for the Hovis bread business 
and the completion of a successful restructuring of our financial structure with the introduction of a new smaller lending group, an equity raise, the diversification of 
funding through a high yield bond and also the completion of a new agreement with the Group’s pension trustees. In addition a new senior management team has 
been brought in to lead the business. The Committee is mindful of these salaries when considering pay increases and elements of variable pay which are based on 
multiples of salary.
In line with the salary increase to all employees not involved in collective bargaining the Committee approved a 1% salary increase for the CEO and CFO in 2016/17 
(which took effect from 1 April 2016). Gavin Darby elected not to take a salary increase and therefore his salary remained unchanged from his appointment in 2013. As 
part of the Company's cost reduction programme it was agreed that there would be no salary increase for employees not involved in collective bargaining for 2017/18.
Executive director 1 April 2017 Change 2 April 2016 Change 4 April 2015
Gavin Darby £700,000 – £700,000 – £700,000
Alastair Murray £408,040 – £408,040 +1% £404,000
Annual Bonus (executive directors) (audited)
Each year the Committee sets individual performance targets and bonus potentials for each of the executive directors. Annually the Committee reviews the level 
of achievement against the performance targets set and, based on the Committee’s judgement, approves the bonus of each executive director. Annual bonus 
payments are not pensionable.
Performance assessment for 2016/17
The Committee undertook a full and detailed review of the performance of each executive director against the targets set at the start of the period. As well as the specific 
targets, the Committee also considered the financial performance of the business as a whole as well as an assessment of the market in which the Company operates. 
As discussed in the Chairman's statement on page 03 the Company results for the period were below expectation due largely to a change in retailer promotional 
strategy which reduced category volumes, and significant input cost inflation. As a result Trading profit was below both our target level of profit and the financial 
underpin for the Annual Bonus plan. The additional financial measures of revenue growth and Net debt were also adversely effected. The Committee reviewed 
performance against each of the Strategic targets (also subject to a financial underpin) and the extent to which they were achieved. The Committee agreed that whilst 
significant progress had been made in the period in respect of Strategic measures the financial underpin had not been achieved and therefore no bonus was payable. 
The Remuneration Committee agreed that both executive directors had achieved a significant proportion of their Personal objectives. As these are not financially 
underpinned, a bonus equivalent to 12.6% of maximum opportunity for the CEO, and 11.5% for the CFO, could have been paid. However the Remuneration 
Committee, together with both the CEO and CFO, have agreed that there will be no bonus payment in relation to the Personal objectives for 2016/17.
The Financial targets and performance assessment for Strategic and Personal targets are set out in the tables on pages 44 and 45 for information. Individual 
weightings have been provided for each Strategic objective.

45 STRATEGIC REPORT INTRODUCTION GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual bonus measures for 2017/18
The Committee has determined that the weightings for the annual bonus performance measures will remain broadly the same as last year split between Financial, Strategic 
and Personal objectives representing 50%, 35% and 15% of opportunity, respectively. 
The performance measures are linked to the Group's strategy to focus on revenue growth, cost efficiency and cash generation with the aim to deleverage the business. 
Trading profit and Net debt are both Group KPIs (see page 08). Strategic objectives are focused on commercial opportunities to drive sales, generate cost savings and 
improve free cash flow. The Board considers the Financial targets and certain of the Strategic and Personal objectives to be commercially sensitive but has agreed that the 
targets will be disclosed as part of the performance assessment in next year’s annual report. The Financial and Strategic targets contain a Trading profit underpin. 
If the Company's new Remuneration Policy and the Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) are approved by shareholders in July 2017 , 1/3rd of any annual bonus awarded in respect of 
the 2017/18 financial year will be deferred in shares for 3 years under the new DBP .

Directors’ Remuneration report continued
Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 46 Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP)
Alastair Murray participated in the DSBP which operated alongside the Annual 
Bonus plan with a maximum opportunity of 30% of salary. The CEO does not 
participate in the DSBP. Awards can be based on the achievement of a range of 
Company-wide financial and strategic targets which are set at the start of each 
financial period. If the objective is met, the bonus earned will be converted into 
shares following the announcement of the results for the financial period and 
deferred for a period of up to two years. These shares are subject to forfeiture over 
the period of deferral and the shares for these awards are sourced in the market.
As set out in the Chairman's letter on page 35 in order to simplify remuneration 
arrangements it is proposed that Alastair Murray's entitlement under the DSBP 
is combined with his annual bonus going forward and therefore, if the new 
Remuneration Policy is approved by shareholders in July 2017 no further 
awards will be made under this plan.
DSBP award for 2016/17 (audited)
For the 2016/17 award, the Committee determined that the performance 
targets for the DSBP would be aligned with those of the Annual Bonus plan 
(excluding personal objectives). The two performance conditions were split 
50:50 between Financial and Strategic measures subject to a Trading profit 
underpin. As set out in the assessment of the 2016/17 annual bonus on page 
43 the underpin was not met and consequently no award will be made under 
the DSBP in respect of 2016/17.

the use of the matching shares element of the LTIP and it was concluded 
that matching shares were no longer common practice in the market and 
it is therefore proposed that this element of the LTIP be removed from the 
Remuneration Policy going forward.

LTIP award for 2017/18
For the 2017/18 award the Committee proposes to use the same measures as 
the 2016/17 LTIP award, i.e. a relative TSR condition (comprising 2/3rds of the 
award) and an adjusted EPS condition (comprising 1/3rd of the award), which 
is aligned with the Company’s focus on revenue, cost efficiency and cash 
generation in order to reduce net debt and improve shareholder return over the 
medium-term. The Committee believes that these measures are fully aligned 
with the interests of shareholders and that awards will only vest following the 
achievement of stretching performance targets. 
The TSR condition requires at least a median ranking to be achieved for 20% 
of this part of the award to vest, with full vesting taking place for an upper 
quartile ranking against the constituents of the FTSE All Share Index (excluding 
investment trusts). The Committee considers that the FTSE All Share Index is 
an appropriate index to use as it includes a wide range of companies, including 
the members of the FTSE Small Cap Index. The Compound Annual Growth 
Rate (CAGR) for the adjusted EPS target ranges from 2.7% to 6.5%. The 
Committee considers the targets to be challenging, particularly in the context of 
current growth levels in the markets in which we operate. Further details of all 
outstanding LTIP awards are provided in the table on page 49.

Anticipated vesting of 2014 LTIP Award
The performance conditions for the 2014 LTIP award were based on a relative 
TSR condition (comprising 2/3rds of the award) and an adjusted EPS condition 
(comprising 1/3rd of the award). The Committee assessed the two performance 
conditions in May 2017 and concluded that the targets had not been met and 
consequently the 2014 LTIP award has lapsed in full.
Co-Investment Award
The Co-Investment Award, which was specific to Gavin Darby, was awarded 
following his appointment as CEO in 2013 and designed to align the CEO with 
shareholders and the delivery of share price growth. On appointment Gavin 
Darby purchased shares worth 100% of annual base salary in the Company. 
In return the Company made an award of shares worth 200% of salary which 
vested in thirds on 1 May 2014, 2015 and 2016. The vesting of each tranche of 
the award was subject to a bonus having been paid for the relevant financial year 
and continued employment. The final tranche of the Co-Investment Award vested 
on 1 May 2016 and Gavin Darby exercised the award on 5 August 2016. 354,062 
shares were sold at 51.375p to cover tax and employee national insurance with 
the remaining shares being retained. The final tranche of his Co-Investment 
Award was included in the single figure table for the period 2015/16, details of 
which are set out on page 42. 
Dilution limits
Awards under certain executive and all-employee share plans may be satisfied 
using either newly issued shares or shares purchased in the market and held in 
the Group’s Employment Benefit Trust (which held 250,420 shares as at 1 April 
2017). The Group complies with the Investment Association guidelines in respect 
of the dilutive effect of newly issued shares. The current dilutive impact of share 
awards over a 10 year period is approximately 1%.

Share ownership for the wider Group
The Committee recognises the importance of aligning colleagues across the 
business with those of shareholders and encourages share ownership in order 
to increase focus on the delivery of shareholder return. All members of the ELT 
participate in the LTIP. In 2014 all colleagues (excluding the ELT) were given 
an award of 500 free shares under the Share Incentive Plan and each year 
colleagues are invited to join the Company’s all employee Sharesave Plan. 
Participation in the Sharesave Plan currently represents 30% of the workforce.
Total shareholder return
The market price of a share in the Company on 31 March 2017 (the last trading 
day before the end of the financial period) was 44.0 pence; the range during the 
financial period was 37.0 pence to 59.50 pence. 
This graph shows the value, by 1 April 2017, of £100 invested in Premier Foods 
plc on 31 December 2008, compared with the value of £100 invested in the FTSE

on the same date. The Committee considers these to be the most appropriate

The following table sets out the amounts and percentage change in total employee 
costs. The terms of our current banking facility contain restrictions on the payment 
of dividends. Free cash flow and Net debt have therefore been included as 
additional indicators. Cash flow demonstrates the cash available to reinvest in the 
business and service debt payments and net debt highlights the importance of 
organically deleveraging the business to a point at which dividend payments can be 
resumed under the Group’s banking arrangements (see KPIs on pages 08 and 09).

51 STRATEGIC REPORT INTRODUCTION GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Committee
The table on page 24 identifies the Committee members and meeting 
attendance. Both the Committee Chairman and a majority of the Committee 
are independent. Daniel Wosner was appointed as a member of the Committee 
following his appointment to the Board in March 2017. Whilst normally only 
independent non-executive directors may become members of the Committee 
it was felt that his input, as a representative of a major shareholder, would be 
helpful when considering remuneration arrangements. In addition, the CEO, 
HR Director and Aon Hewitt regularly attend by invitation. In accordance with 
the Committee’s terms of reference, no one attending a Committee meeting 
may participate in discussions relating to his/her own terms and conditions of 
service or remuneration. Over the course of the year the Committee held three 
scheduled meetings. 
Advisers
Aon Hewitt Limited ('Aon') has been appointed as advisers to the Committee. 
During the year Aon provided advice in connection with executive remuneration 
arrangements, the Company's new Remuneration Policy and the introduction 
of a new Annual Bonus plan for management operating below Board level. Aon 
are signatories of the Remuneration Consultants Company Code of Conduct. 
The trustees of the Company’s pension schemes have appointed Aon to act 
as Administrators and Actuary to the schemes and, in the case of the RHM 
pension scheme, to act as Investment Advisers. Aon operates independently of 
the pension teams and the Committee is satisfied there is no conflict of interest. 
Aon received fees of £65,715 (2015/16: £57,512) in respect of their advice to the 
Committee during the financial period. 
Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Committee has been delegated authority by the Board to approve the 
overall design of the Remuneration Policy for executive directors and senior 
management, to agree the terms of employment including recruitment and 
termination terms of executive directors, approve the design of all share incentive 
plans and recommend appropriate performance measures and targets for the 
variable element of remuneration packages and determine the extent to which 
performance targets have been achieved. The Committee’s terms of reference 
are available on the Company’s website.
What the Committee discussed during the financial period:
• Reviewed the voting results for the 2016 Directors’ Remuneration report  
at the AGM;
• Approved the Company's 2017 Remuneration Policy for approval by 
shareholders; 
• Approved a new management Annual Bonus plan for management at below 
Board level;
• Reviewed and recommended executive directors’ and senior managers’ 
annual bonuses in respect of the financial period and set the targets for  
the 2017/18 annual bonus in accordance with the strategic objectives  
of the Company;
• Granted the 2016 awards under the Company’s all-employee and executive 
share plans and agreed the targets for awards due to be made in 2017; and
• Discussed developments in best practice with regard to remuneration policy 
and disclosure.
External appointments
The Board is open to executive directors who wish to take on a non-executive 
directorship with a publicly quoted company in order to broaden their experience 
and they may be entitled to retain any fees they receive. However, any such 
appointment would be reviewed by the Board on a case by case basis. The current 
executive directors do not have any external appointments with publicly quoted 
companies. Gavin Darby is currently President of the Food and Drink Federation.
Statement of voting at Annual General Meeting
Whilst overall the Directors’ Remuneration report received strong support at the 
AGM in 2016, there was a 15% vote against (full details are set out below). The 
reasons for this vote were discussed by the Committee and it was concluded 
that this was primarily the result of a vote from a certain shareholder. As a result 
the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and Senior Independent Director 
met with this shareholder to discuss their concerns.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Premier Foods plc for the  
52 weeks ended 1 April 2017 set out on pages 58 to 112. In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the  
Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 1 April 2017 and  
of the Group’s profit for the 52 weeks then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in  
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as  
adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared  
in accordance with UK Accounting Standards, including FRS 101  
Reduced Disclosure Framework; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and, as regards the Group  
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, in decreasing order of 
audit significance, were those risks noted below. Following the completion of the acquisition of Knighton Foods Limited (‘Knighton’) in 2016/17, we have not assessed 
‘accounting for investments’ as one of the risks that had the greatest effect on our audit and, therefore, it is not separately identified in our report this year.
The risk Our response
Revenue recognition relating  
to commercial arrangements
Commercial accruals
(£(38.6) million;  
2015/16: £(35.9) million)
Refer to page 31 (Audit Committee 
Report), page 67 (accounting 
policy) and page 82 (financial 
disclosures).

2015/16: £771.7 million)
Refer to page 31 (Audit Committee 
Report), page 67 (accounting 
policy) and page 68 (financial 
disclosures).
Estimation uncertainty impacting revenue
The Group enters into commercial arrangements with its 
customers on a regular basis to offer product promotions 
and discounts. The Group measures revenue taking into 
consideration estimated rebates and discounts. 
Due to the nature of some arrangements and the number 
of different arrangements in place, there is a risk that 
these arrangements are not appropriately accounted for 
and as a result revenue is misstated. 
The Group also focuses on revenue as a key performance 
measure which could create an incentive for revenue to be 
overstated through manipulation of rebates and discounts, 
resulting from the pressure management may feel to 
achieve performance targets.
The most significant areas of estimation uncertainty are:
• estimating the sales volumes attributable to each 
arrangement; and
• determining the period which the arrangements  
cover and hence the correct period for recognition.
Our procedures included: 
• Accounting policies: Assessing the appropriateness of the revenue 
recognition accounting policies, in particular those relating to volume rebates 
and discounts and assessing compliance with the applicable accounting 
standards;
• Tests of details: Comparing a sample of promotions recorded during the 
period to supporting evidence such as customer acceptance, electronic point 
of sale data and customer debit notes to assess the accuracy of the estimate;
• Testing credit notes issued after the period end to assess the completeness of 
the commercial accruals recorded and existence of revenue; 
• Inspecting supporting documentation for a sample of manual journals posted 
to revenue accounts; 
• Visiting a selection of customer stores before the period end, identifying 
product promotions and assessing whether those promotions were 
appropriately included within the commercial accrual; and
• Assessing disclosures: Considering the adequacy of the Group's disclosures 
relating to the critical accounting policies, estimates and judgements in 
respect of volume rebates and discounts.
Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 54 2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement continued
The risk Our response
Carrying value of goodwill  
and Mr Kipling brand
(£692.5 million;  
2015/16: £694.8 million)
Refer to page 31 (Audit Committee 
Report), page 67 (accounting 
policy) and pages 77 to 79 
(financial disclosures).
Forecast-based valuation
Goodwill and brand asset values are dependent on the 
achievement of future business plans which are inherently 
uncertain.
The business operates in an environment of significant 
retailer pressure on price, competitor activity and 
increasing commodity prices. In light of these trading 
challenges, there is a risk that the Group’s goodwill and 
brand asset values, in particular the goodwill attributed 
to the Grocery cash generating unit and the Mr Kipling 
brand, may not be recoverable. 
Our procedures included: 
• Assessing cash generating units: Assessing the appropriateness of the 
cash generating units identified;
• Assessing principles: Assessing the principles of the cash flow models for 
the Grocery cash generating unit and Mr Kipling brand; 
• Benchmarking assumptions: Evaluating assumptions used, in particular 
those relating to: i) the short and long-term revenue growth rates; ii) future 
changes in profitability; iii) the discount rates used; and iv) the royalty rate used 
in the Mr Kipling brand assessment, comparing these with externally derived 
data and using our own valuation specialists where applicable; 
• Sensitivity analysis: Performing sensitivity analysis of key assumptions 
including discount rates, short and long-term revenue growth rates, 
profitability and royalty rate; and
• Assessing disclosures: Assessing whether the Group’s disclosures relating to 
the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessments to changes in key 
assumptions reflect the risks inherent in the valuation of goodwill and brands.
Valuation of defined benefit 
pension plans
(£104.8 million;  
2015/16: £130.9 million)
Refer to page 31 (Audit Committee 
Report), pages 66 to 67 
(accounting policy) and pages 93 
to 98 (financial disclosures).
Subjective valuation
Small changes in the assumptions used to determine the 
liabilities of the RHM Pension Scheme, Premier Foods 
Pensions Scheme and Premier Grocery Products Pension 
Scheme, in particular those relating to inflation, mortality 
and discount rates, can have a significant impact on the 
valuation of the liabilities. 
The Group’s RHM Pension Scheme holds assets for 
which quoted prices are not available. The valuation of 
these assets can have a significant impact on the surplus. 
Valuations are prepared based on most recent information 
available and are updated where appropriate, applying 
judgement and estimation.
Our procedures included: 
• Benchmarking assumptions: Challenging, with the support of our own 
actuarial specialists, the key assumptions applied, being the inflation, mortality 
and discount rate assumptions, against externally derived data; 
• Asset confirmations: Obtaining asset statements in respect of the schemes’ 
investments directly from fund managers; 
• Re-performing valuations: Re-performing valuations for a sample of scheme 
assets and comparing those valuations to the asset statements received; and
• Assessing disclosures: Considering the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures  
relating to the sensitivity of the surplus to the key assumptions. 
Recoverability of deferred tax 
assets
(£32.4 million;  
2015/16: £25.9 million)
Refer to page 31 (Audit Committee 
Report), page 67 (accounting 
policy) and pages 71 to 74 
(financial disclosures).
Forecast-based valuation
As the Group has a history of recent losses, there is 
judgement in determining whether deferred tax assets 
should be recognised.
The Group utilises forecasts of future taxable profits to 
determine the extent to which deferred tax assets can be 
recognised, which is inherently uncertain due to the level 
of judgement and estimation contained in forecasts.
Our procedures included: 
• Assessing recognition: Reviewing historical taxable profits and considering 
if there is convincing evidence that sufficient future taxable profits will be 
available;
• Evaluating assumptions: Evaluating assumptions used, in particular those 
relating to: i) the short and long-term revenue growth rates; ii) future changes in 
profitability; and iii) adjustments to profit before tax to determine taxable profits, 
using our own tax specialists where applicable; and
• Assessing transparency: Assessing the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures 
relating to the sensitivity of the recognition of deferred tax assets to changes in 
key assumptions reflected in the inherent risk.
55 STRATEGIC REPORT INTRODUCTION GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £4.5 million 
(2015/16: £5.25m), determined with reference to a benchmark of Group revenue of 
which it represents 0.57% (2015/16: 0.68%). We consider Group revenue to be the 
most appropriate benchmark as it is a key performance indicator. 
We do not consider the pre-tax result an appropriate benchmark as 
it is not currently a key measure of the performance of the Group. We 
have given consideration to other profit metrics such as trading profit in 
determining materiality. 
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified 
misstatements exceeding £0.22 million (2015/16: £0.25m), in addition to other 
identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
Of the Group’s 33 (2015/16: 40) reporting components, we subjected 5 
(2015/16: 6) to full scope audits for Group purposes. 
For the remaining components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group 
level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material 
misstatement within these.
The component materialities ranged from £0.6 million to £4.25 million (2015/16: 
£0.6m to £4.0m), having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group 
across the components.  All full scope components are managed from the 
central locations in the UK and the work on all components subject to audit 
was performed by the Group team.

Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 56 4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies  
Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for  
the financial year is consistent with the financial statements.
Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the course of the audit  
of the financial statements and from reading the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report:
• we have not identified material misstatements in those reports; and  
• in our opinion, those reports have been prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. 
5. We have nothing to report on the disclosures of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have nothing material 
to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the Directors’ statement of viability on page 33, concerning the principal 
risks, their management, and, based on that, the Directors’ assessment and 
expectations of the Group’s continuing in operation over the three years to 4 
April 2020; or
• the disclosures in note 2 of the financial statements concerning the use of the 
going concern basis of accounting.
6. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are 
required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have identified other information 
in the Annual Report that contains a material inconsistency with either that 
knowledge or the financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that 
is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we 
acquired during our audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider that 
the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy; or
• the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, 
or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  
• the directors’ statements, set out on pages 62 to 63 and 33, in relation to  
going concern and longer-term viability; and   
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on page 24 relating to  
the company’s compliance with the eleven provisions of the 2014 UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.  
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 
34, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. A description of the scope of 
an audit of financial statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is made solely to the 
Company’s members as a body and is subject to important explanations and 
disclaimers regarding our responsibilities, published on our website at www.kpmg.

Consolidated statement of changes in equity
61 STRATEGIC REPORT INTRODUCTION GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. General information
Premier Foods plc (the 'Company') is a public limited company incorporated and 
domiciled in England and Wales, registered number 5160050, with its registered 
office at Premier House, Centrium Business Park, Griffiths Way, St Albans, 
Hertfordshire AL1 2RE. The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries 
(the 'Group') is the manufacture and distribution of branded and own label food 
products. Copies of the annual report and accounts are available on our website: 
http://www.premierfoods.co.uk/investors/results-centre.
These Group consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the 
Board of directors on 16 May 2017.
2. Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated 
financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently 
applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') as adopted 
by the European Union (EU) ('adopted IFRS') in response to IAS regulation 
(EC1606/2002), related interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS, and on the historical cost basis, with the 
exception of derivative financial instruments which are incorporated using fair 
value. Amounts are presented to the nearest £0.1m.
The statutory accounting period is the 52 weeks from 3 April 2016 to 1 April 
2017 and comparative results are for the 52 weeks from 5 April 2015 to 2 April 
2016. All references to the ‘period’, unless otherwise stated, are for the 52 weeks 
ended 1 April 2017 and the comparative period, 52 weeks ended 2 April 2016.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRS requires 
the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management 
to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 
policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or 
areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated 
financial statements are disclosed in note 3.
The following accounting standards and interpretations, issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB') or IFRIC (as endorsed by the 
EU), are effective for the first time in the current financial period and have been 
adopted by the Group:
International Financial Reporting Standards
 Amendments to IFRS 5  Non-current assets held for sale and 
discontinued operations
 Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial instruments
 Amendments to IFRS 10, 11, 12 Transition guidance
 Amendments to IFRS 11  Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests 
in Joint Operations
 Amendments to IFRS 20 & 12, Investment entities: Applying the
 IAS 38 Consolidation Exception
 Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative
 Amendments to IAS 16 & 38  Clarification of Acceptable Methods of 
Depreciation and Amortisation
 Amendments to IAS 16 & 41 Bearer Plants
 Amendments to IAS 19 Employee benefits
 Amendments to IAS 27  Equity Method in Separate Financial 
Statements
 Amendments to IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting
There has been no material impact on the Group’s results, net assets, cash flows 
and disclosures on adoption of new or revised standards in the period.
The following amendments to published standards, effective for periods on or 
after 1 January 2017, have been endorsed by the EU:
International Financial Reporting Standards
 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 Amendments to IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The following standards and amendments to published standards, effective for 
periods on or after 1 January 2017, have not been endorsed by the EU:
International Financial Reporting Standards
 Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative
 Amendments to IAS 12  Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets  
for Unrealised Losses
 Amendments to IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint
   Ventures
 Amendments to IAS 40 Investment Property
 Amendments to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of IFRS
 Amendments to IFRS 2  Classification and Measurement of 
Share-based Payment Transactions
 Amendments to IFRS 4  Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts
 Amendments to IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
 IFRS 16 Leases
During 2016/17 the Group completed a detailed review of the requirements of 
IFRS 15 against current accounting policies. As a result of the review it has been 
concluded that current accounting policies are in line with the new standard. 
As the business evolves the Group will continue to review transactions with 
customers to ensure compliance with IFRS 15 on adoption.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the other above new standards 
that are not yet effective and is yet to quantify the potential impact.
Basis for preparation of financial statements on a going concern basis
The Group’s revolving credit facility includes net debt/EBITDA and EBITDA/
interest covenants. In the event these covenants are not met then the Group 
would be in breach of its financing agreement and, as would be the case in 
Notes to the financial statements
Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 62 any covenant breach, the banking syndicate could withdraw funding to the 
Group. The Group was in compliance with its covenant tests as at 1 October 
2016 and 1 April 2017. The Group’s forecasts, taking into account reasonably 
possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group expects to be 
able to operate within the level of its current facilities including covenant tests. 
Notwithstanding the net current liabilities position of the Group, the directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the next 12 months. The Group therefore 
continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated 
financial statements.
2.2 Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries 
  The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of 
Premier Foods plc and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries). 
Control is achieved where the Company is exposed to or has rights to 
variable returns from involvement with an investee and has the ability to 
affect those returns through its power over the investee.
  The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are 
included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss from the effective 
date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. 
In addition, comparatives are also restated to reclassify material disposed 
businesses into discontinued operations where appropriate.
  All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated 
on consolidation.
2.3 Revenue
Revenue comprises the invoiced value for the sale of goods net of sales rebates, 
discounts, value added tax and other taxes directly attributable to revenue 
and after eliminating sales within the Group. Revenue is recognised when the 
outcome of a transaction can be measured reliably and when it is probable that 
the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group. 
Revenue is recognised on the following basis:
(i) Sale of goods
  Sales of goods are recognised as revenue on transfer of the risks and 
rewards of ownership, which typically coincides with the time when the 
merchandise is delivered to customers and title passes.
(ii) Sales rebates and discounts
  Sales related discounts comprise:
 –  Long-term discounts and rebates, which are sales incentives to customers 
to encourage them to purchase increased volumes and are related to total 
volumes purchased and sales growth.
 –  Short-term promotional discounts, which are directly related to promotions 
run by customers.
  Sales rebates and discount accruals are established at the time of sale 
based on management’s best estimate of the amounts necessary to meet 
claims by the Group’s customers in respect of these rebates and discounts. 
Accruals are made for each individual promotion or rebate arrangement 
and are based on the type and length of promotion and nature of customer 
agreement. At the time an accrual is made the nature and timing of the 
promotion is typically known. Estimation is required for sales volumes/
activity, phasing and the amount of product sold on promotion.
(iii) Commercial income
  Commercial income received from suppliers through rebates and discounts 
are recognised within cost of sales over the period(s) to which the underlying 
contract or agreement relates. Accrued income is recognised for rebates 
on contracts covering the current period, for which no cash was received at 
the balance sheet date. Deferred income is recognised for rebates that were 
received from suppliers at the balance sheet date but relate to contracts 
covering future periods.
2.4 Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker ('CODM'). The CODM 
is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the 
operating segments. See note 4 for further details. 
2.5 Share-based payments
The Company operates a number of equity-settled and share-based 
compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of shares or options is recognised as an expense over 
the vesting period. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is 
determined by reference to the fair value of shares or options granted, excluding 
the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, EPS targets). 
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number 
of shares or options that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the 
Group revises its estimates of the number of shares or options that are expected 
to vest and recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in 
the statement of profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
2.6 Foreign currency translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated into the functional currency of the subsidiaries at rates 
of exchange ruling at the end of the financial period. 
The results of overseas subsidiaries with functional currencies other than in 
sterling are translated into sterling at the average rate of exchange ruling in the 
period. The balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling 
at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising from retranslation at the period 
end exchange rates of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries are recorded as 
a separate component of equity in reserves. When a foreign operation is sold, 
exchange differences previously taken to equity are recognised in the statement 
of profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on sale. 
63 STRATEGIC REPORT INTRODUCTION GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2.6 Foreign currency translation continued
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity 
are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the 
closing rate. All other exchange gains or losses are recorded in the statement of 
profit or loss.
2.7 Property, plant and equipment ('PPE')
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment.
PPE is initially recorded at cost. Cost includes the original purchase price of the 
asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition  
for its intended use. Subsequent expenditure is added to the carrying value 
of the asset when it is probable that incremental future economic benefits will 
transfer to the Group. All other subsequent expenditure is expensed in the  
period it is incurred.
Differences between the cost of each item of PPE and its estimated residual 
value are written off over the estimated useful life of the asset using the straight-
line method. Reviews of the estimated remaining useful lives and residual 
values of individual productive assets are performed annually, taking account of 
commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear. 
Freehold land is not depreciated. The useful economic lives of owned assets 
range from 15 to 50 years for buildings, 5 to 30 years for plant and equipment 
and 10 years for vehicles. All items of PPE are reviewed for impairment when 
there are indications that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. 
Assets under construction represent the amount of expenditure recognised in 
the course of its construction. Directly attributable costs that are capitalised 
as part of the PPE include the employee costs and an appropriate portion of 
relevant overheads. When the item of PPE is available for use, it is depreciated. 
The carrying value relating to disposed assets is written off to profit or loss on 
disposal of PPE.
2.8 Business combinations and goodwill 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. 
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the 
acquisition date fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and 
equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a 
business combination are measured at their fair values at the acquisition date, 
irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. Acquisition related costs 
are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Where the measurement of the fair value of identifiable net assets is incomplete at the 
end of the reporting period in which a business combination occurs, the Group will 
report provisional fair values. The recognised assets and liabilities are measured at fair 
values that reflect the conditions at the date of the acquisition. These provisional fair 
values may be updated for information not known at the reporting date.
The Group has applied IFRS 3 (Revised) Business Combinations to business 
combinations after 1 July 2009. The accounting for business combinations 
transacted prior to this date have not been restated. 
2.9 Intangible assets
In addition to goodwill, the Group recognises the following intangible assets: 
Acquired intangible assets
Acquired brands, trademarks and licences that are controlled through custody 
or legal rights and that could be sold separately from the rest of the business 
are capitalised, where fair value can be reliably measured. All of these assets are 
considered to have finite lives and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
estimated useful economic lives that range from 20 to 40 years for brands and 
trademarks and 10 years for licences.
Software
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of 
identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group are recognised 
as intangible assets when the project or process is technically and commercially 
feasible. Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software 
product include the software development employee costs and an appropriate 
portion of relevant overheads.
Software development costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a 
straight-line basis over a range of 3 to 10 years. 
The useful economic lives of intangible assets are determined based on a review 
of a combination of factors including the asset ownership rights acquired and the 
nature of the overall product life cycle. Reviews of the estimated remaining useful 
lives and residual values of individual intangible assets are performed annually.
Research
Research expenditure is charged to the statement of profit or loss in the period in 
which it is incurred.
2.10 Impairment 
The carrying value of non-financial assets, other than goodwill and inventories, 
are reviewed at least annually to determine whether there is an indication of 
impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable. Non-financial assets, other than goodwill, that have 
suffered an impairment loss are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment 
at each reporting date.
Where an indication of impairment exists, the recoverable amount is estimated 
based on the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In 
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows, adjusted for the risks 
specific to each asset, are discounted to their present value using a discount 
rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the 
general risks affecting the food manufacturing industry.
Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of profit or loss in the period 
in which they occur.
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the 
smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are 
largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. 
Notes to the financial statements continued
Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 64 2.11 Finance cost and income
Finance cost
Borrowing costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in the statement of  
profit or loss using the effective interest method.
Finance income
Finance income is recognised on a time proportion basis, taking into account 
the principal amounts outstanding and the interest rates applicable, taking into 
consideration the interest element of derivatives.
2.12 Leases
Assets held under finance leases, where substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership are transferred to the Group, are capitalised and included in property, 
plant and equipment at the lower of the present value of future minimum lease 
payments or fair value. Each asset is depreciated over the shorter of the lease 
term or its estimated useful life on a straight-line basis. Obligations relating to 
finance leases, net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included 
under borrowings. The interest element of the rental obligation is allocated to 
accounting periods during the lease term to reflect a constant rate of interest on 
the remaining balance of the obligation for each accounting period. 
Leases in which a significant portion of risks and rewards of ownership are 
retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Rental costs under 
operating leases, net of any incentives received from the lessor, are charged to 
the statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease period.
2.13 Inventories
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Where 
appropriate, cost includes production and other attributable overhead expenses 
as described in IAS 2 Inventories. Cost is calculated on a first-in, first-out basis 
by reference to the invoiced value of supplies and attributable costs of bringing 
the inventory to its present location and condition. Net realisable value is the 
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs of 
completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
All inventories are reduced to net realisable value where the estimated selling 
price is lower than cost.
A provision is made for slow moving, obsolete and defective inventory where 
appropriate.
2.14 Taxation
Income tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax
Income tax is recognised in the statement of profit or loss except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income ('OCI') 
in which case it is recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable 
on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of 
previous periods.
Deferred tax
Deferred taxation is accounted for in respect of temporary differences between 
the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the 
corresponding tax bases used in computation of taxable profit. Deferred taxation 
is not provided on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, 
other than in a business combination, if at the time of the transaction there is no 
effect on either accounting or taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
periods in which the asset or liability is settled based on tax rates (and tax 
laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date. It is recognised in the statement of profit or loss except when it relates to 
items credited or charged directly to OCI, in which case the deferred tax is also 
recognised in equity.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be 
utilised. Their carrying amount is reviewed at each balance sheet date on the 
same basis.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority and when the Group intends to settle its 
current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
2.15 Employee benefits
Group companies provide a number of long-term employee benefit 
arrangements, primarily through pension schemes. The Group has both defined 
benefit and defined contribution plans. 
Defined benefit plans
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines the amount of pension 
benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on factors 
such as age, years of service and compensation. 
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit 
pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the 
balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments 
for remeasurement and past service costs. Defined benefit obligations are 
calculated using assumptions determined by the Group with the assistance of 
independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value 
of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated 
future cash outflows using yields of high-quality corporate bonds that are 
denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have 
terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Remeasurement arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial 
assumptions are charged or credited to the statement of comprehensive income 
in the period in which they arise. Past service costs, administration costs, and 
the net interest on the net defined benefit surplus are recognised immediately in 
the statement of profit or loss.
65 STRATEGIC REPORT INTRODUCTION GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Defined benefit plans continued
Curtailments are recognised as a past service cost when the Group makes an 
significant reduction in the number of employees covered by a plan or amends 
the terms of a defined benefit plan so that a significant element of future service 
by current employees no longer qualifies or qualify for amended benefits.
Plan assets of the defined benefit schemes include a number of assets for which 
quoted prices are not available. At each reporting date, the group determines the 
fair value of these assets with reference to most recently available information.
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays 
fixed contributions into a separate entity, which then invests the contributions 
to buy annuities for the pension liabilities as they become due based on the 
value of the fund. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay 
further contributions.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised 
as an expense in the statement of profit or loss as they fall due. Differences 
between contributions payable in the period and contributions actually paid are 
recognised as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
2.16 Provisions
Provisions (for example restructuring or property exit costs) are recognised when 
the Group has present legal or constructive obligations as a result of past events, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations 
and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. In the case of where the Group 
expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, 
the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset when the reimbursement 
is virtually certain. Where material, the Group discounts its provisions using a 
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance expense.
2.17 Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet 
when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment. A provision is 
made for impairment when there is objective evidence that the Group will not 
be able to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the receivables. 
Trade and other receivables are discounted when the time value of money is 
considered material. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents, with original maturities at inception of less than 90 
days, comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly 
liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and 
are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purpose of the 
statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents also include bank overdrafts.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are measured initially at fair value and 
subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. Any 
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs and inclusive of debt 
issuance costs) and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised 
over the term of the borrowings in accordance with the Group’s accounting 
policy for borrowing costs.
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost. Trade payables and other liabilities are discounted 
when the time value of money is considered material.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the amount of the 
proceeds received, net of directly attributable issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are 
treated as separate derivatives when their risk and characteristics are not closely 
related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried 
at fair value, with unrealised gains or losses reported in the statement of profit 
or loss. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative 
contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value. 
Movements in fair value of foreign exchange derivatives are recognised within 
operating profit and those relating to interest rate swaps are recorded within the 
net movement on fair valuation of interest rate financial instruments.
2.18 Deferred income
Deferred income is recognised and released over the period to which the relevant 
agreement relates.
3. Critical accounting policies, estimates and judgements
The following are areas of particular significance to the Group’s financial 
statements and include the use of estimates and the application of judgement, 
which is fundamental to the compilation of a set of financial statements. Results 
may differ from actual amounts.
3.1 Employee benefits
The present value of the Group's defined benefit pension obligations depends on 
a number of actuarial assumptions. The primary assumptions used include the 
discount rate applicable to scheme liabilities, the long-term rate of inflation and 
estimates of the mortality applicable to scheme members.
At each reporting date, and on a continuous basis, the Group reviews the macro-
economic, Company and scheme specific factors influencing each of these 
assumptions, using professional advice, in order to record the Group's ongoing 
commitment and obligation to defined benefit schemes in accordance with 
IAS 19 (Revised). Key assumptions used are mortality rates, discount rates and 
inflation set with reference to bond yields. Each of the underlying assumptions is 
set out in more detail in note 23. 
Notes to the financial statements continued
Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 66 Plan assets of the defined benefit schemes include a number of assets for which 
quoted prices are not available. At each reporting date, the group determines 
the fair value of these assets with reference to most recently available asset 
statements from fund managers.
To the extent a surplus arises under IAS 19, the Group ensures that it can 
recognise the associated asset in line with IFRIC 14.
3.2 Goodwill and other intangible assets
Impairment reviews in respect of goodwill are performed annually unless an 
event indicates that an impairment review is necessary. Impairment reviews 
in respect of intangible assets are performed when an event indicates that an 
impairment review is necessary. Examples of such triggering events include 
a significant planned restructuring, a major change in market conditions or 
technology, expectations of future operating losses, or a significant reduction 
in cash flows. In performing its impairment analysis, the Group takes into 
consideration these indicators including the difference between its market 
capitalisation and net assets.
The Group reviews its identified Cash Generating Units ('CGUs') for the purpose 
of testing goodwill on an annual basis, taking into consideration whether 
assets generate independent cash inflows. The recoverable amounts of CGUs 
are determined based on the higher of net realisable value and value in use 
calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates.
The Group has considered the impact of the assumptions used on the calculations 
and has conducted sensitivity analysis on the value in use calculations of the CGUs 
carrying values for the purpose of testing goodwill. See note 12 for further details.
Acquired brands, trademarks and licences are considered to have finite lives that 
range from 20 to 40 years for brands and trademarks and 10 years for licences. 
The determination of the useful lives takes into account certain quantitative 
factors such as sales expectations and growth prospects, and also many 
qualitative factors such as history and heritage, and market positioning, hence 
the determination of useful lives are subject to estimates and judgement. The 
brands, trademarks and licences are deemed to be individual CGUs. For further 
details see note 13.
3.3 Advertising and promotion costs
Sales rebates and discounts are accrued on each relevant promotion or customer 
agreement and are charged to the statement of profit or loss at the time of the 
relevant promotional buy-in as a deduction from revenue. Accruals for each 
individual promotion or rebate arrangement are based on the type and length of 
promotion and nature of customer agreement. At the time an accrual is made the 
nature and timing of the promotion is typically known. Areas of estimation are sales 
volume/activity, phasing and the amount of product sold on promotion.
For short-term promotions, the Group performs a true up of estimates where 
necessary on a monthly basis, using real time sales information where possible 
and finally on receipt of a customer claim which typically follows 1–2 months  
after the end of a promotion. For longer term discounts and rebates the Group 
uses actual and forecast sales to estimate the level of rebate. These accruals  
are updated monthly based on latest actual and forecast sales.
Expenditure on advertising is charged to the statement of profit or loss when 
incurred, except in the case of airtime costs when a particular campaign is used 
more than once. In this case they are charged in line with the airtime profile.
3.4 Deferred tax assets
When assessing whether the recognition of a deferred tax asset can be justified, 
and if so at what level, the directors take into account the following:
•  Historic business performance
• Projected profits or losses included in the latest board approved forecast  
and other relevant information that allow profits chargeable to corporation  
tax to be derived
• The total level of recognised and unrecognised losses that can be used  
to reduce future forecast taxable profits
• The period over which there is sufficient certainty that profits can be made 
that would support the recognition of an asset
Further disclosures of the amounts recognised (and unrecognised) are contained 
within note 8.
4. Segmental analysis
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be determined based on the Group’s 
internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker ('CODM'). The CODM 
has been determined to be the Executive Leadership Team as it is primarily 
responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and the assessment of 
performance of the segments. 
The Group's operating segments are defined as 'Grocery', 'Sweet Treats', 
'International' and 'Knighton'. The Grocery segment primarily sells savoury ambient 
food products and the Sweet Treats segment sells sweet ambient food products. 
The International and Knighton segments have been aggregated within the Grocery 
segment for reporting purposes as revenue is below 10 percent of the Group's total 
revenue and the segments are considered to have similar characteristics to that of 
Grocery. This is in accordance with the criteria set out in IFRS 8.
The CODM uses Divisional contribution as the key measure of the segments’ 
results. Divisional contribution is defined as gross profit after selling, marketing 
and distribution costs. Divisional contribution is a consistent measure within the 
Group and reflects the segments’ underlying trading performance for the period 
under evaluation.
The Group uses trading profit to review overall group profitability. Trading profit 
is defined as operating profit/(loss) before taxation before net finance costs, 
amortisation of intangible assets, impairment, fair value movements on foreign 
exchange and other derivative contracts, restructuring costs, profits and 
losses associated with divestment activity and net interest on pensions and 
administrative costs.

The movements in losses recognised for the period ended 1 April 2017 of £(2.5m) relates to the derecognition of corporation tax losses, the future recoverability of 
which is not certain. In the prior period, the £55.3m movement relates to the recognition of deferred tax assets to offset an increase in deferred tax liabilities.
The adjustments to prior periods of £1.1m relates to correction of prior period accelerated capital allowances following a change to the capital allowances claimed in 
submitted returns. In the prior period, the £(4.5m) adjustment to prior periods related to the utilisation of losses in prior periods which arose following verification of 
losses noted in submitted returns.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences using the tax rate appropriate to the jurisdiction in which the asset/(liability) arises and the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled. In all cases this is 17.0% (2015/16: 18.0%) except for an asset of £48.4m (2015/16: £70.5m)

73 STRATEGIC REPORT INTRODUCTION GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Deferred tax continued
Where there is a legal right of offset and an intention to settle as such, deferred tax assets and liabilities may be presented on a net basis. This is the case for most 
of the Group’s deferred tax balances and therefore they have been offset in the tables above. Substantial elements of the Group’s deferred tax assets and liabilities, 
primarily relating to the defined benefit pension obligation, are greater than one year in nature.
9. Earnings/(loss) per share
Basic earnings/(loss) per share has been calculated by dividing the profits attributable to owners of the parent of £5.5m (2015/16: £29.2m profit) by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares of the Company.

Dilutive effect of share options
The dilutive effect of share options is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares. The only dilutive potential ordinary shares of the Company are share options and share awards. A calculation is performed to determine  
the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average annual market share price of the Company’s shares) based on the 
monetary value of the share awards and the subscription rights attached to the outstanding share options. 
No adjustment is made to the profit or loss in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share.
Notes to the financial statements continued
Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 74 Adjusted earnings per share ('Adjusted EPS')
Adjusted earnings per share is defined as trading profit less net regular interest, less a notional tax charge at 20.0% (2015/16: 20.0%) divided by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares of the Company.
Net regular interest is defined as net finance costs after excluding write-off of financing costs, fair value movements on interest rate financial instruments and 
other interest.
Trading profit and Adjusted EPS have been reported as the directors believe these assist in providing additional useful information on the underlying trends, 
performance and position of the Group.

Key assumptions
The key assumptions for calculating value in use are cash flows, long-term growth rate and discount rate.
Cash flow assumptions
The cash flows used in the value in use calculation are pre-tax cash flows based on the latest Board approved budget for the first year and the latest Board  
approved forecasts in respect of the following two years. An estimate of capital expenditure required to maintain these cash flows is also made.
The key assumptions when forecasting cash flows are revenue growth and divisional contribution margin. 
Revenue growth is forecast based on known or forecast customer sales initiatives, including, to the extent agreed, customer business plans or agreements for the 
next period, current and forecast new product development, promotional and marketing strategy, and specific category or geographical growth. External factors, 
including the consumer environment, are also taken into account in the more short-term forecasts. The compound annual growth rate over the three year forecast 
period is 0.5% (2015/16: 2.2%).
Divisional contribution margin is forecast based on the projected mix of branded and non-branded sales, supply chain costs, raw material input costs, purchasing 
initiatives and selling costs. 
Long-term growth rate assumptions
For the purposes of impairment testing, the three year Board approved forecasts are extrapolated into perpetuity using growth assumptions relevant for the business 
sector. The growth rate applied of 2.00% (2015/16: 2.50%) is based on the long-term growth in UK GDP as the directors expect food consumption to follow GDP 
growth. This is not considered to be higher than the average long-term industry growth rate. The long-term growth rate is common to all CGUs.
Discount rate assumptions
The discount rate applied to the cash flows is calculated using a pre-tax rate based on the weighted average cost of capital ('WACC') which would be anticipated 
for a market participant investing in the Group. The Directors believe it is appropriate to use a single common discount rate for all impairment testing as each CGU 
shares similar risk profiles.
The Group has considered the impact of the current economic climate in determining the appropriate discount rate to use in impairment testing. At 1 April 2017,  
the pre-tax rate used to discount the forecasted cash flows has been determined to be 9.8% (2015/16: 9.5%). 
77 STRATEGIC REPORT INTRODUCTION GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Sensitivity analysis
An illustration of the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions in the impairment test for the Grocery CGU is as follows:
Reasonably possible change in assumption Impact on value in use
Revenue growth Increase/decrease by 2.0% Increase/decrease by £139.6m/£144.8m
Divisional contribution margin Increase/decrease by 2.0% Increase/decrease by £124.0m/£123.4m
Long-term growth rate Increase/decrease by 0.4% Increase/decrease by £71.9m/£63.4m
Discount rate Increase/decrease by 0.5% Decrease/increase by £91.1m/£106.5m
Under each of the above sensitivities no individual scenario would trigger an impairment for the Grocery CGU.
Impairment charge
There has been no goodwill or intangible asset impairment recognised in 2016/17 (2015/16: £nil). A total impairment charge of £13.6m was recognised in 2015/16 
relating to the Group’s investments in Hovis Holdings Limited ('Hovis') (£9.3m) and Knighton Foods Investments Limited ('Knighton') (£4.3m). The impairment related 
to Hovis reflected the highly competitive bread industry and the significant losses made in that period. The impairment related to Knighton reflected the challenging 
market conditions faced by the Knighton business.

Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 80 16. Ownership of subsidiaries/businesses
On 1 April 2016, the Group gained control (as defined under IFRS 10) of Knighton, in which the Group already held 49% of the ordinary share capital and associated 
voting rights. 
On 24 May 2016, the Group acquired the remaining 51% of the ordinary share capital of Knighton.
Goodwill of £4.3m is attributable to the intellectual property of Knighton and synergies which arose on acquisition. 
Given the proximity of the transfer of control to 2 April 2016, the values of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were provisional. During the period, a fair value 
adjustment has been made in respect of provisions for liabilities that existed at the acquisition date but for which information was not available.
The following table summarises the consideration for Knighton, and the amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

83 STRATEGIC REPORT INTRODUCTION GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 21. Financial instruments
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (arising 
from adverse movements in foreign currency, commodity prices and interest 
rates), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group uses a variety of derivative financial 
instruments to manage certain of these risks. The management of these risks, 
along with the day-to-day management of treasury activities is performed by 
the Group Finance function. The policy framework governing the management 
of these risks is defined by the Board. The framework for management of these 
risks is incorporated into a policies and procedures manual.
The Group also enters into contracts with suppliers for its principal raw 
material requirements, some of which are considered commodities, diesel 
and energy. These commodity and energy contracts are part of the Group's 
normal purchasing activities. Some of the risk relating to diesel is mitigated 
with the use of derivative financial instruments. The Treasury Risk Management 
Committee monitors and reviews the Group’s foreign currency exchange, 
commodity price and energy price exposures and recommends appropriate 
hedging strategies for each.
(a) Market risk
i) Foreign exchange risk
The Group’s main operating entities’ functional currency and the Group’s 
presentational currency is sterling although some transactions are executed 
in non-sterling currencies, including euros and US dollars. The transactional 
amounts realised or settled are therefore subject to the effect of movements in 
these currencies against sterling. Management of these exposures is centralised 
and managed by the Group Finance function. It is the Group's policy to manage 
the exposures arising using forward foreign currency exchange contracts and 
currency options. Hedge accounting is not sought for these transactions. 
The Group generates some of its profits in non-sterling currencies and has 
assets in non-sterling jurisdictions, principally the euro. 
The principal foreign currency affecting the translation of subsidiary 
undertakings within the Group financial statements is the euro. The rates 
applicable are as follows:
Principal rate of exchange: euro/sterling

1 Apr 2017
Period ended

The majority of the Group’s assets and liabilities are denominated in the 
functional currency of the relevant subsidiary.
The table below shows the Group's currency exposures as at 1 April 2017  
and 2 April 2016 that gave rise to net currency gains and losses recognised  
in the consolidated statement of profit or loss as a result of monetary assets  
and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the 
subsidiaries involved.

Sensitivities are disclosed below using the following reasonably possible scenarios:
If the US dollar were to weaken against sterling by 20 US dollar cents, with  
all other variables held constant, profit after tax would increase by £0.1m 
(2015/16: £nil).
If the US dollar were to strengthen against sterling by 20 US dollar cents, with  
all other variables held constant, profit after tax would decrease by £0.1m 
(2015/16: £0.1m increase).
If the euro were to weaken against sterling by 10 euro cents, with all other variables 
held constant, profit after tax would decrease by £2.1m (2015/16: £1.2m decrease).
If the euro were to strengthen against sterling by 10 euro cents, with all other 
variables held constant, profit after tax would increase by £1.8m (2015/16:

Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 84 This is primarily driven by the effect on the mark to market valuation of the  
foreign exchange derivatives of the Group where the hedged rates differ from  
the spot rate. 
(ii) Commodity price risk
The Group purchases a variety of commodities for use in production and 
distribution which can experience significant price volatility, which include, inter-
alia, dairy, wheat, cocoa, edible oils, diesel and energy. The price risk on these 
commodities is managed by the Group through the Treasury Risk Management 
Committee. It is the Group’s policy to minimise its exposure to this volatility by 
adopting an appropriate forward purchase strategy or by the use of derivative 
financial instruments where they are available. 
(iii) Interest rate risk
The Group’s borrowing facilities comprise senior secured notes and a revolving 
facility, in sterling. Interest is charged at floating rates plus a margin on the 
amounts drawn down, and at 40% for the non-utilised portion of the facility, 
hence the borrowings are sensitive to changes in interest rates.
The Group then seeks to mitigate the effect of adverse movements in interest 
rates by entering into derivative financial instruments that reduce the level of 
exposure to floating rates. The target of fixed/capped debt is defined in the 
Group Treasury policy and procedures, however, the amount hedged can be 
amended subject to agreement by the Board. Hedge accounting is not sought 
for these transactions.
The gross cash flows on the interest rate derivatives are sensitive to changes in 
interest rates as they are driven by three month LIBOR which is reset on a quarterly 
basis. As at 1 April 2017 the reset rate was 0.3439% (2015/16: 0.5875%).
The weighted average interest rate for these derivative financial instruments  
is as follows:
Weighted 
average 
interest rate  
%
As at 1 April 2017 1.4
As at 2 April 2016 1.4
Fixed rate derivative financial liabilities constitute two (2015/16: two) floating to 
fixed interest rate swaps with a notional value of £25m each and a total notional 
value of £50m (2015/16: £100m). These mature in December 2017.
Cash and deposits earn interest at floating rates based on banks’ short-term 
treasury deposit rates. Short-term trade and other receivables are interest-free. 
At 1 April 2017, for every 50 basis points reduction in rates below the last floating 
reset rate of 0.3439% (2015/16: 0.5875%) (based on three month LIBOR) with all 
other variables held constant, annualised net interest expense would decrease 
by £0.6m (2015/16: £0.5m decrease). 
At 1 April 2017, if interest rates were 200 basis points higher than the last floating 
reset rate of 0.3439% (2015/16: 0.5875%) (based on three month LIBOR), with all 
other variables held constant, annualised net interest expense would increase by 
£2.4m (2015/16: £2.1m increase). 
The Group’s other financial assets and liabilities are not exposed to material 
interest rate risk.
(b) Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents and trade 
and other receivables.
Cash and cash equivalents are deposited with high-credit quality financial 
institutions and although a significant amount of sales are to a relatively small 
number of customers these are generally the major grocery retailers whose 
credit risk is considered low.
At 1 April 2017, trade and other receivables of £15.4m (2015/16: £18.5m) were 
past due but not impaired. These relate to customers with whom there is no 
history of default.

As at 1 April 2017 / 2 April 2016 6.7 19.8
(c) Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk through both the treasury and finance functions. Cash flow forecasts are prepared and reviewed on a weekly basis, normally 
covering a period of three months.
In addition, cash flow forecasts are prepared as part of the Group’s overall budgeting and forecasting processes and performance is monitored against this each 
month. This is intended to give the Board sufficient forward visibility of debt levels.
The Group’s net debt level can vary from month to month and there is some volatility within months. This reflects seasonal trading patterns, timing of receipts from 
customers and payments to suppliers, patterns of inventory holdings and the timing of the spend on major capital and restructuring projects. For these reasons the 
debt levels at the period end date may not be indicative of debt levels at other points throughout the period.

Fair value estimation
Derivatives
Forward exchange contracts are marked to market using prevailing market prices. Hedge accounting has not been applied to forward contracts and as a result the 
movement in the fair value of £2.1m has been charged to the statement of profit or loss in the period (2015/16: £2.5m credit). 
Commodity derivatives are marked to market using prevailing prices and are also not designated for hedge accounting. As a result the fair value movement of £1.1m 
has been credited to the statement of profit or loss (2015/16: £0.1m credit). 
Interest rate swaps are marked to market using prevailing market prices. Interest rate swaps are also not designated for hedge accounting. As a result the movement 
in the fair value of £0.6m has been credited to the statement of profit or loss in the period (2015/16: £0.7m credit). 
Short and long-term borrowings, loan notes and interest payable
Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest rate cash flows. The fair value of the floating rate debt approximates the carrying 
value above. 
Trade and other receivables/payables
The carrying value of receivables/payables with a remaining life of less than one year is deemed to reflect the fair value given their short maturity. The fair values of 
non-current receivables/payables are also considered to be the same as the carrying value due to the size and nature of the balances involved. 
Notes to the financial statements continued
Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 90 (e) Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and 
benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt. 
The directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend for the period ended 1 April 2017 (2015/16: £nil).
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net 
debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as equity plus net debt.
The gearing ratios at the balance sheet date were as follows:
As at  
1 Apr 2017  
£m
As at  
2 Apr 2016  
£m
Total borrowings (526.3) (542.2)
Less cash and cash equivalents 3.1 8.0
Net debt (523.2) (534.2)
Total equity (792.8) (848.5)
Total capital (1,316.0) (1,382.7)
Gearing ratio 40% 39%
Gearing is flat year on year due to a relatively unchanged RHM Pension Scheme surplus.
Under the Group’s financing arrangement, the Group is required to meet two covenant tests which are calculated and tested on a 12 month rolling basis at the half 
year and full year, each year. The Group has complied with these tests at 1 October 2016 and 1 April 2017. 
(f) Financial compliance risk
Risk
The Group continues to operate with a high level of net debt of £523.2m (2015/16: £534.2m) and is subject to operating within banking covenants set out in its 
refinancing agreement agreed with its banking syndicate, which include net debt/EBITDA and EBITDA/interest covenant tests. In the event these covenants are not 
met then the Group would be in breach of its financing agreement and, as would be the case in any covenant breach, the banking syndicate could withdraw their 
funding to the Group.
In addition to covenant compliance the Group must ensure that it manages its liquidity such that it has sufficient funds to meet its obligations as they fall due.
It also supports three defined benefit pension schemes in the UK; two of the three schemes have significant technical funding deficits which could have an adverse 
impact on the financial condition of the Group. 
Mitigation
The Group has financing arrangements which provide funding until 2021. 
The Group reviews its performance on an ongoing basis and formally tests and reports on covenant compliance to the Group's banking syndicate at each reporting 
date. In the event of a forecast covenant breach the Group would seek a covenant waiver or amendment from its banking syndicate.
The Group manages liquidity risk through the Group Finance functions. Cash flow forecasts are prepared and reviewed on a weekly basis, normally covering a period 
of three months. In addition, cash flow forecasts are prepared as part of the Group’s overall budgeting and forecasting processes and performance is monitored 
against this each month.
91 STRATEGIC REPORT INTRODUCTION GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Mitigation continued
Funding agreements have been reached with the trustees of the pension schemes which fixes deficit contributions until the finalisation of the next triennial valuations 
due in March / April 2019, subject to amendment in the event that the Company recommences payment of dividends. The Group continues to monitor the pension 
risks closely, working with the trustees to ensure a collaborative approach.
22. Provisions for liabilities and charges
Property provisions primarily relate to provisions for non-operational leasehold properties, dilapidations against leasehold properties and environmental liabilities. The 
costs relating to certain non-operational leasehold properties and dilapidation provisions will be incurred over a number of years in accordance with the length of the 
leases. Other provisions primarily relate to insurance claims and provisions for restructuring costs. These provisions have been discounted at rates between 0.30% 
and 1.72%. The unwinding of the discount is charged to the statement of profit or loss under finance cost.

Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 92 23. Retirement benefit schemes
Defined benefit schemes
The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes under which current 
and former employees have built up an entitlement to pension benefits on their 
retirement. These are as follows:
(a) The Premier schemes, which comprise:
Premier Foods Pension Scheme ('PFPS')  
Premier Grocery Products Pension Scheme ('PGPPS')  
Premier Grocery Products Ireland Pension Scheme ('PGPIPS')  
Chivers 1987 Pension Scheme  
Chivers 1987 Supplementary Pension Scheme
(b) The RHM schemes, which comprise:
RHM Pension Scheme 
Premier Foods Ireland Pension Scheme
The most recent triennial actuarial valuation of the PFPS, the PGPPS and RHM 
pension schemes were carried out on 31 March 2016 / 5 April 2016 to establish 
ongoing funding arrangements. Deficit recovery plans have been agreed with 
the Trustees of each of the PFPS and PGPPS. The RHM Pension Scheme was 
in surplus and no deficit contributions are payable. On 28 March 2017, and 
following the finalisation of the triennial actuarial valuation, the Group announced 
it had agreed a revised schedule of pension payments with the Trustees of the 
pension schemes. 
Actuarial valuations for the schemes based in Ireland took place during the 
course of 2013 and 2014. They are all due further valuations in 2016 and 2017, 
the results of which will not be known until later in 2017.
The exchange rates used to translate the overseas euro based schemes are 
£1.00 = €1.1903 for the average rate during the period, and £1.00 = €1.1695 for 
the closing position at 1 April 2017.
All defined benefit plans are held separately from the Company under Trusts. 
Trustees are appointed to operate the schemes in accordance with their 
respective governing documents and pensions law. The schemes meet the 
legal requirement for member nominated trustees representation on the trustee 
boards and the UK schemes have appointed a professional independent Trustee 
as Chair of the boards. The members of the trustee boards undertake regular 
training and development to ensure that they are equipped appropriately to 
fulfil their function as trustees. In addition each trustee board has appointed 
professional advisers to give them the specialist expertise they need to support 
them in the areas of investment, funding, legal, covenant and administration.
The trustee boards of the UK schemes generally meet at least four times a 
year to conduct their business. To support these meetings the Trustees have 
delegated certain aspects of the schemes’ operation to give specialist focus 
(e.g. investment, administration and compliance) to committees for which 
further meetings are held as appropriate throughout the year. These committees 
regularly report to the full trustee boards.
The schemes invest through investment managers appointed by the trustees 
in a broad range of assets including UK and Global equities and Corporate and 
Government bonds. The plan assets do not include any of the Group’s own 
financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the 
Group. The pension schemes hold a security over the assets of the Group which 
rank pari passu with the banks and bondholders in the event of insolvency, up to 
a cap.
The main risks to which the Group is exposed in relation to the funded pension 
schemes are as follows:
• Liquidity risk – the PFPS and PGPPS have significant technical funding 
deficits which could increase. The RHM Pension Scheme is currently in 
surplus, but subsequent valuations could reveal a deficit. As such this could 
have an adverse impact on the financial condition of the Group. The current 
funding plans in place following the 2016 actuarial valuations fixes the deficit 
contributions from 1 April 2017 until 31 December 2021. The Group continues 
to monitor the pension risks closely working with the trustees to ensure a 
collaborative approach. 
• Mortality risk – the assumptions adopted make allowance for future 
improvements in life expectancy. However, if life expectancy improves at 
a faster rate than assumed, this would result in greater payments from the 
schemes and consequently increases in the schemes liabilities. The trustees 
review the mortality assumption on a regular basis to minimise the risk of using 
an inappropriate assumption.
• Yield risk – a fall in government bond yields will increase both the schemes 
assets and liabilities. However, the liabilities may grow by more in monetary 
terms, thus increasing the deficit in the scheme.
• Inflation risk – the majority of the schemes liabilities increase in line with 
inflation and so if inflation is greater than expected, the liabilities will increase. 
The schemes can limit or hedge their exposure to the yield and inflation risks 
described above by investing in assets that move in the same direction as the 
liabilities in the event of a fall in yields, or a rise in inflation. The RHM pension 
scheme has largely hedged its inflation and interest rate exposure to the extent 
of its funding level. The PFPS and PGPPS have broadly hedged 50% of their 
respective liabilities and have put in place a plan to further increase hedging over 
time as its funding level improves.
The liabilities of the schemes are approximately 48% in respect of former active 
members who have yet to retire and approximately 52% in respect of pensioner 
members already in receipt of benefits. The mean duration of the liabilities is 
approximately 19 years.

Future pension increases 2.15% 2.15% 2.00% 2.00%
For the smaller overseas schemes the discount rate used was 1.80% (2015/16: 1.85%) and future pension increases were 1.45% (2015/16: 1.50%). 
At 2 April 2016 the discount rate was derived from a bond curve where all bonds had been rated AA by at least two credit agencies. At 1 April 2017 the discount 
rate was derived based on a bond curve expanded to also include bonds rated AA by one credit agency (and which might for example be rated A or AAA by other 
agencies). The impact of this change in methodology increased the discount rate by 0.05%.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables and allow for future mortality improvements. The life expectancy assumptions are as follows:
At 1 Apr 2017 At 2 Apr 2016
Premier 
schemes RHM schemes
Premier 
schemes RHM schemes
Male pensioner, currently aged 65 87.7 85.9 87.8 86.2

Female non-pensioner, currently aged 45 90.8 89.5 91.5 89.9
A sensitivity analysis on the principal assumptions used to measure the scheme liabilities at the period end is as follows:
Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities
Discount rate Increase/decrease by 0.1% Decrease/increase by £84.0m/£86.4m
Inflation Increase/decrease by 0.1% Increase/decrease by £38.6m/£43.7m
Assumed life expectancy at age 60 (rate of mortality) Increase by 1 year Increase by £204.8m
The sensitivity information has been derived using projected cash flows for the Schemes valued using the relevant assumptions and membership profile as at 1 April 
2017. Extrapolation of these results beyond the sensitivity figures shown may not be appropriate.

The aggregate surplus of £130.9m has reduced to a surplus of £104.8m in the current period. This movement of £26.1m (2015/16: £342.7m increase) is primarily  
due to asset performance in the RHM schemes offset in part by the impact of a reduction in the discount rate on the defined benefit obligations.

Net remeasurement (loss)/gain for the period (101.1) 24.5 (76.6) 43.6 301.2 344.8
The actual return on plan assets was a £666.7m gain (2015/16: £255.7m gain), which is £516.3m more (2015/16: £119.6m more) than the interest income on plan 
assets of £150.4m (2015/16: £136.1m) at the start of the relevant periods. 
The remeasurement loss on liabilities of £592.9m (2015/16: £225.2m gain) comprises a gain due to member experience of £112.6m (2015/16: £15.5m gain), a gain 
due to demographic assumptions of £41.8m (2015/16: £49.8m gain) and a loss due to changes in financial assumptions of £747.3m (2015/16: £159.9m gain).
The net remeasurement loss taken to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income was £76.6m (2015/16: £344.8 gain). This loss was £61.7m (2015/16: 
£278.9m gain) net of taxation (with tax at 17% for UK schemes, and 12.5% for Irish schemes).
The Group expects to contribute between £4m and £8m annually to its defined benefit plans in relation to expenses and government levies and £35-38m of 
additional annual contributions to fund the scheme deficits up to 2022/23.
The Group has an unconditional right to a refund of any surplus in the RHM Pension Scheme once the liabilities have been discharged and so the asset has not been 
restricted and no additional liability has been recognised. 
The Accounting Standards Board under IFRIC 14, are currently reviewing the recognition of a pensions surplus in the financial statements of an entity. Dependent 
upon the final published standard, there is potential that any future defined benefit surplus may not be recognised in the financial statements of the Group and 
additionally, the deficit valuation methodology may also change.

addition a number of schemes providing life assurance benefits only are operated. The total expense recognised in the statement of profit or loss of £6.1m (2015/16: 
£5.4m) represents contributions payable to the plans by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.

99 STRATEGIC REPORT INTRODUCTION GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Share award schemes
The Company’s share award schemes are summarised as follows:
1.  A CEO Co-Investment Award ('CEO Co-Investment Award'). The scheme was structured as a share matching plan and was specifically created to facilitate the 
recruitment of Gavin Darby as CEO in 2013. The award was equity-settled and the outstanding tranche of the award vested on 1 May 2016. No further awards 
will be made under this plan.
2.  A Long-Term Incentive Plan ('LTIP') for executive directors and senior managers, approved by shareholders in 2011. The LTIP is comprised of performance 
shares whereby participants have the right to subscribe for ordinary shares at nil cost. These awards are equity-settled and have a maximum term of three years. 
The vesting of the 2014, 2015 and 2016 Performance Share awards are conditional on achievement of a combination of absolute adjusted earnings per share 
targets and average share price targets.
3.  A Restricted Stock Plan ('RSP') which provides specific ad hoc share awards to managers. Awards are normally subject only to continued employment and may 
be equity-settled or cash-settled and normally have a retention term of two to three years for senior management. In addition an element of the 2015/16 and 
2016/17 annual bonus was satisfied in the form of shares awarded under the RSP.
4.  A Share Incentive Plan ('SIP') for all employees. An award of free shares was made to all employees in 2014 by the Company under this HMRC tax-advantaged 
plan. Free shares are held by a trustee for a minimum of three years. Subject to continuing employment, participants may elect to remove shares from the trust 
after this three year holding period, however, there are tax and National Insurance advantages for the employee should the shares be left in the trust for over five 
years. No further awards under this plan are currently anticipated.
5.  A Deferred Share Bonus Plan ('DSBP'). Currently only the CEO participates in the DSBP which operates alongside the Annual Bonus plan. Awards are based on 
the achievement of a range of targets which are set at the start of each financial period. If the objective is met, the bonus earned will be converted into shares 
following the announcement of the results for the financial period and deferred for a period of up to two years. These shares are subject to forfeiture over the 
period of deferral. 
Share option schemes
The Company’s share option schemes are summarised as follows:
1.  A Savings Related Share Option Scheme ('Sharesave Plan') for all employees. The employees involved in this HMRC tax advantaged save as you earn  
scheme have the right to subscribe for up to 10.1 million ordinary shares. The number of shares subject to options, the periods in which they were granted  
and the periods in which they may be exercised are given below. These options are equity-settled, have a maximum term of 3.5 years and generally vest only  
if employees remain in employment to the vesting date.
Further details of the share award and share options schemes can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration report.

Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 102 Valuation method
The Group uses the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of share options at grant dates. Fair values determined from the model use assumptions that are 
revised for each share-based payment arrangement.
The expected Premier Foods plc share price volatility was determined using an average for food producers as at the date of grant. The risk-free rate has been 
determined from market yield curves for government gilts with outstanding terms equal to the average expected term to exercise for each relevant grant.

The Group has lease agreements in respect of property, plant and equipment, for which future minimum payments extend over a number of years.
Leases primarily relate to the Group’s properties, which principally comprise offices and factories. Lease payments are typically subject to market review every five 
years to reflect market rentals, but because of the uncertainty over the amount of any future changes, such changes have not been reflected in the table below. 
Within our leasing arrangements there are no significant contingent rental, renewal, purchase or escalation clauses.

109 STRATEGIC REPORT INTRODUCTION GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation 
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial 
Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework ('FRS 101').
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, 
measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the EU ('Adopted IFRSs'), but makes amendments 
where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006 and where 
advantage of certain disclosure exemptions available under FRS 101 have 
been taken, as the Group financial statements contains equivalent disclosures. 
Disclosure exemptions are as follows:
• Cash flow statements and related notes;
• Presentation of comparative period reconciliations;
• Share based payments;
• Financial instruments and capital management;
• Standards not yet effective; and
• Disclosures in respect of compensation of key management personnel.
The profit for the period of £15.7m (2015/16: £15.0m profit) is recorded in the 
accounts of Premier Foods plc. 
The Company has ensured that its assets and liabilities are measured in 
compliance with FRS 101. The financial statements have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention.
The preparation of the financial statements requires the directors to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial 
statements. The key estimates and assumptions are set out in the accounting 
policies below, together with the related notes to the accounts.
The directors consider that the accounting policies set out below are the most 
appropriate and have been consistently applied.
The Company is exempt as permitted under Financial Reporting Standard 101 
from disclosing related party transactions with entities that are wholly owned 
subsidiaries of the Premier Foods plc Group.
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment in their value.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax 
is recognised in the profit and loss account except to the extent that it relates 
to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income, in which 
case it is recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or 
loss for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used 
for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the 
expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets 
and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference 
can be utilised. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Short-term cash deposits, which can be called on demand without any material 
penalty, are included within cash balances in the balance sheet.
Share based payments
The Company operates a number of equity-settled and cash-settled share-
based compensation plans. The fair value of employee share option plans 
is calculated using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms 
and conditions upon which the awards were granted. In accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standard 2, Share-Based Payment ('IFRS 2'), 
the resulting expense is charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting 
period of the options for employees employed by the Parent Company, or treated 
as an investment in subsidiaries in respect of employees employed by the 
subsidiaries where the expense is recharged. The value of the charge is adjusted 
to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting. 
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by 
reference to the fair value of the share awards/options granted, excluding the 
impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales 
growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions 
about the number of share awards/options that are expected to vest. At each 
balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of share 
awards/options that are expected to vest and recognises the impact of the 
revision to original estimates, if any, in profit and loss, with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity.
Dividends
Dividend distributions to the Company shareholders are recognised as a liability 
in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are 
approved by the Company’s shareholders, and for interim dividends in the period 
in which they are paid.
Notes to the Company financial statements
Premier Foods plc Annual report for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2017 110 Operating lease agreements
Leases in which a significant portion of risks and rewards of ownership are 
retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Rental costs under 
operating leases, net of any incentives received from the lessor, are charged to 
the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease period.
Financial guarantees
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee  
the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the Company considers 
these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this 
respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability  
until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to 
make a payment under the guarantee.
2. Operating profit
Audit fees in respect of the Company are £nil (2015/16: £nil). Note 5.2 of the
