Cardiovascular Infection Gastrointestinal
Our primary focus is the discovery, development and commercialisation of prescription 
medicines for six important areas of healthcare: Cardiovascular, Gastrointestinal, Infection, 
Neuroscience, Oncology and Respiratory & Inﬂammation. 
We operate in over 100 countries and our innovative medicines are used by millions  
of patients worldwide. We are one of only a handful of companies to span the entire 
life-cycle of a medicine from discovery, early and late-stage development, to the global 
commercialisation of primary care, specialty care-led and specialty care medicines. Using 
these skills and capabilities we can make a real difference to the health of a broad range of 
patients by delivering great medicines in disease areas where there is unmet medical need.
We want AstraZeneca to be valued as a source of great medicines and trusted as a 
company that delivers business success responsibly. Our Responsible Business Plan 
provides the framework for ensuring that we operate with integrity and high ethical 
standards across all our activities.

Non-Executive changes
Part of the strength of any board comes 
from refreshing and renewing the mix of 
people sitting around the boardroom table. 
When I joined the Board, I was pleased that 
both Graham Chipchase and Geneviève 
Berger also became Non-Executive 
Directors. They bring, respectively, in-depth 
ﬁnancial and scientiﬁc expertise, as well as 
signiﬁcant international business experience 
to our discussions.
Also in April 2012, we said farewell to 
Michele Hooper who stood down from  
the Board. We are all grateful for her 
distinguished contribution to our work and 
her dedicated service as Chairman of the 
Audit Committee and senior independent 
Non-Executive Director. In her place, John 
Varley took over as senior independent 
Non-Executive Director and Rudy Markham 
became Chairman of the Audit Committee.
A new Chief Executive Ofﬁcer
Upon my election to the Board I was also 
appointed Chairman of the Nomination 
Committee. This enabled me to lead  
the important process of selecting David 
Brennan’s successor. This was a process 
that included both internal and external 
candidates and culminated in the 
appointment of Pascal Soriot to the Board 
as the Company’s Chief Executive Ofﬁcer 
on 1 October. 
Pascal joined us from Roche where he had 
been serving as Chief Operating Ofﬁcer of 
the company’s pharmaceuticals division. 
His was a key appointment at an important 
time for AstraZeneca. The Board is certain 
that Pascal’s leadership qualities, combined 
with his strategic thinking and extensive 
Dear Shareholder
I am glad I was able to meet a number of 
you in April 2012 when AstraZeneca held its 
Annual General Meeting in London. At that 
meeting you elected me as a Director and  
it is my privilege to have served as your 
Chairman since June.
Louis Schweitzer and David Brennan
The day of the AGM was, by any measure, 
an historic one for your Company. It was the 
day on which David Brennan announced his 
decision to retire from AstraZeneca as your 
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer. It was also the day 
on which your previous Chairman, Louis 
Schweitzer, brought forward the date of his 
intended retirement to 1 June to coincide 
with that of David.
Louis had been a Director since 2004 and 
your Chairman for seven years. During that 
time he worked tirelessly to ensure that the 
Board was effective in its task of setting our 
strategy and overseeing its implementation. 
We are grateful to him for his efforts  
on your behalf.
As Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, David led 
AstraZeneca with skill, integrity and courage 
during a period of enormous change for the 
industry and for the Company in particular.  
I would like to thank David for his selﬂess 
leadership during his six years at the helm.
experience in the industry, make him  
the right person to drive AstraZeneca  
to success over the coming years. I am 
conﬁdent that Pascal’s approach and  
his track record of delivering results in 
innovation-driven businesses will be valued 
by shareholders and employees alike.
Following David’s departure, Simon Lowth 
acted as Interim Chief Executive Ofﬁcer.  
The Board and I would like to record our 
appreciation for his impressive leadership  
in this period. Supported by a highly 
capable and committed executive team, 
Simon maintained the organisation’s focus 
on key business priorities during a period  
of signiﬁcant change.
Sound governance
All the changes I have outlined took  
place at the same time as AstraZeneca 
completed a record number of business 
development deals. We also undertook our 
annual strategic review, in which Pascal has 
been fully involved, as well as our regular 
programme of meetings and business 
activity. That we have been able to do all  
this is a tribute both to the sound corporate 
governance processes we have in place 
and to the dedication and hard work of my 
fellow Directors. I am grateful to all of them 
for the contribution they made in 2012.
Challenging times
We will need to harness all our skills, 
capabilities and experience if we are to 
successfully navigate the current harsh 
climate for the pharmaceutical sector.  
The world pharmaceutical market is still 
growing and underlying demographic 
trends remain favourable to long-term 
industry growth. However, many of the 
drivers of demand and supply in the 
industry are under pressure.
Chairman’s 
Statement AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 7
Overview Strategy Performance Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
On the demand side, we face increased 
competition from generic medicines as 
some of the world’s most successful drugs 
come off patent. In addition, securing 
recognition (through reimbursement approval) 
and reward (through favourable pricing and 
sales) for innovation is becoming more 
difﬁcult in the face of intensifying pricing 
pressures, particularly in Established 
Markets facing rising healthcare costs.  
On the supply side, the industry faces an 
ongoing R&D productivity challenge. R&D 
costs have risen signiﬁcantly over the past 
decade, while industry-wide probability of 
success continues to decline.
Strategic focus
It is for the reasons outlined above that  
the outcome of our current strategic review 
is so important. Our strategy is rooted in  
our heritage as a company focused on 
innovative science to deliver great medicines 
to patients. I ﬁrmly believe that it is the  
path we need to take if we are to remain 
competitive and return to growth. That path 
must also include a commitment to the 
responsible and sustainable development  
of our business. That is why I was so 
pleased that we were once again listed in 
the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index  
in 2012 and retained our listing on the 
European Index for the ﬁfth year running.
Financial performance
We cannot hope to secure our long-term 
success if we do not meet our ﬁnancial 
targets and deliver acceptable levels of 
return to our owners. Group sales in 2012 
were down 15% to $27 ,973 million (2011: 
$33,591 million) and Reported operating 
proﬁt was down 34% at $8,148 million  
(2011: $12,795 million). Revenue in the US 
was down 21% while revenue outside the 
US was down 11%.
More than 13 percentage points of the 
revenue decline, approximately $4.5 billion, 
was related to loss of exclusivity on several 
brands in the portfolio. Seroquel IR alone 
declined by more than $3 billion, while 
regional losses of exclusivity for Atacand, 
Nexium and Crestor accounted for more 
than $1 billion. Additionally, the disposals  
of Astra Tech and Aptium accounted  
for around 1.7 percentage points of the 
decline. On the other hand, taken together, 
Symbicort, Faslodex, Onglyza, Iressa, 
Brilinta/Brilique and Seroquel XR accounted 
for more than $600 million of revenue 
growth. Additionally, our diabetes alliance 
with BMS is strengthened by the inclusion  
of the Amylin portfolio and the approval  
of Forxiga in Europe.
Reported earnings per share were down 
29% to $4.99. The decline reﬂects the  
$1.08 per share beneﬁt in 2011 from the  
sale of Astra Tech and higher restructuring 
costs in 2012.
Returns to shareholders
Consistent with our progressive dividend 
policy, the Board has recommended a 
second interim dividend of $1.90. This 
brings the dividend for the full year to  
$2.80 (178.6 pence, SEK 18.34). In 2012, 
cash distributions to shareholders through 
dividends totalled $3,665 million and net 
share repurchases totalled $2,206 million.  
In October, we announced the suspension 
of our share repurchase programme for 
2012 and the Board has decided that no 
share repurchases will take place in 2013  
in order to maintain the ﬂexibility to invest  
in the business.
Outlook
We believe challenging market conditions 
will persist in 2013, including continued 
government interventions in price. The 
revenue impact from the loss of exclusivity 
will also continue to affect our performance. 
In the context of the ongoing update to our 
strategy, we have withdrawn the planning 
assumptions for revenue and margin 
evolution for the period 2010 to 2014  
we outlined in January 2010. We plan  
to hold a Capital Markets Day in March  
2013 to provide a more detailed exposition 
of our strategic priorities.

“  2012 financial performance was 
defined by significant revenue 
decline associated with the loss  
of exclusivity for several products. 
For 2013, challenging market 
conditions will persist.” Overview | Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s Review
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 8
In the Strategy section from page 12 of  
this Annual Report, we talk more about  
the background to our strategy and the 
review we are undertaking. For the rest  
of my Review I want to look at the progress 
we made towards our goals in 2012, as  
well as consider some of the setbacks  
we encountered.
Scientiﬁc leadership
In a research and development-based 
business such as AstraZeneca, I believe 
that everything starts with a focus  
on patients and great science. It is our  
ﬁrst priority.
AstraZeneca has a unique combination  
of scientiﬁc capabilities in small molecules, 
biologics, immunotherapies and antibody 
engineering. This puts us in a strong 
position to develop the targeted novel 
medicines and combinations (such as 
drug-antibody conjugates) required to meet 
patient needs in the future. Reviews that  
we have held with scientiﬁc experts outside 
AstraZeneca have further reinforced my 
conﬁdence in our underlying science base.
We have much to do to realise our full 
scientiﬁc potential but made some progress 
in 2012. On the regulatory front, we received 
approvals in Europe for Zinforo, our 
intravenous antibiotic, Caprelsa, our thyroid 
cancer treatment, and Forxiga, a product  
of our diabetes alliance with BMS. In the  
US, FluMist Quadrivalent was approved,  
the ﬁrst four-strain inﬂuenza vaccine  
to be approved by the FDA.
I am both excited and honoured to  
have been asked to lead AstraZeneca. 
Throughout my career I have had enormous 
respect for its people and what they have 
achieved. Since joining in October, I have 
seen for myself the passion and commitment 
that exists within the Group to improve the 
lives of patients around the world. 
This level of energy should come as no 
surprise as our innovative medicines mean 
that more people than ever before are  
able to lead longer and healthier lives.  
As we seek to show throughout this  
Annual Report, successful pharmaceutical 
innovation, delivered responsibly, adds  
value not only for patients and shareholders 
but also for healthcare systems and the 
communities in which we work.
The challenge
Leif has already described in his Chairman’s 
Statement how, in addition to the well-known 
challenges that confront the pharmaceutical 
sector, the loss of exclusivity of several  
of our major brands largely deﬁned 
AstraZeneca’s ﬁnancial performance in 
2012. I believe that our ability to provide  
an acceptable level of return to you in the 
years ahead will come from an undiluted 
focus on delivering great medicines to 
patients through innovative science and 
global excellence in development and 
commercialisation. Underpinning that  
focus are three priorities: achieving  
scientiﬁc leadership, returning AstraZeneca 
to growth and making it a great place  
to work.
Across the entire pipeline of 84 projects,  
39 successfully progressed to the next 
stage of testing in 2012, including 12 
projects into ﬁrst human testing. Nineteen 
projects were withdrawn. While we met  
our target for Phase III investment decisions 
for the year, we did not meet our value 
targets for those projects.
To increase the value of our pipeline, we aim 
to access the best science and molecules 
regardless of origin. Our portfolio was 
strengthened during the year by a number 
of successful business development 
initiatives. Our collaboration with Amgen 
encompasses ﬁve clinical stage projects in 
inﬂammation, including brodalumab, which 
has already entered Phase III development. 
In April 2012, we entered into an agreement 
to acquire Ardea, which added lesinurad,  
a Phase III project for the treatment of gout, 
to our portfolio. We also signiﬁcantly 
expanded our diabetes alliance with BMS 
through its acquisition of Amylin.
Overall, we completed a record number  
of more than 60 important business 
development deals in 2012 that helped  
us to strengthen our scientiﬁc leadership  
in key therapeutic areas, expand our 
pipeline and improve our capabilities. They 
also helped underpin business growth in 
both Established and Emerging Markets.
Return to growth
Our second priority must be to return 
AstraZeneca to growth. Our performance  
in 2012 reﬂected a period of signiﬁcant 
patent expiry and tough market conditions 
globally. Despite the challenges we  
face, I am excited about AstraZeneca’s 
fundamental strengths, which will be key  
in returning AstraZeneca to growth.

Overview Strategy Performance Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
Brilinta/Brilique, our treatment for acute 
coronary syndromes, is now approved  
in 88 countries and launched in 82. I believe 
that, while performance since its launch  
has been disappointing, especially in the 
US, Brilinta/Brilique has the potential to 
become a major product for AstraZeneca, 
given its signiﬁcant mortality beneﬁts relative 
to the standard of care. We have moved 
quickly to improve our sales, marketing  
and medical support to this important 
medicine. Early indications from some 
markets, combined with the favourable 
proﬁle of this medicine, suggest that we  
are on the right path.
Taking full advantage of our expanded 
diabetes alliance with BMS also presents  
a signiﬁcant opportunity. With the addition 
of Amylin products such as Byetta and 
Bydureon, we now have treatment options 
for patients from early stages of Type 2 
diabetes to the pre-insulin stage. The launch 
of the extended portfolio in the US, only  
a few weeks after we concluded the deal, 
demonstrates how swiftly we can move  
to bring a range of treatment options  
to physicians and their patients. 
With our well-established commercial 
strength, we are in a strong position to  
bring our medicines to patients in Emerging 
Markets. Conditions have been tough in 
Mexico, Brazil and some other markets,  
but strong growth in countries such as 
Russia and China shows how much our 
products are valued in these markets.
A great place to work
Skilled, committed employees are essential 
if AstraZeneca is to realise its full potential. 
Unfortunately, the 2012 global employee 
survey showed a reduction in the scores  
in the majority of categories. These scores 
were disappointing. While they might be 
regarded as understandable given our 
challenging environment and the ongoing 
transformation of the business, my SET 
colleagues and I are committed to working 
harder to ensure employees have an 
improved understanding and conﬁdence  
in our future direction.
More positively, it was encouraging to  
see the high level of motivation that exists 
across AstraZeneca to help us succeed. 
This was something I witnessed at ﬁrst hand 
as I spent time with colleagues on site in the 
weeks after I joined the organisation. I want 
to build on this and make AstraZeneca a 
great place to work – a simpliﬁed business 
that comprises a diverse and talented 
workforce operating in a high performance 
culture, which enables us to bring great 
medicines to patients.
Senior Executive Team
In January 2013, we announced changes  
to our Senior Executive Team, which were 
designed to provide sharper management 
focus, as well as devolving and accelerating 
decision making. Changes include 
increased representation of the Company’s 
scientiﬁc expertise, product portfolio and 
key regions. Members of the new SET  
are shown on pages 108 and 109 and  
I look forward to working with them all on 
delivering our strategic goals. As a result  
of the changes, two senior roles were 
eliminated – President of R&D, held by 
Martin Mackay, and Executive Vice-
President, Global Commercial, held  
by Tony Zook. Both Martin and Tony  
left their respective roles in January  
2013, and I would like to thank them  
for their contribution and the exemplary 
leadership they have shown.
Innovation and growth
In closing, I would like to thank everyone in 
AstraZeneca for their support and making 
me feel so welcome. My ﬁrst three months 
as Chief Executive Ofﬁcer conﬁrmed the 
nature and scale of the challenges we face. 
Those months also conﬁrmed my view that 
within the organisation we have both the 
capabilities and skills necessary to achieve 
scientiﬁc leadership, return to growth and  
be a great place to work. I am sure that  
by being true to our mission of bringing 
innovative medicines to patients we can 
meet our short- and medium-term goals 
and thereby deliver our longer term 
aspirations for the business.

Our innovative medicines are playing a part in increasing survival rates and 
improving quality of life for patients in important areas of medical need.
For example, Brilinta/Brilique, our treatment for acute coronary syndromes, shows a 21% relative reduction in cardiovascular 
mortality against the current standard of care over a 12 month duration of therapy. 
In the UK, the government has announced it is to extend the inﬂuenza vaccination programme to all children, recommending  
use of our nasal spray vaccine, Fluenz. Even with moderate vaccination uptake, the UK alone could see around a 40% drop  
in the number of people affected. That would mean at least 11,000 fewer hospitalisations as a result of inﬂuenza and around  
2,000 fewer deaths a year. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 11

Our strategic context
AstraZeneca competes as a global biopharmaceutical business 
delivering great medicines to patients through innovative science 
and excellence in development and commercialisation. 
neurological disorders, cancer, and 
respiratory and inﬂammatory conditions. 
This is the core of our commitment to  
our stakeholders and society. Successful 
pharmaceutical innovation, delivered 
responsibly, improves health for patients, 
brings beneﬁts to stakeholders and delivers 
long-term shareholder value.
The process of getting a medicine to 
market, from initial discovery, through 
development to approval and launch is risky, 
costly and time consuming. Of the many 
thousands of compounds initially analysed, 
only a few make it through all stages of 
development. The ﬁgure overleaf illustrates 
the process we follow. Our activities cover 
the entire life-cycle of a medicine and start 
with the identiﬁcation of an unmet medical 
need, and the scientiﬁc search for a 
potential medicine. The process continues 
through the phases of clinical trials and  
drug development, regulatory submission, 
and a medicine’s launch. After launch,  
our life-cycle management process 
(including line extensions) is designed  
to ensure a medicine’s continued safe  
use and to explore its potential for treating 
other diseases or extending its use into 
additional patient populations. 
As the ﬁgure overleaf shows, we work in 
partnership with others to deliver the highest 
quality new medicines to market rapidly.  
For example, we work with those who pay 
for our medicines and health technology 
appraisers early on and throughout a 
In this section, we describe our business 
model and review the key growth drivers 
and challenges that the pharmaceutical 
sector faces. 
We then describe AstraZeneca’s response 
to these factors and the ongoing update to 
our strategy – a strategy that seeks to make 
a real difference to patient health, deliver 
long-term value for our shareholders, and 
add value for our other stakeholders and 
wider society.
Our business model
Improving health is one of the toughest 
challenges facing the world today. Despite 
all the advances in recent decades, the 
prevalence of major diseases is on the 
increase. The world’s population is growing 
and ageing. Health awareness and patients’ 
expectations are rising while healthcare 
systems everywhere are under pressure.  
It will take a sustained and signiﬁcant effort 
to drive continued progress in healthcare. 
As a global biopharmaceutical company, 
AstraZeneca has a key contribution to 
make. Our skills and resources are  
focused on the discovery, development, 
manufacturing and commercialisation  
of patent-protected medicines that make  
a meaningful difference to patients facing 
some of the world’s most serious health 
challenges: heart disease, diabetes, 
gastrointestinal disorders, infection, 
medicine’s development to understand 
where the greatest clinical needs are.  
As we develop our medicines we gather  
not only the clinical data required for 
regulatory approval but also the health 
economics cost/beneﬁt and ‘value-in-use’ 
data required by payers. 
An essential element of our business  
model is the creation and protection of  
our underlying intellectual property assets.  
This process is outlined in the diagram 
above. The development of a new medicine 
requires a signiﬁcant investment of 
resources over a period of 10 or more  
years before product launch, with no 
guarantee of success. For this to be  
a viable investment, the resulting new 
medicine must be safeguarded from  
being copied with a reasonable amount  
of certainty and for a reasonable period  
of time. This allows time to generate a  
return on our investment and to reinvest  
in new pharmaceutical innovation. 
The loss of key product patents has  
affected a signiﬁcant proportion of sales  
in recent years and will continue to do  
so. A key goal for our planning process  
is therefore to ensure that we sustain the 
cycle of successful innovation and, as  
a result, continue to refresh our portfolio  
of patented products and so generate  
value for shareholders.

Performance Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Strategy Overview
Distinctive capabilities
AstraZeneca has clear strengths that  
allow us to create value for patients  
and for shareholders: 
 > Good underlying science. External 
opinion leaders conﬁrm that we  
have strong disease knowledge,  
research portfolios, and related 
technology platforms in a number  
of areas, particularly in oncology,  
and respiratory and inﬂammation.
 > Unique scientiﬁc capabilities.  
Few pharmaceutical companies  
in the world, if any, can match the 
combination of capabilities that  
we have in small molecules, biologics, 
immunotherapies and antibody 
engineering. These capabilities allow  
us to produce combination therapies 
(such as drug antibody conjugates  
and bispeciﬁcs) and customisable 
molecules, both targeted to speciﬁc 
patient populations.
 > Strong therapy area franchises, brands 
and commercial capability. Over the  
past decade, we have developed strong 
commercial franchises that address 
respiratory, cardiovascular, oncology  
and neuroscience diseases. We continue 
to develop these strong therapeutic area 
positions: for example, Brilinta/Brilique 
and the diabetes portfolio we are 
commercialising jointly with BMS provide 
the next phase of development for our 
cardiovascular and metabolic disease 
franchise. We have strong commercial 
capability in developing, marketing and 
selling primary care, specialty care-led 
and specialty care products.
 > Strong Emerging Markets presence. We 
combine global reach with local customer 
relationships. We do this particularly well 
in Emerging Markets, where we invested 
early and where our decentralised 
approach to sales and marketing has 
allowed us to develop and act on local 
customer insight. For example, we are the 
second largest pharmaceutical company 
in China by sales.
As we look ahead, the future success of  
an innovation-driven R&D-based business 
such as AstraZeneca must be based on the 
twin foundations of a focus on patients and 
great science. We are one of only a handful 
of companies to span the entire life-cycle  
of a medicine from discovery, early and 
late-stage development to the global 
commercialisation of primary care, specialty 
care-led and specialty care medicines. 
Using these skills and capabilities we can 
make a real difference to the health of a 
broad range of patients in disease areas 
where there is unmet medical need in  
more than 100 markets around the  
world. We also harness these skills and 
capabilities in partnership with others,  
such as the relationships we have with  
BMS and Amgen.
Health connects us all
We know we cannot deliver on our 
commitment to improve healthcare on our 
own. We work closely with others in the 
healthcare community to understand their 
needs and challenges, and how we can 
combine skills and resources to achieve 
common goals. To be able to do this, 
people must have conﬁdence in both what 
we do and how we do it. We know that their 
trust depends on us acting with integrity 
and staying true to our core values.
The principles of Courage, Collaboration 
and Creativity frame our values. They 
describe what we stand for as a company, 
and the behaviours we need to demonstrate 
to achieve our strategic priorities. These 
values reﬂect our belief that health connects 
us all. They guide our actions and shape  
the culture that underpins our drive for 
business success.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 16
On the supply side, the industry faces an 
ongoing and signiﬁcant R&D productivity 
challenge. R&D costs have risen signiﬁcantly 
over the past decade, while industry-wide 
probability of success from pre-clinical to 
launch continues to decline. For example, 
the median large pharmaceutical company 
success rate for 2007 to 2011 in delivering  
a compound from pre-clinical studies  
to launch was 2%. These factors are 
considered in more detail below.
The industry remains highly competitive. 
Our competitors are other large research-
based pharmaceutical companies that 
discover, develop and sell innovative, 
patent-protected prescription medicines 
and vaccines, as well as smaller 
biotechnology and vaccine companies, and 
companies that produce generic medicines. 
While many of our peers are confronting 
similar challenges, strategically these 
challenges are being met in different ways. 
For example, while some companies have 
pursued a focused strategy, others have 
diversiﬁed by acquiring or building branded 
generics businesses or consumer portfolios, 
arguing that this enables them to better 
meet changing customer needs and 
smooth risk for shareholders. 
While most companies continued to pursue 
their existing strategies in 2012, there were 
exceptions with some companies moving 
away from diversiﬁcation. Key trends across 
the industry included ongoing efforts to 
improve R&D innovation and productivity, 
expansion of geographic scope, especially 
in Emerging Markets and Japan, and the 
pursuit of operational efﬁciency. There  
was an increase in business development 
and partnering at all stages of product 
development, with a continued increase  
in peer collaboration.
Our industry
Introduction
The pharmaceutical industry has doubled  
in value since 2000, driven by a large 
number of FDA approvals in the second half 
of the 1990s and by the increased use of 
medicines around the world in the wake  
of global economic growth in that period. 
Now, many of the drivers of demand and 
supply in the industry are under pressure. 
Nonetheless, as the ﬁgure above shows,  
the world pharmaceutical market grew by 
2.5% in 2012. Average revenue growth in 
Established Markets was 1.5% while that  
in Emerging Markets was over seven times 
higher at 11.1%. The top ﬁve pharmaceutical 
markets in the world remained the US, 
Japan, Germany, France and China, with 
the US representing 39.3% of global 
pharmaceutical sales (2011: 38.1%). 
On the demand side, underlying 
demographic trends remain favourable  
to long-term industry growth. These  
are outlined below. However, securing 
recognition (through reimbursement 
approval) and reward (through favourable 
pricing and sales) for innovation is becoming 
more difﬁcult, as there are intensifying 
pricing pressures, particularly in Established 
Markets which are facing rising healthcare 
costs. Our challenge is to work with 
governments and other payers to ensure 
they understand the value of pharmaceutical 
innovation in order for us to achieve 
adequate commercial returns on our 
investment. We also face increased 
competition from generic medicines as 
some of the world’s most successful drugs 
come off patent. Finally, greater regulatory 
constraints are being placed on the 
pharmaceutical industry by governments 
and those who pay for medicines. 
Growth drivers
Expanding patient populations
The world population is expected to rise 
from its current level of some seven billion 
and reach nine billion by 2050. In addition, 
the number of people who can access 
healthcare continues to increase, particularly 
among the elderly. Globally, it is estimated 
that between 2000 and 2050, the number 
of people aged 60 years and over will 
increase from 605 million to two billion.
Faster-developing economies, such  
as China, India and Brazil, offer new 
opportunities for the pharmaceutical 
industry to help an expanding number of 
patients who can beneﬁt from innovative 
medicines. Developing markets now 
represent approximately 85% of the world 
population and over 22% of the world’s 
pharmaceutical revenues. Pharmaceutical 
revenues in those markets therefore 
continued to grow faster than those  
in Established Markets in 2012. As the 
Estimated pharmaceutical market growth 
2011-2016 ﬁgure on page 20 shows,  
we expect this trend will continue. 
Unmet medical need
In most developed markets, ageing 
populations and certain lifestyle choices 
such as smoking, a poor diet and lack of 
exercise drive an increased incidence of 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such 
as cancer, cardiovascular/metabolic and 
respiratory diseases which require long-term 
management. In 2008, almost two-thirds of 
deaths globally were from NCDs and 80% 
of those were in lower and middle income 
countries. For example, in South Asia  
it is estimated that deaths from NCDs will 
increase from half to almost three-quarters 
of all deaths between 2008 and 2030. It is 
also estimated that nearly one-third of the 
world’s diabetes patients will come from

Advances in science and technology 
Innovation leading to new drugs is critical  
if we are to address unmet medical need. 
Existing drugs will continue to be important 
in meeting the growing demand for 
healthcare, particularly with the increasing 
use of generic medication. At the same 
time, advances in disease understanding 
and the application of new technologies  
will be required to ensure the delivery of  
new medicines. Such approaches include 
personalised healthcare and predictive 
science, as well as new types of therapy. 
With advances in the technologies for the 
design and testing of novel compounds, 
new opportunities exist for the use of 
innovative small molecules as new 
medicines. The use of large molecules,  
or biologics, has also become an important 
source of innovation, with biologics among 
the most commercially successful new 
products. Forecasts for 2018 predict  
that of the world’s top 100 pharmaceutical 
products, 49% of sales will come from 
biologics. This compares with only 34%  
in 201 1 and 1 7% in 2004. Most pharmaceutical 
companies now pursue R&D in both small 
molecules and biologics.
The challenges
R&D productivity
Improving R&D productivity is a critical 
challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. 
As shown in the diagram above, global 
investment in pharmaceutical R&D reached 
an estimated $134 billion in 2012, a 94% 
increase from $69 billion in 2002. However, 
the annual growth in R&D spend has 
slowed in recent years.
The number of new drugs approved by  
the FDA rose from 30 in 2011 to 39 in  
2012. This marks the greatest increase in 
annual approvals since 2004. However, the 
average forecast sales from these products 
ﬁve years post-launch is lower than the 
forecasts for products approved in 2010, 
reﬂecting the shift away from broad primary 
care indications to more specialist drugs.
To ensure it delivers a sustainable return on 
its R&D investment, the industry is working 
to increase its probability of success in 
developing commercially viable new drugs 
and is moving to a lower, more ﬂexible cost 
base. It does so at a time when regulators 
and payers are demanding more and better 
evidence of comparative effectiveness of 
compounds, which lengthens development 
times and increases development costs. 
The industry is using the full range of 
innovative technologies to achieve and 
accelerate product approvals. Additionally, 
greater emphasis has been placed on 
demonstrating Proof of Concept, which 
delivers candidate drugs with supporting 
data demonstrating that the drug results  
in a clinical change with an acceptable 
endpoint or surrogate in patients with  
the disease.
Organisationally, companies are addressing 
productivity challenges in a variety of ways. 
These include:
 > focusing on a deﬁned set of therapeutic 
areas and exiting those where success 
has been poor 
 > restructuring R&D organisations  
to create clearer accountabilities and 
smaller, more entrepreneurial units
 > revamping decision making and 
governance, so that unsuccessful 
compounds are identiﬁed early, before 
signiﬁcant costs have been incurred 
 > reducing costs and improving process 
efﬁciency, using Lean business 
improvement tools such as Six Sigma  
and outsourcing 
 > a collaboration-centric business model 
that includes academic collaborations 
and co-development agreements that 
provide for the sharing of development 
risks and costs with external partners
 > looking externally for high quality science, 
technologies, targets, drug candidates, 
and/or entire drug pipelines.
Regulatory requirements 
Our industry continues to be highly 
regulated. This reﬂects public interest in 
ensuring access to safe, effective and high 
quality medicines that are responsibly 
tested, manufactured and commercialised. 
Given the nature and geographic scope  
of our business, we maintain important 
relationships with health authorities 
worldwide as they assess the safety, 
efﬁcacy and quality of medicines. These 
include the FDA in the US, the EMA in the 
EU, the Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical 
Device Agency and the SFDA in China.
In 2012, the US re-authorised the Prescription 
Drug User Fee Act and the EU continued  
to implement pharmacovigilance legislation. 
These measures share the common goals 
of protecting patient safety, creating greater 
transparency in the regulatory process 
throughout a product’s life-cycle and taking 
greater account of the patient perspective  
in the regulatory process. There is also  
a global trend, led by the EU, to increase 
public access to the documentation 
companies submit to health authorities  
in support of marketing authorisations.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 18
In another trend, health technology 
assessors and payers are increasingly 
assessing not only the safety of products  
but also their relative effectiveness  
and value. Consequently, there is a 
heightened interest by health authorities  
in both comparative clinical effectiveness  
and the ongoing beneﬁt/risk assessment  
of medicines after they have been  
approved. This is resulting in a greater  
focus on incorporating validated health 
outcome measures into clinical  
trials and the development of clinical 
comparative evidence. 
However, it remains the case that when 
applications are supported by strong data 
and compelling beneﬁt/risk propositions, 
regulators are approving drugs that address 
unmet medical need. 
Pricing pressure
The pricing and reimbursement environment 
in many markets continues to be highly 
challenging. Most pharmaceutical sales are 
generated in highly regulated markets where 
governments and private payers, such as 
insurance companies, exert various levels  
of control on pricing and reimbursement. 
Cost-containment, including containment  
of spending on pharmaceuticals, continues 
to be a focus. A wave of austerity 
programmes following the current global 
economic downturn further constrain 
healthcare providers and tougher economic 
conditions constrain those patients who  
pay directly for their medicines. Additional 
challenges may arise if suppliers and 
distributors face credit-related difﬁculties.  
At the same time, signiﬁcant extra resources 
are required by pharmaceutical companies 
to demonstrate to payers the economic  
as well as therapeutic value of medicines.
So far as the development of biosimilars  
is concerned, health authorities continue  
to face the challenge of developing  
robust standards to ensure their safety, 
effectiveness and quality. For further 
information on biosimilars, see the Patent 
expiries and genericisation section below.
Efforts to harmonise regulations globally 
continue, yet the number of regulations  
and their impact continue to multiply.  
Clinical trials that support the registration  
of products in a given regulatory jurisdiction 
must be relevant to a variety of patient 
demographics. Programmes using foreign 
clinical trial data also need to meet each 
individual health authority’s requirements 
and be relevant to their population. Health 
authorities continue to redeﬁne patient 
safety assessment processes. In addition,  
in emerging pharmaceutical markets,  
health authorities are developing their own 
individual requirements and safety initiatives. 
One impact of the growing complexity  
and globalisation of clinical studies, and  
the pressure on industry and healthcare 
budgets, has been an increase in industry 
collaborations with health authorities. These 
are driving innovation and streamlining 
regulatory processes, as well as deﬁning  
and clarifying approval requirements for  
new technology and approaches such  
as personalised healthcare. They are also 
accelerating the development of treatments 
that address public health priorities. 
In 2012, pressures on pricing included  
the implementation of a variety of drug  
price control mechanisms and other 
regulatory reforms, as well as the 
introduction of ﬁxed hospital tariffs which  
can act as a method of controlling drug  
costs by incentivising hospitals to choose  
cheaper generic alternatives over 
patent-protected medicines.
In the US, the Affordable Care Act has 
already had a direct impact on healthcare 
activities despite the fact that many of the 
healthcare coverage expansion provisions 
of the Affordable Care Act do not take  
effect until 2014. For example, in 2010 there 
was an increase in the mandatory Medicaid 
rebates. In addition, the pharmaceutical 
industry, including AstraZeneca, is making 
prescription drugs more affordable to senior 
citizens through, for example, helping  
to close the coverage gap in the Medicare  
Part D prescription drug programme.  
The industry continues to work with 
policymakers and regulators with a view  
to ensuring that they strike a balance 
between containing costs, improving 
outcomes and promoting an environment 
that fosters medical innovation.
In August 2011, as part of the bipartisan 
agreement to raise the federal debt  
ceiling, the US Congress created  
the Joint Select Committee on Deﬁcit  
Reduction (Committee). The Committee 
was empowered to recommend a  
package of $1.2 trillion in cost savings  
with the requirement that, if the Committee 
failed to reach an agreement, the savings 
would be achieved through across  
the board spending cuts (sequestration).

Performance Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Strategy Overview
The Committee discussions ended without 
reaching an agreement and, barring future 
action by Congress, sequestration was to 
take effect on 2 January 2013. Sequestration 
would have impacted most federal 
government healthcare programmes with 
broad reductions in federal government 
spending. On 3 January 2013, President 
Barack Obama signed a bill that avoided 
sequestration. The bill allowed the US 
Congress and the President an additional 
two months to address the sequestration 
challenge. As Congress and the President 
continue to discuss how to reduce 
government expenditure, some policymakers 
may look to the pharmaceutical industry to 
help achieve the cost savings they seek.
In Europe, governments have issued  
new legislation on mandatory discounts, 
clawbacks and referencing rules, driving 
prices down, especially in the distressed 
economies of Greece, Portugal and Spain. 
It has been estimated that in Greece, 
Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain the 
pharmaceutical industry accommodated 
price cuts and discounts of more than  
€7 billion in 2010 and 2011, which amounted 
to 8% of the industry’s turnover in these 
countries. In Germany, Europe’s largest 
pharmaceutical market, manufacturers are 
now required to prove the additional beneﬁt 
of their drugs over existing alternatives. Only 
by showing additional beneﬁt can the drug 
avoid being transferred to the German 
reference pricing system, where, for each 
drug group, a single reimbursement level  
or reference price is set.
Elsewhere, in China, the triennial maximum 
retail drug price review took place in 2012, 
with more stringent rules being imposed 
compared with previous rounds of cuts, 
while in Japan biennial cuts are expected  
to continue. In Latin America, pricing  
is increasingly controlled by governments,  
for example in Colombia and Venezuela. 
More information regarding the impact  
of price controls and reductions, as well  
as the impact of healthcare reform in the 
US, can be found in the Principal risks  
and uncertainties section from page 75.  
The principal aspects of price regulation  
in our major markets are described further 
in the Geographical Review from page 70.
Patent expiries and genericisation
We are in the middle of a period in which 
some of the biggest selling drugs the 
industry has ever produced face patent 
expiry. As a consequence, payers, 
physicians and patients in Established 
Markets will have access to low price, 
generic alternatives in many important 
classes of primary care drugs. For example, 
in the US in 2012, generics constituted  
84% of the market by volume. 
Patents only protect pharmaceutical 
products for a ﬁnite period and the expiry  
or early loss of patents often leads to the 
availability of generics. Generic versions of 
drugs are very competitive with signiﬁcantly 
lower pricing than the innovator equivalents. 
This is partly due to lower investment by 
generic manufacturers in R&D and market 
development. While generic competition 
has traditionally occurred when patents 
expire, it can also occur where the validity  
of patents is disputed or successfully 
challenged before expiry. Such early 
challenges by generics have increased  
with generics companies increasingly  
willing to launch products ‘at risk’, for 
example, prior to resolution of the relevant 
patent litigation. This trend is likely to 
continue, resulting in signiﬁcant market 
presence for the generic version during  
the period in which litigation remains 
unresolved, even though the courts  
may subsequently rule that the innovative 
product is properly protected by a valid 
patent. The unpredictable nature of  
patent litigation has led innovators to  
seek to settle such challenges on terms 
acceptable to both innovator and generic 
manufacturer. However, some competition 
authorities have sought to challenge the 
scope and/or availability of this type of 
settlement agreement. 
Biologics have, to date, sustained longer 
life-cycles than traditional small molecule 
pharmaceuticals and have faced less 
generic competition. This is due to  
a more complex manufacturing process  
for biologics compared with small molecule 
medicines. It is also due to the inherent 
difﬁculties in producing a biosimilar which, 
as a biological equivalent, rather than  
an exact chemical copy, could require 
additional clinical trials. However, with 
regulatory authorities in Europe and the  
US continuing to implement abbreviated 
approvals pathways for biosimilar versions, 
innovative biologics are likely to become 
increasingly subject to competition  
from biosimilars.

economic growth, especially in Emerging 
Markets. While the hurdles to adopting new 
products have been raised, there remains  
a willingness to pay for differentiated, 
innovative medicines.
We further believe that AstraZeneca has  
the skills and capabilities to take advantage 
of these opportunities and turn them into 
long-term value. We will do this by exploiting 
and further developing our competitive 
advantage: an innovation and science-led 
organisation capturing the best of biologics, 
small molecules, immunotherapies and 
antibody engineering.
Our revised strategy is to compete as  
a global biopharmaceutical business 
delivering great medicines to patients 
through innovative science and excellence 
in development and commercialisation:
 > global – in that we believe we combine 
global reach with local customer 
relationships and have the ability  
to meet healthcare needs in both 
developed and developing markets 
efﬁciently and effectively
 > biopharmaceutical – in that we will 
develop both chemical (small molecule) 
and biological (large molecule) medicines 
available by prescription, targeting those 
product categories where medical 
innovation or brand equity will continue  
to enable us to make acceptable levels  
of return on our investments
Building trust
The pharmaceutical industry faces a 
challenge in building and maintaining  
trust, particularly with governments and 
regulators. The last 10 years have seen  
a signiﬁcant increase in the number of 
settlements between innovator companies 
and governmental and regulatory authorities 
for violations of a variety of laws. These 
include breaches of sales and marketing 
practices, inducements of physicians to 
administer a company’s products and 
breaches of anti-trust legislation. For  
some audiences, there is a perception  
that pharmaceutical companies place  
their commercial goals above the interests  
of patients, physicians and payers. 
Companies are taking steps to change  
this perception by embedding a culture  
of ethics and integrity, adopting higher 
standards of governance and improving 
relationships with employees, shareholders 
and other stakeholders. 
Our strategy 
AstraZeneca’s mission is to make the most 
meaningful difference to health through 
great medicines. 
Our strategic review has conﬁrmed our 
belief that biopharmaceuticals remain an 
attractive business, with strong underlying 
drivers of demand: expanding and ageing 
populations, a growing chronic disease 
burden, and increasing wealth through 
 > innovative science – in that we believe  
that innovative science must be the 
foundation for procuring differentiated, 
novel medicines that beneﬁt patients  
and for which payers will pay
 > excellence in development and 
commercialisation – in that we believe  
we have strong commercial franchises 
and capability in developing, marketing 
and selling primary care, specialty 
care-led and specialty care products.
We are currently completing the strategic 
review that we began in 2012. We plan to 
hold a Capital Markets Day in March 2013  
to provide a more detailed exposition  
of our strategic priorities.
Changes to the Senior Executive Team
In January 2013, we unveiled changes to 
our Senior Executive Team that came into 
immediate effect. Membership of the SET 
has been expanded to include increased 
representation of AstraZeneca’s scientiﬁc 
expertise, key products and key markets. 
Changes included the creation of:
 > three senior R&D roles responsible for 
discovery and early-stage development  
in small molecules; discovery and 
early-stage development in biologics;  
and late-stage development
 > three roles representing the commercial 
regions: North America; Europe; and

Restructuring
Since 2007 , we have undertaken signiﬁcant 
efforts to restructure and reshape our 
business to improve long-term 
competitiveness.
The ﬁrst phase was completed in 2009.
The second phase, which featured a 
signiﬁcant change programme in R&D, 
began in 2010. The restructuring actions  
for this phase of the programme were 
completed in 2011, at a total programme 
cost of $2.1 billion. Headcount changes 
associated with this phase, involving an 
estimated 9,000 positions, were also 
completed. Total annual beneﬁts of  
$1.9 billion were to be delivered by the  
end of 2014 in connection with this phase  
of the programme, of which $1.5 billion  
had been achieved by the end of 2012. 
A third phase of restructuring was 
announced in February 2012. This  
phase, comprising initiatives across the 
supply chain, SG&A and R&D, carries an 
estimated programme cost of $2.1 billion 
(approximately $1.7 billion in cash costs). 
Restructuring costs of $1,558 million 
associated with this third phase were  
taken in 2012, together with $261 million 
that was charged in the fourth quarter  
of 2011. Most of the remaining costs of 
approximately $300 million will be taken  
in 2013. To date, actions involving around 
6,300 of the estimated 7 ,300 positions  
to be impacted in connection with this 
phase of the programme have been 
completed. When completed, this phase  
is expected to deliver an estimated  
$1.6 billion in annual beneﬁts by the  
end of 2014, of which approximately  
$350 million was realised by the end  
of 2012. 
These restructuring programmes have  
been delivering their targeted beneﬁts,  
and are designed to continue to provide the 
headroom to make appropriate investments 
to drive future growth and value, such as 
Emerging Markets commercial infrastructure 
and expansion of our research capabilities 
in biologics.
Medium-term planning assumptions
We believe challenging market conditions 
will persist in 2013, including continued 
government interventions in price. The 
revenue impact from the loss of exclusivity 
will also continue to affect our performance. 
In the context of the ongoing update to  
our strategy, we have withdrawn the 
planning assumptions for revenue and 
margin evolution for the period 2010 to 201 4 
that we had outlined in January 2010.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 22
Healthcare systems around the world are under pressure, working with limited 
resources to meet the growing demand for healthcare. 
Innovative medicines offer beneﬁts that go beyond improving patient outcomes, helping to deliver economic efﬁciencies and supporting 
more effective allocation of scarce resources. For example, the introduction of antacid H 2-receptors followed by proton-pump 
inhibitors had an almost overnight impact on the cost of surgery by eliminating the need for many gastric operations and follow-up 
post-operative care. The redundancy of surgical intervention freed up resources to be invested more efﬁciently elsewhere. The 
decrease in costs associated with hospital care for cardiovascular diseases is estimated to be almost four times larger than the 
increase in costs of cardiovascular medicines that deliver improved patient outcomes and overall efﬁciencies for healthcare systems.

Our performance in 2012
In the previous section of this Annual Report, we reviewed our model  
for creating value, the environment in which we operate and our strategic 
response, as a global biopharmaceutical business delivering great 
medicines to patients through innovative science and excellence  
in development and commercialisation. In this section, we review  
our progress towards achieving our priorities in 2012. 
Business Review 
This section includes information that fulﬁls 
the requirements of a business review under 
the Companies Act 2006. The Strategy, 
Corporate Governance, Development 
Pipeline and Shareholder Information 
sections from pages 12, 106, 199, and  
203, respectively, are incorporated into  
this section. Details of the more signiﬁcant 
risks to AstraZeneca are set out in the 
Principal risks and uncertainties section 
from page 75. Many of our products are 
subject to litigation. Information about 
material legal proceedings can be found  
in Note 25 to the Financial Statements  
from page 184. References to prevalence  
of disease have been derived from a variety 
of sources and are not intended to be 
indicative of the current market or any 
potential market for AstraZeneca’s 
pharmaceutical products since, among 
other things, there may be no correlation 
between the prevalence of disease and  
the number of individuals who are treated 
for such a disease.
Our priorities in 2012
 > Pipeline discovery and development  
of innovative, differentiated and 
commercially attractive medicines.  
We are transforming our R&D 
organisation to improve productivity  
and pioneering innovative ways of 
conducting research. We continue  
to focus on improving the quantity  
and quality of R&D output by building 
industry-leading capabilities in critical 
areas and being an outward-looking 
organisation, accessing the best  
science, regardless of origin.
 > Deliver the business sales and 
marketing activities focused on the  
needs of our customers: patients, 
physicians and payers, and undertaken  
in the right way. We continue to build  
on our leading positions in Established 
Markets, to introduce innovative ways  
of serving our customers and pursue 
further growth opportunities in Emerging 
Markets. We have accelerated our  
efforts to secure late-stage/on-market 
product licensing, acquisition and peer 
collaboration opportunities in order  
to leverage our global development, 
resources, and sales and marketing 
capabilities to bring a broader portfolio  
of medicines to patients.
 > Business shape a reliable supply  
and manufacturing operation, and  
Lean organisational infrastructure that 
ensure our medicines are where they 
need to be when they are needed.  
Given the pressures in the external 
environment, we continue to simplify  
the business. Simpliﬁcation means  
not only cost reduction, but also 
streamlining processes and shifting  
to a more ﬂexible cost base.
 > People a talented and diverse  
workforce with the right capabilities 
operating in a high performance culture  
is critical to the successful achievement  
of our strategic priorities.
 > Responsible business our commitment 
to enhancing the sustainability of our 
business by operating responsibly. Our 
Responsible Business Plan underpins  
our work and provides the framework  
for applying integrity and high ethical 
standards across all our activities.
Our performance
Within AstraZeneca, each business  
function is subject to an annual budget  
and target-setting process that includes 
developing ﬁnancial and business forecasts, 
conducting sensitivity and risk analyses,  
and setting relevant objectives. Regular 
reviews are undertaken in order to monitor 
and assess progress against business  
and budget targets. During the year  
we also sought to manage the business 
appropriately, both to optimise our 
opportunities and to assess key risks  
and mitigating actions. Quarterly reports 
provide the SET and the Board with  
insight into progress against current year 
objectives and milestones for longer-term 
strategic goals. We assess performance 
using quantitative, comparative market, 
operational and ﬁnancial measures, and 
qualitative analysis.
We have developed KPIs by which we 
measure our success in delivering our 
strategy. A description of our KPIs and  
how we performed against them in 2012

Research and Development
The discovery and development of 
innovative, differentiated and commercially 
attractive medicines that make a real 
difference to the health of patients 
As a research-based biopharmaceutical 
company, we are committed to applying 
innovative science and technology to 
invent, acquire, produce and distribute 
prescription medicines that make a 
meaningful difference to people’s health 
around the world. This commitment is  
at the core of our R&D strategy. It drives  
our focus to create medicines that are 
valued by patients and that also recognise 
the needs of healthcare practitioners, 
governments, payers and other stakeholders 
throughout the healthcare system.
We invest in high quality science while 
developing a learning-based culture which 
is built on high standards of leadership, 
ethics and transparency. 
Focused R&D portfolio 
We continue to prioritise our resources  
and focus discovery activities on those 
diseases within our existing Therapy Areas 
where we believe there is the greatest 
potential to meet patient need through the 
application of novel science. This continual 
process of prioritisation is designed  
to ensure that the projects we have  
in our pipeline constitute the programmes 
which we believe are most likely to deliver 
technical and commercial success. 
In 2012, we continued our research focus 
on six Therapy Areas: Cardiovascular, 
Gastrointestinal, Neuroscience, Infection, 
Oncology and Respiratory & Inﬂammation. 
Early R&D efforts are conducted by our 
small molecules (Innovative Medicines)  
and biologics R&D groups, which are 
responsible for discovery and development 
up to and including Proof of Concept.  
Our Global Medicines Development (GMD) 
organisation progresses products through 
late-stage development, registration  
and ongoing post-launch development 
activities. The GMD organisation provides  
a consistent, global platform dedicated  
to conducting trials for small molecules and 
biologics. It is accountable for delivering the 
regulatory packages to support launches of 
new medicines that have a positive beneﬁt/
risk proﬁle that are commercially attractive 
and reimbursable. In addition to our deﬁned 
disease areas, we continuously assess 
opportunities to acquire, through purchase 
or partnership, development and 
commercialisation rights to compounds, 
targets and technologies.
In February 2012, as part of our accelerated 
R&D strategy, we created a virtual 
neuroscience Innovative Medicines unit 
(Virtual iMed) made up of a team of 
approximately 40 scientists conducting 
discovery and development externally 
through a network of partners in academia 
and industry. The team is based in our 
major neuroscience hubs – US (Cambridge, 
Massachusetts) and the UK (Cambridge) – 
and works closely with partners such  
as the Karolinska Institute in Sweden 
(Stockholm). The implementation of the 
Virtual iMed has resulted in the end of  
R&D activity at two sites that focused on 
neuroscience: in Sweden (Södertälje) and  
in Canada (Montreal). For more information 
about the Virtual iMed please see the 
Neuroscience section of the Therapy  
Area Review at page 61.
Development pipeline
Our pipeline includes 84 projects of which 
71 are in the clinical phase of development. 
As shown in the Development projects 
chart below, we now have a total of 29 
projects in Phase I, 25 projects in Phase II, 
11 projects in late-stage development, 
either in Phase III or under regulatory 
review, and we are running 19 signiﬁcant 
life-cycle management projects. 
“ 2012 was a productive year for R&D and I look forward to working 
with the new SET members to improve productivity further in both  
cost and output, and to build our capabilities in order to restore 
AstraZeneca to a position of scientiﬁc leadership.”

Development projects
During 2012, across the clinical portfolio,  
36 projects successfully progressed to  
their next phase (including 12 projects 
entering ﬁrst human testing). The Pipeline 
delivery table overleaf summarises the 
milestones for products in development 
passed in 2012. Ten projects have 
successfully completed development 
activities and have now been launched in  
all relevant major markets. Nineteen projects 
were withdrawn in 2012. One project was 
withdrawn following failure to obtain the 
required regulatory or marketing approvals 
for the product candidate or the facilities  
in which it is manufactured and 17 projects 
were withdrawn following poorer than 
anticipated safety or efﬁcacy results.  
One project was withdrawn due to the 
anticipated completion of the collaboration 
which supported that project. For more 
information about our pipeline, including 
discontinued and completed projects, see 
the Therapy Area Review and Development 
Pipeline section from page 50 and page  
199 respectively. For information about  
the risks inherent in the clinical phase of 
development, please see the Principal risks 
and uncertainties section from page 75. 
Portfolio quality
Our focus continues to be on identifying  
key candidate medicines that have the 
highest potential to deliver technical and 
commercial success. This includes an 
annual assessment of our early portfolio 
projects. By continuing to apply a rigorous 
quality approach to our candidate selection 
process, we expect to increase the likelihood 
that our most promising medicines progress 
into Phase III development. Our quality 
approach focuses on ensuring that every 
project in our pipeline has been assessed 
against a valid biological target, has sufﬁcient 
exposure to demonstrate an effect on the 
disease, and has a strong efﬁcacy and safety 
proﬁle in the intended patient population.
Our Portfolio Investment Board (PIB) plays 
an important role in maintaining portfolio 
quality. It continuously evaluates our 
projects with the goal of maximising the 
value of our R&D investments. More detail 
relating to the PIB’s responsibilities can be 
found in the Corporate Governance Report 
on page 119. 
For more information about our pipeline, 
including discontinued and completed 
projects, see the Development Pipeline 
section from page 199.
Our R&D approach
As demonstrated by the Life-cycle of a 
medicine diagram on page 14, our R&D 
activities span the entire life-cycle of a 
medicine. Our approach brings together 
drug discoverers and developers within 
each Therapy Area to focus and collaborate 
in speciﬁc disease areas, while continuing  
to leverage our expertise in late-stage 
development, product registration and 
life-cycle management. This model is 
designed to promote accountability  
and scientiﬁc knowledge-sharing within 
therapeutic areas. In addition, our R&D 
strategy enables more effective and  
efﬁcient delivery of our research objectives 
across the therapeutic portfolio, regardless 
of geography, disease area or stage  
of development. 
Partnering to improve health
We know that we cannot address the 
challenges of healthcare alone and scientiﬁc 
innovation does not exist solely within our 
own research laboratories. By engaging 
with partners across the healthcare delivery 
spectrum, we can stimulate more creativity 
and better develop medicines and solutions 
for patients. Our collaboration efforts have 
resulted in a combination of internally  
and externally sourced compounds 
throughout our portfolio, which include 
development partnerships with biotechnology 
ﬁrms, research institutions and other 
pharmaceutical companies. We aim to 
source at least 40% of our pipeline from 
outside our laboratories and we continued 
to deliver against this KPI in 2012 with 
external partnerships positively impacting 
our pipeline including: 
 > A collaboration with Amgen to jointly 
develop and commercialise ﬁve 
monoclonal antibodies from Amgen’s 
clinical inﬂammation portfolio including 
brodalumab.
 > The acquisition of Ardea and their  
Phase III development product candidate, 
lesinurad, as a potential treatment for the 
chronic management of hyperuricaemia 
in patients with gout.
 > An expansion of the diabetes alliance  
with BMS in connection with BMS’s 
acquisition of Amylin and the potential 
development and commercialisation of 
Amylin’s portfolio of products related to 
diabetes and other metabolic diseases, 
with a primary focus on a franchise of 
glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists (GLP-1 
agonists) for the treatment of Type 2 
diabetes. This includes Byetta (exenatide 
injection) and Bydureon (exenatide 
extended release for injectable suspension), 
both of which are approved for use in  
the US, Europe and Japan, and Symlin 
(pramlintide acetate), an injected amylin 
analogue, which is approved in the US. 
 > An innovative research alliance  
that brings four leading academic 
research laboratories together with 
AstraZeneca to study a major risk  
factor for Alzheimer’s disease, the 
apolipoprotein E4 genotype (ApoE).
 > The acquisition of a portfolio of 
neuroscience assets from Link  
Medicine Corporation, a privately held 
biopharmaceutical company developing 
potential new treatments for a range  
of neurodegenerative diseases.
 > A collaboration with the diagnostics 
division of Roche to develop companion 
diagnostics for selected products in 
development across all AstraZeneca 
Therapy Areas.
 > A worldwide exclusive licensing 
agreement with Ardelyx in respect of  
their NHE3 inhibitor programme for the 
treatment of complications associated 
with end-stage renal disease (ESRD)

Investing in capabilities
A component of our R&D strategy is 
strengthening four core capabilities.  
In 2010, we announced an investment  
of more than $200 million over ﬁve years  
to develop capabilities in the areas of  
payer partnering, personalised healthcare, 
predictive science and clinical design.  
We have made signiﬁcant progress  
in building these skills both internally  
and through external collaborations,  
and they are now fully integrated into  
most of our development programmes. 
 > A collaboration with the Cancer  
Research Institute and the Ludwig 
Institute for Cancer Research to advance 
the research of immunotherapy in cancer. 
Speciﬁcally, the research will focus on 
clinical trials to test novel combinations  
of immunotherapies, including three 
investigational MAbs.
 > A strategic alliance with Isis 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Isis) for the 
discovery and development of novel 
generation antisense therapeutics against 
ﬁve cancer targets, which includes a 
licence to develop and commercialise 
ISIS-STAT3RX, a drug Isis is currently 
evaluating in an early clinical trial in 
patients with advanced lymphomas.
We continue to search for opportunities to 
advance science and public health through 
research collaborations and partnerships. 
Initiatives that we announced in 2012 
include the following:
 > A collaboration with other pharmaceutical 
and biotechnology companies working 
alongside public partners in the 
NewDrugs4BadBugs research 
programme (part of the European 
Commission’s Action Plan Against  
the Rising Threats from Antimicrobial 
Resistance) which is intended to boost 
the current industry-wide faltering 
discovery and development of new 
antibiotics. 
 > A collaboration along with six other 
pharmaceutical companies and four 
research institutions, working with the  
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, with  
Our resources
At the end of 2012, our R&D organisation 
comprised approximately 9,800 people  
at 10 principal centres in six countries.  
In February 2012, we announced an 
acceleration of our R&D transformation 
originally announced in 2010. This included 
initiatives to cease R&D activities at our  
site in Sweden (Södertälje), and close our 
laboratories in Canada (Montreal), France 
(Reims) and the US (Mountain View, 
California) in 2012. These initiatives have 
impacted a total of approximately 2,200 
positions across the R&D organisation. 
Our approach to implementing such change 
is outlined in the Managing change in our 
organisation section on page 45. Further 
details are also set out in the Our strategy 
section from page 20.
Our current R&D geographic footprint 
includes four main small molecule facilities 
in: the UK (Alderley Park and Macclesﬁeld); 
Sweden (MöIndal); and the US (Waltham, 
Massachusetts). We also have a clinical 
development facility in Japan (Osaka). Our 
principal sites for biologics and vaccines  
are in the US (Gaithersburg, Maryland)  
and in the UK (Cambridge). Our Wilmington, 
Delaware site in the US focuses on late- 
stage development across the entire 
therapeutic portfolio. Our strategic expansion 
in Emerging Markets continues and includes 
the ongoing growth of our research facilities 
in China (Shanghai) and India (Bangalore).

Strategy Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance Overview
Before a trial begins, we work to make  
sure that those taking part understand  
the nature and purpose of the research  
and that proper procedure for gaining 
informed consent is followed (including 
managing any special circumstances, such  
as different levels of literacy). Protecting 
participants throughout the trial process  
is a core priority and we have strict 
procedures in place to ensure that they  
are not exposed to any unnecessary risks. 
All our clinical studies are conceptually 
designed and ﬁnally interpreted in-house 
but a percentage of them are run for us  
by contract research organisations (CROs).  
In 2012, around 31% of patients in our  
small molecule studies and around 87%  
of patients in our biologics studies were 
monitored by CROs on our behalf. We 
contractually require CROs to work to  
our global standards and we conduct 
risk-based audits to monitor compliance.
Animal research
†
Our commitment: to embrace, promote 
and embed scientiﬁc and technical best 
practice in animal research.
Our objective: to drive continuous 
improvement internally and engage with 
external providers on the implementation  
of AstraZeneca global standards for 
non-human primate housing and care. 
These include the following targets:
 > roll-out of AstraZeneca Good Statistical 
Practice (GSP) global standard and 
associated compliance monitoring
 > more than 80% of external providers  
of AstraZeneca non-human primate 
research studies are operating to 
AstraZeneca standards.
We remain committed to minimising our  
use of animals in our research without 
compromising the quality of the research 
data. Wherever possible, we use non-animal 
methods, such as computer modelling,  
that eliminate the need to use animals early 
in drug development or reduce the number 
required. We also work to reﬁne our existing 
methods. This replacement, reduction  
and reﬁnement of animal studies is known 
as ‘the 3Rs’. To support our drive for 
In 2012, there was Core R&D expenditure  
of $4.5 billion in our R&D organisation (201 1: 
$5 billion; 2010: $4.2 billion). In addition, 
$5,228 million was spent on acquiring 
product rights (such as in-licensing) (2011: 
$189 million; 2010: $1,017 million) and we 
invested approximately $791 million on the 
implementation of our R&D restructuring 
strategy. The allocations of spend by early 
development and late-stage activities  
are presented in the R&D spend analysis 
table opposite. 
R&D ethics
We want to be recognised for our high 
quality science and for the impact we  
can make on serious diseases, and  
to be trusted for the way we work. Our 
standards of R&D ethics are global and 
apply to all AstraZeneca research activity,  
in all locations, whether conducted  
by us or on our behalf by third parties. 
Clinical trials
†
Our commitment: to deliver consistently 
high standards of ethical practice and 
scientiﬁc conduct in all our trials worldwide 
and to public transparency on registration 
and results of all clinical trials, whether 
positive or negative.
Our objective: to be recognised as an 
industry leader in the publication and 
sharing of clinical trial information.
We conduct clinical trials at multiple  
sites in several different countries/regions  
as shown in the chart above. A broad 
geographic span helps us to ensure that 
those taking part in our studies reﬂect the 
diversity of patients around the world for 
whom the new medicine is intended. This 
approach also helps to identify the types  
of people for whom the treatment may be 
most beneﬁcial. 
Our global governance process for 
determining where we place clinical trials 
provides the framework for ensuring a 
consistent approach worldwide. We take 
several factors into account, including the 
availability of experienced and independent 
ethics committees and a robust regulatory 
regime, as well as sufﬁcient numbers  
of trained healthcare professionals and 
patients willing to participate in a trial.
continuous improvement, we work both 
within AstraZeneca and the wider scientiﬁc 
community to share the 3Rs knowledge 
and learning.
The number of animals we use will continue 
to vary because it depends on a number of 
factors, including the amount of pre-clinical 
research we are doing, the complexity of the 
diseases under investigation and regulatory 
requirements. We believe that, without our 
active commitment to the 3Rs, our animal 
use would be much greater. In 2012, we 
used approximately 304,000 animals in-house 
(2011: 381,000). In addition, approximately 
14,000 animals were used by external 
CROs on our behalf (2011: 17 ,000). Against 
our 2012 target of more than 80%, 85% of 
our externally-placed non-human primate 
studies met AstraZeneca standards in 2012. 
We will continue to progress towards our 
2013 target of 100% of our studies being 
conducted in facilities meeting AstraZeneca 
required standards.
The welfare of the animals we use continues 
to be a top priority and our Bioethics Policy 
applies worldwide. We routinely have 
inspections by government authorities of our 
internal animal research facilities. External 
CROs that conduct animal studies on our 
behalf are required to comply with our 
global standards and we undertake audits 
to ensure our expectations are being met. 
During 2012, we developed, launched  
and began implementation of standard 
operating procedures and guidance 
documents to underpin our new GSP  
global standard, developed in 201 1. These 
apply to our internal animal research  
and the launch included extensive training 
programmes for relevant scientists, 
technical staff and managers across  
the organisation.

including mechanisms for highlighting  
those that require immediate attention.  
We also work to ensure that accurate, 
well-informed and up-to-date information 
concerning the safety proﬁle of our drugs  
is provided to regulators, doctors, other 
healthcare professionals and, where 
appropriate, patients. 
A pharmacovigilance awareness 
programme was developed in 2012 and 
circulated to marketing companies, together 
with guidance about how the information 
should be shared with regulatory authorities 
in readiness for external enquiry. One such 
opportunity arose when SFDA (the Chinese 
health authority) met UMC (WHO Uppsala 
Monitoring Centre) and we were able to 
share our experience and thoughts around 
signal management.
We have an experienced, in-house team  
of clinical patient safety professionals 
dedicated to the task of ensuring that we 
meet our commitment to patient safety.  
Patient safety
†
Our commitment: the safety of the patients 
who take our medicines is of fundamental 
importance to us.
Our objective: to enhance 
pharmacovigilance awareness – including 
the use of collaborative programmes to 
share and use our knowledge and best 
practice in order to improve reporting and 
patient safety in developing countries.
All drugs have potential side effects and  
we aim to minimise the risks and maximise 
the beneﬁts of each of our medicines 
throughout the whole life-cycle of a 
medicine. We continually monitor the  
use of all our medicines to ensure that  
we become aware of any side effects not 
identiﬁed during the development process. 
This is known as pharmacovigilance and  
is core to our ongoing responsibility to 
patients. We have comprehensive and 
rigorous systems in place for detecting  
and rapidly evaluating such effects, 
At a global level, every medicine in 
development and on the market is allocated 
a Global Safety Physician and a team of 
patient safety scientists. In each of our 
markets we also have dedicated safety 
managers with responsibility for patient 
safety at a local level.
Our Chief Medical Ofﬁcer has overall 
accountability for the beneﬁt/risk proﬁles  
of the products we have in development 
and those on the market. He provides 
medical oversight and ensures that 
appropriate risk assessment processes  
are in place to enable informed decisions  
to be made about safety as quickly  
as possible.
Clinical trial transparency
AstraZeneca has a long-standing 
commitment to making information  
about our clinical research publicly 
available to enhance the scientiﬁc 
understanding of how our medicines  
work and in the medical interest of 
patients. By the end of 2012, we had 
registered 2,050 clinical trials and  
posted the results of 1,360 trials  
on a range of public websites including  
our own dedicated clinical trials website, 
astrazenecaclinicaltrials.com.
We publish information on the  
registration and results of all new and 
ongoing AstraZeneca-sponsored  
clinical trials for all products in all phases, 
including marketed medicines, drugs in 
development and drugs whose further 
development has been discontinued.  
We post results, irrespective of whether 
they are favourable or unfavourable  
to AstraZeneca. 
 > Our disclosure policy goes beyond  
legal requirements, which currently 
require publication for Phase II studies 
onwards only.
 > From 15 January 2013, we are 
voluntarily disclosing the research 
protocol for our clinical trials on 
astrazenecaclinicaltrials.com  
once a manuscript relating to an 
investigational or approved product  
is published in a peer-reviewed  
medical journal.
These disclosure requirements are  
set out in our Bioethics Policy and 
compliance is mandatory across  
the Group.
We consider requests for patient-level 
data from other parties on a case-by-case 
basis, following consistent criteria to 
establish if, and how, the information 
provided will be used for valid scientiﬁc 
purposes and to beneﬁt patients.
Calls for ‘open access’ to clinical data 
raise complex practical, legal and ethical 
issues around full disclosure of patient 
information. Decision makers, as well  
as academia and industry, have a duty  
to consider all the implications that could 
arise from such proposals. These include 
ensuring scientiﬁc rigour, safeguarding 
patient privacy and protecting innovation 
and medical progress. We are engaging 
with regulators, legislators, industry, and 
medical and scientiﬁc bodies to discuss 
the issues raised by the proposals to 
routinely publish full clinical trial and 
patient data so we can collectively identify 
practicable solutions that deliver real 
beneﬁts to medical science and patients.

Intellectual Property
A well-functioning system  
of intellectual property rights 
“ A period of patent protection is essential in allowing us to achieve  
a return on our investment in innovation. Our challenge is to refresh  
our portfolio of patented products and offset the impact when that 
protection is lost.” 
Jeff Pott General Counsel
be to the validity of a patent and/or to the 
effective scope of a patent and are based 
on ever-evolving legal precedents. There can 
be no guarantee of success for either party 
in patent proceedings. For information 
about third party challenges to the patents 
protecting our products, see Note 25  
to the Financial Statements from page 184.
The basic term of a patent is typically 20 
years from the ﬁling of the patent application 
with the relevant government patent  
ofﬁce. However, the product protected  
by a pharmaceutical patent may not be 
marketed for several years after patent ﬁling 
due to the time required for clinical trials and 
the regulatory approval process necessary 
to obtain marketing approval for the product. 
Patent Term Extensions (PTE) are available 
in certain major markets including the EU 
and US to compensate for these delays. 
The term of the PTE can vary from zero  
to ﬁve years depending on the time taken  
to obtain any marketing approval. The 
maximum patent term, when including PTE, 
cannot exceed 15 years (EU) or 14 years 
(US) from the ﬁrst marketing authorisation.
The generic industry is increasingly 
challenging innovators’ patents at  
earlier stages and almost all leading 
pharmaceutical products in the US have 
faced or are facing patent challenges from 
generic manufacturers. The result of patent 
challenges experienced by our competitors’ 
products may lead to the availability of 
generics in the same product class as 
patented products we currently supply, 
which may materially impact our business. 
We are also experiencing increased 
challenges elsewhere in the world, for 
example in Europe, Canada, Asia and  
Latin America. Further information about  
The discovery and development of  
a new medicine requires a signiﬁcant 
investment of resources by research-based 
pharmaceutical companies over a period  
of 10 or more years. For this to be a viable 
investment, the results, new medicines, 
must be safeguarded from being copied 
with a reasonable amount of certainty  
for a reasonable period of time.
The principal economic safeguard in our 
industry is a well-functioning patent system 
that recognises our effort and rewards  
our innovation with appropriate protection, 
allowing time to generate the revenue we 
need to reinvest in new pharmaceutical 
innovation. Patent rights are limited by 
territory and duration, yet a signiﬁcant 
period of this time can be spent on R&D  
of our products before product launch. 
Therefore, we commit signiﬁcant resources 
to establishing and defending our patent 
and related IP protections for these inventions.
Patent process
We ﬁle applications for patent protection  
for our inventions to safeguard the large 
subsequent investment required to obtain 
approval of potential new drugs for 
marketing. Further innovation means that 
we may seek additional patent protection  
as we develop a product and its uses.  
We apply for patents via patent ofﬁces 
around the world which assess whether  
our inventions meet the strict legal 
requirements for a patent to be granted.  
In some countries, our competitors can 
challenge our patents in the patent ofﬁces, 
and, in all countries, competitors can 
challenge our patents in the courts.  
We can face challenges early in the patent 
application process and throughout the  
life of the patent. These challenges can

Patent expiries
The tables overleaf set out certain patent 
expiry dates and sales for our key marketed 
products. The expiry dates relate to the 
basic substance patent relevant to that 
product unless indicated otherwise. The 
expiry dates shown include any PTE and 
Paediatric Exclusivity periods. 
Data exclusivity
In addition to patent protection, Regulatory 
Data Protection (RDP or ‘data exclusivity’)  
is an important IP right which arises in 
respect of data which is required to be 
submitted to regulatory authorities in order 
to obtain marketing approvals for our 
medicines. Signiﬁcant investment is required 
to generate such data (for example, through 
conducting global clinical trials) and the  
use of this proprietary data is protected  
from use by third parties (such as generic 
manufacturers) for a number of years in  
a limited number of countries. The period  
of such protection and the extent to which 
the right is respected differs signiﬁcantly 
between these countries. We believe in 
enforcing our rights to RDP and consider  
it an important protection for our products, 
particularly as patent rights are increasingly 
being challenged.
The period of RDP starts from the date  
of the ﬁrst marketing approval from the 
relevant health authority and runs in parallel 
to any pending patent protection. RDP  
would generally be expected to expire prior 
to patent expiry in all major markets.

to secure marketing approval or if patent 
protection has not been secured, has

the sole IP right protecting a product from 
copying, as generics should not be allowed

Compulsory licensing
Compulsory licensing (the over-ruling of 
patent rights to allow patented medicines  
to be manufactured and sold by other 
parties) is increasingly being included in the 
access to medicines debate. We recognise 
the right of developing countries to use the 
ﬂexibilities in the World Trade Organization’s 
Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of 
Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)  
(including the Doha amendment) in certain 
circumstances, such as a public health 
emergency. We believe that this should apply 
only when all other ways of meeting the 
emergency needs have been considered 
and where healthcare frameworks and 
safeguards are in place to ensure that the 
medicines reach those who need them. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 37

Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing activities focused  
on the needs of our customers: patients, 
physicians and payers, and undertaken  
in the right way
“ As anticipated, our performance in 2012 was impacted by  
a series of patent expiries. I will be working with the new 
commercial SET members to invest in key growth platforms  
which are essential if the Group is to return to revenue growth.” 
Pascal Soriot Chief Executive Ofﬁcer
If we are to improve the health of patients 
around the world, we need to ensure that 
the right medicines are available and help 
improve access to them. To that end, our 
global sales and marketing organisation is 
active in over 100 countries. At the end of 
2012, it comprised approximately 30,200 
employees. As well as building on our 
leading positions in commercialising our 
medicines in the US and Other Established 
Markets, we continue to increase our ability 
to serve customers in Emerging Markets 
including China, Brazil, Mexico and Russia. 
We work to ensure success in serving 
customers in individual markets by  
having highly accountable local leaders 
who understand their markets and have  
a strong focus on business growth. This 
extensive network is supported by our 
Global Sales and Marketing Organisation 
that develops global product strategies  
and drives commercial excellence, ensuring 
a strong customer focus and commercial 
direction in the management of our pipeline  
and marketed products. All our efforts  
are underpinned by a commitment to 
conducting our sales and marketing activity 
in accordance with our values and driving 
commercial success responsibly.
Driving commercial success
Driving commercial success requires us  
to maximise the value of our portfolio 
across the whole life-cycle of a medicine. 
We do so by connecting our science with 
our customers’ needs. From an early stage 
in the medicine discovery process we 
embed customer insights into our R&D 
strategy based on our interactions with 
healthcare providers, patients, regulators 
and payers. We build on this with our local 
market expertise and knowledge. This 
approach helps us to prioritise resources 
and optimise our portfolio, thereby 
delivering medicines that customers  
value and which meet their needs.
For an overview of this process, see  
the Life-cycle of a medicine diagram  
on page 14. 
Activities in 2012 focused on ensuring 
continued commercial excellence of key 
products in our established patented 
portfolio, such as Crestor , Seroquel XR  
and Symbicort, driving growth in 
developing markets and accelerating the 
commercialisation of recently launched 
products. Brilinta/Brilique has now been 
approved for use in hospitalised ACS 
patients in 88 countries, is reimbursed  
in 29, available in 33 patient pay markets 
and commercially launched in 82. Other 
recently launched products include 
Caprelsa, Zinforo and Forxiga. In the US, 
we also started promotion of Bydureon, 
Byetta and Symlin, the Amylin diabetes 
products that are part of our expanded 
diabetes alliance with BMS.
Working in partnership
Our commitment to collaboration is outlined 
in the Partnering to improve health section 
from page 31. This approach is further 
evidenced by our global collaboration 
agreement, announced in April 2012, with 
The Medicines Company, which has a 
strong network in interventional cardiology. 
In May, their salesforce began supporting 
Brilinta in the US, complementing our  
own efforts.
In August, we entered into an agreement 
with Pﬁzer pursuant to which Pﬁzer 
acquired the exclusive global rights to 
market Nexium for approved OTC indications. 
We will continue to manufacture and

Global strategies tailored  
to meet local needs
We focus on developing global strategies 
tailored to meet local needs and recognise 
that our commercial capabilities must  
evolve to meet future market requirements. 
The pace and degree of change in global 
economies and intensifying regulatory  
and access challenges have led us to  
look at ways of better and more efﬁciently 
addressing the changing needs and 
preferences of payers, prescribers and 
patients. In 2012, this effort included 
completing the regional consolidation  
of our Commercial organisation announced 
in 2011. Our streamlined operating model 
includes integrating our smaller local 
marketing companies into area clusters, 
allowing them to beneﬁt from global resources 
while staying local and concentrating  
on meeting local customer needs.
All our markets have a role to play in 
delivering our commercial strategy. We 
continue to prioritise investment and allocate 
our resources in the most cost-effective 
way. This allows us to identify those markets 
of major signiﬁcance to us, those that will 
become more important drivers of our 
business in the future and highlight those 
Established Markets where we need to 
refocus our approach to deliver sustained 
success. Our footprint continues to evolve 
to reﬂect declining sales in Established 
Markets and increasing sales in Emerging 
Markets. For example, in 2012 we enhanced 
our presence in Asia with the opening of the 
Zhangjiang Park Regional Hub Headquarters 
in Shanghai.
Changing customer needs
In most countries, our sales are made 
through wholly-owned local marketing 
companies. In other countries, we sell 
through distributors or local representative 
ofﬁces. Our products are marketed primarily 
to primary care and specialist doctors. Our 
efforts are directed towards explaining the 
therapeutic as well as the economic beneﬁts 
of our products to doctors, governments 
and others who pay for healthcare. 
Historically, our commercial model has been 
based on the use of face-to-face marketing 
techniques. This is now changing to reﬂect 
the changing proﬁle of the prescribers of  
our medicines. For example, primary care 
physicians tend to be younger on average 
than previously, a greater proportion is 
female, and more work part-time. Primary 
care physicians want to interact with 
pharmaceutical companies in different 
ways. Driven by experience from innovative 
approaches piloted and implemented  
in North America and Europe, we have 
changed the way we work. Improvements 
include the introduction of ofﬁce-based 
sales teams, which include physicians  
and dedicated customer service staff, and 
expanded use of digital channels. These 
selling channels have now been rolled  
out in more than 30 countries and across  
a range of products. Evidence to date 
suggests these channels are appreciated  
by those who use them and are an efﬁcient 
and effective way of driving value for our 
business. We are accelerating the roll-out 
and adoption of the new model in the 
majority of markets in which we operate.
Pricing our medicines 
Our challenge is to deliver innovative 
medicines that improve health for patients, 
bring beneﬁts to society and provide an 
appropriate return on our investment. Our 
global pricing policy provides the framework 
to ensure appropriate patient access while 
optimising the proﬁtability of all our products 
in a sustainable way. When setting the price 
of a medicine, we take into consideration  
its full value to patients, to those who pay  
for healthcare and to society in general.  
We also pursue a ﬂexible approach to the 
pricing of our medicines. For example, we 
support the concept of differential pricing, 
provided that appropriate safeguards are  
in place to ensure that differentially priced 
products are not diverted from patients  
who need them to be sold and used in  
more afﬂuent markets.

Delivering value for payers
Our medicines play an important role in 
treating unmet medical need. In doing so, 
they bring economic as well as therapeutic 
beneﬁts. Effective treatments can help to 
lower healthcare costs by reducing the need 
for more expensive care, such as hospital 
stays or surgery, or through preventing 
patients from developing more serious  
or debilitating diseases that are costly  
to treat. They also contribute to increased 
productivity by reducing or preventing  
the incidence of diseases that keep people 
away from work. 
As outlined in the Pricing pressure section 
on page 18, there is continued downward 
pressure on drug pricing and, in the current 
difﬁcult economic environment, payers 
expect us to be able to deﬁne the value  
our medicines create. We are acutely aware 
of the challenges facing those who pay  
for healthcare and are committed to 
delivering value, which will allow us to bring 
our medicines to the patients that need 
them. Therefore, we work with payers  
and healthcare providers to understand  
their priorities and requirements and 
generate evidence regarding how our 
products offer value and support cost-
effective healthcare delivery. 
Increasing access to healthcare

Our commitment: to increase access  
to healthcare for under-served patient

populations in a sustainable way is a 
signiﬁcant global challenge and, in March 
2012, we announced our access to 
healthcare strategy to help in that process. 
The strategy framework is explained on  
our website, astrazeneca.com/responsibility. 
It seeks to take account of the different 
barriers to healthcare around the world  
and is tailored locally to meet the needs  
of different patient populations. We are 
pursuing a range of initiatives, including 
broadening affordability of our medicines, 
across these populations to understand 
what works best and in what context.
During the year, we rolled out our access  
to healthcare framework within our Global 
Sales and Marketing Organisation to 
support further development of our existing 
approach and to enable us to capture 
ongoing ‘broadening affordability’ 
commercial initiatives. For example, our 
work to expand patient access to healthcare 
in countries such as Brazil, Romania and 
Ukraine continues with a range of different 
commercial approaches being adopted. In 
China, we are pursuing our strategy to reach 
patients in the broader market, beyond the 
big hospitals in the big cities, by developing 
new commercial channels for reaching 
emerging hospitals and community health 
centres. Best practice will be shared and 
replicated. In addition, in 2012, we acquired 
Guangdong BeiKang Pharmaceutical 
Company Limited, a generics manufacturing 
company in China which gave us access  
to a portfolio of injectable medicines used  
to treat infections. First launches are planned 
for 2013 and underscore our intention to 
serve the health needs of Chinese patients 
through our innovative medicines and, 
increasingly, high quality branded generic 
treatments that are locally produced to 
global standards. You can read more about 
our strategy and the access initiatives we 
have under way on our website, 
astrazeneca.com.
We are making progress on the development 
of non-ﬁnancial indicators for monitoring  
our performance and these are included  
in our 2013 Responsible Business Plan. 
Sales and marketing ethics
†
Our commitment: to deliver consistently 
high ethical standards of sales and 
marketing practice worldwide.
Our objective: to focus on ensuring 
compliance with our Ethical Interactions 
Policy and report on the:
 > number of conﬁrmed breaches of  
external sales and marketing codes 
 > number of instances of failure to meet  
our standards in the Global Commercial 
Organisation, including contract staff
 > number of corrective actions for breaches 
of our Code of Conduct or supporting 
policies by Commercial employees, 
including contract staff.
During 2012, we continued to provide  
training for employees on our global 
standards that govern the way that we 
conduct our business around the world.  
We have comprehensive processes  
in place for monitoring compliance with  
our Code of Conduct and global policies, 
including dedicated compliance 
professionals who support our line  
managers locally in monitoring their  
staff activities. We also have a network  
of nominated signatories who review  
our promotional materials against all 
applicable requirements. Additionally,  
in 2012, audit professionals have conducted 
compliance audits of a selection of our 
marketing companies.
As shown in the Global KPI: Disciplinary 
actions chart opposite, we identiﬁed a total 
of 10 conﬁrmed breaches of external sales 
and marketing regulations or codes globally 
in 2012 (17 in 2011). There were 1,932 
instances, including contract staff, of failure 
to comply with AstraZeneca’s Code of 
Conduct and global policies in our Global 
Commercial Organisation, the majority of 
which were minor (1,292 in 2011, including 
external breaches). We believe that the 
movement in both numbers reﬂects our 
enhanced management oversight and 
compliance monitoring. 
As shown in the Corrective actions table 
above, in relation to these breaches (and it  
is important to note that a single breach can 
involve more than one person failing to meet 
the standards required), we removed 188 
people from their role, formally warned 685 
people and provided further guidance or 
coaching on our policies for 1,808 people. 
The most serious breaches are raised with 
the Audit Committee.
US Corporate Integrity Agreement 
reporting
In April 2010, AstraZeneca signed an 
agreement with the US Department of 
Justice to settle an investigation relating  
to the sales and marketing of Seroquel IR. 
The requirements of the associated 
Corporate Integrity Agreement between 
AstraZeneca and the Ofﬁce of the Inspector 
General of the US Department of Health 
and Human Services (OIG) include a 
number of active monitoring and self-
reporting obligations that differ from 
self-reporting required by authorities in the 
rest of the world. To meet these obligations, 
AstraZeneca provides notices to the OIG 
describing the outcomes of particular 
investigations potentially relating to violations 
of certain laws, as well as a separate annual 
report to the OIG summarising monitoring 
and investigation outcomes relevant to 
Corporate Integrity Agreement requirements.

Supply and Manufacturing
A reliable supply and manufacturing 
operation that ensures our medicines  
are where they need to be when they  
are needed 
necessary, due to the legacy systems 
reaching the end of their life-cycle. At 
launch the implementation encountered 
some unexpected difﬁculties and we  
put in place a team with representatives 
from different parts of the organisation  
to manage the situation so that impact on 
patients would be minimised and markets 
were kept informed. The underlying 
problems have now been resolved and 
production levels returned to normal in 
September. We estimate that the negative 
revenue impact for the year resulting from 
this disruption was approximately 1%. 
Supply from our site in India (Bangalore) 
was also disrupted for a period of time 
following a voluntary recall of products  
that we determined did not meet our global 
quality standards. Remediation actions 
have been implemented.
Continuous improvement
Lessons learned from the supply chain 
disruptions in 2012 have been shared 
across the Group as part of our continuous 
improvement programme. This programme 
allows us to improve our systems and 
minimise the impact of our activities on the 
environment. We focus on what adds value 
to our customers and patients, as well as 
waste elimination. The programme has 
delivered signiﬁcant beneﬁts in recent 
years, including reduced manufacturing 
lead times and lower average stock levels, 
both of which improve our ability to respond 
to customer needs and reduce inventory 
costs. All improvements are designed to 
ensure we maintain product quality, safety 
and customer service.
Our strategy is to balance innovative and 
efﬁcient in-house manufacturing capabilities 
with external manufacturing resources, 
particularly in relation to the early stages of 
our production process. Where efﬁciencies 
can be achieved, we continue to consider 
using outsourced production but our 
strategy is to retain the ﬁnal stages of the 
production cycle in-house. This balance  
is designed to give us product integrity  
and quality assurance while affording us 
cost efﬁciency and volume ﬂexibility.
We progressed two key production facilities 
during 2012 in China (Taizhou) and Russia 
(Vorsino), which will enable us to supply  
our products to both markets locally. These 
sites are intended to commence phased 
commercial production in 2014. The work  
is led by our global engineering group who 
put a strong focus on carrying out these 
projects fully in line with our ethical and 
safety standards. This work was recognised 
externally in 2012 with the Shell health, 
safety, security and environment (HSSE) 
award for embedding an HSSE culture in  
our Emerging Markets projects. 
Product quality and supply chain
We are committed to delivering product 
quality that underpins the safety and 
efﬁcacy of our medicines. We have a 
comprehensive quality management 
system in place designed to assure the 
quality of our products in compliance  
with relevant regulations.
Notwithstanding our efforts, during 2012  
we experienced disruptions to our supply 
chain resulting from the implementation  
in February 2012 of an enterprise resource 
planning IT system in our facilities in Sweden 
(Södertälje and Gärtuna). This change was 
“ The supply of high quality medicines to patients around the world 
continues to be at the forefront of our strategy. The increasingly 
challenging regulatory environment, providing access to Emerging 
Markets and maintaining supply in an increasingly volatile market  
all represent an opportunity to think about supply to the patient  
in a more differentiated way.”

Strategy Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance Overview
We have applied Lean production business 
improvement tools and ways of working to 
improve the efﬁciency of our manufacturing 
plants for a number of years and, in recent 
years, have applied them to the whole of our 
supply chain. This has led to improvements 
in quality, lead times and overall equipment 
effectiveness. In 2012, we continued to 
establish more efﬁcient processes, with 
experts from our global supply chain 
organisation providing cross-functional 
support throughout the business. 
Regulation and compliance 
Facilities and processes for manufacturing 
medicines must observe rigorous standards 
of quality. They are subject to inspections by 
regulatory authorities to ensure compliance 
with prescribed standards. Regulatory 
authorities have the power to require 
improvements to facilities and processes, 
halt production and impose conditions that 
must be satisﬁed before production can 
resume. Regulatory standards are not 
harmonised globally and evolve over time.
We hosted 44 independent inspections 
from 22 different regulatory authorities  
in 2012. All observations from such 
inspections are reviewed along with the 
outcomes of internal inspections and 
subsequent improvement actions are put  
in place as required to ensure ongoing 
compliance. The knowledge obtained from 
all inspections is shared across the Group.
We are actively involved in providing input 
into new product manufacturing regulations 
and approaches to product registration, 
both at national and international levels, 
through our membership of industry 
associations. For example, in the EU we 
continue to provide input into the Falsiﬁed 
Medicines Directive, which came into force 
in January 2013 and starts to take effect  
in stages from July 2013. We have taken 
steps to ensure that our supply chains  
can comply with the Falsiﬁed Medicines 
Directive. In the US, we contributed to 
debates concerning Supply Chain Security 
and the prevention of Drug Shortages.
Our supply and manufacturing strategy is 
based on our commitment to maintaining 
the highest ethical standards while complying 
with internal policies, and laws and regulations. 
We achieve this by placing compliance 
responsibility with line managers who are 
supported by dedicated compliance teams. 
Independent assurance is provided by our 
GIA function. 
Managing risk
Given our strategy to outsource all  
API manufacturing, we place particular 
importance on our global procurement 
policies and integrated risk management 
processes to ensure uninterrupted supply  
of high quality raw materials. Supplies are 
purchased from a range of suppliers. We 
factor in a wide range of potential risks to 
global supply, such as disasters that remove 
supply capability or the unavailability of  
key raw materials, and work to ensure  
that these risks are effectively mitigated. 
Contingency plans include the appropriate 
use of dual or multiple suppliers and 
maintaining appropriate stock levels. 
Although the price of raw materials may 
ﬂuctuate, our global purchasing policies 
seek to avoid such ﬂuctuations becoming 
material to our business.
We also take into account reputational risk 
associated with our use of suppliers and are 
committed to working only with suppliers 
that embrace standards of ethical behaviour 
that are consistent with our own. 
As part of our overall risk management, 
we carefully consider the timing of 
investment with a view to ensuring that 
secure supply chains are in place for our 
products. We also have a programme  
in place to provide appropriate supply 
capabilities for our new products.
Our resources
Capital expenditure on supply and 
manufacturing facilities totalled 
approximately $417 million in 2012 (2011: 
$388 million; 2010: $333 million). This 
included expenditure on two production 
facilities, in China (Taizhou) and Russia 
(Vorsino), which will enable us to supply  
our products to both markets locally. In 
addition to these two facilities, our principal 
small molecule manufacturing facilities are  
in the UK (Avlon and Macclesﬁeld), Sweden 
(Snäckviken, Gärtuna, Södertälje), the  
US (Newark, Delaware and Westborough, 
Massachusetts), France (Reims and 
Dunkerque), Japan (Maihara), Australia 
(North Ryde), China (Wuxi), Indonesia 
(Jakarta), Egypt (Cairo), India (Bangalore), 
Puerto Rico (Canovanas), Germany (Wedel), 
Mexico (Lomas Verdes), Brazil (Cotia) and 
Argentina (Buenos Aires). We currently 
operate sites for the manufacture of APIs  
in the UK and Sweden complemented by 
the efﬁcient use of external sourcing. Our 
principal tablet and capsule formulation sites 
are in the UK, Sweden, Puerto Rico and the 
US. We also have major formulation sites  
for the global supply of parenteral and/or 
inhalation products in Sweden, France, 
Australia and the UK. 
At the end of 2012, approximately 10,300 
people at 22 sites in 16 countries were 
working on the manufacture and supply  
of our products. This total includes some 
770 permanent and 110 seasonal people 
who are employed at our four principal 
biologics commercial manufacturing 
facilities in the US (Frederick, Maryland  
and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), the UK 
(Speke), and the Netherlands (Nijmegen) 
with capabilities in process development, 
manufacturing and distribution of biologics, 
including worldwide supply of MAbs and 
inﬂuenza vaccines. Our biologics capabilities 
are scalable, which enables efﬁcient 
management of our combined small 
molecule and biologics pipeline.

Environmental impact
†
Our commitment: to minimise the 
environmental impact of our operations  
by reducing the carbon footprint and  
natural resource demands of our own  
and our suppliers’ business activities.
Our targets for 2012
‡
 included reducing:
 > operational greenhouse gas footprint  
to 890 kilo tonnes CO 2 e/yr
 > hazardous waste to 0.70 tonnes/$m  
sales and non-hazardous waste  
to 0.52 tonnes/employee
 > water use to 4.0 million m
3
.
Our SHE strategy and associated  
objectives and targets for 2011 to 2015  
provide the framework for driving our 
environmental sustainability going forward. 
This section includes summary information 
about certain key areas of the framework. 
Full details of our strategy, objectives  
and targets are available on our website, 
astrazeneca.com/responsibility.
We work to reduce our greenhouse  
gas emissions by, among other things, 
improving our energy efﬁciency and 
pursuing lower-carbon alternatives  
to fossil fuels at our sites. We strive to  
ensure that our travel and transport  
activities are as efﬁcient as possible.  
Our carbon footprint is also affected  
by some of our respiratory therapies, 
speciﬁcally our pressurised metered-dose 
inhalers that rely on hydroﬂuoroalkane  
(HFA) propellants to deliver the medicine  
to a patient’s airways. While HFAs have  
no ozone depletion potential and a third  
or less of the global warming potential  
than the chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFCs)  
they replace, they are still greenhouse  
gases. Our target is to reduce our 
operational greenhouse gas footprint 
(excluding emissions from patient use  
of our inhaler therapies) by 20% from  
our 2011 levels by 2015. In 2012,  
our gross greenhouse gas emissions  
(from all sources) totalled 1.15 million tonnes 
(41 tonnes/$m indexed to Group revenue).
Working with suppliers
†
Our commitment: to integrate AstraZeneca 
ethical standards into our procurement 
activities and decisions worldwide.
Our objective: to monitor compliance 
through our ongoing assessment and 
programmes with focus on areas 
experiencing highest challenges; to address 
challenges with our suppliers and promote 
improvement through collaboration.
Our Global Responsible Procurement 
Standard deﬁnes one of the key business 
processes for integrating our ethical 
standards into our procurement activity  
and decision making worldwide. It includes 
detailed expectations of suppliers. The 
process is based on an escalating set  
of risk-based due diligence activities, 
applied in a pragmatic way. The same initial 
assessment process is used for all suppliers 
and more detailed, focused assessments 
are then made, relevant to the service 
provided. Since the programme began in 
2009, we have completed 5,661 assessments 
of new and existing suppliers, which accounts 
for approximately two-thirds of our spend 
on suppliers.
We categorise suppliers as high, medium  
or low risk. We focus our auditing efforts  
on high and medium risk rated suppliers  
but we also audit some suppliers that we 
consider to be lower risk, to conﬁrm our 
performance expectations across all suppliers 
we do business with. In 2012, we continued 
our audit activity with 482 audits across  
52 countries (751 audits in 2011) as set  
out in the table on the previous page.
Forty-three percent of suppliers audited 
demonstrated standards that met our 
expectations, with a further 53% implementing 
improvements to address minor non-
compliances. We monitor progress across 
all corrective actions and 4% of suppliers 
audited this year will require signiﬁcant 
follow up to conﬁrm they will make the 
improvements we require. We will not  
use suppliers who are unable or unwilling  
to meet our expectations in a timely way. 
During 2012, we removed eight suppliers 
from our supply chain.
The management of waste is another key 
aspect of our commitment and we have a 
2015 target of a 15% reduction in hazardous 
and non-hazardous waste from our 2011 
levels. Our primary focus is waste prevention, 
but where this is not practical, we concentrate 
on waste minimisation and appropriate 
treatment or disposal to maximise the  
reuse and recycling of materials and 
minimise disposal to landﬁll. In 2012, our 
total waste was 47 ,000 tonnes with a 
tonnes/$m index of 1.7 .
We recognise the need to use water 
responsibly and, where possible, to 
minimise the use of water in our facilities.  
To support the delivery of our target  
to reduce water use by 25% from our  
2011 levels by 2015, we now have water 
conservation plans at our largest sites.  
In 2012, our water use was 3.6 million m
3
 
with a m
3
/$m index of 130.
We are also working to ensure that we 
measure and report the impact of our 
external manufacturing activity on the 
environment, and that our suppliers  
have appropriate environmental 
improvement targets.
Our continued commitment to product 
stewardship is underpinned by our  
ongoing work to integrate environmental 
considerations into a medicine’s complete 
life-cycle, from discovery and development, 
through manufacturing, marketing and to  
its ultimate disposal. Further information is 
available on our website, astrazeneca.com/
responsibility, including environmental risk 
assessment data for our medicines.

A talented and diverse workforce with  
the right capabilities operating in a high  
performance culture that enables us  
to bring great medicines to patients
workforce composition ﬁgure overleaf.  
For example, in 2012,1,800 of the  
new recruits joined AstraZeneca in  
China. We continue to deploy a range  
of innovative approaches to help us achieve 
our ambitious growth plans in these 
markets and to ensure that we have  
an attractive employer brand and strong 
reputation globally. 
Compared with a level of 6.7% in  
2011, the level of voluntary employee 
turnover across AstraZeneca increased  
to 7 .3% in 2012 and now stands at the 
average for the pharmaceutical sector.  
We have continued to invest signiﬁcant 
management time to minimise the risks  
to the business posed by employee 
turnover, particularly in markets where 
conditions are most volatile. This has 
included regular reporting to the SET  
of resignation rates in total, by SET area 
and by key markets using the global HR 
platform being deployed across all markets 
as part of a transformation of the HR 
function. In addition, speciﬁc steps have 
been taken to retain key people and talent 
within our business. For example, regular 
risk assessments and retention plans are  
in place in respect of key individuals. 
With approximately 51,700 people in  
over 100 countries worldwide, we value  
the talents, skills and capabilities that a 
global workforce brings to our business. 
Our people strategy, which deﬁnes our 
approach to managing our workforce  
and supports the delivery of our business 
strategy, is built around four key priorities 
that we believe are critical: acquiring  
and retaining key capabilities and  
talent; further developing leadership  
and management capabilities; further 
improving the strength and diversity  
of the talent pipeline; and managing 
employee engagement while building  
a high performance culture. Managing 
signiﬁcant change in the organisation’s 
workforce is also something to which 
considerable management attention 
continues to be directed. We use a range  
of metrics to track progress against these 
priorities, many of which are reported 
regularly to the SET. 
Acquiring and retaining key 
capabilities and talent
During 2012, we hired approximately  
5,700 permanent employees to fuel the 
expansion of our business in Emerging 
Markets, to continue to build the new 
capabilities required to implement our 
strategy successfully and to replace 
leavers. We have successfully attracted  
key talent to supplement critical capabilities 
across the business and to refresh our 
leadership pipeline in key areas.
With our focus on business growth in 
Emerging Markets, the composition of  
our global workforce continued to change, 
as shown in the Sales and Marketing 
“ The reduction in scores in our employee survey was disappointing,  
if understandable given our business challenges. We must redouble 
our efforts to make AstraZeneca a great place to work – one that 
leverages the deep commitment and passion of our people and 
enables us to operate nimbly, decisively and collaboratively.”

Further developing leadership and 
management capabilities
We encourage and support our people  
in achieving their full potential by providing  
a range of learning and development  
(L&D) programmes. These are designed  
to build the capabilities and encourage  
the behaviours needed to deliver our 
business strategy.
We have a global approach, supported  
by the creation of our global talent and 
development organisation, to ensure  
that high standards of L&D practice are 
applied across AstraZeneca. We continue 
to develop and deploy instructor-led and 
online development resources, which we 
aim to make available to all employees to 
increase access to learning and to support 
self-development.
We recognise the importance of good 
leadership and its critical role in stimulating 
high levels of performance and engagement. 
Our leadership development frameworks 
are focused on the core capabilities that we 
believe are essential for strong and effective 
leadership. These capabilities are deﬁned 
for each level in the organisation and apply 
to all our employees. We complement our 
leadership capabilities with a set of manager 
accountabilities, which deﬁne what we 
expect from our managers. These manager 
accountabilities are further enabled across 
all markets through the deployment of our 
global HR platform.
Alongside judicious hiring of new leaders 
into critical senior roles, the development  
of an internal pipeline of future global leaders  
is a high priority. We identify individuals with 
the potential for more senior and complex 
roles. These talent pools provide succession 
candidates for a range of leadership roles 
across AstraZeneca. We regard these 
individuals as key assets to the organisation 
and we proactively support them to reach 
their potential through, for example, global 
talent development programmes and 
targeted development opportunities. 
Changes to the Senior Executive Team 
announced in January 2013 included the 
promotion of six internal candidates and 
demonstrate our commitment to the 
development of senior leaders.
We remain committed to making full use  
of the talents and resource of all our  
people. We have policies in place to avoid 
discrimination, including on the grounds  
of disability. Our policies cover recruitment 
and selection, performance management, 
career development and promotion, transfer, 
and training (including re-training, if needed, 
for people who have become disabled)  
and reward.
Improving the strength and diversity  
of the talent pipeline
†
 
Our commitment: to build an inclusive, 
open and trusting organisation embracing 
the skills, knowledge and unique ability of 
our employees.
Our objective: to accelerate diversity  
and inclusion appropriately throughout  
the business, build accountability and  
track progress. Our target for 2015  
is to improve female representation:
 > at senior manager level and above  
from 38% (2010) to 43% (2015)
 > in the global talent pool from 33%  
(2010) to 38% (2015). 
Our global workforce provides a diversity  
of skills, capabilities and creativity, and  
we value the beneﬁts that such diversity 
brings to our business. We aim to foster  
a culture of respect and fairness where 
individual success depends solely on  
ability, behaviour, work performance and 
demonstrated potential. As we continue to 
reshape our organisation and geographic 
footprint, our challenge is to ensure that 
diversity in its broadest sense is reﬂected  
in our workforce and leadership, and 
integrated into our business and people 
strategies. Within this context, we support 
the representation of women at the highest 
levels in our business. Women make  
up 50% of our global workforce, giving  
us a real opportunity to develop female 
leaders. Indeed, there are currently three 
women on our Board (25%) and, below 
Board level, women account for 40%  
of senior management. 
Under the leadership of a global Diversity  
& Inclusion steering group chaired by  
a member of the SET and comprising  
senior leaders from across the business  
and geographies, we are driving change in 
three key areas: ‘leadership & management 
capability’; ‘transparency in talent 
management & career progression’;  
and ‘work-life challenges’. In March 2012,  
we launched our Global Insight Exchange 
programme as a direct result of the work  
of the steering group. This programme, 
which consists of peer-to-peer mentoring  
of over 30 ‘learning pairs’ of identiﬁed  
talent from different functional areas and 
geographies within our organisation, is 
designed to accelerate the development  
of our leadership culture and talent pipeline 
through the exchange of diversity of thought 
and experience. In addition, we track 
gender representation at different levels  
of the organisation and country of origin 
representation of our senior leaders to 
measure progress over the medium term.
Driving employee engagement 
We use a variety of global leadership 
communication channels to engage 
employees in our business strategy.  
These include face-to-face meetings,  
video conferencing and Yammer (a social 
media tool) to encourage two-way dialogue 
to take place. For the third year in a row  
our annual global employee survey  
(FOCUS) included an open text feedback 
mechanism, with around 25,000  
comments made on a variety of topics.

We will continue to empower our leaders  
to drive performance, to hold our managers 
accountable for understanding and 
delivering against the standards required, 
and to provide the tools necessary to 
reward outstanding contributions.
Our focus on optimising performance is 
reinforced by performance-related bonus 
and incentive plans. AstraZeneca also 
encourages employee share ownership  
by offering the opportunity to participate  
in various employee share plans, some  
of which are described in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report from page 122 and 
also in Note 24 to the Financial Statements 
from page 179.
Human rights
†
Our commitment: to respect and promote 
international human rights in our operations 
and our sphere of inﬂuence.
Our objective: to ensure that human rights 
considerations are appropriately integrated 
into our policies, processes and practices. 
As reported in 2011, we have carried  
out labour reviews in 106 countries  
in which we have employees. The  
reviews focused on International Labour 
Organization (ILO) core areas, including 
freedom of association and collective 
bargaining, child labour, discrimination, 
working hours and wages. The framework 
for the review was provided by an adaptation 
of the employment section of the Danish 
Institute for Human Rights assessment tool 
for pharmaceutical companies, which was 
developed with our industry’s help and 
launched in 2010. Results showed that our 
practices are generally consistent across  
all countries, based on our mandate that  
our global standards are applied when 
external national standards do not meet  
our minimum requirements. Some gaps  
to ILO standards have been identiﬁed  
and are being addressed as part of the 
review of our Global People Policy, which  
is planned for 2014.
In 2012, 91 % of our employees participated  
in the survey, which measures levels  
of employee engagement and considers  
the effectiveness of our organisational, 
leadership and management capabilities, 
and satisfaction in terms of employees’ 
working environment. Our employee 
engagement score decreased by three 
percentage points this year and our 
leadership communications and work-life 
balance scores also decreased. The  
survey took place at a challenging time  
for the Group and the scores were 
disappointing. We remained ahead of 
external pharmaceutical industry norms  
in areas such as motivation, willingness  
to put in more effort than would normally  
be expected, line management, and 
operating with integrity and ethics. However, 
we recognise that we have more work to  
do in important areas, such as strategic 
understanding and reducing organisational 
complexity, to ensure AstraZeneca is  
a great place to work. Local leadership  
teams have also identiﬁed actions designed 
to target any concerns speciﬁc to their 
organisational area.
A key element of our people strategy is the 
continued development of a performance 
culture across the organisation. By 
strengthening our focus on setting high 
quality objectives aligned to our business 
strategy, and ongoing coaching and 
feedback, we strive to ensure that 
performance at all levels of the organisation 
delivers value. The Board is responsible for 
setting our high-level strategic objectives 
and monitoring performance against them 
(see the Operation of the Board section on 
page 111). Managers across AstraZeneca  
are accountable for working with their teams  
to develop individual and team performance 
targets, and for ensuring that employees 
understand how they contribute to overall 
business objectives.
Managing change 
Recruitment in our Emerging Markets 
continues to be accompanied by headcount 
reductions in our Established Markets  
as a result of our continuing strategic drive  
to improve efﬁciency and effectiveness. 
Reductions have come about through 
restructuring in R&D, supply and 
manufacturing, support functions and  
our sales and marketing workforce.  
The net effect of these changes since  
the end of 2006 has been to reduce our  
total headcount by some 15,100 from 
66,800 to 51,700. This decrease includes  
a reduction of 2,600 positions in 2010, 
5,000 in 2011 and a further 6,300 in 2012, 
which resulted from our business change 
plans announced since 2010. 
We are committed to ensuring that 
AstraZeneca’s core values, robust people 
policies, consultation infrastructure and  
prior experience were integrated into this 
multi-faceted business transformation. 
Trade unions and employee representative 
groups were involved throughout the 
restructuring process. With signiﬁcant 
investment in outplacement support, high 
levels of success have been achieved in 
ﬁnding employees alternative opportunities 
outside AstraZeneca. Further details are set 
out in the Our strategy section from page 20.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 46
Managing employee relations
We work to ensure a level of global 
consistency in managing employee 
relations, while allowing enough ﬂexibility  
to support the local markets in building 
good relations with their workforces, taking 
into account local laws and circumstances. 
To that end, relations with trade unions  
are nationally determined and managed 
locally in line with the applicable legal 
framework and standards of good practice. 
However, each change programme has  
its unique challenges and a standard 
solution may not always be appropriate. 
Where this is the case, the appropriate 
solution is developed through consultation 
with employee representatives or, where 
applicable, trade unions, with the aim of 
retaining key skills and mitigating job losses. 
Early in 2012, we implemented our Global 
Employment Standards, which are linked  
to our Global People Policy. Our Global 
Employment Standards serve to provide 
common and consistent expectations 
concerning the way in which our employees 
will be managed globally and cover matters 
including attendance, employee concerns, 
ﬂexible working, leaving AstraZeneca, 
misconduct, performance improvement, 
redeployment and redundancy, and 
work-life balance.
Safety, health and wellbeing
†
Our commitment: to promote a safe, 
healthy and energising work environment  
in which our people, and those from third 
parties working closely with us, are able  
to express their talents, drive innovation  
and improve business performance.
Our targets for 2012 included:
 > 0 fatalities
 > combined lost time injury/illness  
rate per million hours worked of 2.38
 > 7 .1 collisions per million kilometres driven.
Driver safety remains our highest priority  
for improvement and our focus is on 
promoting driver safety among our sales 
forces, collectively the single largest group  
of employees who drive on AstraZeneca 
business. Driver safety targets are  
included in regional and local scorecards. 
Performance is monitored centrally to 
assess progress and identify areas for 
improvement. In 2012, we missed our 
annual target for collisions per million 
kilometres driven. We remain on track  
to achieve our 2015 target.
We regret that during 2012, two members  
of the public were killed in two separate 
road trafﬁc accidents involving AstraZeneca 
drivers in Russia and Turkey. Detailed 
investigations into both accidents have  
been carried out. For the Russian accident, 
an action plan was formulated to respond  
to the ﬁndings of the investigation and those 
actions are being tracked. The investigation 
report for the Turkish accident, which 
occurred in October, has not yet been 
ﬁnalised. Learning from the investigations 
into both accidents will be shared widely 
across the Group.
In 2012, the lost time injury/illness rate 
increased by 3% from 2011. However,  
we remain on track to achieve our 2015 
target of a 25% reduction in the lost time 
injury/illness rate from the 2010 baseline, 
with an overall 21% reduction achieved  
so far. 
Work-related stress has been a particular 
focus for us in recent years; in 2012 we 
achieved a signiﬁcant (59%) reduction in  
the number of reportable cases compared 
to 2011. We are continuing our efforts in  
this area, using a risk-based approach, 
including wellbeing risk assessment tools,  
to identify high-risk areas and target 
interventions effectively.

Compliance
Employees acting with integrity
When a potential compliance breach  
is identiﬁed, an internal investigation  
is undertaken by appropriate staff from  
our Global Compliance, HR and/or Legal 
teams. When appropriate, external advisers 
are engaged to conduct and/or advise  
on investigations. Should the investigation 
conclude that an actual breach has occurred, 
management, in consultation with our Legal 
function, will consider whether the Company 
needs to make a disclosure and/or to report 
the ﬁndings to a regulatory or governmental 
authority. More information on GIA and  
our overall risk management and control 
framework can be found in the Corporate 
Governance Report from page 110. 
Code of Conduct 
Our Code of Conduct (the Code) is at the 
core of our compliance programme and 
applies worldwide to all full- and part-time 
AstraZeneca Directors, ofﬁcers, employees 
and temporary staff. It has been translated 
into over 40 languages and each employee 
has access to an electronic copy. It provides 
clear direction as to how our commitment  
to honesty and integrity is to be realised in 
consistent actions across all areas of the 
business. Compliance with the Code is 
mandatory and every employee receives 
training on it. Every employee is required to 
comply with local laws and regulations, as 
well as applicable national and international 
codes. We always seek to operate at the 
highest of these various standards. The 
Code is regularly reviewed and updated  
to take account of changing legal and 
regulatory obligations. 
The Code includes information on  
how to report possible violations of the 
Code, including through the AZethics 
telephone lines and AZethics.com. Anyone 
who raises a possible breach in good faith  
is fully supported by management. We  
take all alleged compliance breaches and 
concerns extremely seriously and investigate 
them and report the outcome of such 
investigations to the Audit Committee,  
as appropriate. 
In 2012, 194 reports of alleged compliance 
breaches or other ethical concerns were 
made via telephone, the AZethics.com 
website, or the Global Compliance email  
or postal addresses described in the Code. 
In 2011, the number of reports through 
equivalent channels was 222. This decrease 
is in the context of a signiﬁcant increase  
in management and self-reporting of 
compliance incidents, which can be seen  
as an indication that employees are more 
comfortable in raising their concerns  
with line managers, local HR, Legal or 
Compliance, as recommended in the Code 
and reinforced in the 2012 Code training.
As with the Code, our Global Policies  
apply to all companies within our Group. 
They provide clear and comprehensive 
guidance, in plain language, to all managers 
and employees as to their accountabilities  
in key ethical, compliance and corporate 
responsibility risk areas. 
Our Global Compliance function has been 
established to drive and embed a culture of 
ethics and integrity within our organisation. 
Our key compliance priorities include:
 > focusing our efforts on important 
compliance risk areas 
 > communicating clear policies  
to employees 
 > improving compliance behaviours  
through effective training and support 
 > ensuring employees can raise concerns 
and that those concerns will be properly 
addressed 
 > ensuring fair and objective investigations 
of possible policy breaches 
 > monitoring and auditing compliance  
with policies 
 > providing key stakeholders with 
assurance and effective reporting  
of material issues.
These priorities are closely aligned  
to the Group’s strategy and reﬂect our  
drive to strengthen our efforts for oversight 
at all levels of our business, including risk 
management relating to external parties  
and anti-bribery/anti-corruption. GIA  
and Global Compliance work closely  
with one another and both separately 
provide assurance reporting to the Audit 
Committee. Our Global Compliance  
function also works together with a  
range of specialist compliance functions 
throughout our organisation to ensure 
ongoing legal and regulatory compliance.  
In March 2012, we created a Group 
Compliance Council, with membership 
drawn from Global Compliance and from 
the other specialist compliance functions, 
whose purpose is to co-ordinate our 
compliance activities.
“ If people are to have conﬁdence in AstraZeneca, we must be trusted 
as an organisation. That trust is built on all employees acting with 
integrity in everything that they do on a daily basis – and feeling able 
to raise concerns about possible breaches of our Code of Conduct 
and our Global Policies.”

Responsible Business
A commitment to acting responsibly and to the 
sustainable development of our business 
In this section, we describe our approach  
to delivering business success responsibly. 
Summary information about our commitment 
and performance in key areas is integrated 
into the relevant sections of this Annual 
Report, while further information about 
these and other areas is available on our 
website, astrazeneca.com/responsibility.
Introduction
At AstraZeneca, we are dedicated  
to the discovery, development and 
commercialisation of prescription  
medicines that make a difference in 
healthcare. For us, this is at the core  
of our responsibility to our stakeholders  
and to society. Successful pharmaceutical 
innovation, delivered responsibly, improves 
health for patients, brings beneﬁts to 
stakeholders and delivers long-term 
shareholder value. 
In the Strategy section from page 12, we 
describe our approach to creating value 
across the life-cycle of a medicine, our 
distinctive capabilities and our strategy.
All these efforts are underpinned by  
our commitment to being a responsible 
company, working with integrity and 
delivering sustainable business development 
that adds value for our stakeholders. To that 
end, our responsible business objectives  
are aligned to, and support delivery of,  
our business strategy. Our Responsible 
Business Plan is our framework for 
managing our commitments and includes 
objectives, targets and KPIs that are agreed 
across the Group, taking account of external 
stakeholder insights and internal reputational 
risk assessment. The Responsible Business 
Plan puts at the top of the agenda those 
areas most impacted by our business 
strategy, which are as follows:
>  R&D: Underpinning our accelerated drive 
for innovation with sound R&D ethics 
worldwide (see page 33). 
>  Patient safety: Maintaining a strong focus 
on patient safety in everything we do, 
minimising the risks and maximising the 
beneﬁts of all our medicines throughout 
R&D, and after launch (see page 34).
>  Access to healthcare: As we expand our 
geographic footprint, exploring ways of 
increasing access to healthcare for more 
people, tailored locally to different patient 
needs (see page 38).
>  Sales and marketing: Working to 
consistent global standards of ethical 
sales and marketing practices in all our 
markets as we work to restore growth 
(see page 39).
>  Diversity and inclusion: Working to  
ensure that diversity in its broadest  
sense is reﬂected in our leadership  
and people strategies (see page 44). 
>  Human rights: Continuing to develop  
and embed a consistent approach to 
human rights across all our worldwide 
activities (see page 45).
>  Employee safety, health and wellbeing: 
Promoting the safety, health and  
wellbeing of all our people worldwide as 
we continue to drive a high performance 
culture and achievement of our business 
goals (see page 46).
>  Working with suppliers: Only working  
with suppliers who have standards 
consistent with our own as we increase 
our outsourcing to drive business 
efﬁciency (see page 42).
>  The environment: Managing our impact 
on the environment, across all our 
operations, with a particular focus  
on carbon emissions, waste and water 
use (see page 42).
>  Community investment: Making a positive 
contribution to our local communities 
around the world, through community 
support programmes consistent with 
improving health and promoting science 
(see page opposite). 
A core element of our business strategy  
is value-creating business development 
activity that strengthens our pipeline and 
accelerates growth. This includes targeted 
acquisitions. When we acquire companies 
we aim to work with them to align standards 
of responsible business and incorporate  
the companies into the setting of targets 
and measurement of performance. This 
process can take time. Thus, for example, 
responsible business data relating to Ardea, 
acquired in June, is not incorporated  
in this Annual Report. 
Benchmarking
As expectations of stakeholders evolve,  
we continue to engage with them and use 
the feedback to inform the development  
of our responsible business strategy and 
risk management planning.
We also use the insights we gain from 
external surveys to develop our approach  
in line with global best practice. A member 
of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index since 
2001, we were once again listed in the 2012 
World Index (the top 10% of the largest 
2,500 companies). We also retained our 
listing on the DJSI STOXX – European index 
(the top 20% of the 600 largest European 
companies) for the ﬁfth year running (one  
of only four pharmaceutical companies to 
do so out of 14 assessed). We achieved  
a total score of 83% (2011: 85%) compared 
with a sector best score of 87% (2011: 87%). 
We increased individual scores for nine out 
of 22 criteria for 2012 (compared to 14 out  
“ Being a responsible business is not an optional extra. Despite  
the challenges we face as a business, we remain committed  
to acting responsibly and our sustainable development. In this  
way we can continue to be valued for what we do and trusted  
for the way we do it.”

Our commitment: to meet our 
responsibility as a global corporation  
to support the wider community, 
maximising the beneﬁt of our investment  
for all stakeholders, through focused 
investment and by embracing current  
best practice.
Our objective: to extend the geographic 
reach of our Young Health Programme 
(YHP). Our target was to have 15 YHP 
country programmes running by the end  
of 2012 with a total target reach of 500,000 
adolescents by 2015.
In 2012, we spent a total of $1.18 billion 
(2011: $1.06 billion*) on community 
investment sponsorships, partnerships and 
charitable donations worldwide, including 
our product donation and patient assistance 
programmes which make our medicines 
available free of charge or at reduced  
prices. Through our three patient assistance 
programmes in the US we donated products 
valued at an average wholesale price  
of over $1.12 billion (2011: $938 million).  
We also donated products worth over  
$5.8 million, valued at average wholesale 
price, to charitable organisations Americares 
and Direct Relief International.

these scores are encouraging, we lost 
ground in some areas including innovation 
management and health outcomes 
contribution. To better understand these 
lower scores, we commissioned an 
in-depth external benchmark survey  
and the analysis will be used to inform  
our improvement planning.
Responsible business governance
The Board is responsible for our responsible 
business framework and Non-Executive 
Director, Nancy Rothwell, oversees 
implementation and reporting to the Board. 
The SET and senior managers throughout 
the Group are accountable for operating 
responsibly within their areas taking  
into account national, functional and site 
issues and priorities. Line managers are 
accountable for ensuring that their teams 
understand the requirements and that 
people are clear about what is expected of 
them as they work to achieve AstraZeneca’s 
business goals.
Our Responsible Business Council  
(the Council) is chaired by our Executive 
Vice-President of Human Resources & 
Corporate Affairs, and members include 
senior leaders from each relevant SET  
area. Its agenda is focused on driving 
long-term value creation by agreeing, 
among other things:
 > responsible business priorities for the 
Group in line with strategic business 
objectives
 > managing and monitoring the annual 
process of setting responsible business 
objectives and targets recorded in the 
Responsible Business Plan, as well  
as reviewing performance against KPIs 
 > appropriate policy positions to support 
AstraZeneca’s business objectives and 
reputation management.
The Council is supported by a Responsible 
Business Working Group (the Working 
Group) of SET area representatives. Among 
other things, the Working Group continuously 
reviews external issues with the potential  
to impact AstraZeneca and, as appropriate, 
prepares management and measurement 
proposals for the Council’s consideration. 
Our global community investment strategy 
focuses on two key areas, healthcare in  
the community and science in education.  
In 2012, we continued to expand our YHP 
country programme. This is designed to 
help young people in need around the world 
deal with the health issues they face so  
they can improve their chances of living  
a better life. We currently have 15 country 
programmes under way around the world. 
Through YHP , we have reached over 
250,000 young people in communities 
across ﬁve continents with health 
information. Over 3,000 of these young 
people have been trained to share this 
health information with their peers and with 
the community, and over 2,700 frontline 
health providers have completed training 
programmes in adolescent health. We are 
on track to meet our Clinton Global Initiative 
commitment to reach 500,000 young 
people by the end of 2015. Initial ﬁndings 
from the Wellbeing of Adolescents in 
Vulnerable Environments study being 
undertaken by Johns Hopkins Bloomberg 
School of Public Health as part of YHP were 
presented at the World Health Summit in 
Berlin, Germany in October. As part of our 
best practice sharing, our dedicated online 
resource (younghealthprogrammeYHP .com) 
enables those working with young people  
to access information and resources 
created by the YHP partners.
Our support for science education takes  
a number of forms. For example, in 2011,  
we entered a three year partnership with 
Career Academies UK to support increased 
participation by 16 to 19-year-olds in Science, 
Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) 
subjects, with a target that one-third of 
Career Academies have a STEM theme  
by the 2014/15 academic year. By the 
2012/13 academic year, the proportion  
was almost one-quarter, representing  
48 Career Academies. Our work with  
Career Academies UK complements the 
involvement we have had since 2003 with 
the STEM ambassador programme.

Therapy Area Review
As outlined in the Strategy section from page 12, we are one of only a handful 
of companies to span the entire life-cycle of a medicine from discovery, early 
and late-stage development to the global commercialisation of primary, 
specialty care-led and specialty care medicines. 
This Therapy Area Review reﬂects the  
range of our activities. This includes the  
work of our small molecule and biologics 
groups, responsible for discovery and 
development projects up to and including 
Proof of Concept, as well as our Global 
Medicines Development (GMD) organisation, 
which progresses products through 
late-stage development, registration and 
post-launch development activities. This 
Therapy Area Review also draws on the 
expertise of our Commercial organisation 
which ensures our science is connected  
with our customers’ needs. We embed 
customer insights into our R&D strategy 
based on our interactions with healthcare 
providers, patients, regulators and payers. 
This approach helps us to prioritise resources 
and optimise our portfolio, thereby delivering 
medicines that customers value and which 
meet their needs. While the focus of this 
Therapy Area Review is on our key marketed 
products, many of our other established 
products are key to certain markets  
within Emerging Markets and, taken  
together, represent an important part  
of AstraZeneca’s business.
This process is summarised in the  
Life-cycle of a medicine diagram on page 
14, and in the subsequent Business Review 
section from page 30, we explore how we 
apply our resources, skills and capabilities 
to the various elements of that process  
in furtherance of our business strategy.
This Therapy Area Review contains 
information about the six Therapy  
Areas in which our efforts are focused: 
Cardiovascular, Gastrointestinal, Infection, 
Neuroscience, Oncology, and Respiratory  
& Inﬂammation. For each research area  
we review our pipeline from early projects 
through to launched brands. We describe  
the business environment, trends and  
other factors that have inﬂuenced our 
decision to focus on diseases in these  
six areas, our strategic objectives  
for each and our progress towards 
achieving these objectives. We include 
information about our 2012 focus and key 
developments relating to our marketed 
medicines and how they are designed  
to make a meaningful difference for  
patients. We also report on the potential 
new products and product life-cycle 
developments in our pipeline that reﬂect  
our commitment to maintaining a ﬂow  
of innovation that adds value for our 
shareholders and to society.
For a list of all our potential new products  
and product life-cycle developments,  
see the Pipeline by Therapy Area table  
opposite and the Development Pipeline  
table from page 199. For details of patent 
expiries of our key marketed products, see 
the Patent expiries section on page 36.
Indications for each product described  
in this Therapy Area Review may vary from 
country to country and local prescribing 
information should be referred to for 
country-speciﬁc indications for any 
particular product.
Many of our products are subject to 
litigation. Information about material legal 
proceedings can be found in Note 25  
to the Financial Statements from page 184. 
Details of relevant risks are set out in the 
Principal risks and uncertainties section 
from page 75.

Strategy Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance Overview
Cardiovascular diseases 
Hypertension (high blood pressure) and 
dyslipidaemia (abnormal levels of blood 
cholesterol) damage the arterial wall which 
may lead to atherosclerosis. CV events 
driven by atherosclerotic disease remain  
the leading cause of death in the western 
world. Lipid-modifying therapy, primarily 
statins, is a cornerstone for the treatment  
of atherosclerosis.
Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is an 
umbrella term for sudden chest pain and 
other symptoms due to insufﬁcient blood 
supply (ischaemia) to the heart muscle.  
ACS is the acute culmination of ischaemic 
heart disease. There remains a signiﬁcant 
need to improve outcomes and reduce  
the costs of treating ACS.
Our 2012 focus
Globally, Crestor has continued to gain 
market share (by value) since its launch  
in 2003, with its differentiated proﬁle in 
managing cholesterol levels and its more 
recent label indications for slowing the 
progression of atherosclerosis and reducing 
the risk of CV events in some markets. 
AstraZeneca is one of the world leaders  
in cardiovascular (CV) medicines, working  
to improve the treatment of diseases that 
cause 17 million deaths each year. 
We aim to build on our strong position,  
with a particular focus on thrombosis  
(blood clotting), atherosclerosis (hardening 
of the arteries), metabolic diseases, and 
diabetes and its complications. Despite 
improvements in the quality of diagnosis  
and treatment, the unmet medical need 
remains high and these disease areas,  
and their complications, continue to grow 
worldwide (both in Established Markets  
and Emerging Markets) as a consequence 
of the spread of a westernised lifestyle.
We are developing potential new therapies 
using a variety of approaches, including 
small molecules, antibodies, peptides  
and proteins, to address unmet medical 
need in the treatment of obesity, diabetes 
and heart disease. 
Crestor is the only statin with an 
atherosclerosis indication in the US which is 
not limited by disease severity or restricted  
to patients with coronary heart disease. A 
competitor to Crestor , atorvastatin (Lipitor), 
was available in generic form in the US from 
late 2011, and from May several generic 
atorvastatin products have become 
available in the market.
Fewer than half the people thought to  
have high levels of low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL -C) (so-called ‘bad 
cholesterol’) are diagnosed and treated.  
Of treated patients, only about half reach their 
doctors’ recommended cholesterol targets 
using existing treatments. Study data has 
shown that the usual 10mg starting dose of 
Crestor is more effective at lowering LDL -C 
and produces greater achievement of LDL -C 
goals than commonly prescribed doses  
of other statins. Crestor also produces an 
increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(HDL -C) (so-called ‘good cholesterol’) across 
the dose range and has again been shown  
to reduce atherosclerotic plaque in the 
SATURN study published in 201 1.

countries, including the US, Canada and 
Brazil under the trade name Brilinta and

trade name Brilique. Additional marketing 
authorisations and regulatory submissions 
are planned for 2013.
Clinical studies 
GALAXY, is our long-term global  
clinical research programme for Crestor 
investigating links between optimal lipid 
control, atherosclerosis and CV morbidity 
and mortality. The programme has 
completed over 29 studies involving 
approximately 64,000 patients in over 57 
countries. The ongoing studies in GALAXY 
and our investigator sponsored studies 
programme aim to complete our 
understanding of the product proﬁle  
for Crestor.
PEGASUS-TIMI 54, a 21,000 patient study, 
is ongoing in over 30 countries. The study 
examines the ability of Brilinta/Brilique  
plus aspirin to prevent adverse CV events 
safely compared with aspirin alone in 
higher-risk patients one to three years  
after a heart attack. 
In July, AstraZeneca announced plans to 
conduct the EUCLID study, a global clinical 
trial involving 11,500 patients with peripheral 
artery disease (PAD), a condition affecting 
approximately 27 million people in Europe 
and North America. EUCLID, which  
began enrolling patients in early 2013, is  
a randomised, double-blind, parallel group, 
multi-centre study evaluating the efﬁcacy  
of Brilinta/Brilique (monotherapy) compared 
to clopidogrel (monotherapy) in reducing  
the primary endpoint – a composite of CV 
death, myocardial infarction or ischaemic 
stroke – in patients with PAD. 
Both PEGASUS-TIMI 54 and EUCLID  
are part of the PARTHENON programme, 
an AstraZeneca-funded comprehensive, 
long-term and evolving global research 
initiative designed to address unanswered 
questions in atherothrombotic disease  
and to investigate the impact of Brilinta/
Brilique on reducing CV events and death. 
The PARTHENON programme is part  
of AstraZeneca’s commitment to 
understand and advance treatments  
for CV diseases in an effort to improve 
Crestor continues to face increasing 
challenges from generic products. Patents 
protecting Crestor have been subject  
to a number of challenges in different 
jurisdictions. Details of these matters  
are included in Note 25 to the Financial 
Statements from page 184.
Atacand continues to be an important 
treatment option for patients with 
hypertension and symptomatic heart  
failure. Atacand is approved for the 
treatment of hypertension in over 125 
countries and for symptomatic heart failure 
in more than 70 countries. Most patients 
with hypertension fail to reach their 
treatment goals with the use of a single 
anti-hypertensive treatment and ﬁxed-dose 
combinations of two or more anti-
hypertensives are commonly prescribed  
for patients to improve efﬁcacy and 
attainment of treatment goals. Atacand Plus 
(candesartan cilexetil/hydrochlorothiazide)  
is a ﬁxed-dose combination of Atacand  
and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, 
indicated for the treatment of hypertension 
in patients who require more than one 
anti-hypertensive therapy. Atacand Plus  
is approved in 99 countries.
Axanum is a single capsule of low-dose 
ASA and esomeprazole (the active 
ingredient in Nexium). It is indicated for 
prevention of CV events in high-risk CV 
patients in need of daily low-dose ASA 
treatment and who are at risk of gastric 
ulcers. Low-dose ASA is a mainstay of 
therapy for patients at high risk of having  
a CV event such as a heart attack or  
stroke. Up to 30% of high-risk CV patients 
identiﬁed as being at gastrointestinal (GI)  
risk discontinue or take deliberate breaks 
from their low-dose ASA and one of the 
main reasons is GI problems, placing them  
at risk of a CV event after discontinuation. 
Following the ﬁrst national approval in  
the EU in August 2011, Axanum is now 
approved in 27 countries and has been 
launched in 11 countries.
Brilinta/Brilique is an oral antiplatelet 
treatment for ACS in a new chemical class 
called cyclo-pentyl-triazolo-pyrimidines 
which are selective adenosine diphospate 
(ADP) receptor antagonists that act on  
the P2Y12 ADP-receptor. Brilinta/Brilique 
remains under regulatory review in 23 
patient health. The beneﬁt of Brilinta/Brilique 
on CV thrombotic events, including CV 
mortality, observed in patients who have 
had an ACS event supports continued 
study in other areas of CV disease.  
The current PARTHENON programme  
is designed to include more than 51,000 
patients worldwide.
Diabetes 
Type 2 diabetes is a chronic progressive 
disease and patients often require multiple 
medications to control their condition.  
The disease continues to grow as a 
consequence of western lifestyles and it 
increasingly affects people at a younger 
age. There are a number of established  
oral generic and branded classes, such  
as biguanides and sulfonylureas. However, 
newer classes such as oral dipeptidyl 
peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors and GLP-1 
agonists are successfully entering the market 
by offering effective blood sugar control  
and improved tolerability. Several new 
classes of drugs are in development in  
this area, including sodium-glucose 
co-transporter 2 (SGLT2). CV safety of  
these new classes has been given particular 
emphasis in recent regulatory reviews  
and guidance documents provided by  
the FDA and other regulatory authorities.
Our 2012 focus
AstraZeneca continues its worldwide 
diabetes alliance with BMS to co-develop 
and co-commercialise two compounds 
discovered by BMS: Onglyza and Forxiga 
for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. 
Onglyza is a DPP-IV inhibitor used for  
the treatment of Type 2 diabetes and has 
been submitted for regulatory review in 94 
countries and approved in 81, including  
the US, Canada, Mexico, the EU, India, 
Brazil and China. 
Forxiga is a ﬁrst-in-class SGLT2 inhibitor 
developed with BMS as a once daily  
oral therapy for the treatment of adult 
patients with Type 2 diabetes. In November, 
Forxiga was approved in the EU to improve 
glycaemic control in adult patients with  
Type 2 diabetes. Forxiga is intended to be 
used as an adjunct to diet and exercise in 
combination with other glucose-lowering 
medicinal products, including insulin, or   AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 55
Strategy Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance Overview
Byetta, a twice daily injectable medicine 
indicated to improve blood sugar (glucose) 
control along with diet and exercise  
in adults with Type 2 diabetes mellitus,  
has been submitted for regulatory review  
in 92 countries and approved in 88, 
including the US, the EU and Japan.
Bydureon, which is a weekly injectable 
medicine indicated to improve blood sugar 
(glucose), along with diet and exercise, in 
adults with Type 2 diabetes mellitus, has 
been submitted for regulatory review in 51 
countries and approved in 39, including  
the US, the EU and Japan.
Symlin, an injected amylin analogue for the 
treatment of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in 
patients with inadequate glycaemic control 
on meal-time insulin, is approved in the US. 
During the year, our research activities  
on anti-arrhythmics to treat atrial ﬁbrillation 
were terminated.
In the pipeline 
We expanded our CV research to include 
End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and 
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), with the 
licensing of an NHE3 inhibitor from Ardelyx. 
The NHE3 inhibitor is a novel approach  
to treating sodium and ﬂuid retention in 
patients with renal impairment.
Metreleptin is a leptin analogue under 
development for the treatment of rare  
forms of inherited or acquired lipodystrophy,  
an orphan disease characterised by the 
deterioration or loss of the body’s adipose 
tissue. This compound is part of the Amylin 
portfolio that AstraZeneca and BMS are 
co-developing. Completion of the Biologics

is anticipated in the ﬁrst half of 2013.
as a monotherapy in metformin-intolerant 
patients. With the European approval, 
Forxiga is now approved in 31 countries 
with six additional countries under regulatory 
review. Additional submissions are planned 
for 2013.
In January 2012, AstraZeneca and BMS 
received a Complete Response Letter from 
the FDA requesting additional clinical data  
to allow a better assessment of the beneﬁt/
risk proﬁle for Forxiga. AstraZeneca and 
BMS have since had discussions with the 
FDA, which have resulted in a path forward 
for NDA resubmission. Additional data from 
ongoing clinical studies will be submitted  
to further support the beneﬁt/risk proﬁle  
of Forxiga with resubmission targeted for 
mid-2013.

treated with the combination of saxagliptin 
and metformin as separate tablets, has 
been submitted for regulatory review  
in 34 countries and is approved in the  
EU plus Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, 
Switzerland and Canada. 
Kombiglyze XR, an extended release 
ﬁxed-dose combination indicated as an 
adjunct to diet and exercise to improve 
glycaemic control in adults with Type 2 
diabetes mellitus when treatment with both 
saxagliptin and metformin is appropriate,  
has been submitted for regulatory review in 
38 countries and is approved in 17 countries, 
including the US, Brazil, Mexico and India.
In August, AstraZeneca and BMS  
conﬁrmed that, following the completion  
of BMS’s acquisition of Amylin, AstraZeneca 
and BMS had expanded their worldwide 
diabetes alliance to include the co-
development and co-commercialisation  
of Amylin’s portfolio of products related  
to diabetes (and other metabolic diseases) 
with a primary focus on a franchise of  
GLP-1 agonists for the treatment of Type 2 
diabetes. The products include Byetta, 
Bydureon and Symlin.
Clinical studies 
The SAVOR-TIMI 53 (saxagliptin assessment 
of vascular outcomes recorded in patients 
with diabetes mellitus) trial, which has 
completed recruitment, is designed to 
determine whether treatment with Onglyza 
when added to a patient’s current standard 
of care will result in a reduction in a composite 
CV endpoint (CV death, non-fatal myocardial 
infarction, non-fatal ischaemic stroke) 
compared to placebo. This trial, involving 
16,500 adult patients with Type 2 diabetes 
with a history of established CV disease or 
multiple risk factors, is also designed to fulﬁl 
a post-marketing requirement for the FDA. 
In June, AstraZeneca and BMS announced 
results from a Phase III clinical study that 
showed that Forxiga 10mg demonstrated 
signiﬁcant reductions in blood sugar levels 
(glycosylated haemoglobin levels, or HbA1c) 
compared with placebo at 24 weeks when 
either agent was added to existing sitagliptin 
therapy (with or without metformin) in adult 
patients with Type 2 diabetes. The results 
were maintained over a 24 week extension 
and similar results were observed when  
the data was analysed by subjects’ 
background therapy. The study also 
demonstrated signiﬁcant reductions in total 
body weight and fasting plasma glucose 
levels in patients taking Forxiga added to 
sitagliptin (with or without metformin), with 
results maintained throughout the duration 
of the study extension.
EXSCEL (EXenatide Study of Cardiovascular 
Event Lowering) is designed to determine if 
there are favourable CV effects of exenatide 
treatment, using Bydureon (exenatide 
extended release injectable suspension).  
The EXSCEL study started in 2010 and  
is planned to run until 2017 . The study  
has enrolled patients during 2012 and is 
designed for 9,500 patients. 
By 2030, almost 25 million people will die 
from CV disease, mainly from heart disease 
and stroke. CV diseases are projected to 
remain the single leading cause of death.

Strategy Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance Overview
In August, AstraZeneca announced that it 
had entered into an agreement with Pﬁzer 
for the OTC rights for Nexium. Under the 
terms of the agreement, Pﬁzer will acquire 
the exclusive global rights to market Nexium 
for OTC indications worldwide. 
Nexium continues to face increasing 
challenges from generic products. Patents 
protecting Nexium have been subject  
to a number of challenges in different 
jurisdictions. Details of these matters  
are included in Note 25 to the Financial 
Statements from page 184.
Losec/Prilosec, used for the short-term  
and long-term treatment of acid-related 
diseases, was ﬁrst launched in 1988 and is 
approved for the treatment of GERD and 
other indications. We continue to maintain 
certain patent property covering Losec/
Prilosec. Losec/Prilosec is available both  
as a prescription-only medication and,  
in some countries, as an OTC medication 
where it offers consumers a more effective 
self-medication option for the treatment  
of heartburn compared with antacids  
and H 2-receptor antagonists.
In October, AstraZeneca and Ironwood 
announced an agreement to co-develop 
and co-commercialise in China Ironwood’s 
product linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase-C 
(GC-C) agonist used for the treatment of 
irritable bowel syndrome with constipation 
(IBS-C) and chronic idiopathic constipation 
(CIC) in China. Ironwood markets the 
product under the name Linzess in the  
US. Clinical trial applications for linaclotide 
have been ﬁled with the SFDA.
In the pipeline 
Our activities in the ﬁeld of inﬂammatory 
bowel disease include clinical stage  
testing of two antibodies in collaboration 
with Amgen that target IL -13 and a4b7 .  
In addition, we have expanded our GI 
research to include IBS and IBD with  
the NHE3 inhibitor programme, including 
the lead compound RDX5791 which we 
licensed from Ardelyx in October.
We aim to develop our position in 
gastrointestinal (GI) treatments by continuing 
to focus on our existing proton pump 
inhibitors (PPIs) and the development of new 
therapies for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) 
and inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD).
Our 2012 focus
Nexium is marketed in more than 125 
countries and is available in oral (tablet, 
capsule and sachet for oral suspension)  
and intravenous (i.v.) dosage forms, for the 
treatment of acid-related diseases. Nexium 
is also approved for use in children from the 
age of one month in the US and from the 
age of one year in Europe and other markets. 
Nexium capsules were launched in Japan  
in September 2011 after a Japan-speciﬁc 
development programme.
Nexium is an effective short-term and 
long-term therapy for patients with 
gastroesophageal reﬂux disease (GERD). 
Nexium is also approved for the healing  
and prevention of ulcers associated with 
NSAID therapy and for the treatment  
of patients with the rare gastric disorder, 
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Nexium,  
in combination with antibiotics, is also 
approved for use for the treatment of 
duodenal ulcers caused by Helicobacter 
pylori infection in the US, Europe and other 
markets. Nexium is also approved for this 
use in children from the age of four years 
(approvals vary between countries).
Nexium i.v. is used as an alternative  
dosage form when oral administration  
is not suitable. Nexium i.v. is approved  
for this use in children from the age of  
one month in the US and from the age  
of one year in Europe and other markets.  
In addition, it is approved in Europe  
and other markets for the prevention  
of peptic-ulcer bleeding.
In developed countries, the prevalence range 
for GERD is 10% to 20% of the population.

immunoprophylaxis in the marketplace

paediatric patients at high risk of serious 
RSV disease. Synagis is administered  
by intra-muscular injection.
In the pipeline 
We are developing a live intranasal vaccine 
for the prevention of lower respiratory tract 
illness caused by RSV in otherwise healthy 
infants. The lead vaccine candidate  
in clinical development is in Phase I.
Serious bacterial 
infections
World demand for antibiotics and novel 
therapeutic approaches remains high and 
will continue to grow due to escalating 
resistance and the increased risk of serious 
infections in both immuno-suppressed 
patients and ageing populations. Many 
bacterial infections currently have few 
satisfactory treatment options, prompting 
demand for new and better therapies.  
Our discovery and early development 
platforms focus on the identiﬁcation of 
pathogen-directed approaches, with a 
particular emphasis on multi-drug resistant 
gram-negatives and methicillin resistant 
staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). 
Our 2012 focus
Zinforo is a novel injectable cephalosporin, 
developed in collaboration with Forest,  
which is approved for use in the EU.  
Zinforo provides broad coverage against 
common causative pathogens, such  
as staphylococcus aureus, including  
MRSA, a cause of serious and difﬁcult  
to treat complicated skin infections, 
streptococci in complicated skin infections, 
and streptococcus pneumoniae and 
methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus 
(MSSA) in community acquired pneumonia. 
Forest markets ceftaroline in the US under 
the brand name Teﬂaro. In August, the 
European Commission granted marketing 
authorisation for Zinforo. This makes  
Zinforo the only approved cephalosporin 
monotherapy in the EU with demonstrated 
clinical efﬁcacy against MRSA in difﬁcult  
to treat complicated skin infections.
We aim to build a leading franchise  
in the treatment of infectious diseases 
through continued commercialisation  
of brands such as Synagis, Merrem/
Meronem, FluMist/Fluenz and Cubicin,  
the registration and launch of Zinforo  
in the EU, and through our other ongoing 
development programmes. 
We also aim to make effective use of our 
structural and genomic-based discovery 
technologies and antibody platforms, 
vaccines and continued small molecule  
and biologics research into novel 
approaches in areas of unmet medical 
need. Complementing our biologics 
capabilities, we are building a small 
molecule anti-viral platform based on 
in-house capabilities and external 
collaborations, focused on respiratory 
viruses, such as respiratory syncytial  
virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus.
Respiratory  
syncytial virus 
Approximately half of all infants are infected 
with RSV during the ﬁrst year of life and 
nearly all children in the US have been 
infected by the time they reach their second 
birthday. RSV is the most common virus 
that causes lung and airway infections in 
infants and young children. It is the leading 
cause of hospitalisations and admissions  
to paediatric intensive care units in the ﬁrst 
year of life. Premature babies (earlier than  
36 weeks gestational age, especially those 
less than 32 weeks) and babies with chronic 
lung disease or congenital heart disease are 
at increased risk of contracting serious RSV 
disease than full-term healthy babies.
Our 2012 focus
Synagis is used for the prevention of  
serious lower respiratory tract disease 
caused by RSV in children at high risk of  
the disease. It was the ﬁrst MAb approved  
in the US for an infectious disease and has 
become the global standard of care for  
RSV prevention. Approved in 83 countries 
worldwide, Synagis remains the only 
Cubicin is used for the treatment of serious 
gram-positive infections in hospitalised 
patients and is sold by AstraZeneca in 
selected territories in Asia, Europe and  
the Middle East. Cubicin was submitted  
for marketing approval by the SFDA in  
China in September for the additional 
indication of complicated skin and skin 
structure infections.
Merrem/Meronem remains the leading 
carbapenem anti-bacterial which is 
approved in most countries outside Japan.
AZD9773 (formerly known as CytoFab),  
was a potential treatment for severe sepsis 
licensed from Protherics Inc. (now part  
of the BTG plc group). In August, further 
development of AZD9773 was halted  
after negative Phase llb study results.
In the pipeline 
Following the acquisition of Novexel in 2010, 
we are working with Forest on future joint 
global development programmes, including 
CAZ AVI (a combination of ceftazidime and 
avibactam), CXL (a combination of ceftaroline 
and avibactam) and ATM AVI (a combination 
of aztreonam and avibactam). The CAZ AVI 
Phase III programme was initiated in 2011 
and includes seven trials to conﬁrm the 
efﬁcacy and tolerability of CAZ AVI in adult 
patients with complicated intra-abdominal 
infections, complicated urinary tract infections 
or nosocomial pneumonia. Patients with 
infections which are resistant to commonly 
used antibiotics will also be included in the 
Phase III programme. CXL is in Phase II 
development for serious infections where 
coverage against MRSA and streptococci 
as well as common gram-negative resistant 
strains is required. 
Our early research and development efforts 
aim to address multi-resistant bacterial 
strains expressing metallo-betalactamases, 
for which very few, if any, treatment options 
exist. We are collaborating with regulatory 
authorities to design the clinical trials for 
these programmes.  Performance | Therapy Area Review

Inﬂuenza virus
Inﬂuenza is the most common vaccine-
preventable disease in the developed world. 
According to WHO estimates, seasonal 
inﬂuenza results in three to ﬁve million cases 
of severe illness and up to half a million 
deaths globally each year, primarily among 
the elderly. Rates of infection are highest 
among children. 
Our 2012 focus
FluMist is a trivalent live, attenuated  
nasally delivered vaccine approved for the 
prevention of disease caused by inﬂuenza 
virus subtypes A and B in eligible children 
and adults. FluMist is approved for eligible 
individuals in seven countries including  
the US, Canada and Brazil.
In February 2012, AstraZeneca received 
approval from the FDA for FluMist 
Quadrivalent (inﬂuenza vaccine live, 
intra-nasal), formerly known as MEDI3250,  
in the prevention of inﬂuenza. This marks  
the ﬁrst four-strain inﬂuenza vaccine,  
and the only intra-nasal four-strain vaccine, 
approved by the FDA. Most other approved 
seasonal inﬂuenza vaccines currently 
available in the US are trivalent, containing 
three strains (two strains of type A inﬂuenza 
(A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) and one B lineage 
strain). FluMist Quadrivalent contains four 
strains (two type A strains and two type B 
lineages) to help provide broad protection 
against circulating inﬂuenza A and B.
In the pipeline 
The MAA for the quadrivalent live  
attenuated inﬂuenza vaccine (formerly 
known as MEDI3250) was submitted  
in September in the EU. 
Neglected tropical 
diseases
As part of our commitment to make  
a contribution to improving health in  
the developing world, we are working  
to ﬁnd new, improved treatments for  
neglected tropical diseases. Our strategy  
is collaborative and seeks to leverage 
internal investment and expertise in 
tuberculosis (TB) and malaria. For  
other neglected tropical diseases,  
we participate in open innovation and 
knowledge-sharing platforms, enabling  
the use of AstraZeneca assets and 
infrastructure by external partners.
TB remains a complex research area in 
which collaborations play an important  
role. Our discovery collaboration with the 
Global Alliance for TB Drug Development 
continues to work towards progressing 
suitable compounds through to the lead 
optimisation stage. Research funded by  
a Wellcome Trust grant under the ‘R&D  
for Affordable Healthcare in India’ initiative, 
which will be used to identify novel lead 
molecules for the treatment of TB, continues. 
Our most advanced programme, AZD5847 
(a novel anti-tubercular oxazolidinone 
antibiotic), progressed to Phase IIa trials  
in South Africa, with support from  
The National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases. 
Malaria is another disease for which  
there remains a tremendous medical  
need. Our collaboration with Medicines  
for Malaria Ventures has progressed during 
2012 according to plan, and is currently 
focused on the discovery of a new class  
of malaria medicines. We anticipate that  
this collaboration will continue to progress 
through discovery stages in 2013.
In 2012, we extended our range of  
external collaborations with new screening 
agreements with the Liverpool School  
of Tropical Medicine and the Drugs for 
Neglected Diseases Initiative. In these 
collaborations, AstraZeneca shares 
compounds with external partners  
with a view to identifying new leads against  
a variety of diseases of the developing 
world, including leishmaniasis, sleeping 
sickness, river blindness and Chagas 
disease. We also actively participated  
in the WIPO Re:Search initiative, promoting 
open innovation for the discovery of  
novel treatments.
According to a 2008 study, every year at 
least 25,000 patients in the EU alone die 
from an infection caused by multidrug-
resistant bacteria, and estimated additional 
healthcare costs and productivity losses 
are at least €1.5 billion. 
Worldwide, annual epidemics of influenza 
result in about three to five million cases  
of severe illness and up to 500,000 deaths.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 62
There is still signiﬁcant unmet medical  
need in the areas of chronic pain, cognitive 
disorders and other serious central nervous 
system disorders. 
Our aim is to strengthen our position in 
neuroscience through our experience with 
Seroquel XR and to discover and develop 
new drug candidates with meaningful 
therapeutic advantages, primarily in 
Alzheimer’s disease, neuropathic pain 
control and depression. Many of these 
debilitating illnesses have no effective 
treatments and, for others, current therapies 
are poorly effective, leaving major unmet 
medical need.
Rapid progress is being made in 
understanding diseases of the brain,  
driven by technological advances in ﬁelds 
including genetics, cell biology, imaging  
and informatics. However, despite these 
advances there have been very few novel 
treatments delivered during the last 10  
to 15 years and it is clear that a new way  
of working is required which captures 
advances in neuroscience and harnesses 
them through the drug development 
life-cycle.
AstraZeneca responded in 2012 by creating 
a new neuroscience Innovative Medicines 
Unit (Virtual iMed) made up of a team of 
approximately 40 scientists conducting 
discovery and development externally, 
through a network of partners in academia 
and industry. The team is based in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts, US and Cambridge, UK. 
The locations are strongly associated with 
neuroscience research and the team works 
closely with partners such as the Karolinska 
Institute in Sweden. The Virtual iMed  
is designed to be ﬂexible, independent  
and lean in its structure. Scientists are 
empowered to make decisions quickly.  
The team is focused on target identiﬁcation 
to Proof of Concept studies, with high level 
focus on personalised medicine and 
innovative approaches to early clinical 
development. The Virtual iMed is designed 
to bring together scientiﬁc advances of the 
biotechnology and academic world and to 
develop their potential through the scientiﬁc, 
commercial and geographical reach  
of AstraZeneca.
We will consider any treatments for 
psychiatric, neurological or analgesic 
disorders affecting the central or peripheral 
nervous system which have a solid  
scientiﬁc basis, a high probability to deliver 
meaningful new medicines to patients,  
and will provide an acceptable return on 
investment. We will be looking at indications 
that affect smaller numbers of patients.  
We will focus on selected populations  
of patients whose disease biology makes 
them ideally suited for a particular treatment 
and we will test our therapeutic candidates 
in those populations ﬁrst. Where treatments 
show promise in such selected patient 
groups, we will include a broader range  
of patients with the same disease or other 
disease states that might beneﬁt from  
the approach. For example, a treatment  
that works on a fundamental disease 
process in neurons that eventually causes 
neurodegeneration might be best examined 
initially in patients with Huntington’s disease. 
That same therapy could be as well suited 
for Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS) or other disorders. 
Neurology 
Alzheimer’s disease remains one of the 
largest areas of unmet medical need. 
Product development in this therapy  
area is particularly difﬁcult due in part  
to the challenges of establishing efﬁcacy  
in clinical studies. Current treatments, which 
doctors consider inadequate, target the 
symptoms, not the underlying cause,  
of the disease. Most, if not all, marketed 
treatments will face patent expiry by 2015. 
Disease modiﬁcation, delivered through 
biologics and/or small molecule treatments, 
is clearly the hope for Alzheimer’s disease 
patients and for patients with other 
neurodegenerative disorders such as 
Parkinson’s disease. Combined with better 
diagnostics, disease modiﬁers in both areas 
are expected to allow for earlier intervention 
and better clinical outcomes. Unfortunately, 
the ﬁrst wave of disease modiﬁers is still 
several years away.
In the pipeline 
Alzheimer’s disease is deﬁned and 
characterised by the presence of the  
protein amyloid beta (Abeta) deposits  
in the brain. Present understanding of the 
pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease 
suggests that alterations in Abeta production, 
distribution or aggregation lead to Abeta 
deposition which in turn impacts neuronal 
viability and function. A second protein 
altered in Alzheimer’s disease is tau.  
Our portfolio comprises small molecule  
and biologic projects addressing both  
tau and amyloid, as well as exploring new 
mechanisms based on the developments  
in disease understanding. 
Our research pipeline is also exploiting 
opportunities presented by emerging 
biologic therapies and contains  
projects directed at modulating protein 
accumulation and signalling for a number  
of neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, 
the continued progress of technology 
platforms directed at facilitating the 
transport of macromolecules into the  
central nervous system compartment  
may provide beneﬁts to patient health. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 63
Strategy Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance Overview
Through our collaborations with the 
Karolinska Institute in Sweden, the Banner 
Alzheimer’s Institute in the US, the National 
Institute of Radiological Sciences in Japan 
and others, our R&D capabilities in positron 
emission tomography (PET) imaging  
of the human brain continues to progress. 
AstraZeneca’s amyloid PET ligands may 
enable us to detect Alzheimer’s disease 
early and to assess drug effects in Alzheimer’s 
disease. We have discovered and taken  
into patient studies one F-18 and two C-11 
amyloid PET ligands which are being 
developed as research biomarkers. 
A new alliance involving several academic 
centres, named A5, is a novel, open-
architecture alliance with four leading 
academicians that was launched in July  
to investigate potential new Alzheimer’s 
disease treatments. The initiative is focused 
on the role of apoliprotein E (ApoE) in 
Alzheimer’s disease. ApoE is considered 
second only to age as a risk factor for the 
development of Alzheimer’s disease. Drug 
discovery efforts involving ApoE have been 
hampered by challenging biology and  
a lack of suitable in vivo models. In addition 
to ApoE, the A5 alliance will focus on 
identiﬁcation, validation and risk reduction  
of other drug targets for treatment of 
Alzheimer’s disease.
Psychiatry 
Globally, more than 350 million people of  
all ages suffer from depression (WHO 2012). 
Despite this, psychiatric illness remains 
under-detected, under-diagnosed and 
under-treated, and current treatments  
leave substantial unmet medical need. 
Three National Institute of Mental Health 
sponsored effectiveness studies in the  
US have reported treatment response  
rates in depression, bipolar disorder and 
schizophrenia to be less than 50%, with low 
(around 30%) rates of remission and poor 
compliance. Clear opportunities exist for 
novel approaches targeting deﬁned patient 
sub-groups not adequately treated with 
current generic broad spectrum agents.
Our 2012 focus
Seroquel XR has been approved in 85 
countries for schizophrenia, 81 countries  
for bipolar mania, 72 countries for bipolar 
depression, 61 countries for bipolar 
maintenance, 65 countries for major 
depressive disorder (MDD) and nine 
countries for generalised anxiety disorder. 
Patents protecting Seroquel XR have  
been subject to a number of challenges  
in different jurisdictions. In some cases,  
the patents have been found to be invalid.  
Details of these matters are included  
in Note 25 to the Financial Statements  
from page 184.
In March 2012, top-line results from the 
remaining Phase III studies investigating 
efﬁcacy, tolerability and safety of TC-5214, 
as an adjunct therapy to an anti-depressant 
in patients with MDD who did not respond 
adequately to initial anti-depressant 
treatment, were released. RENAISSANCE 4 
and RENAISSANCE 5, both of which are 
efﬁcacy and tolerability studies, did not  
meet the primary endpoint of change  
on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression  
Rating Scale total score after eight weeks  
of adjunct treatment with TC-5214 as 
compared to placebo. These studies 
conclude the RENAISSANCE programme 
for TC-5214. Based on the totality of  
the results, AstraZeneca and Targacept 
decided not to pursue a regulatory ﬁling  
for TC-5214 as an adjunct treatment for 
patients with MDD. We terminated the 
TC-5214 collaboration with Targacept, with  
all rights and licences granted under the 
licence agreement reverting to Targacept.
In the pipeline 
AZD6765, a low-trapping NMDA  
(N-methyl-D-aspartate) channel blocker  
to address the needs of patients with  
severe treatment-refractory depression,  
has progressed into Phase IIb development. 
Phase IIa results presented in December 
demonstrated anti-depressant efﬁcacy 
following single and repeated intravenous 
infusions in patients who have shown 
inadequate response to multiple oral 
therapies. An ongoing Phase IIb study  
is designed to establish a chronic treatment 
regimen in this difﬁcult to treat patient 
population. Additional early-stage research 
programmes are also focusing on this area.
Analgesia and 
anaesthesia
The small number of currently approved 
products in the neuropathic pain market  
will come off patent between 2014 and 
2017 . However, few new products are  
in development and the unmet medical 
need for improvements in both efﬁcacy  
and tolerability is such that the market 
remains highly attractive. In Asia, neuropathic 
pain drugs are gaining approval, shifting 
cultural and medical treatment barriers.  
The chronic nociceptive pain market, 
including osteoarthritis and chronic  
low back pain, is steadily growing due  
to ageing populations combined with  
longer life expectancy across all regions, 
including Asia. 
Opioids are considered the gold standard 
for efﬁcacy for moderate to severe pain 
across pain segments. However, opioid pain 
control comes with unwanted side effects 
such as bowel dysfunction. There remains  
a high unmet medical need for products 
that enable continued opioid pain control  
by reducing or eliminating side effects. Performance | Therapy Area Review
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 64
Biologics are an emerging treatment  
option for pain control and this is an area  
in which we have an active interest. 
It is believed that advances in the 
understanding of the mechanisms which 
lead to neuropathic pain will allow for 
improved patient segmentation and potential 
increases in the success rate of drug 
development. We are exploring smaller 
treatments in focused pain areas where 
patients can be selected on the basis of 
symptomatic characteristics within the overall 
development and regulatory approach.
Our 2012 focus
Vimovo, 375/20-500/20mg delayed-release 
tablets, co-developed by AstraZeneca  
and Pozen, is a ﬁxed-dose combination  
of enteric-coated naproxen (an NSAID),  
and immediate-release esomeprazole,  
a stomach acid-reducing proton pump 
inhibitor (PPI). Vimovo is generally approved 
for symptomatic relief in the treatment  
of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis  
and ankylosing spondylitis in patients  
at risk of developing NSAID-associated 
gastric and/or duodenal ulcers. Vimovo  
is also indicated for treatment in patients 
where lower doses of naproxen or of other 
NSAIDs are not considered sufﬁcient.
Following FDA approval in April 2010, 
Vimovo launched in the US in July 2010.  
In October, Vimovo received positive 
agreement for approval in 23 European 
member states. 
In the pipeline 
Naloxegol (formerly NKTR-118), licensed 
from Nektar Therapeutics, is a once daily, 
oral, peripherally acting opioid receptor 
antagonist under investigation for treatment 
of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) as  
a side effect of prescription opioid pain 
medication. Positive top-line results from 
two Phase III trials and one safety extension 
trial in patients with non-cancer related  
pain and OIC, a common side effect of 
prescription opioids, were announced  
in November. Additional analyses and 
regulatory consultations are ongoing.
Our research pipeline is exploring  
biologic therapies and contains projects 
directed at modulating afferent signalling, 
inﬂammation associated with pain, and  
the interplay between the immune and 
nervous systems. Projects are directed  
at targeting well-deﬁned patient segments, 
with subset selection based on, for example, 
an increase in particular inﬂammatory 
markers in osteoarthritis and pancreatitis. 
We continue to focus on areas of high 
unmet medical need, and thus, in addition  
to osteoarthritis, we are also active in 
researching novel therapies for neuropathic 
pain. Efforts to access targets in the central 
nervous system compartment, such as the 
spinal cord and the brain, continue to be 
facilitated by solid progression of technology 
platforms designed to transport biologics 
from the periphery to the central nervous 
system compartment.
At any time, more than 450 million people 
worldwide are affected by mental, 
neurological or behavioural problems,  
and the rate is steadily rising.

We aim to build on our position as one of 
the world leaders in cancer treatment with 
established brands such as Zoladex and 
Arimidex and growing brands such as 
Faslodex and Iressa. 
Our future growth will be driven through 
targeting the right treatments, both small 
molecules and biologics, to the right patients, 
using companion diagnostics where 
appropriate. This approach is driving the 
growth of Iressa and is a key focus in the 
development of our early stage portfolio.
Our 2012 focus
Arimidex, ﬁrst launched in 1995, remains  
a leading global hormonal therapy for 
patients with early breast cancer. This 
success is largely based on the extensive 
long-term efﬁcacy and safety results of  
the ATAC study, which showed Arimidex  
to be signiﬁcantly superior to tamoxifen at 
preventing breast cancer recurrence during 
and beyond the ﬁve year treatment course. 
Zoladex, a luteinising hormone-releasing 
hormone (LHRH) agonist, is approved in  
120 countries for the treatment of prostate 
cancer, breast cancer and certain benign 
gynaecological disorders. In non-metastatic 
prostate cancer, Zoladex has been shown 
to improve overall survival, both when used 
in addition to radical prostatectomy and 
when used in addition to radiotherapy. In 
breast cancer, Zoladex is widely approved 
for use in advanced breast cancer in 
pre-menopausal women. In a number  
of countries, Zoladex is also approved  
for the adjuvant treatment of early stage 
pre-menopausal breast cancer as  
an alternative to and/or in addition to 
chemotherapy. Zoladex offers proven 
survival beneﬁts for breast cancer patients 
with a favourable tolerability proﬁle. 
Casodex and Zoladex are both leading 
endocrine therapies for the treatment  
of prostate cancer. Casodex is used as a 
50mg tablet for the treatment of advanced 
prostate cancer and as a 150mg tablet  
for the treatment of locally advanced 
prostate cancer.
Iressa is approved in 89 countries and  
is one of the leading epidermal growth 
factor receptor-tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TK) 
inhibitors in Japan and the Asia Paciﬁc 
region where it is marketed for pre-treated 
advanced non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). Outside the EU, indications  
are being sought or expanded from the 
pre-treated setting to include 1
st
 line  
patients whose tumours harbour activating 
mutations of the epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR). In the EU, Iressa is the ﬁrst 
personalised medicine for the treatment of 
adults with locally advanced or metastatic 
NSCLC with activating mutations.
Faslodex 500mg is now approved in 65 
countries including the member states  
of the EU, the US and Japan. It offers an 
additional, efﬁcacious, hormonal therapy 
option for patients with hormone-receptor 
positive advanced breast cancer. It is given 
by once monthly injections and is approved 
for the treatment of hormone-receptor 
positive advanced breast cancer in 
post-menopausal women whose disease 
has progressed following treatment with  
a prior endocrine therapy. We are now 
exploring the efﬁcacy and safety of Faslodex 
500mg compared to Arimidex in the 1
st
 line 
advanced breast cancer setting (hormone-
naïve patients) in the Phase III FALCON trial.
Caprelsa ﬁghts cancer through two proven 
mechanisms: blocking the development  
of tumour blood supply by inhibition of the 
vascular endothelial growth factor pathway 
and by inhibiting the growth and survival of 
the tumour through EGFR and rearranged 
during transfection (RET) pathways. 
Caprelsa was approved by the FDA and 
granted Orphan Drug status in April 2011, 
and was approved in the EU in February 
2012 for the treatment of medullary thyroid 
cancer (MTC) in patients with unresectable 
locally advanced or metastatic disease. 
Caprelsa is also approved in Canada and 
remains under review by other regulatory 
agencies around the world.
In the pipeline 
Our early oncology pipeline includes a range 
of novel compounds that target signalling 
pathways believed to be pivotal in cancer 
cell growth and survival as well as DNA 
repair mechanisms. Despite set-backs  
in earlier Phase II trials, olaparib, a poly  
ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, 
continues in Phase II trials in relapsed 
ovarian cancer, gastric cancer and germline 
BRCA mutation positive cancers. Olaparib 
has been approved to begin Phase III in 
2013 pending the results of ongoing trials.
Selumetinib, a potent mitogen-activated 
protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor licensed  
from Array BioPharma, Inc., continues  
in Phase II development. 
We are also developing potential new  
cancer drugs using a variety of biologics 
approaches. Our investigational biologics  
are directed towards molecular targets  
with a strong role in cancer progression  
and incorporate innovative technologies, 
providing the potential to eliminate cancer 
cells in more effective ways. Within biologics, 
we continue to progress a discovery  
and clinical pipeline that is balanced  
across different anti-tumour approaches, 
including disrupting cancer cells’ ability to 
grow or communicate (growth factor and 
survival signalling), modulating the blood 
supply that tumours need to grow (vascular 
modulation) and activating a patient’s own 
immune system to eliminate cancer cells 
(immune-mediated therapy).
We currently have ﬁve investigational 
biologics in Phase I clinical trials and four  
in Phase II clinical trials. Additional drug 
candidates are expected to progress into 
clinical trials in 2013. Moxetumomab  
is a monoclonal antibody approved  
to begin Phase III testing in hairy cell 
leukemia in 2013.
Deaths from cancer worldwide are  
projected to continue rising, with an 
estimated 13.1 million deaths in 2030.

We aim to build on our strong position  
in the respiratory and inﬂammation area 
through the growth of key products, with 
new indications and market launches, 
including chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD), as well as through 
developing a strong pipeline of novel  
small molecule and biologics approaches  
to COPD and asthma. 
We aspire to enter the rheumatology  
market through our biologics pipeline  
and targeted small molecule approaches 
such as fostamatinib. With our acquisition  
of Ardea we have expanded our 
inﬂammation focus to include gout.
COPD and asthma 
According to WHO, COPD, a serious  
lung disease that includes chronic bronchitis 
and/or emphysema, is currently the  
fourth leading cause of death worldwide, 
with future increases anticipated. Current 
treatment has recently demonstrated  
the potential for some survival beneﬁt  
but the impact of medication on the  
course of the disease is small and the 
prognosis of the COPD patient remains 
poor. In asthma, unmet medical need for 
patients whose asthma is inadequately 
controlled by current treatments  
remains an important issue and disease 
normalisation is currently not optimally 
achieved by any approved treatment.
The typical treatment for both COPD and 
asthma is a ﬁxed-dose combination of an 
inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with a long-acting 
beta 2-agonist (LABA) (for example Symbicort) 
or for COPD speciﬁcally, an inhaled 
long-acting muscarinic antagonist as either 
monotherapy or adjunctive to ICS/LABA 
treatment. Other major asthma treatments 
include monotherapy ICSs, oral leukotriene 
receptor antagonists and/or oral steroids  
for severe disease and (in combination  
with antibiotics) for exacerbations, as well  
as a MAb targeting allergic asthma for 
moderate to severe asthma patients. Over 
recent years, studies employing patient-
centric tools, such as the asthma control 
questionnaire, have revealed surprisingly low 
asthma control at all severities, highlighting 
an underestimated medical need.
Our 2012 focus
Symbicort improves symptoms and 
provides a clinically important improvement 
in the health of many patients with either 
asthma or COPD by providing effective  
and rapid control of the symptoms.
Symbicort pMDI is indicated in the US for 
the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years 
of age and older. The COPD indication was 
approved and launched in the US in early 
2009. In June 2010, the US Prescribing 
Information was updated to include the FDA’s 
new recommendations for appropriate use 
of asthma medications containing LABAs. 
The class label changes for all LABA-
containing products are speciﬁc to the 
treatment of asthma and do not apply  
to the treatment of COPD.
Symbicort Turbuhaler was originally 
launched in markets outside the US in 2000 
and in Japan in 2010 for the treatment of 
adult asthma and is co-promoted in Japan 
with Astellas Pharma, Inc. The COPD 
indication and the SMART treatment 
regimen were approved in Japan in 2012.
Symbicort SMART (Symbicort Maintenance 
And Reliever Therapy) provides improved 
asthma control including less risk for 
exacerbations relative to comparators  
and simpliﬁes asthma management  
through the use of only one inhaler for  
both maintenance and relief of asthma 
symptoms. As well as being a cost-effective 
treatment, the Symbicort SMART approach 
reduces the usage of both inhaled and  
oral corticosteroids compared to other 
treatment options.
Pulmicort is one of the world’s leading 
inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment  
of asthma and is available in several forms. 
Teva has had an exclusive licence to sell  
a generic version of Pulmicort Respules  
in the US since 2009. Pulmicort continues 
to face increasing challenge from generic 
products. Patents protecting Pulmicort have 
been subject to a number of challenges  
in different jurisdictions. Details of these 
matters are included in Note 25 to the 
Financial Statements from page 184.
Clinical studies
In April 2012, the FDA provided AstraZeneca 
with a Post-marketing Requirement for  
a Symbicort LABA safety study, designed  
to be pooled with similar studies with other 
LABA products. AstraZeneca  
is required to conduct a trial comparing 
Symbicort Inhalation Aerosol with Pulmicort 
to evaluate the risk of serious asthma 
outcomes (hospitalisations, intubation, 
death) in 11,700 adult and adolescent 
patients. Recruitment in the trial is ongoing.
In the pipeline 
Building on our capabilities in combinations 
and inhaler device development demonstrated 
through our experience with Symbicort,  
we are aiming to further improve the 
mainstay of treatment for COPD patients  
by combining bronchodilators, being 
developed in collaboration with Pulmagen 
Therapeutics (Synergy) Limited, with inhaled 
anti-inﬂammatory compounds such as 
inhaled selective glucocorticoid receptor 
agonists (AZD5423, which continues in 
Phase II), being developed in collaboration 
with Bayer Schering Pharma AG. Additionally, 
we are targeting inﬂammation in COPD  
using oral routes of administration with 
AZD5069, a CXCR2 antagonist that targets 
neutrophils which is in Phase II. MEDI8968, 
an anti-interleukin-IL -1 receptor MAb, and 
benralizumab, an anti-interleukin-5 receptor 
MAb, are both in Phase II development  
for severe to very severe COPD. 
We are targeting uncontrolled asthma 
focusing on reducing the rate of annual 
asthma exacerbations through small 
molecule approaches such as a CRTh2 
receptor antagonist and toll-like receptor 7 
agonists (being developed in collaboration 
with Dainippon Sumitomo). Biological 
treatments in Phase IIb include benralizumab 
and tralokinumab, a MAb that targets 
interleukin-13. Also, in Phase II, brodalumab 
is an anti-interleukin-17 receptor MAb  
(being developed in collaboration with 
Amgen) for asthma.
In April 2012, AstraZeneca and Amgen 
agreed to jointly develop and commercialise 
ﬁve MAbs from Amgen’s clinical inﬂammation 
portfolio including brodalumab. The 
collaboration will provide Amgen with 
additional resources to optimally progress 
its portfolio, and Amgen will beneﬁt from the 
strong respiratory, inﬂammation and asthma 
development expertise of AstraZeneca’s 
biologics capabilities. The collaboration  
will also capitalise on AstraZeneca’s global 
commercial reach in respiratory and 
gastrointestinal diseases.  AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 69
Strategy Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance Overview
Rheumatology and gout
Rheumatoid arthritis is currently treated with 
generic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic 
agents and, where the relevant criteria are 
met, biologic disease-modiﬁers. There 
remains a need for novel effective treatments 
since only about a third of patients treated 
with biologics achieve their treatment goals. 
We anticipate that the rheumatoid arthritis 
market will experience modest annual 
growth over the next decade. Sales of the 
biologic tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha 
blockers accounted for 72% of major market 
rheumatoid arthritis sales in 2012. Use  
of other biologic approaches is expected  
to increase due to new entrants, new 
subcutaneous formulations and use earlier  
in the treatment pathway. Novel oral drugs 
targeting intra-cellular signalling pathways 
may provide anti-TNF-like levels of efﬁcacy 
and potentially more convenient dosing, 
especially in patients who currently are  
not taking or are ineligible to take injectable 
biologic agents.
Current treatment of systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) focuses on 
suppressing symptoms and controlling 
disease ﬂares, and in the case of lupus 
nephritis preventing renal failure. Although  
a biologic has recently been launched  
for SLE, signiﬁcant unmet medical  
need remains. Most emerging biologic 
agents are likely to be used initially after 
failure of standard therapies (including 
corticosteroids and immunosuppressants) 
or in combination in order to provide 
incremental beneﬁt, prevent ﬂares and allow 
reduction of high-dose chronic steroid use.
Gout is a chronic, painful, debilitating 
arthritis caused by elevated serum uric  
acid due to overproduction and/or under 
excretion of uric acid. Gout is the second 
most common arthritis after osteoarthritis 
and is the most common form of arthritis  
in men over 40.
In the pipeline 
Fostamatinib was in-licensed from  
Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in 2010. 
Fostamatinib is a potential ﬁrst-in-class  
oral spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor 
being evaluated for a rheumatoid arthritis 
indication. It is thought to block reversible 
signalling in multiple cell types involved  
in inﬂammation and tissue degradation  
in rheumatoid arthritis. The ongoing Phase 
III programme, called OSKIRA, commenced  
in September 2010. In the Phase IIb dose 
ﬁnding study OSKIRA-4, fostamatinib as a 
monotherapy met the ﬁrst primary objective 
showing a statistically signiﬁcant superior 
DAS28 score change from baseline 
compared to placebo at six weeks at the 
100mg twice daily dose and the 100mg 
twice daily for a month followed by 150mg 
once daily dose, but not at the 100mg  
twice daily for a month followed by 100mg 
once daily dose. The OSKIRA-4 study  
did not meet its second primary objective  
as all fostamatinib monotherapy doses  
were inferior to adalimumab monotherapy  
at week 24 based on DAS28. The safety  
and tolerability ﬁndings for fostamatinib  
as reported in the OSKIRA-4 study were 
generally consistent with those previously 
observed in the TASKi Phase II programme. 
Results from the ongoing Phase III OSKIRA 
programme are anticipated in the ﬁrst half  
of 2013 and would form the basis  
of regulatory submissions.
In June, AstraZeneca acquired Ardea, a  
San Diego, California-based biotechnology 
company focused on the development  
of small molecule therapeutics. Ardea’s 
clinically most advanced product candidate, 
lesinurad (formerly known as RDEA594),  
is currently in Phase III development. 
Lesinurad is a selective inhibitor of URAT1,  
a transporter in the proximal tubule cells of 
the kidney that regulates uric acid excretion 
from the body. The Phase III programme  
is exploring lesinurad as an oral, once daily 
treatment for the chronic management  
of hyperuricaemia in patients with gout. 
Regulatory ﬁlings are planned in the US  
and Europe for the ﬁrst half of 2014. We  
also plan to develop and commercialise 
lesinurad in China and Japan. 
In 2012, we continued to invest in several 
novel multi-functional MAbs in inﬂammatory 
and autoimmune conditions. Sifalimumab, 
which targets interferon-alpha, continued 
clinical development with an ongoing Phase 
IIb study in patients with SLE. MEDI-546, 
which targets the Type I IFN receptor, 
continued in a Phase IIb study in patients  
with SLE. Mavrilimumab, which targets  
the alpha sub-unit of the granulocyte-
macrophage colony stimulating factor 
receptor, continues in Phase IIb for patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis.
Dermatology
Psoriasis is a chronic disease in which the 
immune system causes the skin cells to 
grow at an accelerated rate. Instead of being 
shed, the skin cells pile up, causing painful 
and itchy, red, scaly patches that can bleed. 
Up to 12 million patients are diagnosed with 
psoriasis across the US and Europe each 
year. Despite various treatment options  
for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, 
many patients do not meet their therapeutic 
goals including resolution of underlying 
inﬂammation, clearing of symptoms and 
improving quality of life. Biologics are 
currently used in moderate to severe patients 
who are candidates for, or are unresponsive 
to, phototherapy or systemic therapy. 
In the pipeline 
As mentioned previously, in 2012 AstraZeneca 
and Amgen entered into an agreement  
to jointly develop brodalumab, which has 
commenced Phase III development in 
patients with moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis. In addition, brodalumab is being 
considered in a Phase IIb development 
programme in psoriatic arthritis.
Some 235 million people currently  
suffer from asthma. It is the most common 
chronic disease among children.

about the performance of our products 
within the geographical areas in which our 
sales and marketing efforts are focused. 
2012 in brief
 > In the US, sales were down 21% to 
$10,655 million (2011: $13,426 million; 
2010: $13,727 million). Loss of exclusivity 
on Seroquel IR in March 2012 as well  
as the impact of increased generic 
competition experienced by our other 
mature brands was partially offset by 
strong performance from our key brands, 
Brilinta, Crestor , Onglyza, Symbicort  
and Faslodex. 
 > AstraZeneca is the fourth largest 
pharmaceutical company in the US, with 
a 5% market share of US pharmaceuticals 
by sales value.
 > AstraZeneca is the eighth largest 
prescription-based pharmaceutical 
company in Western Europe, with  
a 3.4% market share of sales by value.
 > Sales in Western Europe were down 19% 
to $6,486 million (2011: $8,501 million; 
2010: $9,168 million). Key drivers of the 
decline were the volume erosion on 
Atacand, Seroquel IR, Nexium, Arimidex 
and Meronem, following entry of generic 
competition and the negative price and 
volume impact primarily related to 
government interventions, particularly  
in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain.  
This development was partially offset by 
revenue growth from Brilique, Onglyza, 
Vimovo and Iressa.
 > Established ROW sales were down 14%. 
The entry of generic competition of 
Crestor in Canada, and Seroquel IR and 
Arimidex in Australia was partially offset 
by the successful ﬁrst full year of launch  
of Nexium and Faslodex in Japan.
 > Emerging Markets sales increased by 
 4% to $5,752 million (2011: $5,763 million; 
2010: $5,198 million) with sales growth in 
China of 17% and also in Russia of 17%.
2011 in brief
 > In the US, sales were down 2% to $13,426 
million (2010: $13,727 million). The pricing 
impact from US healthcare reform 
measures lowered revenue by around 
3.3%. Good growth for Crestor , the 
Seroquel franchise, Symbicort and 
Onglyza, broadly offset the impact of 
generic competition for Arimidex, Toprol-XL 
and Merrem, and declines in Nexium.
 > Sales in Western Europe were down  
11% to $8,501 million (2010: $9,168 
million), due largely to volume erosion  
on Nexium, Arimidex and Meronem.  
This was partially offset by volume  
growth attributable to Crestor , Seroquel 
XR, Symbicort, Iressa and Faslodex.
 > Established ROW sales were up  
4%, driven by continued growth of 
Symbicort, Crestor , Nexium and the 
Seroquel franchise. In 2011, AstraZeneca 
became the largest research-based 
pharmaceutical company in Canada  
by sales value.
 > Emerging Markets sales increased by 
10% to $5,763 million (2010: $5,198 
million), with sales growth in China of 15% 
and Russia of 19%. Sales in Brazil were 
down as a result of generic competition 
for Crestor and Seroquel IR.

US
AstraZeneca is the fourth largest 
pharmaceutical company in the US, with  
a 5% market share of US pharmaceuticals 
by sales value.
Sales in the US decreased by 21% to 
$10,655 million (201 1: $13,426 million; 2010: 
$13,727 million), as strong performance 
from our key brands, Brilinta, Crestor, 
Onglyza, Symbicort and Faslodex, was 
offset by loss of exclusivity on Seroquel IR  
in March 2012 as well as the impact of 
increased generic competition experienced 
by our other mature brands. Combined 
sales of our key brands, Brilinta, Crestor, 
Onglyza, Symbicort and Faslodex,  
were up by 9% to $4,733 million (2011: 
$4,351 million; 2010: $3,569 million).  
Other drivers of the sales decline  
include the reduction of sales for Zomig 
following the licensing of Zomig to Impax 
Pharmaceuticals Inc. in February 2012 
down to $12 million (2011: $158 million; 
2010: $176 million), additional generic 
competition affecting sales of Toprol-XL 
down to $320 million (2011: $404 million; 
2010: $689 million), and loss of exclusivity  
of Atacand down to $150 million (2011:  
$182 million; 2010: $216 million).
Brilinta achieved sales of $19 million.

and trial among target interventional 
cardiologist initiators was 39% at the end  
of 2012. Crestor demonstrated resilience  
in the face of the November 2011 market 
entry of a generic version and, from May, 
multiple generic versions of atorvastatin, all 
competitors of Crestor . Crestor’s performance 
volume showed resilience in two of the 
largest and most proﬁtable segments  
of the market, Commercial and Medicare. 
Crestor’s existing patient base remained 
solid, and continuing patients represented 
94% of Crestor’s volume. Crestor achieved 
sales of $3,164 million (2011: $3,074 million; 
2010: $2,640 million) and a total prescription 
share of 11.8% within the statin market. In 
2012, Crestor became the most prescribed 
branded pharmaceutical in the US.
Symbicort pMDI continued to deliver  
steady growth in the US with sales up 19% 
to $1,003 million (2011: $846 million; 2010: 
$721 million) and prescription growth of 
12.5%. It achieved a 21.3% total prescription 
share and a 22.5% new prescription share 
of the inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting 
beta 2-agonist market.
Following the completion of BMS’s acquisition 
of Amylin, AstraZeneca and BMS have been 
developing and commercialising Amylin’s 
portfolio of products related to diabetes  
(and other metabolic diseases). Sales of 
GLP-1 agonists for the treatment of diabetes  
were $74 million for Byetta, $37 million  
for Bydureon and $17 million for Symlin.
Onglyza/Kombiglyze XR captured more  
than one in ﬁve new DPP-IV patient 
treatment decisions and achieved a 2.8% 
total prescription market share gain in 2012, 
ending the year with a total prescription 
market share of 17 .1% of the rapidly  
growing DPP-IV inhibitor market. Onglyza 
revenues in the US were $237 million  
(2011: $156 million; 2010: $54 million).
The loss of exclusivity for Seroquel IR in 
March 2012 resulted in a decrease in sales 
of 79% to $697 million (2011: $3,344 million; 
2010: $3,107 million). In 2012, generics 
accounted for 58.5% of quetiapine 
prescriptions in the US. The presence  
of generic competition impacted the 
prescription volume of Seroquel XR in 2012. 
However, sales of Seroquel XR were up 4% 
to $811 million (2011: $779 million; 2010: 
$640 million) because of higher prices. 
Nexium was the third most prescribed 
branded pharmaceutical in the US. In the 
face of continuing generic, OTC and pricing 
pressures, Nexium sales declined 5% to 
$2,272 million (2011: $2,397 million; 2010: 
$2,695 million). Nexium remains the branded 
market leader retaining signiﬁcant market 
share and volume within the proton pump 
inhibitor class. 
In 2012, sales of Synagis were up 7%  
to $611 million (2011: $570 million;  
2010: $646 million). Sales in the 201 1  
to 2012 RSV season experienced payer 
pressure, which was offset by heightened 
awareness efforts surrounding the RSV 
burden of disease, appropriate patient 
identiﬁcation and enhanced efforts to 
ensure continuity of care for patients from 
the hospital to the paediatrician’s ofﬁce.
In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act 
came into force. It has had, and is expected 
to continue to have, a signiﬁcant impact  
on our US sales and the US healthcare 
industry as a whole. In 2012, the overall 
reduction in our proﬁt before tax for the  
year due to higher minimum Medicaid 
rebates on prescription drugs, discounts  
on branded pharmaceutical sales to 
Medicare Part D beneﬁciaries and an 
industry-wide excise fee was $858 million. 
This amount reﬂects only those effects  
of the Affordable Care Act that we know 
have had or will have a direct impact  
on our ﬁnancial condition or results of 
operations and which we are therefore  
able to quantify based on known and 
isolatable resulting changes in individual 
ﬁnancial items within our Financial 
Statements. There are other potential 
indirect or associated consequences  
of these legislative developments, which 
continue to evolve and which cannot  
be estimated but could have similar 
impacts. These include broader changes  
in access to or eligibility for coverage under 
Medicare, Medicaid or similar governmental 
programmes, such as the recent proposals 
to limit Medicare beneﬁts. These could 
indirectly impact our pricing or sales of 
prescription products within the private 
sector . By their nature and the fact that these 
potentially numerous consequences are  
not directly linked to a corresponding  
and quantiﬁable impact on our Financial 
Statements, it is not possible to accurately 
estimate the ﬁnancial impact of these 
potential consequences of the Affordable 
Care Act or related legislative changes when 
taken together with the number of other 
market and industry-related factors that can 
also result in similar impacts. Further details 
on the impact of the Affordable Care Act  
are contained in the Pricing pressure section 
from page 18 and the Principal risks and 
uncertainties section from page 75. 
Currently, there is no direct governmental 
control of prices for commercial prescription 
drug sales in the US. However, some 
publicly funded programmes, such as 
Medicaid and TRICARE (Department of 
Veterans Affairs), have statutorily mandated 
rebates and discounts that have the effect  
of price controls for these programmes. 
Additionally, pressure on pricing, availability 
and utilisation of prescription drugs for both 
commercial and public payers continues  
to increase. This is driven by, among other 
things, an increased focus on generic 
alternatives. Primary drivers of increased 
generic use are budgetary policies within 
healthcare systems and providers, including 
the use of ‘generics only’ formularies,  
and increases in patient co-insurance  
or co-payments. In 2012, 84% of the 
prescriptions dispensed in the US were 
generic. While it is unlikely that there will  
be widespread adoption of a broad national 
price control scheme in the near future, there 
will continue to be increased attention to 
pharmaceutical prices and their impact on 
healthcare costs for the foreseeable future.

Sales performance outside the US in  
2012 was down by 1 1% to $17 ,318 million 
(201 1: $20, 165 million; 2010: $19,542 million), 
due to loss of exclusivity, competition  
from generic products and the continuing 
challenging economic environment. 
Combined sales of key products (Arimidex, 
Crestor , Nexium, Seroquel IR and Seroquel 
XR, and Symbicort) were down 1 1% with 
sales of $8,769 million (201 1: $10,301 million;

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 72
The macro-economic situation has 
deteriorated, particularly in Greece, Italy, 
Portugal and Spain which have seen the 
implementation of new austerity measures, 
leading to increased pressure on healthcare 
budgets. Most governments in Europe 
intervene directly to control the price, volume 
and reimbursement of medicines. Several 
governments have imposed price reductions 
and increased the use of generic medicines 
as part of healthcare expenditure control.  
A number of countries are applying strict 
criteria for cost-effectiveness evaluations of 
medicines, which has delayed and reduced 
access to medicines for patients in areas  
of important unmet medical need. These  
and other measures all contribute to  
an increasingly difﬁcult environment for 
branded pharmaceuticals in Europe. 
Total sales in Western Europe were down 
19% to $6,486 million (2011: $8,501 million; 
2010: $9,168 million) due largely to volume 
erosion on Seroquel IR, Nexium, Arimidex 
and Meronem following generic entrants 
and the negative price and volume impact 
primarily related to government interventions, 
particularly in Greece, Italy, Portugal and 
Spain. The loss of exclusivity for Atacand  
in April 2012 resulted in a decrease in sales 
of 39% to $422 million (2011: $731 million; 
2010: $736 million). Generics now account 
for 9.7% of candesartan prescriptions in 
Western Europe. This development was 
partially offset by revenue growth attributable 
to Brilique, Onglyza, Vimovo and Iressa. 
Crestor outperformed the statin class with 
strong 2% sales growth. Generic versions  
of Seroquel IR are now available in Western 
Europe, with overall sales down 56% to 
$226 million (2011: $546 million; 2010:  
$560 million). 
Brilique has been launched in all markets  
in Western Europe and sales reached  
$55 million in 2012 (2011: $9 million). 
In Germany, sales fell by 30% to $775 million 
(2011: $1,189 million; 2010: $1,235 million), 
mainly driven by market entries of generic 
versions of Atacand (sales declined to  
$141 million; 2011: $255 million; 2010:  
$252 million), Seroquel IR (sales declined  
to $31 million; 2011: $127 million; 2010:  
$113 million) and Seroquel XR (sales declined 
to $93 million; 201 1: $151 million; 2010:  
$100 million). 
In the UK, a 22% decrease in sales to  
$668 million (201 1: $866 million; 2010: 
$1,022 million) reﬂected strong volume 
erosion on Seroquel IR and Seroquel XR 
(sales declined to $58 million; 201 1: $120 
million; 2010: $124 million), following generic 
entrants. Sales of Nexium decreased by 
59% to $17 million (201 1: $41 million; 2010: 
$89 million) and sales of Arimidex decreased 
by 85% to $4 million (201 1: $28 million;  
2010: $1 14 million), both following the impact 
of a full year of generic penetration. The 
decrease in UK sales was partially offset by 
the solid performance of Symbicort, up 6% 
to $328 million (201 1: $312 million; 2010: 
$272 million).
Sales in France decreased by 18% to  
$1,314 million (2011: $1,740 million; 2010: 
$1,889 million), driven largely by volume 
erosion on Nexium, Atacand, Zomig and 
Arimidex, following generic entrants, and  
the impact from the disposal of Astra Tech, 
which was not entirely offset by the strong 
growth of Crestor and the successful launch 
of Seroquel XR, which had sales of $37 
million. Sales in Spain and Italy were down 
by 22% to $510 million (2011: $708 million; 
2010: $788 million) and by 15% to $876 
million (2011: $1,113 million; 2010: $1,198 
million), respectively, mainly driven by 
generic entrants and the implementation of 
price and prescription controls associated 
with existing and new austerity measures.
Established ROW
Sales in Established ROW decreased by 
14%. The key products with sales growth  
in 2012 were Symbicort, Seroquel XR, 
Onglyza, Faslodex and Iressa.
Canada
The trend in Canada indicates that 
provinces will continue to introduce policy 
changes that drive cost savings and exert 
pricing pressure on new and existing 
medicines (for example, conditional listings, 
product listing agreements and bulk 
purchasing), while providing reasonable 
patient access to innovative medicines.
Due to the loss of exclusivity for Crestor  
in Canada in April 2012, and the continued 
impact of the ‘at risk’ launch of a generic 
version of Nexium by a competitor in 2011, 
total Canadian sales decreased by 31% to 
$1,090 million (2011: $1,604 million; 2010: 
$1,510 million). Combined sales of Crestor, 
Nexium, Symbicort, Seroquel IR  
and Seroquel XR were $742 million  
(2011: $1,171 million; 2010: $1,055 million). 
Japan
Sales in Japan decreased by 5% to  
$2,904 million (2011: $3,064 million;  
2010: $2,617 million). Strong performance 
from Crestor , Symbicort, Faslodex and 
Iressa was largely offset by biennial price 
cuts imposed in April 2012. 
Crestor sales grew by 4%, becoming the 
number one brand in the statin market in 
Japan. Symbicort sales grew 12%, backed 
by additional therapeutic indications for 
SMART and COPD. 
Nexium achieved sales of $78 million  
in its ﬁrst full year after launch, with sales 
accelerating following the lifting in October 
of the two week prescription limit imposed 
by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour 
and Welfare on new medicines during  
the ﬁrst year from launch.
Our oncology business remains one of the 
leaders in Japan based on the performance 
of established brands including Iressa, 
Arimidex, Zoladex and Casodex. Faslodex, 
launched in November 201 1, achieved sales 
of $58 million in its ﬁrst full year in the market.
Other Established ROW
Our sales in Other Established ROW 
showed a decline of 12% to $1,086 million 
(2011: $1,233 million; 2010: $1,049 million). 
Australian sales were impacted by price 
cuts triggered by loss of exclusivity of 
Seroquel IR and Arimidex in April 2012,  
as well as by price reductions due to  
the Australian government’s therapeutic 
group policy, which impacted Crestor  
and Atacand. Price reductions were  
partially offset by performance of Crestor, 
Nexium and Symbicort, which all gained 
market share. Crestor achieved a 28.1% 
volume share in the statin class and became 
the number one drug in the statin market  
in Australia following loss of exclusivity  
of atorvastatin. Brilinta was successfully 
launched in Australia with reimbursement 
through the Australian pharmaceutical 
beneﬁts scheme becoming available from 
August. Brilinta achieved formulary listing  
in the vast majority of hospitals in Australia  
in 2012. Marketing authorisation was 
obtained for Symbicort pMDI in Australia.  AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 73

Crestor continues to face challenges from 
generic competitors. The patent protecting 
Crestor in Australia has been challenged. 
Details of this matter are included in Note 25  
to the Financial Statements from page 184.
Emerging Markets
In Emerging Markets, our sales increased  
by 4% to $5,752 million (2011: $5,763 million; 
2010: $5,198 million), which was principally 
driven by growth in China and Russia. 
In many of the larger markets, such as  
Brazil and Mexico, patients tend to pay 
directly for prescription medicines and 
consequently these markets are at less  
risk of direct government interventions  
on pricing and reimbursement. In other 
markets such as South Korea, Taiwan  
and Turkey, where governments pay for 
medicines, we are seeing continued efforts 
to reduce the cost of prescriptions in line 
with the systems in Western Europe, Canada 
and Australia. Some strong growth markets 
such as Vietnam are also implementing 
price and volume controls in an attempt  
to control government spending.
Emerging Europe
Sales in Emerging Europe grew by 2%  
to $1,165 million (2011: $1,244 million;  
2010: $1,165 million) driven by increased 
sales in Russia and Romania, which  
more than offset reduced sales in Turkey.
We have continued to build our presence  
in Russia, where sales increased by 17%  
to $314 million (2011: $284 million; 2010: 
$232 million) mainly due to increased sales 
of Symbicort by 24%, Nexium by 93%, 
Crestor by 14% and Seroquel XR by 154%, 
driven by growth in the retail segment.  
We have also consolidated our position 
among the growth leaders in the hospital 
and regional reimbursement segments.
In Romania, we delivered a strong 
performance with sales up 19% to  
$161 million (2011: $154 million; 2010:  
$119 million), largely as a result of sales  
of Atacand increasing by 34%, Seroquel XR 
increasing by 41%, Crestor increasing  
by 10% and Symbicort increasing by  
4%. In Turkey, a decrease in sales to 
$252 million (2011: $297 million; 2010:  
$304 million) reﬂected the additional price 
and prescription controls imposed by the 
Turkish government in late 2011.
China
Our sales in China (excluding Hong Kong) 
increased by 17% to $1,512 million (2011: 
$1,261 million; 2010: $1,047 million). Sales  
of products in our Cardiovascular and 
Respiratory & Inﬂammation Therapy Areas 
continue to grow ahead of the market, 
driven by strong performances of Crestor, 
Betaloc Zok and Pulmicort Respules.  
Sales of Nexium and Symbicort grew 
strongly by 27% and 50% respectively,  
while our mature gastrointestinal and 
oncology brands experienced challenges 
from government pricing reductions.  
In 2012, we saw Zoladex 10.8mg 
successfully launched in China, the 
expansion of our co-promotion with  
BMS to achieve listing of Onglyza into key 
hospitals, and a new collaboration formed 
between AstraZeneca and Ironwood  
to co-develop and co-commercialise 
linaclotide in China. We continue to be one  
of the leading multinational pharmaceutical 
companies in China.
Emerging Asia Paciﬁc
Sales in Emerging Asia Paciﬁc decreased  
by 3% to $923 million (2011: $968 million; 
2010: $890 million). This decline was driven 
by India, where sales decreased by 29%  
to $67 million (2011: $110 million; 2010:  
$92 million), due primarily to supply issues; 
continued government interventions on 
pricing in countries such as Thailand,  
where sales decreased by 7% to $97 million  
(2011: $106 million; 2010: $114 million);  
and by Vietnam, where sales decreased  
by 4% to $45 million (2011: $47 million; 
2010: $37 million). This was partially offset 
by sales growth in Indonesia, up 7% to  
$39 million (2011: $39 million; 2010: $34 
million); South Korea, up 4% to $239 million 
(2011: $235 million; 2010: $213 million);  
and Malaysia, up 6% to $73 million  
(2011: $70 million; 2010: $66 million).
Other Emerging ROW
Sales in Other Emerging ROW were ﬂat at 
$2,152 million (2011: $2,290 million; 2010: 
$2,096 million), with increased sales in Latin 
America, Egypt, Maghreb, Saudi Arabia  
and the Gulf States balanced by reduced 
sales in South Africa and Israel.
The Latin American pharmaceutical  
market continues to grow, underpinned  
by a reasonably stable political and 
economic climate. However, in many  
of the countries, the majority of the  
growth in the market is being captured  
by generics, branded generics and private 
label product offerings, often from local, 
non-multinational, companies.
In Latin America, our sales were down  
1% to $1,331 million (2011: $1,455 million; 
2010: $1,392 million). This was driven by 
declines in Mexico, down 22%, and Brazil, 
down 5%. Brazil continued to feel the 
effects of the loss of exclusivity on Seroquel 
IR and Crestor with year-on-year declines  
of 54% and 39% respectively. Growth  
of Seloken, Faslodex and older products 
such as Diprivan and Meronem helped  
to compensate for this development.  
In Mexico, challenging market conditions  
and the impact of an ‘at risk’ generic version 
of Crestor , resulted in weak performance 
with sales in Mexico declining by 22%.  
This was partially offset by sales growth  
in Venezuela (up 41%) and Argentina  
(up 24%). All key brands achieved double 
digit growth in Argentina (Nexium, Crestor, 
Atacand, Symbicort and Seroquel XR)  
and growth of more than 40% in Venezuela 
(Crestor , Symbicort, Seroquel XR, Atacand, 
Zoladex and Arimidex).
Successful product launches in the year 
included Brilinta and Kombiglyze XR in 
Mexico, Colombia and Argentina, and 
Vimovo in Brazil, Colombia and Argentina. 
Faslodex 500mg was launched in the  
fourth quarter of 2012 in Argentina, and  
is expected to launch in the ﬁrst half  
of 2013 in Brazil and Venezuela.
In the Middle East and Africa, despite 
political challenges arising from the ‘Arab 
Spring’ revolutions, we further accelerated 
our growth with sales up 3%. Our largest 
markets were South Africa, Saudi Arabia 
and the Gulf States. Performance | Risk

Risk
Embedded in business processes
We strive to ensure that sound risk 
management is embedded within  
our strategy, planning, budgeting and 
performance management processes.  
The Board has deﬁned the Group’s  
risk appetite expressing the acceptable 
levels of risk for the Group using three key 
dimensions. These are (i) earnings and  
cash ﬂow (ii) return on investment and (iii) 
potential impact on our reputation. This 
deﬁnition provides a clear statement by  
the Board of its position on risk which 
enables the Group, in both quantitative  
and qualitative terms, to judge the level  
of risk it is prepared to take so as  
to achieve its overall objectives. 
Annually, the Group develops a long-term 
business plan to support the delivery of its 
strategy, which the Board reviews to ensure 
that it conforms to its risk appetite. Line 
managers are accountable for identifying 
and managing risks, and for delivering 
business objectives in accordance with  
the Group’s risk appetite. Each area for 
which a SET member is responsible  
(a SET function) is required to provide a 
comprehensive assessment of its risks  
as part of the annual business planning 
process. Identiﬁed risks are mapped to 
AstraZeneca’s risk ‘taxonomy’, providing  
a structured disaggregation of the various 
potential risks facing the Group.
The CEO and the CFO undertake quarterly 
business reviews (QBRs) with each SET 
function, where the key risks are reviewed. 
Business managers within each SET 
function are required to provide quarterly 
updates on their key risks, which are then 
consolidated to create a list of key risks for 
In this section we describe our key risk 
management and assurance mechanisms 
and the principal risks and uncertainties 
which we consider to be material to our 
business as they may have a signiﬁcant 
effect on our ﬁnancial condition, results  
of operations and/or reputation. Speciﬁc 
risks and uncertainties are also discussed  
in the Business Review from page 30,  
where relevant. 
Managing risk
As an innovation-driven, global, prescription-
based biopharmaceutical business, we face 
a diverse range of risks and uncertainties 
that may adversely affect our business. Our 
approach to risk management is designed 
to encourage clear decision making as to 
which risks we take and how these are 
managed, based on an understanding of 
the potential strategic, commercial, ﬁnancial, 
compliance, legal and reputational 
implications of these risks.
We work continuously to ensure that we 
have effective risk management processes 
in place to support the delivery of our 
strategic objectives, the material needs  
of our stakeholders and our core values.  
We monitor our business activities and 
external and internal environments for  
new, emerging and changing risks to ensure 
that these are managed appropriately  
as they arise.
The Board believes that the processes  
and accountabilities which are in place 
(described below) provide it with  
adequate information on the key risks  
and uncertainties we face. Further 
information about these risks and 
uncertainties is set out in the Principal  
risks and uncertainties section from  
page 75.
that SET function to review at QBRs.  
The key risks for each SET function are  
then aggregated into a Group risk register. 
The purpose of the risk review is to identify  
and measure risks, and to deﬁne and review 
risk management and mitigation plans. 
Supporting tools are in place to assist the 
managers in this process and we continue 
to work on developing our risk management 
standards and guidelines.
We develop business resilience plans to 
provide for situations where speciﬁc risks 
have the potential to severely impact our 
business. Global business resilience plans 
covering crisis management, business 
continuity and emergency responses are  
in place. These plans are supported by the 
provision of training and crisis simulation 
activities for business managers. 
Key responsibilities
Management of risk
Day-to-day risk management is delegated 
from the Board to the CEO and through the 
SET to line managers. SET functions are 
accountable for establishing an appropriate 
line management-led process and for 
providing the resources for supporting 
effective risk management.
Line and project managers have primary 
responsibility, within the context of  
their functional area, for identifying and 
managing risk as well as for putting in place 
appropriate controls and procedures  
to monitor effectiveness. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 75
Strategy Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance Overview
Oversight and monitoring
The SET is responsible for overseeing  
and monitoring the effectiveness of the  
risk management processes implemented 
by management. The Compliance and 
Finance functions, together with the GIA, 
support the SET by advising on policy and  
standard setting, monitoring and auditing, 
communication and training, as well  
as reporting on the adequacy of line 
management processes as they apply  
to managing our risk. Our compliance 
organisation is comprised of the Global 
Compliance function together with a wide 
range of specialist compliance functions. 
Further information about Global Compliance 
and the Code of Conduct can be found in 
the Compliance section on page 47 . 
Management reporting and assurance
We provide quarterly risk reports to the  
SET and to the Board. Among other things, 
these summarise our current assessment  
of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including environmental, social and 
governance risks, senior management 
accountability and our expected plans  
in order to address these risks, to the  
extent possible.
The Audit Committee comprises ﬁve 
Non-Executive Directors. It reviews  
and reports to the Board following each  
Audit Committee meeting on the overall 
framework of risk management and internal 
controls, and is responsible for promptly 
bringing to the Board’s attention any 
signiﬁcant concerns about the conduct, 
results or outcomes of internal audits  
and other compliance matters. The Audit 
Committee receives regular reports from 
our external auditor and the following 
business functions:

GIA is an independent assurance and 
advisory function that reports to, and  
is accountable to, the Audit Committee.  
GIA’s budget, resources and programme  
of audits are approved by the Audit 
Committee annually and the ﬁndings  
from its audit work are reported to, and 
discussed at, each Audit Committee 
meeting. A core part of the audit work 
carried out by GIA includes assessing  
how we are managing risk and reviewing 
the effectiveness of selected aspects  
of our risk control framework, including  
the effectiveness of other assurance and 
compliance functions within the business. 
Principal risks and uncertainties
The pharmaceutical sector is inherently  
risky and a variety of risks and uncertainties 
may affect our business. In the remainder  
of this section we describe the principal 
risks and uncertainties which we consider  
to be material to our business in that  
they may have a signiﬁcant effect on our 
ﬁnancial condition, results of operations 
and/or reputation. 
These risks are not listed in any particular 
order of priority. Other risks, unknown  
or not currently considered material,  
could have a similar effect. We believe  
that the forward-looking statements  
about AstraZeneca in this Annual Report, 
identiﬁed by words such as ‘anticipates’, 
‘believes’, ‘expects’ and ‘intends’, are  
based on reasonable assumptions. 
However, forward-looking statements 
involve inherent risks and uncertainties  
such as those summarised below. They 
relate to events that may occur in the  
future, that may be inﬂuenced by factors 
beyond our control and that may have 
actual outcomes materially different from 
our expectations. Performance | Risk

Product pipeline risks
Failure to meet development targets Impact
The development of any pharmaceutical product candidate is a complex, risky 
and lengthy process involving signiﬁcant ﬁnancial, R&D and other resources, 
which may fail at any stage of the process due to a number of factors. These 
include: failure to obtain the required regulatory or marketing approvals for the 
product candidate or its manufacturing facilities, unfavourable clinical efﬁcacy 
data, safety concerns, failure of R&D to develop new product candidates,  
failure to demonstrate adequate cost-effective beneﬁts to regulators and the 
emergence of competing products. 
Production and release schedules for biologics may be more signiﬁcantly 
impacted by regulatory processes than other products. This is due to more 
complex and stringent regulation on the manufacturing of biologics and their 
supply chain.
A succession of negative drug project results and a failure  
to reduce development timelines effectively, or produce new 
products that achieve commercial success, could adversely  
affect the reputation of our R&D capabilities, and is likely to 
materially adversely affect our business or results of operations. 
Difﬁculties of obtaining and maintaining  
regulatory approvals for new products Impact
We are subject to strict controls on the commercialisation processes for our 
pharmaceutical products, including their development, manufacture, distribution 
and marketing. The requirements to obtain regulatory approval based on a 
product’s safety, efﬁcacy and quality before it can be marketed for an indication  
in a particular country, as well as to maintain and comply with licences and other 
regulations relating to its manufacture and marketing, are particularly important. 
The submission of an application to regulatory authorities (which vary, with 
different requirements, in each region or country) may or may not lead to the  
grant of marketing approval. Regulators can refuse to grant approval or may 
require additional data before approval is given, even though the medicine may 
already be launched in other countries. The approval of a product is required by 
the relevant regulatory authority in each country, although a single pan-EU MAA 
can be obtained through a centralised procedure. 
In recent years, companies sponsoring NDAs and regulatory authorities have 
been under increased public pressure to apply more conservative beneﬁt/risk 
criteria. In some instances, regulatory authorities require a company to develop 
plans to ensure safe use of a marketed product before a pharmaceutical 
product is approved, or after approval, if a new and signiﬁcant safety issue  
is established. In addition, third party interpretation of publicly available data  
on our marketed products has the potential to inﬂuence the approval status  
or labelling of a currently approved and marketed product. 
The predictability of the outcome and timing of review processes 
remains challenging, particularly in the US, due to competing 
regulatory priorities and a continuing sentiment of risk aversion  
on the part of regulatory reviewers and management. 
Delays in regulatory reviews and approvals could impact the 
timing of a new product launch. In addition, the drive for public 
transparency of the review processes through the more extensive 
use of public advisory committees, increase the unpredictability  
of the process. 
Failure to obtain and enforce effective IP protection Impact
Our ability to obtain and enforce patents and other IP rights in relation to our 
products is an important element of our ability to protect our investment in  
R&D and create long-term value for the business. A number of the countries  
in which we operate are still developing their IP laws or may even be limiting  
the applicability of these laws to pharmaceutical inventions. Adverse political 
perspectives on the desirability of strong IP protection for pharmaceuticals in 
certain emerging and even developed markets may limit the scope for us to 
obtain effective IP protection for our products. As a result, certain countries  
may seek to limit or deny effective IP protection for pharmaceuticals.
Limitations on the availability of patent protection or the use  
of compulsory licensing in certain countries in which we operate 
could have a material adverse effect on the pricing and sales  
of our products and, consequently, could materially adversely 
affect our revenues from those products. More information  
about protecting our IP is contained in the Intellectual Property 
section on page 35. Information about the risk of patent litigation 
and the early loss of IP rights is contained in the Expiry or loss  
of, or limitations on, IP rights risk on page 78.
Delay to new product launches Impact
Our continued success depends on the development and successful launch  
of innovative new drugs. The anticipated launch dates of major new products 
have a signiﬁcant impact on a number of areas of our business, including 
investment in large clinical studies, the manufacture of pre-launch product 
stocks, investment in marketing materials pre-launch, sales force training  
and the timing of anticipated future revenue streams from new product sales.  
These launch dates are primarily driven by the development programmes that 
we run and the demands of the regulatory authorities in the approvals process, 
as well as pricing negotiations. Delays to anticipated launch dates can result 
from a number of factors including adverse ﬁndings in pre-clinical or clinical 
studies, regulatory demands, price negotiation, competitor activity and 
technology transfer.
Signiﬁcant delays to anticipated launch dates of new products 
could have a material adverse effect on our ﬁnancial condition  
and results of operations. For example, for the launch of products 
that are seasonal in nature, delays in regulatory approvals or 
manufacturing difﬁculties may delay launch to the next season 
which, in turn, may signiﬁcantly reduce the return on costs 
incurred in preparing for the launch for that season. In addition,  
a delay in the launch may lead to increased costs if, for example, 
marketing and sales efforts need to be rescheduled or protracted 
for longer than expected. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 77
Strategy Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance Overview
Strategic alliances and acquisitions may be unsuccessful Impact
We seek technology licensing arrangements and strategic collaborations  
to expand our product portfolio and geographical presence as part of our 
business strategy. 
Such licensing arrangements and strategic collaborations are key, enabling  
us to grow and strengthen the business. The success of such arrangements is 
largely dependent on the technology and other IP we acquire rights to, and the 
resources, efforts and skills of our partners. Also, under many of our strategic 
alliances, we make milestone payments well in advance of the commercialisation 
of the products, with no assurance that we will recoup these payments. 
Furthermore, we experience strong competition from other pharmaceutical 
companies in respect of licensing arrangements and strategic collaborations, and 
therefore we may be unsuccessful in establishing some of our intended projects. 
We may also seek to acquire complementary businesses as part of our 
business strategy. The integration of an acquired business could involve 
incurring signiﬁcant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities, as well as having 
a negative effect on our reported results of operations from acquisition related 
charges, amortisation of expenses related to intangibles and charges for the 
implementation of long-term assets. We may also experience difﬁculties in 
integrating geographically separated organisations, systems and facilities,  
and personnel with different organisational cultures. 
If we fail to complete these types of collaborative projects in  
a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, this may  
limit our ability to access a greater portfolio of products, IP 
technology and shared expertise. 
Additionally, disputes or difﬁculties in our relationship with  
our collaborators or partners may arise, often due to conﬂicting 
priorities or conﬂicts of interest between parties, which may  
erode or eliminate the beneﬁts of these alliances. 
The incurrence of signiﬁcant debt or liabilities as a result of 
integration of an acquired business could cause deterioration  
in our credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and 
interest expense. 
Further, if, following an acquisition, liabilities are uncovered in  
the acquired business, the Group may suffer losses and may not 
have remedies against the seller or third parties. The integration 
process may also result in business disruption, diversion of 
management resources, the loss of key employees and other 
issues, such as a failure to integrate IT and other systems. 
Commercialisation and business execution risks
Challenges to achieving commercial success of new products Impact
The successful launch of a new pharmaceutical product involves substantial 
investment in sales and marketing activities, launch stocks and other items.  
The commercial success of our new medicines is of particular importance to  
us in order to replace lost sales following patent expiry. We may ultimately be 
unable to achieve commercial success for any number of reasons. These 
include difﬁculties in manufacturing sufﬁcient quantities of the product candidate 
for development or commercialisation in a timely manner, the impact of price 
control measures imposed by governments and healthcare authorities, erosion 
of IP rights, including infringement by third parties and failure to show a 
differentiated product proﬁle. 
As a result, we cannot be certain that compounds currently under development 
will achieve success, and our ability to accurately assess, prior to launch, the 
eventual efﬁcacy or safety of a new product once in broader clinical use can 
only be based on data available at that time, which is inherently limited due  
to relatively short periods of product testing and relatively small clinical study 
patient samples. 
The commercialisation of biologics is often more complex than for small 
molecule pharmaceutical products, primarily due to differences in the mode  
of administration, technical aspects of the product and rapidly changing 
distribution and reimbursement environments.
If a new product does not succeed as anticipated or its rate  
of sales growth is slower than anticipated, there is a risk that  
we are unable to fully recoup the costs incurred in launching  
it, which could materially adversely affect our business or results 
of operations. 
Due to the complexity of the commercialisation process for 
biologics, the methods of distributing and marketing biologics 
could materially adversely impact our revenues from the sales  
of products such as Synagis and FluMist/Fluenz.
Illegal trade in our products Impact
Illegal trade covers the theft, illegal diversion and counterfeiting of our products. 
Illegal trade in pharmaceutical products is estimated to exceed $75 billion  
per year and is generally considered by the industry, non-governmental 
organisations and governmental authorities to be increasing. We suffer a 
commensurate ﬁnancial exposure to illegal trade and there is also a risk to public 
health. Regulators and the public expect us to secure the integrity of our supply 
chain and to co-operate actively in the reduction of illegal trade in AstraZeneca 
products, through surveillance, investigation and legal action against others 
engaged in illegal trade.
Public loss of conﬁdence in the integrity of pharmaceutical 
products as a result of counterfeiting could materially adversely 
affect our reputation and ﬁnancial performance. In addition, undue 
or misplaced concern about the issue may induce some patients 
to stop taking their medicines, with consequential risks to their 
health. There is also a direct ﬁnancial loss where counterfeit 
medicines replace sales of genuine products and where genuine 
products are recalled following discovery of counterfeit, stolen 
and/or illegally traded products in an effort to regain control  
of the integrity of the supply chain.
Developing our business in Emerging Markets Impact
The development of our business in Emerging Markets is a critical factor  
in determining our future ability to sustain or increase our global product 
revenues. This poses various challenges including: more volatile economic 
conditions; competition from companies with existing market presence; the 
need to identify correctly and to leverage appropriate opportunities for sales 
and marketing; poor IP protection; inadequate protection against crime 
(including counterfeiting, corruption and fraud); the need to impose developed 
market compliance standards; inadvertent breaches of local and international 
law; not being able to recruit appropriately skilled and experienced personnel; 
identiﬁcation of the most effective sales channels and route to market; and 
interventions by national governments or regulators restricting access  
to market and/or introducing adverse price controls. 
The failure to exploit potential opportunities appropriately in 
Emerging Markets may materially adversely affect our reputation, 
business or results of operations. Performance | Risk
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 78
Expiry or loss of, or limitations on, IP rights Impact
Pharmaceutical products are only protected from being copied during the  
limited period of protection under patent rights and/or related IP rights such  
as Regulatory Data Protection or Orphan Drug status. Expiry or loss of these 
rights typically leads to the immediate launch of generic copies of the product 
in the country where the rights have expired or been lost. See the Intellectual 
Property section on page 35 which contains a table of certain patent expiry 
dates for our key marketed products. 
Additionally, the expiry or loss of patents covering other innovator companies’ 
products may also lead to increased competition for our own, still-patented, 
products in the same product class due to the availability of generic products  
in that product class. Further, there may be increased pricing pressure on  
our still-patented products as a result of the lower prices of generic entrants.
Products under patent protection or within the period of 
Regulatory Data Protection typically generate signiﬁcantly 
higher revenues than those not protected by such rights.  
Our revenues, ﬁnancial condition and results of operations  
may be materially adversely affected upon expiry or early  
loss of our IP rights, due to generic entrants into the market  
for the applicable product. Additionally, the loss of patent rights 
covering major products of other pharmaceutical companies, 
such as Plavix in May, may adversely affect the growth of our 
still-patented products in the same product class (eg Brilinta/
Brilique) in that market.
Pressures resulting from generic competition Impact
Our products compete not only with other products approved for the same 
condition, marketed by research-based pharmaceutical companies, but also  
with generic drugs marketed by generic pharmaceutical manufacturers.  
These competitors may invest more of their resources into the marketing of  
their products than we do depending on the relative priority of these competitor 
products within their company’s portfolio. Generic versions of products are often 
sold at lower prices than branded products as the manufacturer does not have  
to recoup the signiﬁcant cost of R&D investment and market development. The 
majority of our patented products, including Nexium, Crestor and Seroquel XR, 
are subject to price pressures as a result of competition from generic copies of 
these products and from generic forms of other drugs in the same product class 
(for example, generic forms of Lipitor and Plavix and generic forms of Seroquel IR). 
As well as facing generic competition upon expiry or loss of IP rights, we also  
face the risk that generic drug manufacturers seek to market generic versions  
of our products prior to expiries of our patents and/or the Regulatory Exclusivity 
periods. For example, we are currently facing challenges in the US from 
numerous generic drug manufacturers regarding our patents for Seroquel XR, 
Nexium, Crestor and Pulmicort, four of our key products. Generic manufacturers 
may also take advantage of the failure of certain countries to properly enforce 
Regulatory Data Protection and may launch generics during this protected 
period. This is a particular risk in some Emerging Markets where appropriate 
patent protection may be difﬁcult to obtain or enforce. 
If challenges to our patents by generic drug manufacturers 
succeed and generic products are launched, or generic products 
are launched ‘at risk’ on the expectation that challenges to our  
IP will be successful, this may materially adversely affect our 
ﬁnancial condition and results of operations. In 2012, US sales  
for Seroquel XR, Nexium and Crestor were $811 million, $2,272 
million and $3,164 million respectively. Furthermore, if limitations 
on the availability, scope or enforceability of patent protection  
are implemented in jurisdictions in which we operate, generic 
manufacturers in these countries may be increasingly able to 
introduce competing products to the market earlier than they 
would have been able to, had more robust patent or Regulatory  
Data Protection been available.
Effects of patent litigation in respect of IP rights Impact
Any of the IP rights protecting our products may be asserted or challenged  
in IP litigation initiated against or by external parties. Such IP rights may also be 
the subject of validity challenges in patent ofﬁces. We expect our most valuable 
products to receive the greater number of challenges. Despite our efforts to 
establish and defend robust patent protection for our products, we may not 
succeed in protecting our patents from such litigation or other challenges.
Where we assert our IP rights and allege infringement, we bear the risk that 
courts may decide that third parties do not infringe our IP rights. This may result 
in AstraZeneca losing exclusivity and/or erosion of revenues. Non-infringement 
defences are typically ﬁled by third parties in response to patent infringement 
lawsuits including in so-called 505(b)(2) cases in the US. Details of 505(b)(2) 
actions can be found in Note 25 to the Financial Statements from page 184. 
We also bear the risk that we may be found to infringe patents owned or 
licensed exclusively by third parties, including research-based and generic 
pharmaceutical companies and individuals. Infringement accusations may 
implicate, for example, our manufacturing processes, product intermediates  
or use of research tools. Details of signiﬁcant infringement claims against us  
by third parties enforcing IP rights can be found in Note 25 to the Financial 
Statements from page 184.
If we are not successful in maintaining exclusive rights to market 
one or more of our major products, particularly in the US where 
we achieve our highest revenue, our revenue and margins  
could be materially adversely affected. 
Managing or litigating infringement disputes over so-called 
‘freedom to operate’ can be costly. We may be subject to 
injunctions against our products or processes and be liable  
for damages or royalties. We may need to obtain costly licences. 
These risks may be greater in relation to biologics and vaccines, 
where patent infringement claims may relate to discovery or 
research tools, and manufacturing methods and/or biological 
materials. While we seek to manage such risks by, for example,  
acquiring licences, foregoing certain activities or uses, or 
modifying processes to avoid infringement claims and permit 
commercialisation of our products, such steps can entail 
signiﬁcant cost and there is no guarantee that they will  
be successful. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 79
Strategy Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance Overview
Price controls and reductions Impact
Most of our key markets have experienced the implementation of various cost 
control or reimbursement mechanisms in respect of pharmaceutical products.
For example, in the US, realised prices are being depressed through restrictive 
reimbursement policies and cost-control tools such as restricted lists and 
formularies, which employ ‘generic ﬁrst’ strategies and require physicians  
to obtain prior approval for the use of a branded medicine where a generic 
alternative exists. These mechanisms can be used by payers to limit the use  
of branded products and put pressure on manufacturers to reduce net prices. 
Many of these mechanisms shift a greater proportion of the cost of medicines  
to the patient via out-of-pocket payments at the pharmacy counter. The patient 
out-of-pocket spend is generally in the form of a co-payment or, in some  
cases, a co-insurance, which is designed, principally, to encourage patients  
to use generic medicines. 
A summary of the principal aspects of price regulation and how price pressures 
are affecting our business in our most important markets is set out in the Pricing 
pressure section from page 18 and these economic pressures are also further 
discussed below in the following risk factor.
Due to these pressures on the pricing of our products, there  
can be no certainty that we will be able to charge prices for a 
product that, in a particular country or in the aggregate, enable  
us to earn an adequate return on our product investment. These 
pressures, including the increasingly restrictive reimbursement 
policies to which we are subject and the potential adoption of  
new legislation expanding the scope of permitted commercial 
importation of medicines into the US, could materially adversely 
affect our business or results of operations. 
We expect that these pressures on pricing will continue, and  
may increase. 
Economic, regulatory and political pressures Impact
We face continued economic, regulatory and political pressures to limit or 
reduce the cost of our products. 
In 2010, the US passed the Affordable Care Act, a comprehensive health reform 
package with provisions taking effect between 2010 and 2014. The law expands 
insurance coverage, establishes health insurance exchanges and establishes 
new national entities focused on health system reforms. In terms of speciﬁc 
provisions impacting our industry, the law mandates higher rebates and discounts 
on branded drugs for certain Medicare and Medicaid patients as well as an 
industry-wide excise fee. Implementation of several health system delivery 
reforms included in the law has commenced and will continue over the next  
two years. For example, a new comparative effectiveness research organisation, 
the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, has been established and  
an Independent Payment Advisory Board, with broad authority to propose to  
cut Medicare expenditures, is scheduled to commence in 2014. 
The Affordable Care Act expands the patient population eligible for Medicaid 
and will provide new insurance coverage for individuals through state-operated 
and federal-operated health insurance exchanges from 2014. Large employers  
have typically offered generous health insurance beneﬁts, but many are 
struggling with increasing health insurance premiums and may, therefore, opt  
to shift employee coverage into the health insurance exchanges, which will be 
operational by 2014. The pharmaceutical industry could be adversely impacted 
by such shifts if the health insurance exchanges do not offer a prescription drug 
beneﬁt that is as robust as beneﬁts historically provided by large employers. 
We anticipate further government intervention in the US in connection with  
the recent initiative to contain federal spending. For more information see  
the Regulatory requirements and Pricing pressure sections from page 17  
and 18, respectively.
In the EU, efforts by the European Commission to reduce inconsistencies  
and to improve standards in the disparate national regulatory systems have met 
with little immediate success. The industry continues to be exposed in Europe 
to a range of disparate pricing systems, ad hoc cost-containment measures  
and reference pricing mechanisms, which impact prices. 
Concurrently, many markets are adopting the use of Health Technology 
Assessment (HTA) to provide a rigorous evaluation of the clinical efﬁcacy of  
a product, at or post launch. HTA evaluations are also increasingly being used  
to assess the clinical as well as cost-effectiveness of products in a particular 
health system. This comes as payers and policymakers attempt to drive 
increased efﬁciencies in the use and choice of pharmaceutical products. 
Further information regarding these pressures is contained in the Regulatory 
requirements and Pricing pressure sections from page 17 and page 18, 
respectively.
It is not possible to accurately estimate the ﬁnancial impact of the 
potential consequences resulting from the Affordable Care Act or 
related legislative changes when taken together with the number 
of other market-related and industry-related factors that can also 
result in similar impacts. While the overall reduction in our proﬁt 
before tax for the year due to higher minimum Medicaid rebates 
on prescription drugs, discounts on branded pharmaceutical 
sales to Medicare Part D beneﬁciaries and an industry-wide 
excise fee was $858 million, this reﬂects only the limited number 
of known, quantiﬁable and isolatable effects of these legislative 
developments. Other potential indirect or associated 
consequences of these legislative developments, which continue 
to evolve and which cannot be estimated, could have similar 
impacts. These include broader changes in access to, or eligibility 
for, coverage under Medicare, Medicaid or similar governmental 
programmes, such as the recent proposals to limit Medicare 
beneﬁts, which could indirectly impact our pricing or sales of 
prescription products within the private sector.
These continued disparities in pricing systems could lead to 
marked price differentials between markets, which, by way  
of the implementation of existing or new reference pricing 
mechanisms, increases the pricing pressure affecting the 
industry. The importation of pharmaceutical products from 
countries where prices are low due to government price controls, 
or other market dynamics, to countries where prices for those 
products are higher, is already prevalent and may increase.  
In particular, as discussed in the Pricing pressure section  
on page 18, Greece, Portugal and Spain have all introduced 
measures to lower healthcare spending, including mandatory 
discounts, clawbacks and price referencing rules, which could 
have a material adverse effect on our business or results  
of operations. Performance | Risk
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 80
Biosimilars Impact
While no application for a biosimilar has been made in relation to an 
AstraZeneca biologic, various regulatory authorities are implementing  
or considering abbreviated approval processes for biosimilars that would 
compete with patented biologics. 
For example, in 2010, the US enacted the Biologics Price Competition and 
Innovation Act within the Affordable Care Act, which contains general directives 
for biosimilar applications. The FDA issued draft guidance in February 2012 on 
implementing an abbreviated biosimilar approval pathway. However, signiﬁcant 
questions remain, including standards for designation of interchangeability.  
In 2012, the FDA also implemented user fee programmes to support biosimilar 
product review and policy development. In Europe, the EMA published ﬁnal 
guidelines on similar biological medicinal products containing MAbs and in 
May, the ﬁrst MAb biosimilar application was made. Notably, a number of 
jurisdictions have adopted either the EMA guidelines or those recently set  
forth by the WHO to enable biosimilars to enter the market after discrete 
periods of data exclusivity.
The extent to which biosimilars would be differentiated from 
patented biologics on price is unclear. However, due to their 
complex nature, it is uncertain whether biosimilars would have 
the same impact on patented biologics that generic products 
have had on patented small molecule products. 
In addition, it is uncertain when any such abbreviated approval 
processes may be fully realised, particularly for more complex 
protein molecules such as MAbs. Any such processes may 
materially adversely affect the future commercial prospects  
for patented biologics, such as the ones that we produce. 
 
Increasing implementation and enforcement of more stringent 
anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation Impact
There is an increasing global focus on the implementation and enforcement  
of anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation. 
For example, the UK Bribery Act 2010 came into force in July 2011. This act  
has extensive extra-territorial application, implements signiﬁcant changes  
to existing UK anti-bribery legislation and broadens the scope of statutory 
offences and the potential applicable penalties, including, organisational liability  
for any bribe paid by persons or entities associated with an organisation where  
the organisation failed to have adequate preventative procedures in place  
at the time of the offence. There is also an increase in the maximum applicable 
penalties for bribery, including up to 10 years imprisonment and unlimited ﬁnes. 
There have also been increased enforcement efforts in the UK by the Serious 
Fraud Ofﬁce and, in the US, there has been signiﬁcant enforcement activity in 
respect of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by the SEC and US Department  
of Justice against US companies and non-US companies listed in the US. 
We are the subject of current anti-corruption investigations and there can be no 
assurance that we will not, from time to time, continue to be subject to informal 
inquiries and formal investigations from governmental agencies. In the context  
of our business, governmental ofﬁcials interact with us in a variety of roles that 
are important to our operations, such as in the capacity of a regulator, partner  
or healthcare payer, reimburser or prescriber, among others. Details of these 
matters are included in Note 25 to the Financial Statements from page 184.
We devote signiﬁcant resources to the considerable challenge  
of compliance with this legislation, including in emerging and 
developing markets, at considerable cost. Investigations from 
governmental agencies require additional resources. Despite 
taking signiﬁcant measures to prevent breaches of applicable 
anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws by our personnel, breaches 
may result in the imposition of signiﬁcant penalties, such  
as ﬁnes, the requirement to comply with monitoring or self-
reporting obligations, or debarment or exclusion from government 
sales or reimbursement programmes, any of which could 
materially adversely affect our reputation, business or results  
of operations.
Any expected gains from productivity initiatives are uncertain Impact
We continue to implement various productivity initiatives and restructuring 
programmes with the aim of enhancing the long-term efﬁciency of the business. 
However, anticipated cost savings and other beneﬁts from these programmes  
are based on estimates and the actual savings may vary signiﬁcantly. In particular, 
these cost reduction measures are often based on current conditions and 
cannot always take into account any future changes to the pharmaceutical 
industry or our operations, including new business developments, wage  
or price increases.
If inappropriately managed, the expected value of these  
initiatives could be lost through low employee engagement  
and hence productivity, increased absence and attrition  
levels, and industrial action. 
Our failure to successfully implement these planned cost 
reduction measures, either through the successful conclusion of 
employee relations processes (including consultation, engagement, 
talent management, recruitment and retention), or the possibility 
that these efforts do not generate the level of cost savings  
we anticipate, could materially adversely affect our business  
or results of operations. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 81
Strategy Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance Overview
Changes in senior management, failure to attract  
and retain key personnel and failure to successfully  
engage with our employees Impact
The success of our business is guided by our SET and their direct reports.  
The departure of senior leaders can introduce uncertainty in the business. 
We rely heavily on recruiting and retaining talented employees with a diverse 
range of skills and capabilities to meet our strategic objectives. For example,  
the success of our R&D activities is particularly dependent on our ability to 
attract and retain sufﬁcient numbers of high-quality researchers and development 
specialists. We face intense competition for qualiﬁed individuals, as the supply  
of people with speciﬁc skills and signiﬁcant leadership potential or in speciﬁc 
geographic regions may be limited. 
Our ability to achieve high levels of employee engagement in the workforce,  
and hence beneﬁt from strong commitment and motivation, is key to the 
successful delivery of our business objectives. 
 
In 2012, we appointed a new CEO and in January 2013, we 
changed the composition of our SET. Senior management 
transitions can introduce uncertainty and could materially 
adversely impact our business or results of operations. 
The inability to attract and/or retain highly skilled personnel, in 
particular those in key scientiﬁc and leadership positions, may 
weaken our succession plans for critical positions in the medium 
term, may materially adversely affect the implementation of our 
strategic objectives and could ultimately impact our business  
or results of operations. 
Failure to engage effectively with our employees could lead to 
business disruption in our day-to-day operations, reduce levels  
of productivity and/or increase levels of voluntary turnover, all of 
which could ultimately adversely impact our business or results  
of operations. 
While we are committed to working on improving drivers of 
engagement, such as increasing our employees’ understanding 
of our new management, strategy and our ongoing efforts to 
reduce organisational complexity, our efforts may be unsuccessful.
Failure of information technology Impact
We are dependent on effective IT systems. These systems support key 
business functions such as our R&D, manufacturing, supply chain and  
sales capabilities, and are an important means of safeguarding and 
communicating data. 
Any signiﬁcant disruption to these IT systems, including breaches 
of data centre security or cybersecurity, or failure to integrate new 
and existing IT systems, could harm our reputation and materially 
adversely affect our ﬁnancial condition or results of operations. 
While we have invested heavily in the protection of our data and 
IT, we may be unable to prevent breakdowns or breaches in our 
systems that could adversely affect our business. 
For example, in 2012, the failure of the implementation of an IT 
interface in an enterprise resource planning IT system in our 
facility in Sweden (Södertälje) caused a disruption to our supply 
chain resulting in an estimated negative revenue impact of 1%. 
As previously disclosed, we terminated our previous outsourcing 
relationship for the provision of IT infrastructure services. We 
continue to migrate applications and servers to equipment and 
facilities managed by AstraZeneca and our current providers  
of IT infrastructure services. This migration activity may not be 
completed on time and within budget, which could adversely 
impact our business or results of operations.
Failure of outsourcing Impact
We have outsourced a number of business critical operations to third  
party providers. This includes certain R&D processes, IT systems, HR,  
and ﬁnance and accounting services. 
A failure to successfully manage and implement the integration  
of IT infrastructure services provided by our outsourcing providers 
could create disruption, which could materially adversely affect 
our business or results of operations. 
Failure of outsource providers to deliver timely services, and  
to the required level of quality, and failure of outsource providers  
to co-operate with each other, could materially adversely affect  
our ﬁnancial condition or results of operations. In addition, such 
failures could adversely impact our ability to meet business 
targets, maintain a good reputation within the industry and with 
stakeholders, and result in non-compliance with applicable laws 
and regulations. Performance | Risk
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 82
Supply chain and delivery risks
Manufacturing biologics Impact
Manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is complex and may 
require the use of innovative technologies to handle living micro-organisms and 
facilities speciﬁcally designed and validated for this purpose, with sophisticated 
quality assurance and control procedures.
Slight deviations in any part of the manufacturing process may 
result in lot failure, product recalls or spoilage, for example due  
to contamination.
Difﬁculties and delays in the manufacturing,  
distribution and sale of our products Impact
We may experience difﬁculties and delays in manufacturing our products, such 
as (i) supply chain continuity, including as a result of disruptions such as a natural 
or man-made disaster at one of our facilities or at a critical supplier or vendor;  
(ii) delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing 
facilities, including those intended to support future demand for our products;  
(iii) seizure or recalls of products or shutdown of manufacturing plants; and (iv) 
other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in manufacturing 
production sites, limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, 
changes in the types of products produced, or physical limitations or other 
business interruptions that could impact continuous supply.
Manufacturing distribution and sale difﬁculties may result in 
product shortages and signiﬁcant delays, which may lead to  
lost sales. 
In 2012, supply from our site in India was disrupted for a period of 
time, following a voluntary recall of products that we determined 
did not meet our global quality standards. 
In 2012, the failure of the implementation of an IT interface in an 
enterprise resource planning IT system in our facility in Sweden 
(Södertälje) caused a disruption to our supply chain resulting  
in an estimated negative revenue impact of 1%.
Reliance on third parties for goods Impact
We increasingly rely on third parties for the timely supply of goods, such  
as raw materials (for example, the API in some of our medicines), equipment, 
formulated drugs and packaging, all of which are key to our operations. 
Unexpected events and/or events beyond our control could result in the failure  
of the supply of goods. For example, suppliers of key goods we rely on may  
cease to trade. In addition, we may experience limited supply of biological 
materials, such as cells, animal products or by-products. Furthermore, 
government regulations in multiple jurisdictions could result in restricted  
access to, use or transport of such materials. 
Third party supply failure could materially adversely affect our 
ﬁnancial condition or results of operations. This may lead to 
signiﬁcant delays and/or difﬁculties in obtaining goods and 
services on commercially acceptable terms. 
Loss of access to sufﬁcient sources of key goods and biological 
materials may interrupt or prevent our research activities as 
planned and/or increase our costs. Further information is 
contained in the Managing risk section on page 74.
Legal, regulatory and compliance risks
Adverse outcome of litigation and/or governmental investigations Impact
We may be subject to legal proceedings and governmental investigations. 
Litigation, particularly in the US, is inherently unpredictable and unexpectedly 
high awards for damages can result from an adverse verdict. In many cases, 
plaintiffs may claim compensatory, punitive and statutory damages in extremely 
high amounts. In particular, the marketing, promotional, clinical and pricing 
practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner in which 
manufacturers interact with purchasers, prescribers and patients, are subject  
to extensive regulation, litigation and governmental investigation. Many 
companies, including AstraZeneca, have been subject to claims related to these 
practices asserted by federal and state governmental authorities and private 
payers and consumers, which have resulted in substantial expense and other 
signiﬁcant consequences. Note 25 to the Financial Statements from page 184 
describes the material legal proceedings in which we are currently involved.
Investigations or legal proceedings, regardless of their outcome, 
could be costly, divert management attention, or damage our 
reputation and demand for our products. Unfavourable resolution 
of current and similar future proceedings against us could subject 
us to criminal liability, ﬁnes, penalties or other monetary or 
non-monetary remedies, require us to make signiﬁcant provisions 
in our accounts relating to legal proceedings and could materially 
adversely affect our business or results of operations.
Substantial product liability claims Impact
Pharmaceutical companies have, historically, been subject to large product 
liability damages claims, settlements and awards for injuries allegedly caused  
by the use of their products. Adverse publicity relating to the safety of a product  
or of other competing products may increase the risk of product liability claims. 
Substantial product liability claims that result in court decisions 
against us or in the settlement of proceedings could materially 
adversely affect our ﬁnancial condition or results of operations, 
particularly where such circumstances are not covered by 
insurance. Furthermore, in the past we incurred substantial costs 
relating to product liability litigation involving Seroquel IR. For more 
information, see the Limited third party insurance coverage risk  
on page 84. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 83
Strategy Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance Overview
Failure to adhere to applicable laws, rules and regulations Impact
Any failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations may result in  
civil and/or criminal legal proceedings being ﬁled against us, or in us becoming 
subject to regulatory sanctions. Regulatory authorities have wide-ranging 
administrative powers to deal with any failure to comply with continuing 
regulatory oversight and this could affect us, whether such failure is our  
own or that of our contractors or external partners.
Failure to comply with applicable laws, including ongoing control 
and regulation, could materially adversely affect our business  
or results of operations. For example, once a product has been 
approved for marketing by the regulatory authorities, it is subject 
to continuing control and regulation, such as the manner of its 
manufacture, distribution, marketing and safety surveillance.  
In addition, any changes that are made to the manufacturing, 
distribution, marketing and safety surveillance processes of our 
products may require additional regulatory approvals, which could 
result in signiﬁcant additional costs and/or disruption to these 
processes. Such changes may be imposed on us by regulatory 
authorities as a result of continuing inspections to which we are 
subject or may be made at our own discretion. For example,  
if regulatory issues concerning compliance with current Good 
Manufacturing Practice or safety monitoring regulations for 
pharmaceutical products (often referred to as pharmacovigilance) 
arise, this could lead to loss of product approvals, product recalls 
and seizures, and interruption of production, which could create 
product shortages and delays in new product approvals.
Failure to adhere to laws, rules and regulations  
relating to anti-competitive behaviour Impact
Any failure to comply with laws, rules and regulations relating to anti-competitive 
behaviour may expose us to regulatory sanctions or lawsuits from private, 
non-governmental entities. 
Certain of our commercial arrangements with generics companies, which have 
sought to settle patent challenges on terms acceptable to both innovator and 
generics manufacturer, may be subject to challenge by competition authorities. 
An example of such a challenge is the Federal Trade Commission inquiry.  
See Note 25 to the Financial Statements from page 184 for more details.
Where a government authority investigates our adherence  
to competition laws, or we become subject to private party 
lawsuits, this may result in inspections of our sites or requests  
for documents and other information. Competition investigations 
or legal proceedings could be costly, divert management 
attention, or damage our reputation. 
Unfavourable resolution of such challenges, investigations or legal 
proceedings against us could require us to make changes to our 
commercial practice and could subject us to ﬁnes and penalties 
and other sanctions. These could materially adversely affect our 
business or results of operations.
Environmental and occupational health and safety liabilities Impact
We have environmental and/or occupational health and safety-related liabilities  
at some currently or formerly owned, leased and third party sites, the most 
signiﬁcant of which are detailed in Note 25 to the Financial Statements from  
page 183. 
While we carefully manage these liabilities, if a signiﬁcant 
non-compliance issue, environmental, occupational health or 
safety incident for which we are responsible were to arise, this 
could result in us being liable to pay compensation, ﬁnes or 
remediation costs. In some circumstances, such liability could 
materially adversely affect our business or results of operations.  
In addition, our ﬁnancial provisions for any obligations that we may 
have relating to environmental or occupational health and safety 
liabilities may be insufﬁcient if the assumptions underlying the 
provisions, including our assumptions regarding the portion  
of waste at a site for which we are responsible, prove incorrect  
or if we are held responsible for additional contamination  
or occupational health and safety-related claims.
Misuse of social media platforms and new technology Impact
We increasingly use the internet, social media, mobile applications and  
other forms of new technology to communicate internally and externally.  
The accessibility and instantaneous nature of interactions with such media  
may facilitate or exacerbate the risk of data leakages from within AstraZeneca  
or false or misleading statements being made about AstraZeneca, which may  
be damaging to our reputation. As social media platforms expand, it becomes 
increasingly challenging to identify new points of entry and to put structures  
in place to secure and protect information.
Inappropriate use of certain media vehicles could lead to  
misuse including public disclosure of sensitive information  
(such as personally identiﬁable information on employees, 
healthcare professionals or patients, for example, those enrolled 
in our clinical trials), which may damage our reputation and 
expose us to legal risks as well as additional legal obligations. 
Similarly, the involuntary public disclosure of commercially 
sensitive information such as trade secrets through external 
media channels, or an information loss, could materially adversely 
affect our business or results of operations. In addition, negative 
posts or comments on social media websites about us or,  
for example, the safety of any of our products, could harm  
our reputation. Performance | Risk

Economic and ﬁnancial risks
Adverse impact of a sustained economic downturn Impact
A variety of signiﬁcant risks may arise from a sustained global economic 
downturn. Additional pressure from governments and other healthcare payers  
on medicine prices and volumes of sales in response to recessionary pressures 
on budgets may cause a slowdown or a decline in growth in some markets.  
In some cases, those governments most severely impacted by the economic 
downturn may seek alternative ways to settle their debts through, for example,  
the issuance of government bonds which might trade at a discount to the face 
value of the debt. 
In addition, our customers may cease to trade, which may result in losses  
from writing off debts. We are highly dependent on being able to access a 
sustainable ﬂow of liquid funds due to the high ﬁxed costs of operating our 
business and the long and uncertain development cycles of our products.  
In a sustained economic downturn, ﬁnancial institutions with whom we deal  
may cease to trade and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to 
access monies owed to us without a protracted, expensive and uncertain 
process, if at all. 
More than 95% of our cash investments are managed centrally and are invested 
in AAA credit rated institutional money market funds backed by institutions in 
the US and the EU, which, in turn, invest in other funds, including sovereign 
funds. This means our credit exposure is a mix of US sovereign default risk and 
ﬁnancial institution default risk.
While we have adopted cash management and treasury policies 
to manage this risk (see Financial risk management policies 
section on page 99), we cannot be certain that these will be  
as effective as they are intended to be, in particular in the event  
of a global liquidity crisis. In addition, open positions where we  
are owed money and investments we have made in ﬁnancial 
institution money market funds cannot be guaranteed to be 
recoverable. Additionally, if we need access to external sources  
of ﬁnancing to sustain and/or grow our business, such as the  
debt or equity capital ﬁnancial markets, this may not be available 
on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, in the event of a severe 
and/or sustained economic downturn. This may, for instance,  
be the case in the event of any default by the Group on its debt 
obligations, which may materially adversely affect our ability to 
secure debt funding in the future or our ﬁnancial condition in 
general. Further information on debt funding arrangements is 
contained in the Financial risk management policies section  
on page 99.
Political and socio-economic conditions Impact
We operate in over 100 countries across the world, some of which may be 
subject to political and social instability. There may be disruption to our business  
if there is instability in a particular geographic region, including as a result of war, 
terrorism, riot, unstable governments, civil insurrection or social unrest. 
Deterioration of, or failure to improve, socio-economic conditions, 
and situations and/or events resulting therefrom, depending on 
their severity, could adversely affect our supply and/or distribution 
chain in the affected countries and the ability of customers or 
ultimate payers to purchase our medicines. This could materially 
adversely affect our business or results of operations.
Impact of ﬂuctuations in exchange rates Impact
As a global business, currency ﬂuctuations can signiﬁcantly affect our results  
of operations, which are reported in US dollars. Approximately 38% of our  
global 2012 sales were in the US, which is expected to remain our largest single 
market for the foreseeable future. Sales in other countries are predominantly in 
currencies other than the US dollar, including the euro, Japanese yen, Australian 
dollar and Canadian dollar. We have a growing exposure to emerging market 
currencies, where some have exchange controls in place, but for others the 
exchange rates are also linked to the US dollar. Major components of our cost 
base are located in the UK and Sweden, where an aggregate of approximately 
25.9% of our employees are based.
Movements in the exchange rates used to translate foreign 
currencies into US dollars may materially adversely affect our 
ﬁnancial condition or results of operations. Additionally, some  
of our subsidiaries import and export goods and services in 
currencies other than their own functional currency and so  
the ﬁnancial results of such subsidiaries could be affected by 
currency ﬂuctuations arising between the transaction dates and 
the settlement dates for these transactions. In addition, there are 
foreign exchange differences arising on the translation of equity 
investments in subsidiaries. See Note 23 to the Financial 
Statements from page 175.
Limited third party insurance coverage Impact
In recent years, the costs associated with product liability litigation have 
increased the cost of, and narrowed the coverage afforded by, pharmaceutical 
companies’ product liability insurance. To contain insurance costs in recent 
years, we have continued to adjust our coverage proﬁle, accepting a greater 
degree of uninsured exposure. The Group has not held any material product 
liability insurance since February 2006. In addition, where claims are made 
under insurance policies, insurers may reserve the right to deny coverage on 
various grounds. For example, product liability litigation cases relating to Crestor 
and Nexium in the US are not covered by third party product liability insurance. 
See Note 25 to the Financial Statements from page 183 for details.
If we are found to have a ﬁnancial liability as a result of product 
liability or other litigation, in respect of which we do not have 
appropriate insurance, or if an insurer’s denial of coverage is 
ultimately upheld, this could materially adversely affect our 
business or results of operations. For details about litigation  
with a number of insurers with respect to the Seroquel IR liability 
claim, see Note 25 to the Financial Statements from page 184.
For more information, see the Substantial product liability claims 
risk on page 82. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 85
Strategy Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance Overview
Taxation Impact
The integrated nature of our worldwide operations can produce conﬂicting 
claims from revenue authorities as to the proﬁts to be taxed in individual 
countries. The majority of the jurisdictions in which we operate have double  
tax treaties with other foreign jurisdictions, which provide a framework for 
mitigating the incidence of double taxation on our revenues and capital gains. 
The resolution of these disputes can result in a reallocation of 
proﬁts between jurisdictions and an increase or decrease in 
related tax costs, and has the potential to affect our cash ﬂows 
and EPS. Claims, regardless of their merits or their outcome,  
are costly, divert management attention and may adversely  
affect our reputation.
If any of these double tax treaties should be withdrawn or 
amended, especially in a territory where a member of the Group 
is involved in a taxation dispute with a tax authority in relation to 
cross-border transactions, such withdrawal or amendment could 
materially adversely affect our business or results of operations, 
as could a negative outcome of a tax dispute or a failure by the 
tax authorities to agree through competent authority proceedings. 
See the Financial risk management policies section on page 99  
for tax risk management policies and Note 25 to the Financial 
Statements on page 189 for details of current tax disputes.
Pensions Impact
Our pension obligations are backed by assets invested across the broad 
investment market. Our most signiﬁcant obligations relate to the UK pension fund.
Sustained falls in these asset values will put a strain on funding, 
which may result in requirements for additional cash, restricting 
cash available for strategic business growth. Similarly, if the 
liabilities increase as a result of a sustained low interest rate 
environment, there will be a strain on funding from the business. 
The likely increase in the IAS 19 accounting deﬁcit generated by 
any of these factors may cause the ratings agencies to review  
our credit rating, with the potential to negatively affect our ability  
to raise debt. See Note 18 to the Financial Statements from page 
167 for further details of the Group’s pension obligations. Performance | Financial Review
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 86
Financial Review
The ﬁnancial performance for the full year 
2012 was deﬁned by the signiﬁcant revenue 
decline associated with the loss of exclusivity 
for several products, with revenue down 
15% in constant currency terms. 
Spending discipline and restructuring 
beneﬁts only partially mitigated the impact  
of the revenue decline on Core proﬁts  
and margins, particularly as we remain 
committed to investment to drive future 
growth and value. Core earnings per share, 
which beneﬁted from the favourable impact 
of two tax related matters and the sale  
of Nexium OTC rights, were down 9%. 
Productivity and efﬁciency programmes 
continue to deliver their target levels  
of savings, providing the headroom  
to invest behind key growth platforms  
and in progressing the pipeline. Our cash 
generation remains strong, funding these 
investments for future growth and value 
whilst providing $5.9 billion in net cash 
distributions to shareholders through net 
share repurchases of $2.2 billion and  
$3.7 billion from payment of the second 
interim dividend from 2011 and the ﬁrst 
interim dividend from 2012. The Company’s 
commitment to its progressive dividend 
policy was conﬁrmed with the full year  
2012 results announcement.
Simon Lowth 
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer
 
The purpose of this Financial Review is  
to provide a balanced and comprehensive 
analysis of the ﬁnancial performance of the 
business during 2012, the ﬁnancial position 
as at the end of the year and the main 
business factors and trends which could 
affect the future ﬁnancial performance  
of the business.
All growth rates in this Financial Review are 
expressed at CER unless noted otherwise.
2012 Business background  
and results overview
The business background is covered in  
the Our industry section from page 16, the 
Therapy Area Review from page 50 and  
the Geographical Review from page 70,  
and describes in detail the developments in 
both our products and geographical regions. 
As described earlier in this Annual Report, 
sales of our products are directly inﬂuenced 
by medical need and are generally paid for 
by health insurance schemes or national 
healthcare budgets. Our operating results 
can be affected by a number of factors 
other than the delivery of operating plans 
and normal competition, such as:
 > The risk of generic competition following 
loss of patent protection or patent expiry 
of one of our products or an ‘at risk’ 
launch by a competitor or the launch  
of a generic competitor in the same class 
as one of our products, with the potential 
adverse effects on sales volumes and 
prices. For example, in 2012, our 
performance was affected by generic 
competition in the US for Seroquel IR 
and, again in the US, there has been

some volume decline of Crestor following 
the introduction of a large number of 
generic atorvastatin products. Further 
details of patent expiries for our key 
marketed products are included in the 
Patent expiries section on page 35.
 > The adverse impact on pharmaceutical 
prices as a result of the macroeconomic 
and regulatory environment. For instance, 
although there is no direct governmental 
control on prices in the US, action from 
federal and individual state programmes 
and health insurance bodies is leading to 
downward pressures on realised prices. 
In other parts of the world, there are a 
variety of price and volume control 
mechanisms and retrospective rebates 
based on sales levels that are imposed  
by governments. 
 > The timings of new product launches, 
which can be inﬂuenced by national 
regulators, and the risk that such new 
products do not succeed as anticipated, 
together with the rate of sales growth and 
costs following new product launches. 
 > Currency ﬂuctuations. Our functional  
and reporting currency is the US dollar, 
but we have substantial exposures  
to other currencies, in particular the  
euro, Japanese yen, pound sterling  
and Swedish krona. 
 > Macro factors such as greater demand 
from an ageing population and increasing 
requirements of Emerging Markets. 
Over the longer term, the success of our 
R&D is crucial and we devote substantial 
resources to this area. The beneﬁts of this 
investment are expected to emerge over the 
long term and there is considerable inherent 
uncertainty as to whether and when it will 
generate future products.
The most signiﬁcant features of our ﬁnancial 
results in 2012 are:
 > Revenue was down 15% to $27 ,973 million 
(Reported: 17%).
 > Loss of exclusivity on several brands, 
most notably Seroquel IR, and the 
disposals of Astra Tech and Aptium were 
the key drivers of the revenue decline. 
 > Symbicort, Faslodex, Onglyza, Iressa, 
Brilinta/Brilique and Seroquel XR delivered 
aggregate CER revenue growth of  
$600 million for the full year. 
 > Emerging Markets revenue increased 
by 4% (Reported: unchanged). 
 > Core operating proﬁt was down 18% 
(Reported: 21%) to $10,430 million,  
driven by lower revenues and lower Core 
gross margin, partially offset by reduced 
Core R&D and SG&A expenses. 
 > Reported operating proﬁt was down  
34% (Reported: 36%) to $8,148 million.
 > Core operating margin of 37 .3% of 
revenue was down 1.6 percentage  
points at CER. Reported operating  
margin was 29.1% of revenue.
 > Core EPS decreased by 9% (Reported: 
12%) to $6.41. Basic EPS was down 29% 
(Reported: 32%) to $4.99. Basic and  
Core EPS beneﬁted by $0.37 from two 
separate tax-related matters during the 
year. Proceeds from the sale of Nexium 
OTC rights contributed $0.16 to Basic  
and Core EPS. The larger decline in Basic 
EPS reﬂects the $1.08 per share beneﬁt  
in 2011 from the sale of Astra Tech and 
higher restructuring costs in 2012, neither 
of which are included in Core earnings.
 > Dividends paid decreased to  
$3,665 million (2011: $3,764 million).  
Net share repurchases totalled  
$2,206 million (2011: $5,606 million).  
On 1 October, the Group announced  
the suspension of its share repurchase 
programme.
 > Total restructuring costs associated with 
the global programme to reshape the cost 
base of the business were $1,558 million  
in 2012. Total costs to date for this third 
phase of restructuring, comprised of 
initiatives across the supply chain, SG&A 
and R&D, amount to $1,819 million.  
This brings the total restructuring costs 
charged to 31 December, since the start  
of our restructuring programme in 2007 ,  
to $6,427 million. Most of the remaining 
costs of approximately $300 million for the 
third phase of our restructuring will be 
taken in 2013.
“  The financial performance for 
the full year 2012 was defined 
by the loss of exclusivity for 
several products.” Performance | Financial Review
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 88
The following measures are referred to in  
this Financial Review when reporting on our 
performance both in absolute terms but 
more often in comparison to earlier years:
 > Reported performance. Reported 
performance takes into account all the 
factors (including those which we cannot 
inﬂuence, principally currency exchange 
rates) that have affected the results of  
our business as reﬂected in our Group 
Financial Statements prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted  
by the EU and as issued by the IASB. 
 > Core ﬁnancial measures. These are 
non-GAAP measures because, unlike 
Reported performance, they cannot  
be derived directly from the information  
in the Group’s Financial Statements. 
These measures are adjusted to exclude 
certain signiﬁcant items, such as charges 
and provisions related to our global 
restructuring programmes, amortisation 
and impairment of the signiﬁcant 
intangibles relating to the acquisition of 
MedImmune in 2007 , the amortisation 
and impairment of the signiﬁcant 
intangibles relating to our exit arrangements 
with Merck in the US and other speciﬁed 
items. In determining the adjustments  
to arrive at the Core result, we use a  
set of established principles relating to 
the nature and materiality of individual 
items or groups of items, excluding, for 
example, events which (i) are outside  
of the normal course of business, (ii)  
are incurred in a pattern that is unrelated  
to the trends in the underlying ﬁnancial 
performance of our ongoing business,  
or (iii) are related to major acquisitions,  
to ensure that investors’ ability to evaluate 
and analyse the underlying ﬁnancial 
performance of our ongoing business is 
enhanced. See the 2012 Reconciliation 
of Reported results to Core results table 
on the page opposite for a reconciliation 
of Reported to Core performance. 
 > Constant exchange rate (CER) growth 
rates. These are also non-GAAP 
measures. These measures remove  
the effects of currency movements  
(by retranslating the current year’s 
performance at previous year’s exchange 
rates and adjusting for other exchange 
effects, including hedging). A reconciliation 
of the Reported results adjusted for  
the impact of currency movements is 
provided in the 2012 Reported operating 
proﬁt table on the page opposite. 
 > Gross and operating proﬁt margin 
percentages, and Core pre-R&D 
operating margin. These measures set 
out the progression of key performance 
margins and illustrate the overall  
quality of the business. Core pre-R&D 
operating margin is a non-GAAP 
measure of our Core ﬁnancial 
performance. A reconciliation of Core 
pre-R&D operating margin to our 
operating proﬁt is provided on the page 
opposite and page 95.
 > Prescription volumes and trends for key 
products. These measures can represent 
the real business growth and the progress 
of individual products better and more 
immediately than invoiced sales. 
 > Net funds/debt. This represents our  
cash and cash equivalents, current 
investments and derivative ﬁnancial 
instruments less interest-bearing loans 
and borrowings. 
CER measures allow us to focus on the 
changes in sales and expenses driven by 
volume, prices and cost levels relative to 
the prior period. Sales and cost growth 
expressed in CER allows management  
to understand the true local movement in 
sales and costs, in order to compare recent 
trends and relative return on investment. 
CER growth rates can be used to analyse 
sales in a number of ways but, most often, 
we consider CER growth by products and 
groups of products, and by countries and 
regions. CER sales growth can be further 
analysed into the impact of sales volumes 
and selling price. Similarly, CER cost 
growth helps us to focus on the real local 
change in costs so that we can manage  
the cost base effectively.
We believe that disclosing Core ﬁnancial 
and growth measures in addition to our 
Reported ﬁnancial information enhances 
investors’ ability to evaluate and analyse  
the underlying ﬁnancial performance of  
our ongoing business and the related key 
business drivers. The adjustments made  
to our Reported ﬁnancial information in 
order to show Core ﬁnancial measures 
illustrate clearly, and on a year-on-year or 
period-by-period basis, the impact upon 
our performance caused by factors such  
as changes in sales and expenses driven 
by volume, prices and cost levels relative  
to such prior years or periods.
As shown in the 2012 Reconciliation of 
Reported results to Core results table  
on the page opposite, our reconciliation  
of Reported ﬁnancial information to Core 
ﬁnancial measures includes a breakdown  
of the items for which our Reported 
ﬁnancial information is adjusted and a 
further breakdown by speciﬁc line item as 
such items are reﬂected in our Reported 
income statement. This illustrates the 
signiﬁcant items that are excluded from 
Core ﬁnancial measures and their impact  
on our Reported ﬁnancial information,  
both as a whole and in respect of speciﬁc  
line items.
Core pre-R&D operating margin is our Core 
operating margin before Core R&D costs 
recorded in the year. This measure reﬂects 
Core operating performance before 
reinvestment in internal R&D.
Management presents these results 
externally to meet investors’ requirements 
for transparency and clarity. Core ﬁnancial 
measures are also used internally in the 
management of our business performance,  
in our budgeting process and when 
determining compensation.
Core ﬁnancial measures are non-GAAP 
adjusted measures. All items for which 
Core ﬁnancial measures are adjusted  
are included in our Reported ﬁnancial 
information as they represent actual costs 
of our business in the periods presented. 
As a result, Core ﬁnancial measures merely 
allow investors to differentiate between 
different kinds of costs and they should not 
be used in isolation. You should also refer 
to our Reported ﬁnancial information in the 
2012 Reported operating proﬁt table on the 
page opposite, our reconciliation of Core 
ﬁnancial measures to Reported ﬁnancial 
information in the Reconciliation of 
Reported results to Core results table on 
the page opposite, and to the Results of 
operations – summary analysis of year to 
31 December 2011 section from page 95 
for our discussion of comparative Reported 
growth measures that reﬂect all factors that 
affect our business. Our determination of 
non-GAAP measures, and our presentation 
of them within this ﬁnancial information, 
may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP 
measures of other companies.
With effect from the ﬁrst quarter results  
of 2013, we will update our deﬁnition of 
Core ﬁnancial measures to exclude all 
intangible asset amortisation charges and 
impairments, except those for IS-related 
intangibles. Further details of this change 
are included in the Revised Core ﬁnancial 
measures section of this Financial Review 
from page 97 . With the exception of the 
numbers detailed on page 98, all other 
references to Core in this Annual Report 
are calculated using our current deﬁnition  
of Core.
The SET retains strategic management of 
the costs excluded from Reported ﬁnancial 
information in arriving at Core ﬁnancial 
measures, tracking their impact on Reported 
operating proﬁt and EPS, with operational 
management being delegated on a 
case-by-case basis to ensure clear 
accountability and consistency for each 
cost category.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 90
Revenue decreased by 15% on a CER  
basis and 17% on a Reported basis.  
More than 13 percentage points of the 
decline at CER (approximately $4.5 billion) 
was related to loss of exclusivity on several 
brands in the portfolio. Seroquel IR revenues 
declined by $3 billion and regional losses of 
exclusivity for Atacand, Nexium and Crestor 
combined for a further negative impact of 
more than $1 billion. The disposals of Astra 
Tech and Aptium accounted for a further 
decrease of $562 million, or approximately 
1.7 percentage points of the year-on-year 
revenue change at CER. Disruptions to  
our supply chain, from the implementation 
of an enterprise resource planning IT  
system in our plant in Sweden early in the 
year, negatively impacted revenues by 
approximately 1%.
Revenue in the US was down 21% 
(Reported: 21%) with revenue in the  
Rest of World down 1 1% (Reported: 14%). 
Emerging Markets sales increased by 4% 
(Reported: ﬂat). Further details of our sales 
performance are contained in the Therapy 
Area Review from page 50 and the 
Geographical Review from page 70.
Core gross margin of 81.2% decreased  
0.9 percentage points (Reported: 1.0 
percentage points). In 2012, beneﬁts from 
the absence of the lower margin businesses 
of Astra Tech and Aptium, and from lower 
net expense related to our accounting  
for the amendments to the Merck exit 
arrangements (as detailed in Note 9  
to the Financial Statements from page  
159), were more than offset by an 
unfavourable impact from product mix.  
Core gross margin in 2011 beneﬁted  
from a $131 million settlement of a royalty 
dispute with PDL Biopharma Inc. 
Core R&D expenditure was $4,452 million, 
11% lower than last year (Reported: 12%). 
Higher costs from new spending on 
in-licensed, acquired or partnered projects, 
including $151 million relating to Amylin, 
Ardea and Amgen, were more than offset 
by lower intangible impairments in 2012  
of $186 million compared with 2011 
impairments of $527 million, a reduction  
of $341 million, and reduced spend  
on projects. 
Core SG&A costs of $8,541 million were 
12% lower than in 2011 (Reported: 14%),  
as a result of spending discipline, partially 
offset by amortisation expense related  
to the expansion of our diabetes alliance 
with BMS and increased promotional  
costs in Emerging Markets. The excise fee 
imposed by the enactment of US healthcare 
reform measures amounted to 2.8% (2011: 
2.1%) of Core SG&A expense for the year.
Core other income of $1,027 million was 
$182 million higher (Reported growth) than 
the previous year principally as a result of 
$250 million income from an agreement 
with Pﬁzer for OTC rights for Nexium.
Core pre-R&D operating margin was 53.2%, 
down 0.9 percentage points (Reported:  
1.0 percentage points), as the beneﬁt from 
higher Core other income was more than 
offset by higher Core cost of sales and Core 
SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue. 
Core operating proﬁt was $10,430 million,  
a decrease of 18% (Reported: 21%).  
Core operating margin declined by  
1.6 percentage points (Reported:  
1.9 percentage points) to 37 .3% as  
a result of an unfavourable impact from 
lower Core gross margin combined with 
higher Core R&D and SG&A costs as a 
percentage of revenue, being only partially 
mitigated by the increased Core other 
income for the year.
Core EPS was $6.41, down 9% (Reported: 
12%), lower than the decline in Core 
operating proﬁt as a result of the beneﬁts 
from net share repurchases and a lower  
tax rate. 
Pre-tax adjustments to arrive at Core 
amounted to $2,282 million in 2012  
(2011: $372 million). Excluded from  
Core results were: 
 > Restructuring costs totalling $1,558 million 
(2011: $1,161 million), incurred as the 
Group commenced the third phase of 
restructuring announced in February 
2012. 
 > Amortisation totalling $591 million (2011: 
$537 million) relating to assets capitalised 
as part of the MedImmune acquisition 
and the Merck exit arrangements, the 
increase driven by the additional 
amortisation arising from the amendment 
to the Merck exit arrangements during 
2012, as detailed in Note 9 to the Financial 
Statements from page 159.
 > $72 million (2011: $135 million) of legal 
provision charges in respect of ongoing 
Seroquel franchise legal matters, Average 
Wholesale Price litigation in the US, the 
Toprol-XL anti-trust litigation and Nexium 
commercial litigation. In line with prior 
years these have been excluded from our 
Core performance and full details of these 
matters are included in Note 25 to the 
Financial Statements from page 184.
 > $61 million (2011: $nil) of acquisition- and 
transaction-related expenses in relation  
to our Ardea and new BMS collaboration 
arrangements. Further details of these 
transactions are included in Note 9 and 
Note 22 to the Financial Statements.
 > In 2011, the proﬁt on sale of our subsidiary 
Astra Tech of $1,483 million was also 
excluded from Core results. Further 
details of this disposal are included  
in Note 22 to the Financial Statements  
on page 173. 
Reported operating proﬁt was down 34% 
(Reported: 36%) at $8,148 million. Reported 
EPS was $4.99, down 29% (Reported: 
32%). The larger declines compared with 
the respective Core ﬁnancial measures  
are the result of the $1,483 million beneﬁt  
to Reported other income in 2011 from  
the sale of Astra Tech, together with higher 
restructuring and amortisation costs in 2012 
compared with the prior year. 
Net ﬁnance expense was $430 million, in 
line with the $428 million expense recorded 
in 2011. Net fair value losses on long-term 
debt and derivatives were $10 million for the 
year, versus $4 million gains in 2011. This 
was partially offset by reduced net ﬁnance 
cost on the Group’s pension schemes. 
The Reported taxation charge of $1,391 
million (2011: $2,351 million) consists of  
a current tax charge of $1,682 million (201 1: 
$2,578 million) and a credit arising from 
movements on deferred tax of $291 million 
(2011: $227 million). The current year tax 
charge includes a prior period current tax 
credit of $79 million (2011: $102 million). 
The Reported tax rate for the year was 
18.0% (2011: 19.0%). The Reported tax  
rate for the year beneﬁted from a $230 
million adjustment to deferred tax balances 
following substantive enactment in 2012  
of a reduction in the Swedish corporation 
tax rate from 26.3% to 22%, which is 
effective 1 January 2013, and a $240 million 
adjustment in respect of prior periods 
following the favourable settlement of a 
transfer pricing matter. Excluding these 
items, the Reported tax rate for the year 
would have been 24.1%; this tax rate is 
applied to the taxable Core adjustments to 
operating proﬁt, resulting in a Core tax rate 
for the year of 18.9%. The Reported tax rate 
for last year beneﬁted from a non-taxable 
gain on the disposal of Astra Tech and a 
favourable adjustment to tax provisions of 
$520 million following the announcement  
in March 2011 that HM Revenue & Customs 
in the UK and the US Internal Revenue 
Service had agreed the terms of an Advance 
Pricing Agreement regarding transfer  
pricing arrangements for AstraZeneca’s US 
business for the period from 2002 to the 
end of 2014 and a related valuation matter. 
Excluding these beneﬁts, the Reported tax 
rate for 2011 was 26.4%.
Total comprehensive income for the year 
decreased by $3,065 million from 2011  
to $6,405 million. This was driven by the 
decrease in proﬁt for the year of $3,689 
million, partially offset by an increase of 
$624 million in other comprehensive 
income, which was principally due to the 
non-recurrence in 2012 of $741 million  
of actuarial losses recorded in 2011 on  
our deﬁned beneﬁt schemes, arising  
from lower discount rates applied to our 
long-term pension obligations reﬂecting 
external market conditions. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 91

Cash generated from operating activities 
was $6,948 million in the year to 31 
December 2012, compared with $7 ,821 
million in 2011. The decrease of $873 million 
is primarily driven by lower operating proﬁts, 
offset by lower tax payments.
Investment cash outﬂows of $5,607 million 
include the purchases of Ardea ($1,187 
million) and intangible assets associated 
with our collaboration with BMS on Amylin 
($3,358 million). The 2011 investment cash 
inﬂow of $577 million beneﬁted from the sale 
of Astra Tech ($1,772 million). Further details 
of the Ardea acquisition and Astra Tech 
disposal are included in Note 22 to the 
Financial Statements from page 173. Our 
Amylin transaction is detailed in Note 9  
to the Financial Statements on page 161.
Net cash distributions to shareholders 
decreased from $9,370 million in 2011  
to $5,871 million in 2012, the reduction 
being driven by the suspension of our  
share repurchase programme in October. 
Included in net cash distributions to 
shareholders are dividend payments  
of $3,665 million (2011: $3,764 million). 
At 31 December 2012, outstanding gross 
debt (interest-bearing loans and borrowings) 
was $10,310 million (2011: $9,328 million).  
Of this gross debt, $901 million is due within 
one year, including $77 4 million of commercial 
paper borrowings (2011: $nil) with various 
short-term maturities all within 90 days. In 
2011, amounts due within one year included 
$1,769 million relating to current instalments 
of loans. 
During September, the Company issued  
$2 billion of new long-term debt in two 
tranches; $1 billion maturing in 2019 with a 
coupon of 1.95% and $1 billion maturing in 
2042 with a coupon of 4.00%. Net proceeds 
of $1,980 million from the issue were used to 
repay a $1.75 billion bond with a coupon of 
5.40% maturing in September 2012 and for 
general corporate purposes. 
Net debt was $1,369 million at the end  
of the year, a decrease from net funds  
of $2,849 million at the end of 201 1,  
a movement of $4,218 million during the  
year as a result of the net cash outﬂow 
described above.

In 2012, net assets increased by $480 
million to $23,952 million. The increase  
in net assets is broadly as a result of the 
Group proﬁt of $6,327 million, offset by 
dividends of $3,619 million and net share 
repurchases of $2,206 million.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment decreased 
by $336 million to $6,089 million. Additions 
of $772 million (2011: $807 million) were 
offset by depreciation of $1,023 million 
(2011: $1,086 million) and disposals  
of $224 million (2011: $233 million).
Goodwill and intangible assets
The Group’s goodwill of $9,898 million 
(2011: $9,862 million) principally arose on 
the acquisition of MedImmune in 2007  
and the restructuring of our US joint venture 
with Merck in 1998. Goodwill of $30 million 
arising on our acquisition of Ardea, as 
detailed in Note 22 to the Financial 
Statements on page 173, was capitalised  
in 2012.
Intangible assets amounted to $16,448 
million at 31 December 2012 (201 1: $10,980 
million). Intangible asset additions were 
$6,916 million in 2012 (2011: $442 million), 
including $1,464 million arising on the 
acquisition of Ardea, $3,358 million arising 
from the expansion of our diabetes alliance 
with BMS and $1,475 million in connection 
with our Merck arrangements. Amortisation 
in the year was $1,296 million (2011: $911 
million) and impairments totalled $199 million 
(2011: $553 million). Further details of  
our additions to intangible assets, and 
impairments recorded, are included in Note 
9 to the Financial Statements from page 159. 
Receivables, payables and provisions
Trade receivables decreased by $934 
million to $5,696 million in line with lower 
revenues in 2012. 
Included within trade receivables is 
approximately $420 million of net 
receivables, representing 7% of our  
trade receivables, due from customers  
in the eurozone countries of Spain, Italy, 
Portugal and Greece (Spain: $120 million; 
Italy: $205 million; Portugal: $30 million;  
and Greece: $65 million). Within this balance 
is approximately $130 million of overdue 
government trade receivables. In light of 
current market conditions, debts within 
these eurozone countries have been subject 
to enhanced monitoring and scrutiny by  
the Group. Our bad debt provisioning 
against these debts reﬂects our current 
estimate of the recoverability of these 
balances based on consideration of a 
number of factors such as the status of 
current negotiations, past payment history 
and the budget constraints of individual 
countries. In 2012, our revenue from these 
four countries was $876 million (Italy),  
$510 million (Spain), $241 million (Greece) 
and $168 million (Portugal). 
Other receivables decreased by $402 
million to $835 million as a result of monies 
being released from externally held 
settlement funds in relation to Seroquel 
franchise legal matters. Prepayments and 
accrued income increased by $563 million 
driven, principally, by an increase in 
prepayments related to our Amylin 
transaction (see Note 9 to the Financial 
Statements on page 161).
Trade and other payables increased by 
$862 million in 2012 to $10,222 million, with 
increases in accruals of $1,323 million due 
to our Merck exit commitments, as detailed 
in Note 9 to the Financial Statements from 
page 161, being offset by a decrease  
in rebates and chargeback accruals of  
$799 million. The decrease in rebates and 
chargebacks is principally driven by the 
reduction in US revenues recorded in 2012. 
Further details of the movements on rebates 
and chargebacks are included from page 99.
The reduction in provisions of $518 million  
in 2012 includes $1,096 million of additional 
charges recorded in the year, offset by 
$1,476 million of cash payments. Included 
within the $1,096 million of charges for  
the year is $873 million for our global 
restructuring initiative and $90 million in 
respect of legal charges. Cash payments  
of $1,476 million include a reduction in our 
Seroquel franchise-related provisions of 
$427 million, following release of monies 
from our settlement funds as detailed 
above, and $853 million for our global 
restructuring programme. Further details  
of the charges made against our provisions 
are contained in Notes 17 and 25 to the 
Financial Statements.
Tax payable and receivable
Net income tax payable has decreased  
by $275 million to $2,059 million, principally 
due to the settlement of a transfer pricing 
matter as detailed in Note 4 to the Financial 
Statements from page 152. Our tax 
receivable balance of $803 million 
comprises tax owing to AstraZeneca  
from certain governments expected to be 
received on settlements of transfer pricing 
audits and disputes (see Note 25 to the 
Financial Statements on page 189) and 
cash tax timing differences. Net deferred  
tax liabilities increased by $244 million  
in the year.
Retirement beneﬁt obligations
Net retirement beneﬁt obligations decreased 
by $409 million, driven by an additional lump 
sum payment made into the UK deﬁned 
beneﬁt scheme in 2012.  AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 93
Strategy Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance Overview
In recent years the Group has undertaken 
several initiatives to reduce its net pension 
obligation exposure. For the UK deﬁned 
beneﬁt pension scheme, which represents 
AstraZeneca’s largest deﬁned beneﬁt 
scheme, these initiatives have included 
agreeing funding principles for cash 
contributions to be paid to the UK pension 
scheme to target a level of assets in excess 
of the current expected cost of providing 
beneﬁts, and, in 2010, amendments to the 
scheme to freeze pensionable pay at 30 
June 2010 levels. In addition to the cash 
contributions to be paid into the UK pension 
scheme, AstraZeneca makes contributions 
to an escrow account which is held outside 
the pension scheme. The escrow account 
assets are payable to the fund in agreed 
circumstances, for example, in the event of 
AstraZeneca and the pension fund trustee 
agreeing on a change to the current 
long-term investment strategy.
AstraZeneca has agreed to fund the UK 
deﬁned beneﬁt scheme shortfall by making 
lump sum payments totalling £715 million 
($1,103 million). The ﬁrst of these lump sum 
payments of £180 million ($278 million) was 
paid into the pension scheme from the 
escrow account in December 2011. A 
further £300 million ($463 million) was paid 
into the pension scheme during January 
2012 and the balance will be paid in due 
course. In 2011, £132 million ($213 million) 
was paid into the escrow account and a 
further £230 million ($355 million) was paid 
in during January 2012. At 31 December 
2012, £462 million ($748 million) escrow fund 
assets are included within other investments 
(as detailed in Note 10 to the Financial 
Statements on page 163).
In 2012, approximately 97% of the Group’s 
obligations were concentrated in the UK, 
the US, Sweden and Germany. Further 
details of the Group’s pension schemes  
are included in Note 18 to the Financial 
Statements from page 167 .
Commitments and contingencies
The Group has commitments and 
contingencies which are accounted for in 
accordance with the accounting policies 
described in the Financial Statements in the 
Group Accounting Policies section from 
page 146. The Group also has taxation 
contingencies. These are described in the 
Taxation section in the Critical accounting 
policies and estimates section on page 99 
and in Note 25 to the Financial Statements 
from page 189.
Research and development 
collaboration payments
Details of future potential R&D collaboration 
payments are also included in Note 25  
to the Financial Statements from page 183. 
As detailed in Note 25 to the Financial 
Statements, payments to our collaboration 
partners may not become payable due  
to the inherent uncertainty in achieving  
the development and revenue milestones 
linked to the future payments. As part of  
our overall externalisation strategy, we may 
enter into further collaboration projects  
in the future that may include milestone 
payments and, therefore, as certain 
milestone payments fail to crystallise due to, 
for example, development not proceeding,  
they may be replaced by potential payments 
under new collaborations.
Investments, divestments  
and capital expenditure 
As detailed earlier in the Research  
and Development section from page  
30, AstraZeneca views collaborations,  
including externalisation arrangements  
in the ﬁeld of R&D, as a crucial element  
of the development of our business.
The Group has completed over 130  
major externalisation transactions over  
the past three years, two of which were 
accounted for as business acquisitions 
under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, 
being the acquisition of Ardea in 2012  
for $1.3 billion and Novexel in 2010 for  
$0.5 billion, and all others were strategic 
alliances and collaborations. Further  
details of our business acquisitions  
and disposals in the past three years  
are contained in Note 22 to the Financial 
Statements from page 173. Details of  
our signiﬁcant externalisation transactions 
are given below:
 > In January 2007 , AstraZeneca signed  
an exclusive co-development and 
co-promotion agreement with BMS for 
the development and commercialisation 
of Onglyza, a DPP-IV and Forxiga, a 
selective sodium-glucose co-transporter 
2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, both for the treatment 
of Type 2 diabetes. The agreement is 
global with the exception of Japan for 
Onglyza. Under each agreement, the  
two companies jointly develop the clinical 
and marketing strategy and share 
development and commercialisation 
expenses on a global basis. To date, 
AstraZeneca has made upfront and 
milestone payments totalling $300 million 
for Onglyza and $170 million for Forxiga, 
will make a further payment of $80 million 
for Forxiga in early 2013, and may make 
future milestone payments of up to 
 $150 million on Forxiga contingent on 
achievement of regulatory milestones  
and launch in key markets. Following 
launch, proﬁts and losses globally  
are shared equally and an additional  
$300 million of sales-related payments  
for each product may be triggered  
based on worldwide sales success. 
 > In August, AstraZeneca expanded its 
diabetes alliance with BMS to incorporate 
the development and marketing of 
Amylin’s portfolio of diabetes products. 
Amylin, a wholly owned subsidiary of 
BMS, is a biopharmaceutical company 
dedicated to the discovery, development 
and commercialisation of innovative 
medicines for patients with diabetes  
and other metabolic diseases. Amylin’s 
primary focus is on the research, 
development and commercialisation  
of a franchise of GLP-1 agonists for  
the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.  
The portfolio of collaboration products 
includes Byetta (exenatide) injection and 
Bydureon (exenatide extended-release  
for injectable suspension/exenatide  
2mg powder and solvent for prolonged 
release suspension for injection) that  
are approved for use in both the US  
and Europe, Symlin (pramlinitide acetate) 
injection that is approved for use in the 
US, and metreleptin, a leptin analogue 
currently under review at the FDA  
for the treatment of diabetes and/or 
hypertriglyceridaemia in patients with  
rare forms of inherited or acquired 
lipodystrophy. AstraZeneca has expanded 
the alliance for a total consideration of 
$3.7 billion. This includes an amount  
of $135 million relating to an option  
of AstraZeneca contained in the 
collaboration agreement to acquire 
certain additional governance rights in 
respect of the collaboration. The Group 
notiﬁed BMS of its decision to exercise 
the option in August and the balance  
of $135 million will be payable once 
applicable anti-trust and competition 
approvals are received by AstraZeneca. 
The Group expects to make this payment 
in the ﬁrst half of 2013. Proﬁts and losses 
arising from the collaboration will be 
shared equally. Further details of this 
collaboration and our accounting 
treatment for this arrangement are 
included in Note 9 to the Financial 
Statements on page 161. 
 > In April 2012, AstraZeneca announced  
an agreement to jointly develop and 
commercialise ﬁve monoclonal antibodies 
from Amgen’s clinical inﬂammation 
portfolio: AMG 139, AMG 157 , AMG 181, 
AMG 557 and brodalumab (AMG 827). 
Under the terms of the agreement, 
AstraZeneca made a $50 million upfront 
payment and the companies share  
both costs and proﬁts. Approximately 
65% of costs for the 2012 to 2014  
period will be funded by AstraZeneca. 
Thereafter, the companies will split  
costs equally. In addition, AstraZeneca  
will make milestone payments to a 
maximum of $30 million up to launch.  
On commercialisation, Amgen will retain  
a low single-digit royalty for brodalumab 
and a mid-single-digit royalty for the rest 
of the portfolio after which the companies 
will share proﬁts equally. Performance | Financial Review
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 94
The Group determines the above 
externalisation transactions to be signiﬁcant 
using a range of factors. We look at the 
speciﬁc circumstances of the individual 
externalisation arrangement and apply 
several quantitative and qualitative criteria. 
Because we consider our externalisation 
strategy to be an extension of our R&D 
strategy, the expected total value of 
development payments under the 
transaction and its proportion of our annual 
R&D spend, both of which are proxies for 
overall R&D effort and cost, are important 
elements of the signiﬁcance determination. 
Other quantitative criteria we apply include, 
without limitation, expected levels of future 
sales, the possible value of milestone 
payments and the resources used for 
commercialisation activities (for example, 
the number of staff). Qualitative factors we 
consider include, without limitation, new 
market developments, new territories, new 
areas of research and strategic implications.
In aggregate, payments capitalised under 
the Group’s externalisation arrangements, 
other than those detailed above, amounted 
to $156 million in 2012, $123 million in  
2011 and $337 million in 2010. The Group 
recognised other income in respect of  
other externalisation arrangements totalling 
$255 million in 2012, including $250 million 
of income from an agreement with Pﬁzer  
for OTC rights for Nexium, $18 million  
in 2011 and $82 million in 2010.
Capitalisation
The total number of shares in issue at  
31 December 2012 was 1,247 million.  
12.2 million Ordinary Shares were issued in 
consideration of share option exercises for  
a total of $429 million. Share repurchases 
amounted to 57 .8 million Ordinary Shares  
at a cost of $2,635 million. Shareholders’ 
equity increased by $491 million to $23,737 
million at the year end. Non-controlling 
interests decreased to $215 million (2011: 
$226 million).
Dividend and share repurchases
The Board has recommended a second 
interim dividend of $1.90 (120.5 pence, 
12.08 SEK) to be paid on 18 March 2013. 
This brings the full year dividend to $2.80 
(178.6 pence, 18.34 SEK).
This dividend is consistent with the 
progressive dividend policy, by which the 
Board intends to maintain or grow the 
dividend each year. In adopting this policy, 
the Board recognised that some earnings 
ﬂuctuations are to be expected as the 
Group’s revenue base transitions through 
this period of exclusivity losses and new 
product launches. The Board’s view is  
that the annual dividend will not just reﬂect 
the ﬁnancial performance of a single year 
taken in isolation, but reﬂect its view of  
the earnings prospects for the Group over 
the entirety of the investment cycle. 
The Company has revised the basis by 
which it assesses dividend cover. The 
previous basis was a dividend cover target 
of two times (ie a payout ratio of 50%) based 
on Reported earnings (before restructuring 
costs). With the adoption of new deﬁnitions 
of Core ﬁnancial measures, as detailed  
from page 97 , the dividend cover target  
is now two times based on Core earnings 
under the new deﬁnition. In the context  
of the earnings ﬂuctuations that are to be 
expected as the Group’s revenue base 
transitions through this period of exclusivity 
losses and new product launches, the 
Board recognises that dividend cover in  
any year is likely to vary from the two times 
target level through the investment cycle.
In setting the distribution policy and the 
overall ﬁnancial strategy, the Board’s  
aim is to continue to strike a balance 
between the interests of the business,  
our ﬁnancial creditors and our shareholders. 
After providing for business investment, 
funding the progressive dividend policy  
and meeting our debt service obligations, 
the Board will keep under review the 
opportunity to return cash in excess  
of these requirements to shareholders 
through periodic share repurchases.
Future prospects 
We believe challenging market conditions 
will persist in 2013, including continued 
government interventions in price. The 
revenue impact from the loss of exclusivity 
will also continue to affect our performance. 
In the context of the ongoing update to our 
strategy, we have withdrawn the planning 
assumptions for revenue and margin 
evolution for the period 2010 to 2014 we 
outlined in January 2010. We plan to hold  
a Capital Markets Day in March 2013  
to provide a more detailed exposition  
of our strategic priorities.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 96
2011 revenue increased by 1% on a 
Reported basis but decreased by 2% on  
a CER basis. As in 2010, revenue beneﬁted 
from strong growth of Crestor , Symbicort 
and the Seroquel franchise but was offset 
by lower revenues for Nexium, Arimidex and 
Seloken/Toprol-XL. Emerging Markets sales 
growth of 10% in 2011 (Reported: 11%) and 
Established ROW 4% (Reported: 14%) was 
offset by a decline in 2011 US sales of 2% 
(Reported: 2%) and Western Europe of 11% 
(Reported: 7%). Further details of our sales 
performance are contained in the Therapy 
Area Review from page 50 and the 
Geographical Review from page 70.
Core gross margin in 201 1 of 82.2% increased 
1.3 percentage points (Reported: 1.0 
percentage points). The 2011 year-on-year 
improvement in the margin was largely due 
to the impact of the intangible impairment 
related to lesogaberan on 2010 gross 
margin and a $131 million beneﬁt from the 
settlement of a royalty dispute with PDL 
Biopharma Inc. in 2011.
Core R&D expenditure in 2011 was  
$5,033 million, 15% higher than 2010 
(Reported: 19%), driven by higher intangible 
impairments charged to R&D expenditure  
in 2011, including $285 million for olaparib 
and $150 million for TC-5214, and late-stage 
project spend. 
2011 Core SG&A costs of $9,918 million 
were 2% lower than in 2010 (Reported:  
1% higher). Investment in Emerging  
Markets and recently launched brands,  
as well as the impact of the US healthcare  
reform excise tax were more than offset  
by operational efﬁciencies across 
Established Markets.
Core other income in 2011 of $845 million 
was $65 million less than the previous year, 
principally as a result of a higher level of 
disposal gains in 2010.
Core pre-R&D operating margin was  
54.2% in 2011, up 1.0 percentage points 
(Reported: 0.7 percentage points), as the 
higher 2011 gross margin was only slightly 
offset by lower Core other income and 
higher SG&A costs as a percentage  
of revenue.
2011 Core operating proﬁt was  
$13,167 million, a decrease of 4% from  
2010 (Reported: 3%). Core operating  
margin declined by 1.2 percentage  
points (Reported: 1.6 percentage points)  
to 39.2% in 2011 as a result of the higher  
R&D spend and lower Core other  
operating income.
Core EPS was $7 .28 in 2011, up 7% 
(Reported: 9%), with the lower operating 
proﬁt offset by a lower tax rate, lower net 
interest as well as the beneﬁt of a lower 
average number of shares outstanding.
Within Core adjustments for 2011, 
restructuring costs and amortisation  
were broadly in line with 2010. Non-core 
intangible impairments and legal provisions 
were signiﬁcantly reduced from 2010.  
In 2011, Core adjustments also included  
the proﬁt on the sale of our dental and 
healthcare subsidiary Astra Tech.  
Excluded from 201 1 Core results were: 
 > Impairment charges of $22 million  
(2010: $568 million), arising from 
impairments of assets capitalised as  
part of the MedImmune acquisition.
 > $135 million (2010: $612 million) of legal 
provision charges in respect of the 
ongoing Seroquel IR product liability 
litigation, Average Wholesale Price 
litigation in the US and the Toprol-XL 
anti-trust litigation.
 > Restructuring costs totalling $1,161 million 
in 2011 (2010: $1,202 million), incurred  
as the Group continued its previously 
announced efﬁciency programmes. 
 > Amortisation totalling $537 million  
(2010: $518 million) relating to assets 
capitalised in 2011 as part of the 
MedImmune acquisition and the Merck 
exit arrangements. 
 > Proﬁt on sale of our subsidiary Astra  
Tech of $1,483 million. On 31 August 
2011, we completed the sale of Astra 
Tech to DENTSPLY International Inc.  
for a net cash consideration of $1,772 
million. Further details of this disposal  
are included in Note 22 to the Financial 
Statements on page 173. 
2011 Reported operating proﬁt was up  
10% at CER (Reported: 11%) at $12,795 
million, largely as a result of the impact  
of the proﬁt on the disposal of Astra Tech. 
Reported EPS was $7 .33 in 2011, up 29% 
(Reported: 31%), as a result of the same 
factors affecting Core EPS along with  
the proﬁt recognised on the disposal  
of Astra Tech. 
Net ﬁnance expense was $428 million  
in 2011, against $517 million in 2010, due  
to reduced interest payable on lower debt 
balances ($46 million) and a lower net 
pension interest expense of $55 million 
principally due to increased pension assets 
held by our deﬁned beneﬁt schemes.
The 2011 Reported taxation charge  
of $2,351 million (2010: $2,896 million) 
consisted of a current tax charge of  
$2,578 million (2010: $3,435 million) and  
a credit arising from movements on deferred 
tax of $227 million (2010: $539 million).  
The 201 1 current year tax charge included a 
prior period current tax credit of $102 million 
(2010: charge of $370 million). The Reported 
tax rate for 2011 was 19.0% (2010: 26.4%). 
The 2011 Reported tax rate beneﬁted from 
the non-taxable gain on the disposal of 
Astra Tech and an adjustment in respect  
of prior periods following the announcement  
in March 2011 that HM Revenue & Customs 
in the UK and the US Internal Revenue 
Service had agreed the terms of an Advance 
Pricing Agreement regarding transfer pricing 
arrangements for AstraZeneca’s US business 
for the period from 2002 to the end of 2014 
and a related valuation matter. Excluding 
these beneﬁts, the Reported tax rate for 
2011 was 26.4%. 
Total comprehensive income for 2011 
increased by $1,364 million to $9,470 
million. This was driven by the increase 
in proﬁt in 2011 of $1,935 million, offset  
by a decrease of $571 million in other 
comprehensive income, principally due  
to $741 million of actuarial losses on our 
deﬁned beneﬁt schemes arising from  
lower discount rates being applied in 201 1  
to our long-term pension obligations 
reﬂecting external market conditions.
Cash ﬂow and liquidity – 2011
All data in this section is on a Reported basis. 
Cash generated from operating activities 
was $7 ,821 million in the year to  
31 December 2011, compared with  
$10,680 million in 2010. The decrease  
of $2,859 million was primarily driven  
by higher tax payments made in 2011, 
including a net amount of $1.1 billion in 
relation to the Advance Pricing Agreement 
between the UK and US governments’  
tax authorities and the settlement of  
a related valuation matter, an increase in 
trade and other receivables and higher 
contributions made to our UK deﬁned 
beneﬁt pension fund. 
Investment cash inﬂows of $577 million  
in 2011 included the sale of Astra Tech 
($1,772 million). Cash outﬂows on the 
purchase of tangible ﬁxed assets amounted 
to $839 million in 2011, in line with the 
previous year. 
Net cash distributions to shareholders 
increased from $5,471 million in 2010 to 
$9,370 million in 2011 through dividend 
payments of $3,764 million and net share 
repurchases of $5,606 million.  AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 97
Strategy Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance Overview
At 31 December 2011, outstanding gross 
debt (interest-bearing loans and borrowings) 
was $9,328 million (2010: $9,222 million).  
Of this gross debt, $1,990 million was due 
within one year (2010: $125 million). 
Financial position – 2011
All data in this section is on a Reported basis.
In 2011, net assets increased by $62 million 
to $23,472 million. The increase in net 
assets as a result of the 2011 Group proﬁt  
of $10,016 million was offset by dividends  
of $3,752 million and share repurchases  
of $6,015 million.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment decreased 
by $532 million to $6,425 million in 2011. 
Additions of $807 million (2010: $808 million) 
were offset by depreciation of $1,068 million 
(2010: $1,076 million) and disposals of $233 
million (2010: $73 million), including $151 
million of assets on the sale of Astra Tech.
Goodwill and intangible assets
Our goodwill of $9,862 million at 31 
December 2011 (2010: $9,871 million) 
principally arose on the acquisition of 
MedImmune and the restructuring of  
our US joint venture with Merck in 1998.  
No goodwill was capitalised in 2011.
Intangible assets amounted to $10,980 
million at 31 December 2011 (2010:  
$12,158 million). Intangible asset additions 
were $442 million in 2011 (2010: $1,791 
million), amortisation was $911 million  
(2010: $810 million) and impairments  
totalled $553 million (2010: $833 million). 
$113 million of intangible assets were 
disposed of on the sale of Astra Tech  
in 2011.
Intangible asset impairment charges 
recorded in 2011 included $285 million 
following the termination of development  
of olaparib for the maintenance treatment  
of serous ovarian cancer and an impairment 
of $150 million reﬂecting a lower probability 
of success assessment for TC-5214, based 
on the results of the ﬁrst two of four Phase III 
efﬁcacy and tolerability studies. 
Receivables, payables and provisions
In 2011, trade receivables increased by 
$383 million to $6,630 million driven, 
principally, by higher gross sales in the  
US in December 201 1 and the way calendar 
working days fell at the 2011 year end.  
Other receivables increased by $566 million 
to $1,237 million at 31 December 2011 
driven by an increase in our Seroquel 
IR-related settlement funds. 
Trade and other payables increased by 
$326 million in 2011, driven by increases  
in accruals of $177 million and rebates and 
chargebacks of $446 million, offset by a 
decrease in other payables of $215 million. 
The increase in rebates and chargebacks 
arose principally from increased managed-
care and group purchasing organisation 
rebates. Further details of the movements 
on rebates and chargebacks are included 
from page 99.
The movement in provisions of $76 million  
in 2011 included $716 million of additional 
charges recorded in the year, offset by  
$657 million of cash payments. Included 
within the $716 million of charges in 2011 
was $135 million in respect of legal charges 
and $450 million for our global restructuring 
initiative. 2011 cash payments of $657 
million included $377 million against our 
ongoing global restructuring initiative and 
$153 million related to legal matters. 
Tax payable and receivable
Net income tax payable in 201 1 decreased 
by $1,521 million to $2,334 million, principally 
due to the payment of a net amount  
of $1.1 billion in relation to the Advance  
Pricing Agreement between the UK  
and US governments’ tax authorities  
and the settlement of a related valuation 
matter. The tax receivable balance of  
$1,056 million largely comprised tax owing 
to AstraZeneca from certain governments 
expected to be received on settlements  
of transfer pricing audits and disputes.  
Net deferred tax liabilities reduced by  
$449 million in 2011.
Retirement beneﬁt obligations
Net retirement beneﬁt obligations  
increased by $202 million in 2011, due  
to an increase in post-retirement scheme 
obligations of $954 million driven by  
a reduction in the discount rate applied  
to long-term scheme obligations, reﬂecting 
present market conditions for corporate 
bonds, offset by pension fund employer 
contributions made in the year of  
$733 million (2010: $469 million). 
Revised Core ﬁnancial measures
As detailed in our announcement of  
12 November 2012, with effect from  
our ﬁrst quarter results in 2013, the Group 
will update its deﬁnition of Core ﬁnancial 
measures to exclude all intangible asset 
amortisation charges and impairments, 
except those for IS-related intangibles.  
As intangible assets acquired as a result  
of externalisation become an increasing 
proportion of the Group’s asset base,  
the new deﬁnition has been extended  
to provide better clarity of the impact  
from amortisation and impairment charges 
included in Reported results and, in  
addition, while recognising that non-GAAP 
measures differ between companies,  
it will aid comparability of our results  
versus our peers.
The items excluded from Core results under 
the existing deﬁnition, as disclosed in detail 
on page 88, remain a constituent part  
of the new deﬁnition. The existing deﬁnition 
excludes from our Core numbers certain 
signiﬁcant items, such as charges and 
provisions related to our global restructuring 
programmes, amortisation and impairment 
of the signiﬁcant intangibles relating to our 
acquisition of MedImmune in 2007 and our 
exit arrangements with Merck in the US, 
and other speciﬁed items. In determining the 
adjustments to arrive at the Core result, we 
use a set of established principles relating to 
the nature and materiality of individual items 
or groups of items, excluding, for example, 
events which (i) are outside of the normal 
course of business, (ii) are incurred in a 
pattern that is unrelated to the trends in  
the underlying ﬁnancial performance of our 
ongoing business, or (iii) are related to major 
acquisitions, to ensure that investors’ ability 
to evaluate and analyse the underlying 
ﬁnancial performance of our ongoing 
business is enhanced.
Adjustments between Reported and 
revised Core performance measures
Under the revised deﬁnition of Core, our 
Reported performance will be adjusted for:
 > Amortisation and impairments  
of intangible assets. The deﬁnition  
of this item will be updated to include  
all amortisation and impairment charges 
for intangible assets except for those 
arising on IS-related assets. Adjusting  
for these items removes the volatility  
when impairments are booked on  
such assets and is intended to provide  
a better measure of underlying business 
performance. It will be extended to cover 
all amortisation and impairments relating 
to product marketing and distribution 
rights and other intangibles, incorporating 
those already excluded under the current 
deﬁnition relating to our acquisition of 
MedImmune and our exit arrangements 
with Merck. The amortisation and 
impairment of IS-related intangibles   Performance | Financial Review
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 98
are not included in the adjustment,  
and will remain in Core.
 > Restructuring costs. The deﬁnition for  
this item has not been changed. These 
charges arise from the major restructuring 
programmes announced by the Group.
 > Legal charges and other charges. The 
deﬁnition for this item has not been 
changed. Legal payments, charges  
and expenses related to settlements, 
judgments and ﬁnes in the context  
of product liability litigation, anti-trust 
litigation, patent litigation and government 
investigations will be excluded from the 
Core measures and the adjustment will 
be stated net of related insurance 
recoveries. In the ordinary course of 
business, external legal professional fees, 
including those relating to IP protection 
costs, and the costs of AstraZeneca’s 
in-house legal function will remain in Core. 
Professional fees directly attributable to 
AstraZeneca’s signiﬁcant acquisitions and 
other signiﬁcant business combination 
activity will continue to be excluded from 
Core. Other speciﬁed items deemed not 
to be in the ordinary course of business 
will continue to be excluded from Core.
 > Tax on adjustments. The deﬁnition for this 
item has not been changed. The Group’s 
Reported tax rate, adjusted for signiﬁcant 
one-off items embedded within that rate, 
is applied to all taxable Core adjustments.

Strategy Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance Overview
Financial risk management
Financial risk management policies
Insurance
Our risk management processes are 
described in the Managing risk section  
from page 74. These processes enable us  
to identify risks that can be partly or entirely 
mitigated through the use of insurance.  
We negotiate best available premium rates 
with insurance providers on the basis of our 
extensive risk management procedures.  
In the current insurance market, the level  
of cover is decreasing while premium rates 
are increasing. Rather than simply paying 
higher premiums for lower cover, we focus 
our insurance resources on the most critical 
areas, or where there is a legal requirement, 
and where we can get best value for money. 
Risks to which we pay particular attention 
include business interruption, Directors’  
and Ofﬁcers’ liability and property damage. 
Insurance for product liability has not  
been available on commercially acceptable 
terms for several years and the Group has 
not held product liability insurance since 
February 2006.
Taxation
Tax risk management forms an integrated 
part of the Group’s risk management 
processes. Our tax strategy is to manage 
tax risks and tax costs in a manner 
consistent with shareholders’ best 
long-term interests, taking into account  
both economic and reputational factors.  
We draw a distinction between tax planning 
using artiﬁcial structures and optimising  
tax treatment of business transactions,  
and we engage only in the latter.
Treasury
The principal ﬁnancial risks to which  
the Group is exposed are those arising  
from liquidity, interest rate, foreign currency  
and credit. The Group has a centralised 
treasury function to manage these risks  
in accordance with Board-approved 
policies. Speciﬁcally, liquidity risk is 
managed through maintaining access  
to a number of sources of funding to  
meet anticipated funding requirements, 
including committed bank facilities  
and cash resources. Interest rate risk  
is managed through maintaining a debt 
portfolio that is weighted towards ﬁxed  
rates of interest. Accordingly, the Group’s 
net interest charge is not signiﬁcantly 
affected by movements in ﬂoating rates  
of interest. We do not currently hedge  
the impact on earnings and cash ﬂow  
of changes in exchange rates, with the 
exception of the currency exposure  
that arises between the booking and 
settlement dates on non-local currency 
purchases and sales by subsidiaries  
and the external dividend. Credit risk is 
managed through setting and monitoring 
credit limits appropriate for the assessed 
risk of the counterparty.
Our capital and risk management objectives 
and policies are described in further detail  
in Note 23 to the Financial Statements from 
page 175 and in the Risk section from page 
74.
Sensitivity analysis of the Group’s exposure 
to exchange rate and interest rate movements 
is also detailed in Note 23 to the Financial 
Statements from page 175.
Critical accounting policies  
and estimates
Our Financial Statements are prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU (adopted IFRS) and as issued by the 
IASB, and the accounting policies employed 
are set out in the Group Accounting Policies 
section in the Financial Statements from 
page 146. In applying these policies, we 
make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets 
and liabilities. The actual outcome could 
differ from those estimates. Some of these 
policies require a high level of judgement 
because the areas are especially subjective 
or complex. We believe that the most critical 
accounting policies and signiﬁcant areas  
of judgement and estimation are in:
 > revenue recognition 
 > research and development 
 > impairment testing of goodwill  
and intangible assets 
 > litigation 
 > post-retirement beneﬁts 
 >taxation.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recorded at the invoiced amount 
(excluding inter-company sales and value 
added taxes) less movements in estimated 
accruals for rebates and chargebacks given 
to managed-care and other customers and 
product returns – a particular feature in the 
US. The impact in the rest of the world is not 
signiﬁcant. It is the Group’s policy to offer a 
credit note for all returns and to destroy all 
returned stock in all markets. Cash discounts 
for prompt payment are also deducted from 
sales. Revenue is recognised at the point of 
delivery, which is usually when title passes 
to the customer either on shipment or on 
receipt of goods by the customer depending 
on local trading terms. Income from royalties 
and from disposals of IP , brands and product 
lines is included in other operating income.
Rebates, chargebacks and returns  
in the US
When invoicing sales in the US, we  
estimate the rebates and chargebacks that 
we expect to pay. These rebates typically  
arise from sales contracts with third party 
managed-care organisations, hospitals, 
long-term care facilities, group purchasing 
organisations and various federal or state 
programmes (Medicaid ‘best price’ 
contracts, supplemental rebates etc).  
They can be classiﬁed as follows:
 > Chargebacks, where we enter into 
arrangements under which certain 
parties, typically hospitals, the 
Department of Veterans Affairs, Public 
Health Service Covered Entities and the 
Department of Defense, are able to buy 
products from wholesalers at the lower 
prices we have contracted with them.  
The chargeback is the difference between 
the price we invoice to the wholesaler  
and the contracted price charged by  
the wholesaler. Chargebacks are paid 
directly to the wholesalers.
 > Regulatory, including Medicaid and other 
federal and state programmes, where we 
pay rebates based on the speciﬁc terms 
of agreements with the US Department  
of Health and Human Services and with 
individual states, which include product 
usage and information on best prices  
and average market prices benchmarks.
 > Contractual, under which entities such as 
third party managed-care organisations, 
long-term care facilities and group 
purchasing organisations are entitled  
to rebates depending on speciﬁed 
performance provisions, which vary  
from contract to contract.
The effects of these deductions on  
our US pharmaceuticals revenue and  
the movements on US pharmaceuticals 
revenue provisions are set out overleaf.
Accrual assumptions are built up on a 
product-by-product and customer-by-
customer basis, taking into account speciﬁc 
contract provisions coupled with expected 
performance, and are then aggregated into 
a weighted average rebate accrual rate for 
each of our products. Accrual rates are 
reviewed and adjusted on a monthly basis. 
There may be further adjustments when 
actual rebates are invoiced based on 
utilisation information submitted to us  
(in the case of contractual rebates) and 
claims/invoices are received (in the case  
of regulatory rebates and chargebacks).  
We believe that we have made reasonable 
estimates for future rebates using a similar 
methodology to that of previous years. 
Inevitably, however, such estimates involve 
judgements on aggregate future sales 
levels, segment mix and the customers’ 
contractual performance.
The large increase in managed-care  
and group purchasing organisation rebates 
in 2011 was principally driven by the impacts 
of the Affordable Care Act. See page 71 of 
the Geographical Review for more information. 
The 2012 adjustment in respect of prior 
years includes reﬁnements of the provisions 
recorded for the Affordable Care Act.
Cash discounts are offered to customers  
to encourage prompt payment. Accruals  
are calculated based on historical 
experience and are adjusted to reﬂect  
actual experience. Performance | Financial Review

Strategy Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance Overview
Industry practice in the US allows 
wholesalers and pharmacies to return 
unused stocks within six months of, and  
up to 12 months after, shelf-life expiry.  
The customer is credited for the returned 
product by the issuance of a credit note. 
Returned products are not exchanged for 
products from inventory and once a return 
claim has been determined to be valid  
and a credit note has been issued to  
the customer, the returned products are 
destroyed. At the point of sale in the US,  
we estimate the quantity and value of  
products which may ultimately be returned. 
Our returns accruals in the US are based  
on actual experience. Our estimate is  
based on the preceding 12 months for 
established products together with 
market-related information, such as 
estimated stock levels at wholesalers  
and competitor activity, which we receive  
via third party information services.  
For newly launched products, we use rates 
based on our experience with similar 
products or a pre-determined percentage.
For products facing generic competition 
(such as Seroquel IR in the US) our 
experience is that we usually lose the ability 
to estimate the levels of returns from 
wholesalers with the same degree of 
precision that we can for products still 
subject to patent protection. This is because 
we have limited or no insight into a number  
of areas: the actual timing of the generic 
launch (for example, a generic manufacturer 
may or may not have produced adequate 
pre-launch inventory); the pricing and 
marketing strategy of the competitor;  
the take-up of the generic; and (in cases 
where a generic manufacturer has approval  
to launch only one dose size in a market  
of several dose sizes) the likely level of 
switching from one dose to another. Under 
our accounting policy, revenue is recognised 
only when the amount of the revenue  
can be measured reliably. Our approach in 
meeting this condition for products facing 
generic competition will vary from product 
to product depending on the speciﬁc 
circumstances.
The closing adjustment in respect of prior 
years beneﬁted 2012 net US pharmaceuticals 
revenue by 1.0% (2011: increased revenue 
by 1.1%; 2010: increased revenue by  
1.1%). However, taking into account the 
adjustments affecting both the current and 
the prior year, 201 1 revenue was reduced by 
0.3%, and 2010 revenue was not impacted, 
by adjustments between years.
We have distribution service agreements 
with major wholesaler buyers which serve  
to reduce the speculative purchasing 
behaviour of the wholesalers and reduce 
short-term ﬂuctuations in the level of 
inventory they hold. We do not offer  
any incentives to encourage wholesaler 
speculative buying and attempt, where 
possible, to restrict shipments to underlying 
demand when such speculation occurs.
Sales of intangible assets
A consequence of charging all internal R&D 
expenditure to the income statement in the 
year in which it is incurred (which is normal 
practice in the pharmaceutical industry)  
is that we own valuable intangible assets 
which are not recorded on the balance 
sheet. We also own acquired intangible 
assets which are included on the balance 
sheet. As a consequence of regular reviews 
of product strategy, from time to time we  
sell such assets and generate income. Sales  
of product lines are often accompanied  
by an agreement on our part to continue 
manufacturing the relevant product for a 
reasonable period (often about two years) 
while the purchaser constructs its own 
manufacturing facilities. The contracts 
typically involve the receipt of an upfront 
payment, which the contract attributes  
to the sale of the intangible assets, and 
ongoing receipts, which the contract 
attributes to the sale of the product we 
manufacture. In cases where the transaction 
has two or more components, we account 
for the delivered item (for example, the 
transfer of title to the intangible asset) as  
a separate unit of accounting and record 
revenue on delivery of that component 
provided that we can make a reasonable 
estimate of the fair value of the undelivered 
component. Where the fair market value  
of the undelivered component (for example,  
a manufacturing agreement) exceeds the 
contracted price for that component, we 
defer an appropriate element of the upfront 
consideration and amortise this over the 
performance period. However, where  
the fair market value of the undelivered 
component is equal to or lower than the 
contracted price for that component,  
we treat the whole of the upfront amount  
as being attributable to the delivered 
intangible assets and recognise that part  
of the revenue upon delivery. No element  
of the contracted revenue related to the 
undelivered component is allocated to the 
sale of the intangible asset. This is because 
the contracted revenue relating to the 
undelivered component is contingent on 
future events (such as sales) and so cannot 
be anticipated.
Research and development
Our business is underpinned by our 
marketed products and development 
portfolio. The R&D expenditure on internal 
activities to generate these products is 
generally charged to proﬁt in the year  
that it is incurred. Purchases of IP and 
product rights to supplement our R&D 
portfolio are capitalised as intangible  
assets. Further details of this policy are 
included in the Group Accounting Policies 
section of our Financial Statements  
from page 146. Such intangible assets  
are amortised from the launch of the 
underlying products and are tested for 
impairment both before and after launch.  
This policy is in line with practice adopted  
by major pharmaceutical companies.
Impairment testing of goodwill and 
intangible assets
We have signiﬁcant investments in goodwill 
and intangible assets as a result of 
acquisitions of businesses and purchases 
of assets, such as product development 
and marketing rights.
Details of the estimates and assumptions 
we make in our annual impairment testing  
of goodwill are included in Note 8 to the 
Financial Statements on page 158. No 
impairment of goodwill was identiﬁed.
Impairment reviews have been carried  
out on all intangible assets that are in 
development (and not being amortised),  
all major intangible assets acquired during 
the year and all intangible assets that have 
had indications of impairment during the 
year. Sales forecasts and speciﬁc allocated  
costs (which have both been subject to 
appropriate senior management sign-off) 
are discounted using appropriate rates 
based on AstraZeneca’s risk-adjusted 
pre-tax weighted average cost of capital. 
Our weighted average cost of capital 
reﬂects factors such as our capital structure 
and our costs of debt and equity. In building 
to the range of rates used in our internal 
investment appraisal of future projects  
and capital investment decisions, we adjust 
our weighted average cost of capital  
for other factors, which reﬂect, without 
limitation, local matters such as risk on  
a case-by-case basis. Performance | Financial Review
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 102
The majority of our investments in intangible 
assets and goodwill arose from the 
restructuring of the joint venture with Merck 
in 1998, the acquisition of MedImmune in 
2007 and the payments to partially retire 
Merck’s interests in our products in the  
US in 2008 and 2010. Additions in 2012 
have included intangible assets acquired 
through our new collaboration with BMS 
concerning Amylin’s portfolio of products, 
our acquisition of Ardea and revised 
arrangements with Merck concerning  
the ﬁnal step in our exit arrangements.  
The Group, including acquisitions,  
is considered a single cash-generating  
unit for impairment purposes. We are 
satisﬁed that the carrying values at  
31 December 2012 are fully justiﬁed  
by estimated future cash ﬂows. The 
accounting for our arrangements with 
Merck and our Amylin collaboration  
with BMS are fully explained in Note 9  
to the Financial Statements from page  
159. Further details of our acquisition  
of Ardea are included in Note 22 to the 
Financial Statements from page 173.
Further details of the estimates and 
assumptions we make in impairment  
testing of intangible assets are included  
in Note 9 to the Financial Statements. 
Litigation
In the normal course of business, contingent 
liabilities may arise from product-speciﬁc 
and general legal proceedings, from 
guarantees or from environmental liabilities 
connected with our current or former  
sites. Where we believe that potential 
liabilities have a less than 50% probability  
of crystallising, or where we are unable to  
make a reasonable estimate of the liability, 
we treat them as contingent liabilities.  
These are not provided for but are disclosed  
in Note 25 to the Financial Statements  
from page 183.
In cases that have been settled or 
adjudicated, or where quantiﬁable ﬁnes and 
penalties have been assessed and which 
are not subject to appeal (or other similar 
forms of relief), or where a loss is probable 
(more than 50% assessed probability) and 
we are able to make a reasonable estimate 
of the loss, we indicate the loss absorbed  
or the amount of the provision accrued.
Where it is considered that the Group  
is more likely than not to prevail, or in the 
rare circumstances where the amount  
of the legal liability cannot be estimated 
reliably, legal costs involved in defending  
the claim are charged to proﬁt as they  
are incurred. Where it is considered that  
the Group has a valid contract which 
provides the right to reimbursement  
(from insurance or otherwise) of legal  
costs and/or all or part of any loss incurred 
or for which a provision has been established 
and we consider recovery to be virtually 
certain, then the best estimate of the 
amount expected to be received is 
recognised as an asset.
Assessments as to whether or not to 
recognise provisions or assets and of the 
amounts concerned usually involve a series 
of complex judgements about future events 
and can rely heavily on estimates and 
assumptions. AstraZeneca believes that  
the provisions recorded are adequate  
based on currently available information  
and that the insurance recoveries recorded 
will be received. However, given the inherent 
uncertainties involved in assessing the 
outcomes of these cases and in estimating 
the amount of the potential losses and the 
associated insurance recoveries, we  
could in future periods incur judgments  
or insurance settlements that could have  
a material adverse effect on our results  
in any particular period.
The position could change over time, and 
there can, therefore, be no assurance that 
any losses that result from the outcome of 
any legal proceedings will not exceed the 
amount of the provisions that have been 
booked in the accounts.
Although there can be no assurance 
regarding the outcome of legal proceedings, 
we do not currently expect them to have  
a material adverse effect on our ﬁnancial 
position, but they could signiﬁcantly affect 
our ﬁnancial results in any particular period.
Post-retirement beneﬁts
We offer post-retirement beneﬁt plans  
which cover many of our employees around 
the world. In keeping with local terms and 
conditions, most of these plans are ‘deﬁned 
contribution’ in nature, where the resulting 
income statement charge is ﬁxed at a set 
level or is a set percentage of employees’ 
pay. However, several plans, mainly in the 
UK (which has by far the largest single 
scheme), the US and Sweden, are deﬁned 
beneﬁt plans where beneﬁts are based on 
employees’ length of service and ﬁnal salary 
(typically averaged over one, three or ﬁve 
years). The UK and US deﬁned beneﬁt 
schemes were closed to new entrants in 
2000. All new employees in these countries 
are offered deﬁned contribution schemes. 
In applying IAS 19, we recognise all actuarial 
gains and losses immediately through 
reserves. This methodology results in a less 
volatile income statement charge than under 
the alternative approach of recognising 
actuarial gains and losses over time. 
Investment decisions in respect of deﬁned 
beneﬁt schemes are based on underlying 
actuarial and economic circumstances with 
the intention of ensuring that the schemes 
have sufﬁcient assets to meet liabilities as 
they fall due, rather than meeting accounting 
requirements. The trustees follow a strategy 
of awarding mandates to specialist, active 
investment managers, which results in a 
broad diversiﬁcation of investment styles 
and asset classes. The investment 
approach is intended to produce less 
volatility in the plan asset returns.
In assessing the discount rate applied  
to the obligations, we have used rates  
on AA corporate bonds with durations 
corresponding to the maturities of those 
obligations, except in Sweden where  
we have used rates on mortgage bonds  
as the market in high quality corporate 
bonds is insufﬁciently deep.
In all cases, the pension costs recorded  
in the Financial Statements are assessed in 
accordance with the advice of independent 
qualiﬁed actuaries but require the exercise 
of signiﬁcant judgement in relation to 
assumptions for future salary and pension 
increases, long-term price inﬂation and 
investment returns.
As detailed in our Accounting Policies 
section of the Financial Statements on page 
146, the Group will adopt the amended IAS 
19 from 1 January 2013. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 103
Strategy Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Performance Overview
Taxation
Accruals for tax contingencies require 
management to make judgements and 
estimates in relation to tax audit issues  
and exposures. Amounts accrued are 
based on management’s interpretation  
of country-speciﬁc tax law and the  
likelihood of settlement. Tax beneﬁts  
are not recognised unless the tax positions 
are probable of being sustained. Once 
considered to be probable, management 
reviews each material tax beneﬁt to assess 
whether a provision should be taken against 
full recognition of the beneﬁt on the basis  
of potential settlement through negotiation 
and/or litigation. All such provisions are 
included in current liabilities. Any recorded 
exposure to interest on tax liabilities is 
provided for in the tax charge.
AstraZeneca faces a number of transfer 
pricing audits in jurisdictions around  
the world and, in some cases, is in  
dispute with the tax authorities. These 
disputes usually result in taxable proﬁts 
being increased in one territory and 
correspondingly decreased in another.  
Our balance sheet positions for these 
matters reﬂect appropriate corresponding 
relief in the territories affected.
Further details of the estimates and 
assumptions we make in determining our 
recorded liability for transfer pricing audits 
and other tax contingencies are included  
in the Tax section of Note 25 to the Financial 
Statements on page 189.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404
As a consequence of our NYSE listing, 
AstraZeneca is required to comply with 
those provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley  
Act applicable to foreign issuers. Section 
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires 
companies annually to assess and make 
public statements about the quality and 
effectiveness of their internal control over 
ﬁnancial reporting.
Our approach to the assessment has  
been to select key transaction and ﬁnancial 
reporting processes in our largest operating 
units and a number of specialist areas,  
such as ﬁnancial consolidation and reporting, 
treasury operations and taxation, so that,  
in aggregate, we have covered a signiﬁcant 
proportion of each of the key line items  
in our Financial Statements. Each of these 
operating units and specialist areas has 
ensured that its relevant processes and 
controls are documented to appropriate 
standards, taking into account, in particular, 
the guidance provided by the SEC. We  
have also reviewed the structure and 
operation of our ‘entity level’ control 
environment. This refers to the overarching 
control environment, including structure  
of reviews, checks and balances that  
are essential to the management of  
a well-controlled business.
The Directors have concluded that our 
internal control over ﬁnancial reporting is 
effective at 31 December 2012 and the 
assessment is set out in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities for, and Report on,  
Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
on page 140. KPMG Audit Plc has audited 
the effectiveness of our internal control  
over ﬁnancial reporting at 31 December 
2012 and, as noted in the Auditor’s Reports 
on the Financial Statements and on  
Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
(Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404)  
on page 141, their report is unqualiﬁed. Corporate Governance | The value of innovation
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 104
Our innovation takes many forms which offer signiﬁcant beneﬁts by adding value 
beyond the medicines themselves. 
For example, we are exploring new ways of increasing access to healthcare which take account of the different barriers  
to healthcare around the world and which are tailored locally to different patient needs. Our broad market strategy in China  
means we are expanding the affordability of our medicines to reach an increasing number of physicians and hospitals in communities 
outside of the most afﬂuent cities, which do not currently have regular access to healthcare and high quality medicines.
Innovation means
benefits beyond 
medical advances

Corporate Governance 
Report
Leif Johansson 
Chairman and Chairman of the Nomination  
and Governance Committee 
time for the Company. My thanks go to 
John and Simon for their work in this regard 
and for their support during the transition  
to a new CEO. Since his appointment, 
Pascal has also met numerous investors. 
He, Simon and I, supported by John Varley, 
will work hard to maintain these contacts 
and a constructive and frank dialogue with 
our shareholders.
My third priority has been the annual review 
of AstraZeneca’s strategy. Due to the timing 
of the CEO succession process, this has  
run over a longer period than usual to enable 
Pascal to form his conclusions about 
AstraZeneca’s strengths, weaknesses  
and the best strategy for its future success. 
From a corporate governance perspective, 
my aim has been to ensure that the review 
has been thorough; that a good, open and 
robust discussion about all aspects of the 
strategy has taken place at the Board  
table with management being challenged 
appropriately about their proposals and 
recommendations; and that all Board 
members have felt able to and have,  
in fact, contributed fully to that discussion.
Leif Johansson 
Chairman
This Corporte Governance Report 
describes how the Group is organised, 
including the overall structure and principal 
roles and responsibilities of the Board,  
its Committees and the SET.
Board composition, processes  
and responsibilities
The Board comprises two Executive 
Directors (the CEO and the CFO) and  
10 Non-Executive Directors. The 
membership of the Board at 31 January 
2013 and information about individual 
Directors is contained in the Board of 
Directors section on pages 106 and 107 .
All Directors are collectively responsible  
for the success of the Group. In addition,  
the Non-Executive Directors are responsible 
for exercising independent, objective 
judgement in respect of Board decisions 
and for scrutinising and challenging 
management. The Non-Executive Directors 
also have various responsibilities concerning 
the integrity of ﬁnancial information, internal 
controls and risk management.
Corporate governance
We have prepared this Annual Report with 
reference to the UK Corporate Governance 
Code published by the UK Financial 
Since joining the Board and becoming 
Chairman, I have focused on three main 
priorities. As Chairman of the Nomination 
and Governance Committee, my ﬁrst  
priority was to lead a thorough search for  
a new CEO, which started in April 2012.  
The section on page 117 describing the  
work of the Nomination and Governance 
Committee gives more information about 
this and how the Committee and the Board 
approach succession planning generally.  
I am delighted that we were able to  
recruit Pascal Soriot and appoint him as 
AstraZeneca’s new CEO with effect from  
1 October. Pascal stood out from a strong 
ﬁeld of candidates and has a number of 
attributes that made him the outstanding 
candidate. Succession planning remains  
the main focus of the Nomination and 
Governance Committee’s work.
Alongside the CEO search, I also spent  
a signiﬁcant amount of time following my 
appointment meeting shareholders in the 
UK, Sweden and the US and listening to 
their comments and views. I was supported 
in this by John Varley, who became senior 
independent Non-Executive Director in April 
2012, and Simon Lowth, CFO who acted  
as Interim CEO for four months at a critical

Strategy Performance Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Overview
The membership and work of these 
Committees is described below. In addition, 
there may from time to time be constituted 
ad hoc Board Committees for speciﬁc 
projects or tasks. In these cases, the scope 
and responsibilities of the Committee are 
documented. The Board provides adequate 
resources to enable each Committee to 
undertake its duties.
Reserved matters and delegation  
of authority
The Board maintains and periodically 
reviews a list of matters that are reserved  
to, and can only be approved by, the Board. 
These include: the appointment, termination 
and remuneration of any Director; approval 
of the annual budget; any item of ﬁxed 
capital expenditure or any proposal for the 
acquisition or disposal of an investment or 
business which exceeds $150 million; the 
raising of capital or loans by the Company 
(subject to certain exceptions); the giving of 
any guarantee in respect of any borrowing 
of the Company; and allotting shares of the 
Company. The matters that have not been 
expressly reserved to the Board are either 
delegated by the Board to its Committees 
or to the CEO.
The CEO is responsible to the Board  
for the management, development and 
performance of our business in relation to 
those matters in respect of which he has 
been delegated authority from the Board.
Although the CEO retains full responsibility 
for the authority delegated to him by the 
Board, he is responsible for establishing, 
and chairs, the SET, which is the vehicle 
through which he exercises certain of that 
authority in respect of our business.
The roles of the Board, the Board 
Committees, the Chairman and the  
CEO are documented, as are the Board’s 
delegated authorities and reserved powers.
Operation of the Board
The Board is responsible for setting our 
strategy and policies, oversight of risk and 
corporate governance, and also monitors 
progress towards meeting our objectives 
and annual plans. The Board discharges 
these responsibilities through a programme 
of meetings that includes regular reviews of 
ﬁnancial performance and critical business 
issues, and the formal annual strategy 
review day. The Board also aims to ensure 
that a good dialogue with our shareholders 
takes place and that their issues and 
concerns are understood and considered.
The Board held 14 meetings in 2012,  
which included sessions to cover its usual 
annual strategy review. Eight of those 
meetings were telephone meetings,  
some convened at short notice, at which 
Board changes and business development 
transactions were discussed and approved. 
All of the meetings held in person took  
place in London, UK. The Board is currently 
scheduled to meet six times in 2013,  
and will meet at such other times as  
may be required to conduct business.
As part of the business of each Board 
meeting, the CEO typically submits a 
progress report on each key business  
area, giving details of progress against the 
goals the Board has approved. To ensure  
that the Board has good visibility of the  
key operating decisions of the business, 
members of the SET routinely attend  
Board meetings on a rotational basis and 
Board members regularly meet other  
senior executives throughout the year.  
The Board also receives accounting and 
other management information about our 
resources, and presentations from internal 
and external speakers on legal, governance 
and regulatory developments. At the end  
of Board meetings, the Non-Executive 
Directors meet without the Executive 
Directors present to review and discuss any 
matters that have arisen during the meeting 
and/or such other matters as may appear  
to the Non-Executive Directors to be 
relevant in properly discharging their  
duty to act independently.
Board effectiveness
Composition of the Board,  
succession planning and diversity
The Nomination and Governance 
Committee and, where appropriate, the  
full Board regularly review the composition 
of the Board and the status of succession  
to both senior executive management  
and Board-level positions. Directors  
have regular contact with, and access to, 
succession candidates for senior executive 
management positions.
Reporting Council (FRC) in June 2010.  
This Corporate Governance Report 
(together with other sections of this Annual 
Report) describes how we apply the main 
principles of good governance in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. We have 
complied throughout the accounting period 
with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, which is available on  
the FRC’s website, frc.co.uk.
Leadership
The roles of Chairman and CEO are split. 
Leif Johansson, our Non-Executive 
Chairman, is responsible for leadership of 
the Board. Our CEO, Pascal Soriot, leads 
the SET and has executive responsibility for 
running our business. The Board comprises 
10 Non-Executive Directors, including the 
Chairman, and two Executive Directors 
– the CEO, Pascal Soriot, and the CFO,  
Simon Lowth.
All Directors are collectively responsible  
for our long-term success. In addition, the 
Non-Executive Directors are responsible  
for exercising independent, objective 
judgement in respect of Board decisions 
and for scrutinising and challenging the 
actions of executive management.
The Board runs an annual strategy review 
process. The CEO, the CFO and the SET 
take the lead in developing our strategy, 
which is then reviewed, constructively 
challenged and approved by the Board.
John Varley, who joined the Board as  
a Non-Executive Director in 2006, was 
appointed as our senior independent 
Non-Executive Director in April 2012.  
The role of the senior independent 
Non-Executive Director is to provide a 
sounding board for the Chairman and  
to serve as an intermediary for the other 
Directors when necessary. The senior 
independent Non-Executive Director is  
also available to shareholders if they have 
concerns that contact through the normal 
channels of Chairman or Executive Directors 
has failed to resolve, or for which such 
contact is inappropriate. 
There are four principal Board Committees: 
the Audit Committee; the Remuneration 
Committee; the Nomination and Governance 
Committee; and the Science Committee.  Corporate Governance | Corporate Governance Report
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 112
The Board aims to maintain a balance in 
terms of the range of experience and skills 
of individual Board members, which 
includes relevant international business, 
pharmaceutical industry and ﬁnancial 
experience, as well as appropriate scientiﬁc 
and regulatory knowledge. The biographies 
of Board members set out on pages 106  
and 107 give more information about 
current Directors in this respect. The  
Board views gender, nationality and  
cultural diversity among Board members  
as important considerations when reviewing 
the composition of the Board. The Board 
recognises, in particular, the importance  
of gender diversity. Currently, 30% of the 
Company’s Non-Executive Directors are 
women and they make up 25% of the full 
Board. Since the formation of AstraZeneca 
in 1999, the proportion of women Board 
members has been approximately 25%. 
Although it has not set any speciﬁc 
measurable objectives, the Board intends  
to continue with its current approach to 
diversity in all its aspects, while at the same 
time seeking Board members of the highest 
calibre and with the necessary experience 
and skills to meet the needs of the 
Company and its shareholders. Information 
about our approach to diversity in the 
organisation below Board-level can be 
found in the People section from page 43. 
The following changes to the composition  
of the Board have occurred during the 
period covered by this Annual Report:
 > Louis Schweitzer and David Brennan, 
formerly Chairman and CEO respectively, 
retired from the Board on 1 June.
 > Leif Johansson was elected as a 
Non-Executive Director at the AGM on  
26 April 2012 and appointed Chairman  
of the Board with effect from 1 June.  
He was appointed Chairman of the 
Nomination and Governance Committee 
and as a member of the Remuneration 
Committee with effect from 26 April 2012.
 > Pascal Soriot was appointed CEO with 
effect from 1 October.
 > Simon Lowth served as Interim CEO with 
effect from 1 June and remained in this 
role until Pascal Soriot’s appointment, 
following which he reverted to his position 
as CFO.
 > Michele Hooper retired from the Board  
at the end of the AGM on 26 April 2012.
 > John Varley was appointed as senior 
independent Non-Executive Director  
with effect from 26 April 2012.
 > Rudy Markham was appointed as 
Chairman of the Audit Committee and  
as a member of the Nomination and 
Governance Committee with effect from 
26 April 2012. He also remained in his  
role as a member of the Remuneration 
Committee.
 > Geneviève Berger was elected as a 
Non-Executive Director and appointed  
as a member of the Science Committee 
with effect from 26 April 2012.
 > Graham Chipchase was elected as a 
Non-Executive Director and appointed  
as a member of the Audit Committee  
with effect from 26 April 2012.
Independence of the  
Non-Executive Directors
During 2012, the Board considered the 
independence of each Non-Executive 
Director for the purposes of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the 
corporate governance listing standards  
of the NYSE (Listing Standards). With the 
exception of Marcus Wallenberg, the Board 
considers that all of the Non-Executive 
Directors are independent. Leif Johansson 
was considered by the Board to be 
independent upon his appointment as 
Chairman. In accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the test of 
independence is not appropriate in relation 
to the Chairman after his appointment.
Marcus Wallenberg was appointed  
as a Director of Astra in May 1989 and 
subsequently became a Director of the 
Company in 1999. He is a Non-Executive 
Director of Investor AB, which has a 4.13% 
interest in the issued share capital of the 
Company as at 31 January 2013. 
Wallenberg family foundations remain 
Investor AB’s largest shareholders in terms 
of votes controlled. For these reasons,  
the Board does not believe that Marcus 
Wallenberg can be determined independent 
under the UK Corporate Governance  
Code. However, the Board believes that  
he has brought, and continues to bring, 
considerable business experience and 
makes a valuable contribution to the work  
of the Board. In April 2010, he was 
appointed as a member of the Science 
Committee, reﬂecting his interest in 
innovation and R&D, knowledge of the 
Board Committee membership

history of the Company and its scientiﬁc 
heritage and culture, and his broad 
experience of other industries and 
businesses in which innovation and R&D  
are important determinants of success.
Conﬂicts of interest
The Articles enable the Directors to 
authorise any situation in which a Director 
has an interest that conﬂicts or has the 
potential to conﬂict with the Company’s 
interests and which would otherwise be a 
breach of the Director’s duty, under section 
175 of the Companies Act 2006. The Board 
has a formal system in place for Directors to 
declare such situations to be considered for 
authorisation by those Directors who have 
no interest in the matter being considered. 
In deciding whether to authorise a situation, 
the non-conﬂicted Directors must act in the 
way they consider, in good faith, would be 
most likely to promote the success of the 
Company, and they may impose limits or 
conditions when giving the authorisation, or 
subsequently, if they think this is appropriate. 
Situations considered by the Board and 
authorisations given are recorded in the 
Board minutes and in a register of conﬂicts 
maintained by the Company Secretary  
and are reviewed annually by the Board. 
The Board considers that this system 
continues to operate effectively.
Appointments to the Board
The Nomination and Governance 
Committee section on page 117 gives 
information about the appointment  
process for new Directors.
Newly appointed Directors are provided  
with comprehensive documentation 
containing information about the Group  
and their role as Non-Executive Directors. 
They also typically attend tailored induction 
programmes that take account of their 
individual skills and experience.
Time commitment
Our expectation is that Non-Executive 
Directors should be prepared to commit 
about 15 days per annum, as a minimum,  
to the Group’s business. In practice, Board 
members’ time commitment usually exceeds 
this minimum expectation when all the  
work that they undertake for the Group is 
considered, particularly in the case of the 
Chairman of the Board and the Chairmen  
of the Board Committees. As well as their 
work in relation to formal Board and Board 
Committee meetings, the Non-Executive 
Directors also commit time throughout the 
year to meetings and telephone calls with 
various levels of executive management, 
visits to AstraZeneca’s sites throughout the 
world and, for new Non-Executive Directors, 
induction sessions and site visits.
On occasions when a Director is 
unavoidably absent from a Board or Board 
Committee meeting, for example where  
a meeting clashes with his or her existing 
commitments, he or she still receives and 
reviews the papers for the meeting and 
typically provides verbal or written input 
ahead of the meeting, usually through the 
Chairman of the Board or the Chairman  
of the Board Committee, so that his or her 
views are made known and considered at 
the meeting. In addition, given the nature of 
the business to be conducted, some Board 
meetings are convened at short notice, 
which can make it difﬁcult for some Directors 
to attend due to prior commitments.
Information and support
The Company Secretary is responsible  
to the Chairman for ensuring that all  
Board and Board Committee meetings  
are properly conducted, that the Directors 
receive appropriate information prior to 
meetings to enable them to make an 
effective contribution, and that governance 
requirements are considered and 
implemented.
The Company maintained directors’ and 
ofﬁcers’ liability insurance cover throughout 
2012. The Directors are also able to obtain 
independent legal advice at the expense  
of the Company, as necessary, in their 
capacity as Directors.
The Company has entered into a deed of 
indemnity in favour of each Board member 
since 2006. These deeds of indemnity are 
still in force and provide that the Company 
shall indemnify the Directors to the fullest 
extent permitted by law and the Articles,  
in respect of all losses arising out of, or  
in connection with, the execution of their 
powers, duties and responsibilities, as 
Directors of the Company or any of its 
subsidiaries. This is in line with current 
market practice and helps us attract and 
retain high-quality, skilled Directors.

Performance evaluation
During the year, the Board conducted  
the annual evaluation of its own 
performance and that of its Committees  
and individual Directors.
The 2012 evaluation was conducted 
internally and involved a series of 
web-based questionnaires. A draft report 
based on responses from the questionnaires 
was prepared and reviewed by the 
Chairman and the Company Secretary.  
The ﬁnal report was circulated to the full 
Board and discussed at the Board meeting 
held in January 2013. The evaluation 
covered a range of topics, including: the 
composition of the Board; the effectiveness 
of its strategic oversight; Board members’ 
involvement in the affairs of the Company 
outside Board meetings; decision making 
and time management; the nature and 
quality of the information and general 
support provided to the Board; its approach 
to risk management and oversight of internal 
controls; and succession planning and  
how effectively the Board prioritises  
matters. Separate questionnaires covered 
the operation and effectiveness of the 
Board’s Committees, and relevant Board 
members (those serving in the period 
January to April 2012) also responded  
to a questionnaire dealing speciﬁcally  
with shareholder engagement.
The composition and dynamics of the 
Board were generally thought to be 
balanced and appropriate. Information  
ﬂows to the Board from the management 
team, and from Board Committees,  
were usually considered to be good and 
Board meetings were generally felt to  
be well-structured. The expanded role  
of the Science Committee reviewing the 
R&D aspects of a number of business 
development and acquisition proposals  
on behalf of the Board was seen as  
a positive development. However, a number 
of areas were identiﬁed for improvement.  
The importance of shareholder engagement 
and succession planning were highlighted  
by the performance evaluation. The Board’s 
visibility of major shareholders’ views will  
be improved. The engagement of the  
new Chairman and, more recently, the new 
CEO with the Company’s largest investors  
is contributing to this but, in addition, more 
structured and regular discussion on this 
topic and greater analyst/broker insight  
at Board-level will be implemented. In  
recent years, the Board’s overview of  
senior executive succession planning  
work has increased but needs to be further 
improved by the Board receiving more 
detailed information about the work of the 
Nomination and Governance Committee.
As part of the assessment process, each 
Director had an individual discussion with 
the Chairman to discuss their contribution  
to the work of the Board and personal 
development needs. Each Director 
continues to perform effectively and to 
demonstrate commitment to their role.
The Board’s annual performance evaluation 
was last externally facilitated in 2011.  
The Board intends to continue to comply 
with the UK Corporate Governance  
Code guidance that the evaluation should 
be externally facilitated at least every  
three years.
Re-election of Directors
In accordance with Article 66 of the  
Articles, all Directors retire at each AGM  
and may offer themselves for re-election  
by shareholders. Accordingly, all of the 
Directors will retire at the AGM in April 2013. 
The Notice of AGM will give details of those 
Directors seeking re-election.
Accountability
Risk management and internal control
The Non-Executive Directors have various 
responsibilities concerning the integrity of 
ﬁnancial information, internal controls and 
risk management.
The Board has overall responsibility  
for our system of internal controls and  
risk management policies and is also 
responsible for reviewing their effectiveness. 
During 2012, the Directors have continued 
to review the effectiveness of our system  
of controls, risk management and our 
high-level internal control processes. These 
reviews have included an assessment of 
internal controls, and in particular, ﬁnancial, 
operational and compliance controls and 
risk management and their effectiveness, 
supported by management assurance  
of the maintenance of controls reports  
from GIA, as well as the external auditor  
on matters identiﬁed in the course of  
its statutory audit work. The system is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable 
(not necessarily absolute) assurance of 
effective operation and compliance with 
laws and regulations.
Underpinning these reviews is an annual 
‘letter of assurance’ process by which 
responsible managers conﬁrm the 
adequacy of their systems of internal 
ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial controls, their 
compliance with Group policies and  
relevant laws and regulations (including  
the industry’s regulatory requirements),  
and that they have reported any control 
weaknesses through our ‘continuous 
assurance’ process.
The internal control framework has been  
in operation throughout 2012 and continues 
to operate up to the date of the approval  
of this Annual Report. The Directors believe  
that the Group maintains an effective, 
embedded system of internal controls  
and complies with the Turnbull Report 
guidance and, in the view of the Directors, 
no signiﬁcant deﬁciencies have been 
identiﬁed in the system.
Further information about the ways  
in which we manage our business risks  
is set out in the Risk section from page 74, 
which also contains a list of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that we face.
Remuneration
Information about our approach to 
remuneration and the role and work  
of the Remuneration Committee, including 
our policy on executive remuneration,  
is set out in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report from page 122.
Relations with shareholders
In our ﬁnancial and business reporting  
to shareholders and other interested parties 
by means of quarterly, half-yearly and annual 
reports, we aim to present a balanced and 
understandable assessment of our strategy, 
ﬁnancial position and prospects.
We make information about the Group 
available to shareholders through a range  
of media, including a fully integrated  
html corporate website, astrazeneca.com, 
containing a wide range of data of interest  
to institutional and private investors.  
We consider our website to be an  
important means of communication  
with our shareholders. 
The Company has been authorised  
by shareholders to place shareholder 
communications (such as the Notice  
of AGM and this Annual Report) on the 
corporate website in lieu of sending  
paper copies to shareholders (unless 
speciﬁcally requested by shareholders). 
While recognising and respecting the  
fact that some of our shareholders may 
have different preferences about how  
they receive information from us, we  
will continue to promote the beneﬁts  
of electronic communication given the 
advantages that this has over traditional 
paper-based communications, both in 
terms of the conﬁgurability and accessibility 
of the information provided and the 
consequent cost savings and reduction  
in environmental impact associated with 
reduced printing and distribution costs.
We have frequent discussions with 
institutional shareholders on a range  
of issues. These include individual meetings 
with some of our largest institutional 
shareholders to seek their views. Board  AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 115

members are kept informed of any  
issues and receive regular reports and 
presentations from executive management 
and our brokers in order to assist them  
to develop an understanding of major 
shareholders’ views about the Group.  
From time to time, we conduct an audit  
of institutional shareholders to ensure that 
we are communicating clearly with them 
and that a high-quality dialogue is being 
maintained. The results of this audit are 
reported to, and discussed by, the full Board.
We also respond to individual ad hoc 
requests for discussions from institutional 
shareholders and analysts. Our Investor 
Relations team acts as the main point of 
contact for investors throughout the year.  
As discussed above, the senior independent 
Non-Executive Director, John Varley, is  
also available to shareholders if they have 
concerns that contact through the normal 
channels of Chairman, CEO and/or CFO 
has failed to resolve, or in relation to  
which such contact is inappropriate.  
All shareholders, including private investors, 
have an opportunity at the AGM to put 
questions to members of the Board  
about our operation and performance. 
Formal notiﬁcation of the AGM is sent to 
shareholders at least one month in advance. 
The Chairmen of the Board Committees 
ordinarily attend the AGM to answer 
questions raised by shareholders. In line 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
details of proxy voting by shareholders, 
including votes withheld, are given at the 
AGM and are posted on our website 
following the AGM.
Audit Committee
The members of the Audit Committee are 
Rudy Markham (Chairman of the Audit 
Committee), Bruce Burlington, Graham 
Chipchase, Jean-Philippe Courtois and 
Shriti Vadera (and, until her retirement at  
the 2012 AGM, Michele Hooper). They are  
(or in the case of Michele Hooper, were)  
all Non-Executive Directors. The Board 
considers each member to be independent 
under the UK Corporate Governance  
Code and under the general guidance and 
speciﬁc criteria of the Listing Standards 
concerning the composition of audit 
committees applicable to non-US 
companies listed on the NYSE. In April 
2012, we submitted the required annual 
written afﬁrmation to the NYSE conﬁrming 
our full compliance with those standards. 
For the purposes of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Board remains 
satisﬁed that at least one member of the 
Audit Committee has recent and relevant 
ﬁnancial experience. At its meeting in 
December, the Board determined that  
Rudy Markham and Graham Chipchase  
are audit committee ﬁnancial experts for  
the purposes of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 
The Deputy Company Secretary acts  
as secretary to the Audit Committee.
The core terms of reference of the Audit 
Committee include, reviewing and reporting 
to the Board on:
 > matters relating to the audit plans  
of the external auditor and GIA as well  
as oversight of the work of the Global 
Compliance function
 > our overall framework for internal control 
over ﬁnancial reporting and for other 
internal controls and processes
 > our overall framework for risk 
management, particularly ﬁnancial risks
 > our accounting policies and practices
 > our annual and quarterly ﬁnancial 
reporting, including the critical estimates 
and judgements contained in our reporting 
 > our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting
 > our Code of Conduct and whistleblower 
procedures
 > compliance with the Corporate Integrity 
Agreement (CIA).
The Audit Committee is responsible for 
notifying the Board of any signiﬁcant 
concerns of the external auditor or the 
Vice-President, GIA arising from their  
audit work, any matters that may materially 
affect or impair the independence of the 
external auditor, any signiﬁcant deﬁciencies 
or material weaknesses in the design  
or operation of our internal control over 
ﬁnancial reporting or other internal controls, 
any serious issues of non-compliance  
and how the Audit Committee has 
discharged its responsibilities. It oversees 
the establishment, implementation and 
maintenance of our Code of Conduct  
and other related policies. It monitors the 
Company’s response to letters requesting 
information and investigations initiated by 
regulatory and governmental authorities 
such as the SEC and the US Department  
of Justice and the UK Financial Reporting 
Council pertaining to matters within  
the remit of the Audit Committee’s work.  
It has established procedures for the receipt 
and handling of complaints concerning 
accounting or audit matters. It recommends 
to the Board the appointment of the  
external auditor, subject to the approval of 
the Company’s shareholders at a general 
meeting. Shareholders in a general  
meeting authorise the Directors to ﬁx  
the remuneration of the external auditor.  
The Audit Committee reviews and approves  
the appointment and dismissal of the 
Vice-President, GIA.
The Audit Committee maintains policies and 
procedures for the pre-approval of all audit 
services and permitted non-audit services 
undertaken by the external auditor, the 
principal purpose of which is to ensure that 
the independence of the external auditor is 
not impaired. The policies and procedures 
cover three categories of work; audit 
services, audit-related services and tax 
services. The policies deﬁne the type  
of work that falls within each of these 
categories and the non-audit services  
that the external auditor is prohibited from 
performing under the rules of the SEC and 
other relevant UK and US professional and 
regulatory requirements. The pre-approval 
procedures permit certain audit, audit-
related and tax services to be performed  
by the external auditor during the year, 
subject to fee limits agreed with the Audit 
Committee in advance. The CFO (supported 
by the Vice-President, Group Finance) 
monitors the status of all services being 
provided by the external auditor. The 
procedures also deal with placing non-audit 
work out for tender, where appropriate. 
Authority to approve work in excess of the 
pre-agreed fee limits is delegated to the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee together 
with one other Audit Committee member  
in the ﬁrst instance. A standing agenda item 
at Audit Committee meetings covers the 
operation of the pre-approval procedures 
and regular reports are provided to the full 
Audit Committee. Fees paid to the auditor 
for audit, audit-related and other services 
are analysed in Note 27 to the Financial 
Statements on page 190.
The Audit Committee held seven scheduled 
meetings in 2012. The individual attendance 
record of members of the Audit Committee 
is set out in the Board and Board Committee 
meeting attendance in 2012 table on page 
1 13. Following each Audit Committee meeting, 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee reported 
to the Board on the principal matters covered 
at the meeting and minutes of the meetings 
were circulated to all Board members.  
In addition, the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee held regular scheduled calls 
between Audit Committee meetings with 
each of the Vice-President, GIA, the Chief 
Compliance Ofﬁcer, the CFO and the lead 
partner of the external auditor.
During 2012 and January 2013, the Audit 
Committee considered and discussed the 
following matters:
 > The key elements of the ﬁnancial 
statements, and estimates and 
judgements contained in our ﬁnancial 
disclosures, which were reviewed and 
various accounting matters considered. 
These included the areas described  
in the Financial Review under the  
heading ‘Critical Accounting Policies  
and Estimates’ (with a focus on 
accounting issues relevant to litigation 
and taxation matters and goodwill 
impairment) from page 99 and discussion 
was supported by papers prepared by 
management and the external auditor.  Corporate Governance | Corporate Governance Report
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 116
 > The reports received from the external 
auditor concerning its audit of the 
Financial Statements of the Group  
and from management, GIA, Global 
Compliance and the external auditor on 
the effectiveness of our system of internal 
controls and, in particular, our internal 
control over ﬁnancial reporting. This 
included review and discussion of the 
results of the ‘continuous assurance’  
and annual ‘letter of assurance’ 
processes. The Audit Committee also 
reviewed quarterly activity reports of  
audit work carried out by GIA and the 
status of follow-up actions with 
management as well as reports  
from the Global Compliance function.
 > The systems and processes that 
management has developed pertaining  
to risk identiﬁcation, classiﬁcation  
and mitigation.
 > Compliance with the applicable provisions 
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In particular, 
the Audit Committee regularly reviewed 
the status of compliance with the 
programme of internal controls over 
ﬁnancial reporting implemented pursuant 
to section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley  
Act. The Audit Committee remained 
focused on IS/IT controls in the context  
of the changes to the Group’s IS/IT 
environment, described below. Further 
information about this is set out in the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404 section 
on page 103. 
 > Data about reports made by employees 
via the AZethics helpline, online facilities 
and other routes regarding potential 
breaches of the Code of Conduct 
together with the results of inquiries  
into these matters.
 > Quarterly reports received from the  
US Compliance Ofﬁcer responsible for 
monitoring the US business’ compliance 
with the CIA (for more information about 
the obligations imposed on the Board  
by the CIA, see below).
 > Regular progress updates from IS/IT  
on the status of the transition from the 
existing outsource provider to the new 
providers.
 > Reports from the Group Treasury function 
and, in particular, reports concerning  
the Group’s liquidity and cash position 
and the appropriateness of its cash 
management policies in the context  
of the current economic situation.
 > Going concern assessment and adoption 
of the going concern basis in preparing 
this Annual Report and the Financial 
Statements.
 > Other reports concerning the GIA,  
Global Compliance and Finance 
functions, including the internal audit  
plan and progress and plans of the  
Global Compliance function.
 > Reports from the General Counsel  
on the status of certain litigation matters 
and governmental investigations.
 > The amount of audit and non-audit fees  
of the external auditor throughout 2012. 
The Audit Committee was satisﬁed 
throughout the year that the objectivity 
and independence of the external auditor 
were not in any way impaired by the 
nature of the non-audit work undertaken 
by the external auditor during the year, the 
level of non-audit fees charged for such 
work or any other facts or circumstances. 
Further information about the audit and 
non-audit fees for 2012 is disclosed in 
Note 27 to the Financial Statements on 
page 190.
 > The rotation of the lead partner of the 
external auditor. In advance of the expiry 
of the permitted tenure of the lead audit 
partner, Jimmy Daboo, at the conclusion 
of the 2012 audit, the Audit Committee 
oversaw a process whereby a number  
of potential successors were considered 
and Tony Cates was endorsed as  
his successor. The Audit Committee  
also considered the external auditor’s 
proposed arrangements to ensure an 
effective handover of responsibilities.
 > A review and assessment of the  
Audit Committee’s performance  
which concluded that such performance 
was satisfactory.
In line with its normal practice, the Audit 
Committee also held a number of private 
meetings, without management present, 
with the Vice-President, GIA, the Chief 
Compliance Ofﬁcer, the General Counsel 
and the Company’s external auditor.  
These meetings were held between Audit 
Committee members and those individuals, 
separately from the main sessions of the 
Audit Committee, which were also attended 
by the CEO, the CFO, the General Counsel 
and the Vice-President, Group Finance.
In addition to its usual business as 
described above, during 2012, members  
of the Audit Committee met individual 
managers or groups of managers on  
a number of occasions in order to gain  
a deeper insight into areas relevant to the 
Audit Committee’s work and to provide  
an opportunity to discuss speciﬁc areas  
of interest. These included: 
 > Considering the potential impact of  
the eurozone crisis on AstraZeneca’s 
operations, in particular in Greece,  
Italy and Spain. 
 > Hearing from the regional ﬁnance 
directors of the Americas, Asia Paciﬁc 
and EMEA regions on the ﬁnancial 
objectives, the local challenges and 
organisational structures in their 
respective regions and learning  
how the Group Finance organisation 
supports AstraZeneca’s network  
of local marketing companies. 
 > Learning about AstraZeneca’s business 
processing outsourcing centre of 
excellence and the work it does to 
support the various outsourcing initiatives 
currently ongoing in the business  
as we seek to reduce our cost base. 
 > Receiving regular updates from the IS/IT 
team in connection with the transition 
from the Company’s previous IT 
infrastructure outsourcing provider  
to its new providers. 
 > Considering a presentation on the lessons 
learnt from the implementation of an 
enterprise resource planning IT system  
at our plant in Sweden which led to 
disruptions in our supply chain during 
the year. 
 > Meeting with the Global Compliance 
Leadership Team which comprises 
representatives from the second line 
assurance functions in R&D, Operations, 
and Sales and Marketing. 
 > Considering the risks associated with  
the Group’s pension and other beneﬁt 
obligations and the steps taken to 
manage those risks.
 > Monitoring the operation of controls and 
reporting arrangements, cognisant of the 
additional pressures on management 
during the tenure of the Interim CFO.
In addition to the quarterly reporting 
stipulated by the CIA as described above,  
a number of other obligations required by 
the CIA were discharged by members of  
the Board and the Audit Committee during 
2012. For example, all members of the 
Board completed the annual CIA-required 
training, addressing the Code of Conduct 
and the elements of the CIA and the US 
compliance programme. Furthermore,  
the Board adopted a resolution (signed by 
each member) in respect of the second  
12 month reporting period under the CIA. 
The resolution summarised the Board’s 
oversight of the US compliance programme 
and stated that, to the best of the Board’s 
knowledge, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, 
LP and AstraZeneca LP (AstraZeneca’s 
principal US trading entities) have 
implemented an effective US compliance 
programme to meet Federal healthcare 
programme, FDA and CIA requirements. 
In accordance with its normal practice,  
the Audit Committee considered the 
performance of our external auditor KPMG 
Audit Plc (KPMG). It also considered 
KPMG’s compliance with the independence 
criteria under the relevant statutory, 
regulatory and ethical standards applicable 
to auditors and assessed its objectivity, 
taking into account the level of challenge 
provided around the critical estimates  
and judgements involved in our ﬁnancial  AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 117
Strategy Performance Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Overview
reporting and the quality of our internal 
control over ﬁnancial reporting. Having 
considered all these factors, the Audit 
Committee unanimously recommended  
to the Board that a resolution for the 
re-appointment of KPMG as the Company’s 
external auditor for the year ending  
31 December 2013, be proposed to 
shareholders at the AGM in April 2013. 
Consistent with current market practice, 
KPMG’s services to the Company are 
provided pursuant to terms of engagement 
which are reviewed by the Audit Committee. 
Neither these terms of engagement nor any 
other agreement include any contractual 
obligations under which the Directors would 
be prevented from appointing a different 
audit ﬁrm were they to consider this to  
be in the best interests of the Group. The 
Audit Committee, through management, 
continues to maintain contact and dialogue 
with other major audit ﬁrms who are familiar 
with the Group’s business for succession 
purposes as required. This is reported to  
the Audit Committee in order to ensure a 
smooth transition from the current auditor, 
should this be necessary. In December 
2012, the Audit Committee reviewed the 
changes to the UK Corporate Governance 
Code with regard to putting the external 
audit contract out to tender at least every  
10 years. It noted that KPMG was ﬁrst 
appointed as sole external auditor to 
AstraZeneca in 2001 following a competitive 
tender. The Audit Committee concluded 
that, as the lead audit partner at KPMG  
is rotating in 2013, then in accordance  
with the transitional guidance issued by  
the FRC, the audit would be put out to 
tender by 2018. 
At the January 2013 meeting, the CFO 
presented to the Audit Committee the 
conclusions of the CEO and the CFO 
following the evaluation of the effectiveness 
of our disclosure controls and procedures 
required by Item 15(a) of Form 20-F at  
31 December 2012. Based on their evaluation, 
the CEO and the CFO concluded that, as  
at that date, we maintain an effective system 
of disclosure controls and procedures.
There was no change in our internal control 
over ﬁnancial reporting that occurred during 
the period covered by this Annual Report 
that has materially affected, or is reasonably 
likely to materially affect, our internal control 
over ﬁnancial reporting.
The Audit Committee is currently scheduled 
to meet six times in 2013 and will meet at 
such other times as may be required.
The Audit Committee’s terms of  
reference are available on our website, 
astrazeneca.com.
Code of Conduct 
Our Code of Conduct (the Code), which is 
available on our website, astrazeneca.com, 
applies worldwide to all full-time and 
part-time AstraZeneca Directors, ofﬁcers, 
employees and temporary staff. Further 
information relating to the Code can  
be found in the Compliance section  
on page 47 . 
A Group Finance Code of Conduct 
complements the Code. It applies to  
the CEO, the CFO, the Group’s principal 
accounting ofﬁcers (including key Finance 
staff in major overseas subsidiaries) and  
all Finance function employees. This 
reinforces the importance of the integrity  
of the Group’s Financial Statements, the 
reliability of the accounting records on  
which they are based and the robustness  
of the relevant controls and processes.
Remuneration Committee
The principal role of the Remuneration 
Committee is to consider and set, on  
behalf of the Board, the remuneration 
(including pension rights and compensation 
payments) of Executive Directors and other 
senior executives. It also considers and  
sets the remuneration of the Chairman,  
in conjunction with the senior independent 
Non-Executive Director and in the absence 
of the Chairman. No Director is involved  
in deciding his or her own remuneration. 
More information is set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report from page 122.
Nomination and Governance 
Committee
The Nomination and Governance 
Committee’s role is to recommend to the 
Board any new Board appointments and  
to consider, more broadly, succession  
plans at Board level. It continually reviews 
the composition of the Board using a matrix 
that records the skills and experience of 
current Board members and comparing  
this with the desired skills and experience it 
believes are appropriate to the Company’s 
overall business and strategic needs both 
now and in the future. Any decisions relating 
to the appointment of Directors are made  
by the entire Board based on the merits of 
the candidates and the relevance of their 
background and experience, measured 
against objective criteria, with care taken  
to ensure that appointees have enough  
time to devote to our business. 
The Nomination and Governance 
Committee also advises the Board 
periodically on signiﬁcant developments  
in corporate governance and the 
Company’s compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
During 2012, the members of the 
Nomination and Governance Committee 
were Louis Schweitzer (Chairman of the 
Committee until 26 April 2012 and member 
until his retirement on 1 June), Leif Johansson 
(member and Chairman of the Committee 
from 26 April 2012), John Varley, Rudy 
Markham (from 26 April 2012) and Michele 
Hooper (until her retirement on 26 April 
2012). Each of them is (and in the case  
of each of Louis Schweitzer and Michele 
Hooper, was) a Non-Executive Director  
and considered independent by the Board.  
Each of Louis Schweitzer and Leif 
Johansson was considered by the Board  
to be independent upon his appointment  
as Chairman; in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the test of 
independence is not appropriate in relation 
to the Chairman after his appointment. The 
Company Secretary acts as secretary to the 
Nomination and Governance Committee.
The Nomination and Governance 
Committee considers both planned and 
unplanned (unanticipated) succession 
scenarios. It was anticipated that Louis 
Schweitzer would retire from the Board in 
2012 and, consequently, a thorough search 
for a new Chairman was started at the 
beginning of 2011. Although Mr Schweitzer 
retired a few months earlier than originally 
envisaged, succession plans were 
well-advanced and our new Chairman,  
Leif Johansson, joined the Board in April 
2012 and became Chairman in June. In the 
fourth quarter of 2010, in anticipation of the 
likelihood of David Brennan retiring within 
the next two years, the Nomination and 
Governance Committee engaged the 
search ﬁrm Spencer Stuart to carry out  
a desktop exercise to identify potential 
external candidates for this position. This 
work, combined with a good overview of 
potential internal candidates as a result of 
the Board’s normal work with and exposure 
to senior executives, put the Nomination 
and Governance Committee in a position  
to react quickly to Mr Brennan’s decision 
in 2012 that he wished to retire. A strong 
slate of internal and external candidates was 
identiﬁed, who were thoroughly assessed 
over the summer of 2012, leading to the 
appointment of Pascal Soriot as CEO with 
effect from 1 October.
The Nomination and Governance 
Committee met six times in 2012. Much  
of its work during the year naturally focused  
on the recruitment of Mr Soriot. The 
Committee engaged Spencer Stuart  
to assist it with the assignment.  Corporate Governance | Corporate Governance Report
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 118
The ad hoc Board Committee formed  
for the purpose of appointing a new 
Chairman of the Board also completed  
its work during 2012 and the appointment  
of Leif Johansson was announced by the 
Company on 1 March 2012. He was elected 
as a Director at the AGM on 26 April 2012 
and became Chairman with effect from  
1 June. This work was led by Michele 
Hooper in her capacity as senior independent 
Non-Executive Director and the search ﬁrm, 
MWM Consulting, was engaged to assist 
with the assignment. 
The Nomination and Governance 
Committee also recommended to the  
Board the appointments of Geneviève 
Berger and Graham Chipchase during  
the year as part of routine Board succession 
planning. Professor Berger and Mr 
Chipchase were elected to the Board  
on 26 April 2012 and became members  
of the Science Committee and the Audit 
Committee, respectively, from the same  
date. Professor Berger strengthens the 
Board’s scientiﬁc and R&D knowledge  
and experience. Mr Chipchase adds  
to the Board’s international business 
leadership. The Nomination and Governance 
Committee engaged MWM Consulting and 
The Zygos Partnership to assist it with the 
assignments to appoint Professor Berger 
and Mr Chipchase respectively. 
Neither MWM Consulting nor The Zygos 
Partnership has any other connection  
to the Company. Spencer Stuart undertakes 
executive search assignments for the 
Company periodically.
The individual attendance record of the 
Nomination and Governance Committee’s 
members is set out on page 113. During  
the year, the Nomination and Governance 
Committee also reviewed the composition 
of Board Committees in the light of the 
Board changes described above and 
recommended to the Board appropriate 
changes, which are described in this  
Annual Report.
The Nomination and Governance 
Committee’s terms of reference are 
available on our website, astrazeneca.com.
Science Committee
The Science Committee’s core role 
continues to be to provide assurance  
to the Board regarding the quality, 
competitiveness and integrity of the Group’s 
R&D activities by way of: meetings and 
dialogue with our R&D leaders and other 
scientist employees; visits to our R&D sites 
throughout the world; and review and 
assessment of the: 
 > approaches we adopt in respect of our 
chosen Therapy Areas 
 > scientiﬁc technology and R&D capabilities 
deployed 
 > decision making processes for R&D 
projects and programmes
 > quality of our scientists, career 
opportunities and talent development
 > benchmarking against industry and 
scientiﬁc best practice, where 
appropriate.
The Science Committee also reviews,  
from time to time, important bioethical 
issues that we face, and assists in the 
formulation of, and agrees on behalf  
of the Board, appropriate policies in relation 
to such issues. It may also consider,  
from time to time, future trends in medical 
science and technology. The Science 
Committee does not review individual R&D 
projects. However, during 2012 the Science 
Committee did review on behalf of the 
Board the R&D aspects of a number  
of speciﬁc business development or 
acquisition proposals and advised the 
Board on its conclusions.
During 2012, the members of the Science 
Committee, all of whom have a knowledge 
of, or an interest in, life sciences, were 
Nancy Rothwell (Chairman of the Science 
Committee), Bruce Burlington, Marcus 
Wallenberg and Geneviève Berger (from  
26 April 2012). The President, Global R&D; 
the Executive Vice-President, Innovative 
Medicines; the Executive Vice-President, 
MedImmune; and the Executive Vice-
President, Global Medicines Development 
attended meetings of the Science 
Committee in 2012. The Vice-President, 
Strategy, Portfolio & Performance, R&D  
also attended all meetings and acted as 
secretary to the Science Committee.
The Science Committee met twice in 
person in 2012, in Cambridge and London, 
UK and held ﬁve meetings by telephone  
to review speciﬁc business development  
or acquisition proposals. 
The Science Committee’s terms of 
reference are available on our website, 
astrazeneca.com.
US corporate governance 
requirements
Our ADSs are traded on the NYSE  
and, accordingly, we are subject to the 
reporting and other requirements of the 
SEC applicable to foreign private issuers. 
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
requires companies to include in their 
annual report on Form 20-F ﬁled with the 
SEC a report by management stating its 
responsibility for establishing internal control 
over ﬁnancial reporting and to assess 
annually the effectiveness of such internal 
control. We have complied with those 
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
applicable to foreign private issuers.  
The Board continues to believe that the 
Group has a sound corporate governance 
framework, good processes for the accurate 
and timely reporting of its ﬁnancial position 
and results of operations, and an effective 
and robust system of internal controls. We 
have established a Disclosure Committee,  
further details of which can be found in  
the Disclosure Committee section on the 
page opposite.
The Directors’ assessment of the 
effectiveness of the internal control over 
ﬁnancial reporting is set out in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities for, and Report on, Internal 
Control over Financial Reporting section  
in the Financial Statements on page 140.
We are required to disclose any signiﬁcant 
ways in which our corporate governance 
practices differ from those followed by US 
companies under the Listing Standards.  
In addition, we must comply fully with the 
provisions of the Listing Standards relating 
to the composition, responsibilities and 
operation of audit committees, applicable  
to foreign private issuers. These provisions 
incorporate the rules concerning audit 
committees implemented by the SEC under 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have reviewed 
the corporate governance practices 
required to be followed by US companies 
under the Listing Standards and our 
corporate governance practices are 
generally consistent with those standards.
Business organisation
Senior Executive Team
The CEO is responsible for establishing, and 
chairs, the SET. The SET normally meets 
once a month to consider and decide major 
business issues, or as otherwise required  
by business needs. Typically, it also reviews,

Strategy Performance Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Overview
Portfolio Investment Board (PIB)
The CEO is responsible for establishing,  
and chairs, the PIB, a senior-level, 
cross-functional governance body, which 
seeks to maximise the value of our internal 
and external R&D investments through 
robust, transparent and well-informed 
decisions that drive business performance 
and accountability. 
Speciﬁcally, the PIB has responsibility for: 
 > Reviewing the R&D portfolio, by 
conducting an objective and transparent 
review of R&D performance, product 
launch proﬁle and alignment with 
corporate strategy. The review is also  
an important step in reconﬁrming the  
R&D three year budget. 
 > Approving the business plans of the 
Innovative Medicines groups and the  
Global Medicines Development demand 
forecast, by conﬁrming the allocation  
of resources across early-stage and  
late-stage elements of R&D as well  
as assessing licensing and acquisition 
opportunities. 
 > Approving late-stage (internal and 
external) investment decisions.
 > Monitoring environmental events that 
could have a major transformational  
or disruptive impact on our business.
In addition to the CEO, the PIB’s members 
in 2012 were: the CFO; the President, Global 
R&D; the Executive Vice-President, Global 
Commercial Operations; the Executive 
Vice-President, Innovative Medicines;  
the Executive Vice-President, MedImmune;  
the Executive Vice-President, Global

permanent secretary and typically meets  
at around the time of the monthly SET 
meetings, or as otherwise required by 
business needs.
Disclosure Committee
Our disclosure policy provides a framework 
for the handling and disclosure of inside 
information and other information of interest 
to shareholders and the investment 
community. It also deﬁnes the role of the 
Disclosure Committee. The members of  
the Disclosure Committee in 2012 were:  
the CEO; the CFO, who chaired the 
Disclosure Committee; the President,  
Global R&D; the General Counsel; the 
Vice-President, Corporate Affairs; the 
Vice-President, Investor Relations; and  
the Vice-President, Group Finance.  
The Deputy Company Secretary acted  
as secretary to this Committee. The 
Disclosure Committee meets regularly  
to assist and inform the decisions of the 
CEO concerning inside information and 
its disclosure. Periodically, it reviews our 
disclosure controls and procedures and  
its own operation as part of work carried  
out to enable management and the Board 
to assure themselves that appropriate 
processes are operating for our planned 
disclosures, such as our quarterly results 
announcements and scheduled investor 
relations events.
Disclosure of information to auditors 
The Directors who held ofﬁce at the date  
of approval of this Annual Report conﬁrm 
that, so far as they are each aware, there  
is no relevant audit information of which  
the Company’s auditors are unaware; and 
each Director has taken all the steps that  
he or she ought to have taken as a Director 
to make himself or herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditors are aware  
of that information.
Compliance and Group Internal Audit 
The role of the Global Compliance function 
is to manage and maintain the compliance 
programme infrastructure and to help 
embed a culture of ethics and integrity  
in the Group. Global Compliance works 
closely with GIA, with whom it provides 
assurance reporting to the Audit Committee. 
During 2013, the Global Compliance 
function will continue to focus on ensuring 
the delivery of an aligned approach to 
compliance that addresses key risk areas 
across the business. Further information 
can be found in the Compliance section 
from page 47 .
Global Compliance provides direct 
assurance to the Audit Committee on 
matters concerning compliance issues, 
including the results of monitoring and 
auditing conducted by Global Compliance 
and an analysis of compliance breaches. 
Complementing this, GIA carries out a 
range of audits that include compliance-
related audits and reviews of the assurance 
activities of other Group assurance 
functions. The results from these activities 
are reported to the Audit Committee.
GIA is an independent appraisal function 
that derives its authority from the Board 
through the Audit Committee. Its primary 
role is to provide reasonable and objective 
assurance to the Directors regarding the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the  
Group’s risk management and control 
framework and the internal controls over  
key business risks, including ﬁnancial 
controls and compliance with laws, 
regulations and policies.
GIA seeks to discharge the responsibilities 
set down in its charter by reviewing:
 > the processes for ensuring that key 
business risks are effectively managed
 > the ﬁnancial and operational controls  
that help to ensure the Group’s assets  
are properly safeguarded from losses, 
including fraud
 > the controls that help to ensure the 
reliability and integrity of management 
information systems
 > the processes for ensuring compliance 
with policies and procedures, external 
legislation and regulation.
In addition to fulﬁlling its primary remit of 
assurance to the Audit Committee, GIA acts 
as a source of constructive advice and best 
practice, assisting senior management to 
improve governance, control, compliance 
and risk management.

Distributions to shareholders and 
dividends for 2012
Our distribution policy comprises both  
a regular cash dividend and a share 
repurchase component, further details  
of which are set out in the Financial Review 
on page 94 and Notes 20 and 21 to the 
Financial Statements on page 173. 
The Company’s dividends for 2012 of  
$2.80 (178.6 pence, SEK 18.34) per 
Ordinary Share amount to, in aggregate,  
a total dividend payment to shareholders  
of $3,665 million. Two of our employee 
share trusts, AstraZeneca Share Trust 
Limited and AstraZeneca Quest Limited, 
waived their right to a dividend on the 
Ordinary Shares that they hold and  
instead received a nominal dividend.
A shareholders’ resolution was passed at 
the 2012 AGM authorising the Company  
to purchase its own shares. Pursuant  
to this resolution, the Company repurchased 
(and subsequently cancelled) 57 .8 million 
Ordinary Shares with a nominal value  
of $0.25 each, at an aggregate cost of 
$2,635 million, representing 4.6% of the 
closing total issued share capital of the 
Company. The Company suspended its 
share repurchase programme on 1 October 
as a prudent step to maintain ﬂexibility  
while the Board and the newly-appointed 
CEO completed the Company’s annual 
strategy update.
During our share repurchase programmes 
that operated between 1999 and 
September 2012, a total of 615.2 million 
Ordinary Shares were repurchased, and 
subsequently cancelled, at an average price 
of 2777 pence per share for a consideration, 
including expenses, of $29,352 million.
Going concern accounting basis 
Information on the business environment 
AstraZeneca operates in, including the 
factors underpinning the industry’s future 
growth prospects, is included in the 
Directors’ Report. Details of the product 
portfolio of the Group (including patent 
expiry dates for key marketed products),  
our approach to product development and 
our development pipeline are covered  
in detail with additional information by  
Therapy Area in the Directors’ Report.
The ﬁnancial position of the Group, its  
cash ﬂows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the Financial 
Review from page 86. In addition, Note 23  
to the Financial Statements from page 175 
includes the Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital,  
its ﬁnancial risk management objectives, 
details of its ﬁnancial instruments and 
hedging activities and its exposures to 
credit, market and liquidity risk. Further 
details of the Group’s cash balances  
and borrowings are included in Notes 13  
and 14 to the Financial Statements from 
page 164.
The Group has considerable ﬁnancial 
resources available. As at 31 December 
2012, the Group had $9.8 billion in ﬁnancial 
resources (cash balances of $7 .7 billion  
and undrawn committed bank facilities of  
$3 billion which are available until April 2017 , 
with only $0.9 billion of debt due within  
one year). The Group’s revenues are largely 
derived from sales of products which  
are covered by patents which provide  
a relatively high level of resilience and 
predictability to cash inﬂows, although  
our revenue is expected to continue  
to be signiﬁcantly impacted by the expiry  
of patents over the medium term.  
In addition, recent government price 
interventions in response to budgetary 
constraints are expected to continue to 
adversely affect revenues in many of our 
mature markets. However, we anticipate new 
revenue streams from both recently launched 
medicines and products in development,  
and the Group has a wide diversity of 
customers and suppliers across different 
geographic areas. Consequently, the 
Directors believe that, overall, the Group  
is well placed to manage its business  
risks successfully despite the current 
uncertain economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the Directors  
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the  
Annual Report and Financial Statements.
Changes in share capital 
Changes in the Company’s Ordinary  
Share capital during 2012, including details 
of the allotment of new shares under  
the Company’s share plans, are given in 
Note 20 to the Financial Statements from 
page 172.
Directors’ shareholdings 
The Articles require each Director to be  
the beneﬁcial owner of Ordinary Shares  
in the Company with an aggregate nominal 
value of $125 (which currently represents at 
least 500 shares because each Ordinary 
Share has a nominal value of $0.25). Such 
holding must be obtained within two months 
of the date of the Director’s appointment.  
At 31 December 2012, all of the Directors 
complied with this requirement and full 
details of each Director’s interests in shares 
of the Company are set out in the Directors’ 
interests in shares section from page  
134. Information about the shareholding 
expectations of the Remuneration 
Committee (in respect of Executive 
Directors and SET members) and the  
Board (in respect of Non-Executive 
Directors) is also set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report from page 122.
Political donations 
Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries 
made any EU political donations or incurred 
any EU political expenditure in 2012 and 
they do not intend to do so in the future  
in respect of which shareholder authority  
is required, or for which disclosure in  
this Annual Report is required, under  
the Companies Act 2006. However, to 
enable the Company and its subsidiaries  
to continue to support interest groups  
or lobbying organisations concerned  
with the review of government policy or  
law reform without inadvertently breaching 
the Companies Act 2006, which deﬁnes 
political donations and other political 
expenditure in broad terms, a resolution  
will be put to shareholders at the 2013 
AGM, similar to that passed at the 2012  AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 121
Strategy Performance Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Overview
AGM, to authorise the Company and its 
subsidiaries to: 
 > make donations to political parties  
or independent election candidates
 > make donations to political organisations 
other than political parties
 > incur political expenditure, up to an 
aggregate limit of $250,000.
Corporate political contributions in the  
US are permitted in deﬁned circumstances 
under the First Amendment of the US 
Constitution and are subject to both federal 
and state laws and regulations. In 2012, the 
Group’s US legal entities made contributions 
amounting in aggregate to $1,759,450  
(2011: $1,099,450) to national political 
organisations, state-level political party 
committees and to campaign committees 
of various state candidates. No corporate 
donations were made at the federal level 
and all contributions were made only where 
allowed by US federal and state law. We 
publicly disclose details of our corporate  
US political contributions, which can be 
found at astrazeneca-us.com/responsibility/
transparency/ . The annual corporate 
contributions budget is reviewed and 
approved by the US General Counsel, the 
US Vice-President, Corporate Affairs and 
the President of our US business to ensure 
robust governance and oversight. US 
citizens or individuals holding valid green 
cards exercised decision making over  
the contributions and the funds were not 
provided or reimbursed by any non-US legal 
entity. Such contributions do not constitute 
political donations or political expenditure for 
the purposes of the Companies Act 2006 
and were made without any involvement  
of persons or entities outside the US. 
Signiﬁcant agreements
There are no signiﬁcant agreements to 
which the Company is a party that take 
effect, alter or terminate on a change of 
control of the Company following a takeover 
bid. There are no persons with whom we 
have contractual or other arrangements, 
who are deemed by the Directors to be 
essential to our business.
Use of ﬁnancial instruments 
The Notes to the Financial Statements, 
including Note 23 (from page 175),  
include further information on our  
use of ﬁnancial instruments.
Creditor payment policy 
Our policy is to agree appropriate payment 
terms with all suppliers when agreeing  
to the terms of each transaction, to ensure  
that those suppliers are made aware  
of the terms of payment and, subject  
to their compliance, to abide by the terms  
of payment. A considerable part of the  
trade creditors’ balance continues to relate  
to the Merck account in the US, which has 
particularly long contractual payment terms. 
On 26 June 2012, AstraZeneca and Merck 
agreed to amend certain provisions of their 
ongoing Agreements with respect to the 
Second Option, as detailed in Note 9 to  
the Financial Statements from page 161. 
Our trade creditors’ balance excluding 
payments to Merck and other items not 
directly related to trade purchases in the  
US is our most accurate calculation of 
balances owed by the Company’s 
subsidiaries to trade creditors at the  
balance sheet date. This was equivalent  
to 56 days’ average purchases (2011:  
43 days; 2010: 57 days). Historically,  
we have also disclosed the total ﬁgure 
including any trade balances payable  
to Merck. By including these items,  
an average of 58 days is obtained  
(2011: 50 days; 2010: 62 days).
The Company has no external trade 
creditors.
Annual General Meeting 
The Company’s AGM will be held on  
25 April 2013. The meeting place will be  
in London, UK. A Notice of AGM will be sent  
to all registered holders of Ordinary Shares 
and, where requested, to the beneﬁcial 
holders of shares.
External auditor 
A resolution will be proposed at the AGM  
on 25 April 2013 for the re-appointment  
of KPMG as auditor of the Company.  
The external auditor has undertaken various 
non-audit work for us during 2012. More 
information about this work and the audit 
and non-audit fees that we have paid  
are set out in Note 27 to the Financial 
Statements on page 190. The external 
auditor is not engaged by us to carry out 
any non-audit work in respect of which it 
might, in the future, be required to express  
an audit opinion. As explained more fully  
in the Audit Committee section from page 
115, the Audit Committee has established 
pre-approval policies and procedures for 
audit and non-audit work permitted to be 
carried out by the external auditor and has 
carefully monitored the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditor 
throughout 2012.

 > Proposed changes to performance 
metrics (but not to the rules nor the 
quantum of compensation opportunity)  
of the PSP are under consideration. The 
Remuneration Committee will consult the 
Group’s largest investors about the PSP 
proposals and will take those views into 
account before reaching its ﬁnal decision. 
This consultation process will take place 
in the ﬁrst quarter of 2013 and before  
any awards are made under the PSP .  
The Remuneration Committee’s intention 
in considering these changes is to  
ensure that the PSP continues to provide 
incentives for management to perform 
successfully against a balance of both 
ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial metrics. 
Further information about the new  
PSP performance metrics will be made 
available at the AGM. Shareholders will  
of course have an opportunity to vote  
on the new PSP arrangements as part  
of the vote on remuneration policy to be 
introduced by the new UK Department  
for Business, Innovation & Skills’ executive 
remuneration proposals, which we expect 
to be implemented with effect from 2014.
Given the Board changes during the year, 
the Remuneration Committee gave careful 
consideration to a number of related 
remuneration matters. In particular, the 
remuneration package for our new CEO;  
the arrangements for Simon Lowth’s  
four months service as Interim CEO  
and his return to the role of CFO; and the 
arrangements relating to the retirement  
of our former CEO, David Brennan. We 
consulted with our major investors where 
appropriate on these matters, and related 
information was provided to the market  
by way of announcements at the relevant 
times. The arrangements are described  
in detail in this Remuneration Report.
threshold under the AstraZeneca 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) in March 
2012 (relating to performance over the  
period 2012 to 2014 inclusive), which is 
lower (principally but not solely because  
of patent expiry) than the equivalent  
cash ﬂow targets applicable to previous 
awards (details are set out on pages  
129 and 130).
Following Pascal Soriot’s appointment  
as CEO in October, the Remuneration 
Committee has been reviewing the 
Company’s remuneration framework.  
The Remuneration Committee wishes  
to ensure that remuneration structures 
continue to be closely aligned with the 
Company’s strategy, and that they  
will support and drive achievement  
of our business objectives.
The Remuneration Committee is  
proposing a number of changes to both 
short-term and long-term incentive 
arrangements for Executive Directors  
and other senior executives. 
 > The composition of performance  
metrics for the annual bonus plan will be 
adjusted. From 2013, they will be based 
on an integrated Group scorecard that 
includes both ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial 
performance metrics, as well as reﬂecting 
individual performance. No changes are 
being made to the funding of the bonus 
pool, the overall quantum at the Group  
or individual level, or the payout curve. 
The new integrated Group scorecard will 
be based on four key priorities: ‘Achieve 
scientiﬁc leadership’, ‘Restore growth’, 
‘Achieve Group ﬁnancial targets’ and 
‘Ensure AstraZeneca is a great place  
to work’, with all but the last scorecard 
priority forming part of the ﬁnancial 
determination of the bonus outcome. 
Targets for each category have been  
set for 2013.
The performance of AstraZeneca as set  
out in this Annual Report was mixed. 
Revenues and proﬁt were down versus  
prior year. Although Core earnings per share 
and cash ﬂow fell versus 2011, they both 
exceeded targets set at the beginning of the 
year. Shareholders also had mixed fortunes. 
Total shareholder return performance was 
weak. But cash distributions (including 
buybacks) reﬂected the strong cash ﬂow 
generation, which also supported the 
strengthening of the product pipeline through 
the acquisition of Ardea, the collaboration 
with Amgen and the extension of our 
diabetes alliance with BMS. We know that 
our shareholders expect pay appropriately 
to reﬂect performance. The Remuneration 
Committee has taken these diverse factors 
and expectations into account in making  
its judgements in 2012. 
The business environment for the Company 
will continue to be challenging in 2013, and 
beyond, in terms of the ﬁscal pressures on 
governments, which in most markets have  
a direct affect on the Company’s business; 
the need to continue to address R&D 
productivity; and the need to maintain a 
level of investment that is right for the future 
of AstraZeneca but which is also balanced 
against shareholders’ expectations for 
return on their investment in the Company. 
The Remuneration Committee has to take  
a judicious view of performance stretch  
and reward. So performance targets must 
be stretching; but not so stretching as to 
compromise or weaken incentivisation.  
For example, we have increased for 2013, 
many of the revenue targets in priority areas 
(Emerging Market sales and sales of Brilinta/
Brilique would be two cases in point). But 
the environmental factors referred to above 
were also recognised by the Remuneration 
Committee in setting the free cash ﬂow

Strategy Performance Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Overview
There are a number of ways in which  
we seek to listen and respond to the views  
of shareholders on remuneration matters 
during the year, including at the AGM, and 
via consultation with the Company’s largest 
investors about speciﬁc remuneration 
matters. In the latter part of each year, the 
Company usually hosts a meeting to which 
we invite our largest shareholders and seek 
their views on executive remuneration and 
corporate governance more broadly. In 
previous years, a number of Non-Executive 
Directors have been available to shareholders 
at that meeting, including the Chairman  
of the Board, myself as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee as well as other 
Board members. Although we cancelled  
the meeting proposed to be held in 
December in anticipation of our dialogue 
with shareholders on remuneration matters 
in the ﬁrst quarter of 2013, we intend to 
continue to hold such meetings annually, 
with the aim of maintaining a constructive 
discussion with shareholders on these topics.
Anticipating the coming into effect of  
the new regulations proposed by the UK 
Department for Business, Innovation & 
Skills, we have taken the opportunity to 
structure this 2012 Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to incorporate a number of the 
proposed features. As a result, this 
Remuneration Report has been prepared 
with separate sections that set out, ﬁrst,  
our remuneration policy (Policy Report)  
and, second, how that policy has been 
implemented in 2012 (Implementation 
Report). We have not yet produced a 
Remuneration Report that is fully compliant 
with the proposed new regulations because 
they are still to be published in their ﬁnal 
form. But our 2013 Remuneration Report 
will fully reﬂect the new regulations and we 
will place resolutions before shareholders 
accordingly at the 2014 AGM. 
As last year, we have sought in this 
Remuneration Report to answer the 
question: what have we paid our Executive 
Directors and why? The answer to this 
question is largely contained in the 
Implementation Report, which commences 
on page 127 . To simplify the narrative and 
structure of this year’s Remuneration Report 
we have placed a lot of detailed disclosure 
(including pensions, the fees paid to the 
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors,  
and facts and ﬁgures relating to the long- 
term incentive plans) in the Appendix  
from page 131. We have taken into account 
Group and individual performance in 2012.  
We are guided in our judgements by our 
compensation schemes and their rules.  
But we know that we must exercise 
appropriate discretion to ensure that reward 
outcomes at AstraZeneca are appropriately 
consistent with the protection of your 
interests as our shareholders. 
As ever, we would welcome your feedback.

Remuneration Committee membership
The Remuneration Committee members are 
John Varley (Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee), Leif Johansson, Rudy Markham 
and Nancy Rothwell. Leif Johansson was 
considered by the Board to be independent 
upon his appointment as Chairman of the 
Board; in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the test of independence 
is not appropriate in relation to the Chairman 
after his appointment. All other members  
of the Remuneration Committee are 
independent Non-Executive Directors. The 
Deputy Company Secretary acts as the 
secretary to the Remuneration Committee.
Terms of reference
A copy of the Remuneration Committee’s 
terms of reference is available on our 
website, astrazeneca.com. The Remuneration 
Committee conducted a review of its terms 
of reference during 2012. A small number  
of minor changes were recommended  
to the Board, principally to reﬂect updated 
guidance issued by the Association  
of British Insurers in September. The 
changes were approved by the Board  
in January 2013.
Main work of the Remuneration 
Committee during 2012
The Remuneration Committee met 12 times 
in 2012. The individual attendance record  
of Remuneration Committee members  
is set out on page 113. At the invitation  
of the Remuneration Committee, except 
where their own remuneration was being 
discussed, the CEO; the Executive 
Vice-President, Human Resources & 
Corporate Affairs; the Global Head, Reward 
& Employment; and the Vice-President, 
Global Compensation attended one  
or more Remuneration Committee meetings 
in 2012 and provided advice and services  
that materially assisted the Remuneration 
Committee. In addition, all meetings of the 
Remuneration Committee were attended  
by Carol Arrowsmith, representing  
Deloitte LLP (Deloitte), the Remuneration 
Committee’s independent adviser.
The work of the Remuneration Committee 
focused on the following principal matters 
during 2012:
 > Executive Directors’ remuneration 
arrangements on appointment, change  
of role and retirement as described 
elsewhere in this Remuneration Report.
 > The terms of other senior executives’ 
remuneration packages on appointment, 
promotion or termination.
 > The Non-Executive Chairman’s 
remuneration arrangements on 
appointment.
 > The assessment of Group and individual 
performance against performance targets 
to determine the level of executive bonuses

Adviser to the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee retains 
Deloitte, represented by Carol Arrowsmith, 
who provided independent advice on 
various matters considered by the 
Remuneration Committee in 2012. The cost 
of this service to the Company in 2012 was 
£229,260 (including VAT). During the year, 
Deloitte also provided taxation advice and 
other speciﬁc non-audit services to the 
Group. The Remuneration Committee 
reviewed the potential for conﬂicts of interest 
and judged that there were no conﬂicts. 
Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration 
Consultants’ Group, which is responsible  
for the stewardship and development of  
the voluntary code of conduct in relation  
to executive remuneration consulting  
in the UK. The principles on which the  
code is based are transparency, integrity, 
objectivity, competence, due care and 
conﬁdentiality. Deloitte adheres to the code.

Purpose and link to strategy Operation Performance measures
Base salary Base salary is intended to be 
sufﬁcient (but no more than 
necessary) to attract, retain  
and develop high-calibre talent.
Based on conditions in the relevant market and 
recognising the value of an individual’s sustained 
personal performance and contribution to the 
business, taking account of the market rate  
for an individual’s skills and experience. 
Benchmarked periodically (but not annually) 
against external comparators.
Beneﬁts Non-cash beneﬁts are designed 
to be sufﬁcient (but no more 
generous than necessary)  
to attract, retain and develop 
high-calibre talent.
Based on local median market practice.
Annual bonus The annual bonus rewards 
short-term performance against 
speciﬁc Group and individual 
objectives.
An annual cash incentive opportunity determined 
by reference to an integrated Group scorecard 
and individual performance, measured over  
a single ﬁnancial year of the Company relative  
to targets set at the beginning of each year.
The Remuneration Committee requires that 
certain percentages of the annual bonus are 
converted into stock to be held for three years 
before vesting.
The Group performance measures ensure  
that all eligible employees receive an element  
of reward based on the Group’s overall ﬁnancial 
and non-ﬁnancial performance.
Individual goals are based on annual objectives.

AstraZeneca  
Performance  
Share Plan (PSP)
1
As described in the 
introduction to this 
Remuneration Report  
from the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee, 
changes to performance 
metrics for the PSP are 
under consideration. It is 
planned that consultation 
with shareholders and 
implementation of the 
changes will take place  
in 2013. The information  
set out in this table refers  
to awards made under  
the PSP, up to and  
including 2012.
The PSP rewards the 
outperformance of industry 
peers in terms of shareholder 
value creation measured by 
relative TSR, and the generation 
of cash at levels to ﬁnance 
investment in the business, debt 
repayment and the Company’s 
shareholder distribution policy.
The PSP was approved by shareholders at the 
2005 AGM and provides for the grant of awards 
over Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
The three year performance periods commence 
on 1 January in the year of the award. The 
vesting date is the third anniversary of the date  
of the award.
In respect of any ﬁnancial year of the Company, 
the maximum market value of shares that may  
in theory be put under an award under the  
PSP is 500% of a participant’s base salary 
(which converts into an expected value of 250%).  
The actual individual limits that apply under  
the PSP, subject to this maximum, are set by  
the Remuneration Committee from time to time.
In the event that employment ceases for anything 
other than a ‘good leaver’ reason, any unvested 
awards lapse unless the Remuneration 
Committee decides otherwise.
Fifty percent based on the relative TSR 
performance of the Company over the relevant 
three year performance period against  
a predetermined peer group of global 
pharmaceutical companies.
Fifty percent based on the achievement of  
a cumulative free cash ﬂow target over the relevant 
three year performance period, based on  
a sliding scale between a threshold target  
and an upper target.
More information about the PSP’s performance 
measures is set out on page 129.
AstraZeneca Investment  
Plan (AZIP)
1
The performance and holding 
periods of the AZIP are 
inﬂuenced by the Group’s 
targeted product development 
cycle, reﬂecting the long-term 
investment horizons that  
are a feature of the industry. 
Dividend-based performance 
hurdles motivate the generation  
of returns for shareholders  
on a sustainable basis over  
an extended period of time.
The AZIP was approved by shareholders at the 
2010 AGM and provides for the grant of awards 
over Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
The AZIP is operated over a four year performance 
period and a subsequent four year holding period. 
Performance periods commence on 1 January  
in the year of the award. Holding periods 
commence at the end of the performance period 
and end eight years from 1 January in the year  
of the award.
In respect of any ﬁnancial year of the Company, 
the maximum market value of shares that may,  
in theory, be put under an award under the AZIP 
is 500% of a participant’s base salary (which 
converts into an expected value of 500%). The 
actual individual limits that apply under the  
AZIP, subject to this maximum, are set by the 
Remuneration Committee from time to time.
Clawback – the Remuneration Committee may 
claw back some or all of the shares that are the 
subject of a participant’s award at any time during 
the performance or the holding period if, in the 
opinion of the Remuneration Committee (acting 
fairly and reasonably), this is warranted by 
underlying Company performance, the 
occurrence of an event that causes or is very likely 
to cause reputational damage to the Company  
or serious misconduct by the participant.
A combination of dividend and dividend cover 
hurdles, assessed over the relevant four year 
performance period.
More information about the AZIP’s performance 
hurdles is set out on page 130.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 126
Performance evaluation process
AstraZeneca conducts an annual performance evaluation process for all of its executives. In the case of members of the Senior Executive 
Team, this is conducted by the CEO. In the case of the CEO, this is conducted by the Chairman of the Board. Recommendations are then 
made to the Remuneration Committee. Those reviews take place relative to Group and individual objectives which are set at the beginning 
of each year.
Service contracts
The notice periods and unexpired terms of Executive Directors’ service contracts at 31 December 2012 are shown in the table below. 
Subject to the arrangements in respect of the ﬁrst 12 months of Pascal Soriot’s service, which are described below, either AstraZeneca  
or the Executive Director may terminate the service contract on 12 months’ notice. It is the Remuneration Committee’s intention that, in 
the event of early termination of an Executive Director’s employment, any compensation payable under his/her service contract should  
not exceed the salary and beneﬁts that would have been received had the contractual notice period been worked and this may be further 
reduced in line with the Executive Director’s duty to mitigate losses.
None of the Executive Directors has any provision in their service contracts giving them a right to liquidated damages or an automatic 
entitlement to bonus for the duration of their notice period.

 The notice period in Mr Soriot’s service contract is 24 months initially, which is reducing by one month for each month of service and will stabilise at a 12 month notice period.
Policy on external appointments and retention of fees
Subject to speciﬁc Board approval in each case, Executive Directors and other SET members may accept external appointments as 
non-executive directors of other companies, and retain any related fees paid to them, provided that such appointments are not 
considered by the Board to prevent, or reduce, the ability of the executive to perform their role within the Group to the required standard. 
Simon Lowth is a Non-Executive Director of Standard Chartered PLC. In respect of this position, he received fees of £130,000 for his 
services in 2012.
Considering the wider employee context
The Remuneration Committee sets overall remuneration policy and makes decisions about speciﬁc remuneration arrangements in the 
broader context of employee remuneration throughout the Group. The Remuneration Committee annually reviews Group remuneration 
data including ratios of average pay to senior executive pay; bonus data; gender and geographical data in relation to base salaries and 
variable compensation; and aggregate data about the shareholding levels of senior managers. In reviewing the base salaries of Executive 
Directors and SET members, the Remuneration Committee considers the overall level of any salary increases being awarded to 
employees across the Group in the relevant year.
Shareholder and broader context
In all aspects of its work, the Remuneration Committee considers both the external environment in which the Company operates and  
the guidance issued by organisations representing institutional shareholders. It consults the Company’s largest investors on general and 
speciﬁc remuneration and provides an annual opportunity for representatives of those investors to meet the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee and other Remuneration Committee and Board members. The Remuneration Committee works with the Audit Committee  
to ensure that the Group’s remuneration policies and practices achieve the right balance between appropriate incentives to reward good 
performance and managing risk in terms of employee behaviour and how the Company achieves its business objectives. The annual 
bonus plan, in which all employees participate, contains goals relating to the demonstration of commitment to integrity, with the aim  
of enhancing the Company’s reputation and avoiding reputational damage. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 127

Implementation Report
Implementation of remuneration policy in 2012
Pascal Soriot
Mr Soriot joined AstraZeneca as CEO on 1 October. In establishing his remuneration arrangements, the Remuneration Committee  
sought to offer a package that was internationally competitive, but pay no more than was necessary. In doing so, to the extent possible, 
the Remuneration Committee put in place a framework that maintained broadly the same balance in terms of its constituent elements and 
overall quantum as for the previous CEO, which the Remuneration Committee considers to be right for AstraZeneca and its shareholders.
At the time of Mr Soriot’s appointment as CEO, certain share awards and payments, which are described below, were negotiated and 
agreed. They were approved by the Remuneration Committee in order to compensate Mr Soriot for the forfeiture of unvested long-term 
incentive awards and forfeited 2012 bonus opportunity from his previous employer. The principle governing the decision of the 
Remuneration Committee was that the buyout should be implemented predominantly in shares of AstraZeneca in circumstances where 
the vesting and, in the case of the award under the AZIP , the holding period operate over several years. The unvested long-term incentive 
awards from Mr Soriot’s previous employer were valued with the assistance of an independent third party, using its standard methodology 
for such work and, where relevant, taking into account the extent to which such awards might have been expected to vest.
General information about annual bonus outcomes for performance in 2012 can be found on page 129. In awarding Mr Soriot’s bonus  
for 2012, the Remuneration Committee recognised the strong start he had made since becoming CEO and his positive impact on  
the organisation.
2012 Notes
Base salary £275,000 The annual rate of base salary for the CEO in 2012 was £1,100,000.
Mr Soriot was appointed as CEO with effect from 1 October.
Beneﬁts £1,017,000 This sum is made up of:
£991,000 being cash paid to compensate Mr Soriot in respect of his forfeited bonus opportunity for 2012 from his previous 
employer, paid at his previous employer’s target bonus rate and pro-rated from 1 January 2012 to 30 September.  
Mr Soriot is required to invest this sum, after payment of income tax, in AstraZeneca shares; and
£26,000 being remaining cash following selection of beneﬁts within the Company’s UK ﬂexible beneﬁts programme.
Annual bonus £335,000 Mr Soriot was awarded a bonus for performance during 2012 of 122% of base salary out of a maximum possible award of 180% 
of base salary (range 0% – 180% with a target annual bonus of 100%). This award was pro-rated from 1 October to 31 
December to reﬂect the date of Mr Soriot’s appointment as CEO.
One-third of any pre-tax bonus must be deferred into Ordinary Shares or ADSs. These are held for three years before being 
released.
The bonus is not pensionable.
Award of 
restricted shares
1
£2,000,000 On 26 October, Mr Soriot was granted an award of 69,108 restricted Ordinary Shares at a price of 2894 pence per share  
by way of compensation for the loss of long-term incentives from his previous employer.
No performance conditions apply.
Vesting schedule for this award (subject to Mr Soriot’s continued employment with the Company):
> 40% on 1 October 2013
> 30% on 1 October 2014
> 30% on 1 October 2015.
Pension £66,000 Cash payment equivalent to 24% of base salary (time pro-rated to take account of Mr Soriot’s joining date in 2012) taken  
by Mr Soriot as a cash alternative to participation in a deﬁned contribution pension scheme.

  In addition to the award of restricted shares, on 26 October, Mr Soriot was also granted an award of 69,108 Ordinary Shares at a price of 2894 pence per share under the AZIP (also by way of 
compensation for the loss of long-term incentives from his previous employer). This award is subject to a four year performance period (1 January 2012 to 31 December 2015) and a subsequent four 
year holding period (1 January 2016 to 31 December 2019). The performance hurdles that apply to this award are that the annual dividend per share paid to holders of Ordinary Shares must increase 
from $2.80 over the four year performance period ($2.80 being the full-year dividend for 2011), and that dividend cover over the same period (based on Reported earnings before restructuring costs) 
does not fall below 1.5 times. Corporate Governance | Directors’ Remuneration Report

Simon Lowth
During 2012, at a time of considerable change within the Group, Mr Lowth served as Interim CEO for the period 1 June to 30 September, 
reverting to his previous role as CFO on 1 October.
To reﬂect his additional responsibilities during his tenure as Interim CEO, he was awarded a temporary increase in base salary. General 
information about annual bonus outcomes for performance in 2012 can be found on the page opposite. The Remuneration Committee 
also recognised Mr Lowth’s excellent performance as Interim CEO, and his strong support to Mr Soriot in his new position as CEO, in 
determining the quantum of his annual bonus award.
2012 Notes
Base salary £740,000 Base salary for the CFO in 2012 was £660,000.
Temporary base salary increase effective from June to September inclusive (period as Interim CEO) was £20,000 gross per

Strategy Performance Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Overview
Variable elements of the CEO’s and CFO’s remuneration in 2012 – additional disclosures
Annual bonus outcomes for performance in 2012
For Executive Directors, the principal drivers of annual bonus opportunity are EPS (27% weighting), cash ﬂow (9% weighting), and 
scorecards (Group and SET area, 64% weighting). For the CEO, the average of all SET area scorecards is used to create an aggregate 
scorecard weighting. For the CFO, the average of Finance and Strategic Partnering and Business Development scorecards is used. 
Reward driven by EPS and cash ﬂow performance depends on EPS and cash ﬂow outcomes versus targets set at the beginning of each 
year. Reward driven by the scorecards depends on performance outcomes relative to goals in the areas of Values, Pipeline and People 
set at the beginning of each year. At constant exchange rates, there were declines in revenue, Core operating proﬁt and EPS versus prior 
year. However, the Core EPS outcome and the cash ﬂow outcome both exceeded the target set at the beginning of 2012. That element  
of the bonus payout which was driven by EPS and cash ﬂow performance therefore exceeded target. In respect of the scorecards, a 
number of factors were taken into consideration. These include the supply problems described elsewhere in this Remuneration Report 
and the slower than expected uptake of Brilinta/Brilique. But they also include the strengthening of the pipeline through the acquisition  
of Ardea, the collaboration with Amgen, and the extension of our diabetes alliance with BMS through the inclusion of the Amylin product 
portfolio. Both Forxiga and Zinforo were launched in Europe, and we had a successful launch of Nexium in Japan. These factors 
collectively drove a score relative to scorecard performance of slightly below target. 
The outturn is that the total variable short-term compensation of Executive Directors and other SET members in 2012 fell relative to the 
equivalent number in 2011. 
The Remuneration Committee decided that Mr Soriot’s annual bonus should amount to 122% of base salary, representing 68% of the 
potential maximum. The Remuneration Committee decided that Mr Lowth’s annual bonus should be 140% of base salary, representing 
86% of the potential maximum. 
Mr Brennan informed the Remuneration Committee that he did not wish to be considered for a bonus in respect of that part of 2012 
during which he was CEO and the Remuneration Committee determined that no such bonus would be awarded.
Annual bonus deferral
Part of the annual bonus of Executive Directors and other SET members is deferred into shares, helping to align senior executives’ 
interests with those of shareholders. The proportion currently deferred into shares is one-third of the pre-tax annual bonus for Executive 
Directors and one-sixth for other SET members. The shares are acquired on the open market at the prevailing market price and held  
for a period of three years from the date of acquisition before being delivered to individual Executive Directors and other SET members.
Performance measures under the PSP
The vesting of PSP awards is contingent on performance against speciﬁed performance measures over the relevant three year 
performance period and continued employment with the Group. Equal weighting is given to the two performance measures used:  
relative TSR and cumulative free cash ﬂow.
Relative TSR – Fifty percent of the award is based on the Group’s relative TSR performance against a predetermined peer group of 
global pharmaceutical companies. The peer group is: Abbott, BMS, Eli Lilly & Company, GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Novartis, 
Pﬁzer, Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Sanoﬁ-Aventis. TSR measures share price growth, and dividends reinvested in respect of a notional 
number of shares from the beginning of the relevant performance period to the end of it, and ranks the companies in the peer group  
by reference to their TSR achieved over that period. The rank which the Company’s TSR achieves over the performance period will 
determine how many shares will vest under the relevant PSP award. Payouts against performance in relation to TSR for PSP awards are 
expressed as a percentage of the maximum award currently payable, shown within a range of 0% to 100%, as set out in the table below.
TSR ranking of the Company % of the maximum PSP award that vests
Below median 0%
Median 25%
Between median and upper quartile Pro rata
Upper quartile 75%
Signiﬁcantly above upper quartile 100%
Although 100% of the maximum award may vest at the Remuneration Committee’s discretion if the Company’s TSR performance  
is substantially better than that of the upper quartile of the comparator group, the Company would need to have sustained a level of 
performance signiﬁcantly in excess of upper quartile over a period of years for the Remuneration Committee to be satisﬁed that the 
vesting of awards at this level was warranted.
In addition to the TSR performance target being met for each PSP award, the Remuneration Committee has to satisfy itself that 
achievement of the TSR performance target is an appropriate reﬂection of the Group’s underlying ﬁnancial performance. It has the 
discretion to prevent PSP awards from vesting or only allow them to vest partially where this, in the judgement of the Remuneration 
Committee, is warranted.
The TSR graphs on page 134 show, for each PSP award, how the Company’s TSR performance has compared with the TSR for the 
companies in the comparator group from the ﬁrst day of the relevant performance period to 31 December 2012, and how the Company 
ranks against those other peer companies on this basis.
Cumulative free cash ﬂow – Fifty percent of the award vests subject to the achievement of the free cash ﬂow performance measure, 
which operates as a cumulative cash ﬂow target over the same three year performance period as the TSR performance measure. The 
measure for the cash ﬂow target is net cash ﬂow (before distributions) (subject to any further adjustments the Remuneration Committee 
chooses to make at its discretion and thus referred to as ‘adjusted cumulative cash ﬂow’) and the level of vesting is based on a sliding 
scale between a threshold cash ﬂow target and an upper target. Vesting levels in relation to the threshold target and the upper target  
are shown in the table overleaf. Corporate Governance | Directors’ Remuneration Report

$16 billion $12 billion 25%
Between $16 billion and $23 billion Between $12 billion and $18 billion Pro rata
$23 billion and above $18 billion and above 100%
Cumulative cash ﬂow is considered to be the most appropriate measure of cash ﬂow performance because it relates to the residual cash 
available to ﬁnance additional investment in speciﬁc business needs, debt repayments and our distribution policy. The cash ﬂow measure 
encompasses a number of important elements of operational and ﬁnancial performance and helps to align executives’ rewards with 
shareholder value creation. The level of vesting of this element is based on a sliding scale against a target that is intended to represent  
a signiﬁcant challenge for the business. It is intended that the Remuneration Committee should have the discretion to adjust, but on  
an exceptional basis only, the free cash ﬂow target during the performance period for material factors that might otherwise distort the 
performance measure in either direction. This allows performance to be assessed against targets that have been set on a consistent 
basis. For example, adjustments may be required to reﬂect exchange rate movements, signiﬁcant acquisitions or divestments, and major 
legal and taxation settlements. Any major adjustments to the calculation are disclosed to shareholders. There is no retesting of 
performance. 
Vesting of share awards made in 2010 under the PSP
In 2012, the TSR ranking of the Company was below median and therefore none of the award will vest in respect of that element of the 
performance measure. Fifty percent of the PSP award is based on free cash ﬂow and in 2012 the Company achieved 95% of the free 
cash ﬂow performance measure. The PSP share awards made in 2010 in respect of the 2010 to 2012 performance period will therefore 
vest at 47% for SET members, including Simon Lowth but excluding Pascal Soriot who does not hold any 2010 PSP awards. For the 
former CEO, David Brennan, vesting of his 2010 PSP awards will be pro-rated from 7 May 2010 to 30 June 2012 to reﬂect the period  
of his employment since the award was granted.

Statement of Executive Directors’ shareholdings
In addition to the shareholding requirements imposed by the Board on Executive Directors and SET members and shown in the table

Pension arrangements 
Pascal Soriot and Simon Lowth
Pascal Soriot and Simon Lowth are eligible to join the AstraZeneca Group Self Invested Personal Pension (UK Deﬁned Contribution  
Plan (UK DCP)) at a Company contribution rate of 24% of annual base salary or, alternatively, to take the Company contribution as a  
cash allowance. Since joining AstraZeneca, Mr Lowth has elected to take the cash allowance in lieu of a pension, which during 2012 
amounted to £158,000 ($251,000) (201 1: £153,000 ($245,000)). In respect of 2012, Mr Soriot made a similar election, which amounted  
to £66,000 ($105,000).
In the event of a senior employee in the UK DCP (including one who has taken the alternative cash allowance) becoming incapacitated, 
permanent health insurance cover provides continuation of a proportion of salary, subject to the satisfaction of certain medical criteria. In the 
event of death prior to retirement, dependants are entitled to a lump sum secured from a multiple of 10 times salary, capped at £4.3 million.
David Brennan
David Brennan is a member of the AstraZeneca US Deﬁned Beneﬁt Pension Plan (US DBP). Beneﬁts for members of the US DBP are 
delivered on a tax-qualiﬁed basis, with accrued beneﬁts that exceed speciﬁc limits under the US DBP’s formula and the US Tax Code 
being delivered through a supplementary, non-qualiﬁed plan. The normal pension age under the US DBP is 65. However, on his 
retirement in 2012, Mr Brennan was eligible to take a pension or lump sum equivalent based on accrued service and ﬁnal pensionable  
pay (ie without actuarial reduction) due to his satisfaction of a condition in the pension plan relating to combined age and service 
exceeding 85 years. 
Mr Brennan’s participation in the US DBP was subject to a service cap at 35 years’ service, which was attained during his tenure  
as CEO and therefore service beyond 35 years is not shown in the table below. During his tenure as a Director, bonus payments were 
removed from the calculation of his pensionable pay under the US DBP .
Pension is payable to Mr Brennan in US dollars. For ease of understanding, the table below has been presented in both pounds sterling 
and US dollars using the exchange rates for 2012 set out on page 133. Transfer values are calculated to be consistent with the value of the 
lump sum distribution equivalent to his deferred accrued pension annually.

 Mr Brennan’s employment with AstraZeneca ended on 30 June 2012.
In addition to the US DBP , Mr Brennan (as a US citizen) was a contributing member of the US 401(k) savings plan. He also participated  
in AstraZeneca’s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (EDCP) which is operated as a supplemental non-qualiﬁed plan in respect  
of US employees should annual contributions exceed the limit applicable to contributions under the qualiﬁed 401(k) plan. During 2012, 
total employer matching contributions of $47 ,000 (£30,000) (2011: $96,000 (£60,000)) were made to his 401(k) plan and EDCP . Member 
contributions of £224,000 ($355,000) were paid through salary sacriﬁce into the plans. Corporate Governance | Directors’ Remuneration Report

Summary of other share plans 
AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan
The AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan (GRSP) was introduced in 2010 and provides for the grant of restricted stock awards  
over the Company’s Ordinary Shares or ADSs. The GRSP is operated for below SET-level employees only. Typically, awards are made  
in March each year and, in relation, for example, to new appointments or promotions, in August. Awards under the GRSP do not involve 
the issue or allotment of new Ordinary Shares or ADSs but rely instead on the market purchase of Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
AstraZeneca Restricted Share Plan
The AstraZeneca Restricted Share Plan (RSP) was introduced in 2008 and provides for the granting of restricted share awards to key 
employees, excluding Executive Directors. Awards are made on an ad hoc basis with variable vesting dates. The RSP was used in 2012 
to make awards (totalling an aggregate of 643,000 Ordinary Shares under the plan for the calendar year 2012) to a number of key senior 
executives in speciﬁc situations considered by the Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for 
agreeing any awards under the RSP and for setting the policy for the way in which the RSP operates. Awards under the RSP do not 
involve the issue or allotment of new Ordinary Shares or ADSs but rely instead on the market purchase of Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
AstraZeneca Share Option Plan
The AstraZeneca Share Option Plan (SOP) expired in May 2010. Details of outstanding options granted to Executive Directors are shown 
in the table on page 137 . The Remuneration Committee imposed performance conditions in respect of the exercise of such options by 
SET members (including the Executive Directors) which, in the view of the Remuneration Committee, were considered appropriately 
stretching. In order for options to vest, the EPS of the Group must increase at least in line with the UK Retail Prices Index plus 5% per 
annum on average, over a three year period, the base ﬁgure being the EPS for the ﬁnancial year preceding the date of grant, with no 
retesting. In addition, since the review of executive remuneration in 2004, the Remuneration Committee has included a condition that, if an 
event occurs which causes material reputational damage to the Company, such that it is not appropriate for the options to vest and 
become exercisable, the Remuneration Committee can make a determination to reﬂect this. No such determination was made in 2012.
Other plans
In addition to the plans described above, the AstraZeneca Savings-Related Share Option Plan and the AstraZeneca All-Employee Share 
Plan are operated in the UK, both of which are HM Revenue & Customs approved plans. Executive Directors and certain other SET 
members are eligible to participate in these plans.
Dilution under share plans
Other than the AstraZeneca Savings-Related Share Option Plan and the AstraZeneca All-Employee Share Plan, which operate in the  
UK only, and the SOP , none of AstraZeneca’s share plans has a dilutive effect because they do not involve the issue or allotment of new 
Ordinary Shares or ADSs but rely instead on the market purchase of Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
Chairman
The Remuneration Committee determines the terms of service, including remuneration, of the Chairman. The annual Board fees payable 
to the Chairman are set out in the table below. In addition to the Chairman’s fee, a proportion of the ofﬁce costs of the Chairman are 
reimbursed; the sum paid in this respect in 2012 is set out in the Directors’ emoluments section below. The Chairman receives no 
additional fee or allowance for Remuneration Committee membership. The Chairman does not participate in the Group’s incentive plans 
or pension or healthcare arrangements.
Non-Executive Directors
None of the Non-Executive Directors has a service contract but all have letters of appointment. In accordance with the Articles, following 
their appointment, Directors must retire at each AGM and may present themselves for election or re-election. None of the Non-Executive 
Directors has any provision in their letter of appointment giving them a right to compensation payable upon early termination of their 
appointment. They are not eligible for performance-related bonuses or the grant of share awards or options. No pension contributions  
are made on their behalf.
The annual Board fees applicable to Non-Executive Directors are set out below. 
Under the Articles, all Directors must, within two months of their appointment, acquire a beneﬁcial interest in at least 500 shares.  
In addition to this mandatory shareholding requirement, the Board encourages each Non-Executive Director to build up, over time,  
a shareholding in the Company with a value approximately equivalent to the basic annual fee for a Non-Executive Director (£75,000)  
or, in the case of the Chairman, approximately equivalent to his annual fee (£500,000).

Directors’ emoluments in 2012
The aggregate remuneration, excluding pension contributions and the value of shares under option and shares subject to share awards, 
paid to or accrued for all Directors for services in all capacities during the year ended 31 December 2012 was £7 ,308,000 ($11,572,000). 
The remuneration of individual Directors is set out in the Directors’ remuneration tables opposite in pounds sterling and US dollars.

Total shareholder return
The Regulations require the inclusion of a graph showing TSR over a ﬁve year period in respect of a holding of the Company’s shares, 
plotted against TSR in respect of a hypothetical holding of shares of a similar kind and number by reference to which a broad equity 
market index is calculated. The Company is a member of the FTSE 100 Index and consequently, for the purposes of this graph, which  
is set out above, we have selected the FTSE 100 Index as the appropriate index. This graph is re-based to 100 at the start of the rolling 
ﬁve year period. We have also included a ‘Pharmaceutical peers (average)’, which reﬂects the TSR of the same comparator group used  
for the PSP graphs above.
The PSP requires that the TSR in respect of a holding of the Company’s shares over the relevant performance period be compared with 
the TSR of a peer group of pharmaceutical companies (as described on page 129). The graphs above show how the Company’s TSR 
performance has compared with the TSR for the relevant companies in the comparator group from the ﬁrst day in the relevant three year 
performance period in respect of each PSP award to 31 December 2012 and how the Company ranks against those other companies  
on this basis.
To alleviate any short-term volatility, the return index is averaged in the TSR calculations for each company over the three months prior  
to the start of the relevant performance period (as stipulated in the PSP) and, for the purposes of the graphs above, over the last three 
months of 2012.
Directors’ interests in shares
Beneﬁcial interests
The table opposite shows any change in the interests of the Directors (including the interests of their Connected Persons, as such term is 
deﬁned in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) in Ordinary Shares from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012 or on the date of 
resignation of such Director (if earlier). All such interests were beneﬁcial except as otherwise stated. However, interests in Ordinary Shares 
or ADSs that are the subject of PSP awards and/or AZIP awards, as well as Ordinary Shares or ADSs that are deferred under the annual 
bonus plan discussed in this Remuneration Report, are not included in the Directors’ interests in shares table opposite but are shown in 
the relevant tables from page 135. No Director or senior executive beneﬁcially owns, or has options over, 1% or more of the issued share 
capital of the Company, nor do they have different voting rights from other shareholders. None of the Directors has a beneﬁcial interest in 
the shares of any of the Company’s subsidiaries. Between 31 December 2012 and 31 January 2013, there was no change in the interests 
in Ordinary Shares shown in the table opposite.

Unitised stock plans
David Brennan, in common with other participating executives in the US, has interests in the following plans which were awarded to him 
prior to him becoming CEO: the AstraZeneca Executive Deferral Plan, the AstraZeneca Executive Deferred Compensation Plan and the 
AstraZeneca Savings and Security Plan. These are unitised stock plans into which the value of certain previous share incentive awards 
has been deferred and are not incentive awards in their own right. Participants hold units in each plan, which represent a long-term  
equity interest in the Company. A unit comprises part cash and part ADSs. The overall unit value can be determined daily by taking  
the market value of the underlying ADSs and adding the cash position. The ADSs held within these units carry both voting and dividend 
rights. David Brennan is deemed to have a notional beneﬁcial interest in these ADSs, calculated by reference to the fund value and the 
closing price of ADSs. Therefore, the number of ADSs in which a notional beneﬁcial interest arises can vary daily as a consequence  
of stock price movements.

Our presence contributes to the economic development of the communities in which  
we work, building skills in these communities through local employment, contributions 
through wages and taxes, as well as capacity building through local procurement and 
collaborations with local partners.
For example, in Russia we were the ﬁrst pharmaceuticals multinational to announce an investment in full-cycle manufacturing. The factory, 
currently being built and due to open in the Kaluga region in 2014, will manufacture a range of AstraZeneca’s medicines. We are also 
committed to sharing our global R&D expertise with the Russian scientiﬁc community through research collaborations, support programmes 
and clinical trials. In support of this commitment, we opened our ﬁrst Predictive Science Centre in Russia in St. Petersburg in 2012.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 140
The Directors assessed the effectiveness of AstraZeneca’s internal 
control over financial reporting as at 31 December 2012 based on 
the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated 
Framework. Based on this assessment, the Directors believe that, 
as at 31 December 2012, the internal control over financial reporting 
is effective based on those criteria.
KPMG Audit Plc, an independent registered public accounting 
firm, has audited the effectiveness of internal control over financial 
reporting as at 31 December 2012 and, as explained on page 141, 
has issued an unqualified report thereon.
The Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining 
adequate internal control over financial reporting. AstraZeneca’s 
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide 
reasonable assurance over the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles.
Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting 
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any 
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the 
risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes 
in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies 
or procedures may deteriorate.
Directors’ Responsibilities for, and Report on,  
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps 
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement 
that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement pursuant to DTR 4
The Directors confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 > The Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole.
 > The Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the issuer 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.
On behalf of the Board of Directors on 31 January 2013
Pascal Soriot 
Director
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
Form 20-F Information and the Group and Parent Company Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent 
Company Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group Financial Statements 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable 
law and have elected to prepare the Parent Company Financial 
Statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and 
applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and 
of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group 
and Parent Company Financial Statements, the Directors are 
required to:
 > select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently
 > make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent
 > for the Group Financial Statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU
 > for the Parent Company Financial Statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the Parent Company Financial Statements
 > prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Parent Company will continue in business.

those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and, in respect of the separate opinion in relation to IFRSs 
as issued by the IASB, those matters that we have agreed to state

permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members,

we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Preparation of the Financial 
Statements and Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on 
page 140, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
Group Financial Statements and for being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit, and express an 
opinion on, the Group Financial Statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
for the year ended 31 December Financial Statements | Group Accounting Policies
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 146
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the Annual Report and Financial Statements.
Estimates and judgements
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to 
make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts 
of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and 
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Judgements include classification of transactions between profit 
and the consolidated statement of financial position and the 
determination of operating segments while estimates focus  
on areas such as carrying values and estimated lives.
AstraZeneca’s management considers the following to be 
the most important accounting policies in the context of the 
Group’s operations.
The accounting policy descriptions set out the areas where 
judgements and estimates need exercising, the most significant 
of which are revenue recognition, research and development 
(including impairment reviews of associated intangible assets), 
business combinations and goodwill, litigation and environmental 
liabilities, employee benefits and taxation.
Further information on estimates and critical judgements made in 
applying accounting policies, including details of significant methods 
and assumptions used, is included in Notes 4, 6, 8, 9, 18, 22 and 
25 in the Financial Statements. Financial risk management policies 
are detailed in Note 23.
Revenue
Revenues comprise sales and income under co-promotion and 
co-development agreements.
Income under co-promotion and co-development agreements is 
recognised when it is earned as defined in the contract and can be 
reliably estimated. In general, this is upon the sale of the co-promoted/
developed product or upon the delivery of a promotional or 
developmental service.
Revenues exclude inter-company revenues and value-added taxes 
and represent net invoice value less estimated rebates, returns 
and settlement discounts. Revenues are recognised when the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred 
to a third party. In general, this is upon delivery of the products to 
wholesalers. In markets where returns are significant (currently 
only in the US), estimates of returns are accounted for at the point 
revenue is recognised. In markets where returns are not significant, 
they are recorded when returned.
For the US market, we estimate the quantity and value of goods 
which may ultimately be returned at the point of sale. Our returns 
accruals are based on actual experience over the preceding 
12 months for established products together with market-related 
information such as estimated stock levels at wholesalers and 
competitor activity which we receive via third party information 
services. For newly launched products, we use rates based on our 
experience with similar products or a pre-determined percentage.
When a product faces generic competition particular attention 
is given to the possible levels of returns and, in cases where the 
circumstances are such that the level of returns (and, hence, revenue) 
cannot be measured reliably, revenues are only recognised when 
the right of return expires, which is generally on ultimate prescription 
of the product to patients.
Basis of accounting and preparation of financial information
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention, modified to include revaluation to 
fair value of certain financial instruments as described below, in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU (adopted IFRSs) 
in response to the IAS regulation (EC 1606/2002). The Consolidated 
Financial Statements also comply fully with IFRSs as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board.
During the year the Group adopted the amendments to IFRS 7 
‘Disclosures – Transfers of Financial Assets’ and IAS 12 ‘Deferred Tax: 
Recovery of Underlying Assets’. The adoption of the amendments 
did not have a significant effect on the Group’s profit for the period, 
net assets or cash flows.
The Company has elected to prepare the Company Financial 
Statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards. These 
are presented on pages 193 to 197 and the accounting policies  
in respect of Company information are set out on page 194.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in US dollars, 
which is the Company’s functional currency.
In preparing their individual financial statements, the accounting 
policies of some overseas subsidiaries do not conform with adopted 
IFRSs. Therefore, where appropriate, adjustments are made 
in order to present the Consolidated Financial Statements on 
a consistent basis.
Basis for preparation of financial statements 
on a going concern basis
Information on the business environment AstraZeneca operates 
in, including the factors underpinning the industry’s future growth 
prospects, is included in the Directors’ Report. Details of the 
product portfolio of the Group (including patent expiry dates for 
key marketed products), our approach to product development 
and our development pipeline are covered in detail with additional 
information by Therapy Area in the Directors’ Report.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity  
position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial 
Review from page 86. In addition, Note 23 to the Financial 
Statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management 
objectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging 
activities and its exposures to credit, market and liquidity risk. 
Further details of the Group’s cash balances and borrowings  
are included in Notes 13 and 14 of the Financial Statements.
The Group has considerable financial resources available. As at 
31 December 2012, the Group has $9.8bn in financial resources 
(cash balances of $7.7bn and undrawn committed bank facilities 
of $3.0bn which are available until April 2017 , with only $0.9bn of 
debt due within one year). The Group’s revenues are largely derived 
from sales of products which are covered by patents which provide 
a relatively high level of resilience and predictability to cash inflows, 
although our revenue is expected to continue to be significantly 
impacted by the expiry of patents over the medium term. In addition, 
recent government price interventions in response to budgetary 
constraints are expected to continue to adversely affect revenues 
in many of our mature markets. However, we anticipate new revenue 
streams from both recently launched medicines and products in 
development, and the Group has a wide diversity of customers and 
suppliers across different geographic areas. Consequently, the 
Directors believe that, overall, the Group is well placed to manage 
its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain 
economic outlook.
Group Accounting Policies AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 147
Strategy Performance Corporate Governance Additional Information Financial Statements Overview
its share of expenses incurred. The Group also recognises the  
assets associated with the jointly controlled operation that it 
controls and the liabilities it incurs under the jointly controlled 
operation collaboration agreement.
Employee benefits
The Group accounts for pensions and other employee benefits 
(principally healthcare) under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’. In respect 
of defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted 
present value while plan assets are measured at fair value. 
The operating and financing costs of such plans are recognised 
separately in profit; current service costs are spread systematically 
over the lives of employees and financing costs are recognised in 
full in the periods in which they arise. Actuarial gains and losses 
are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.
Where the calculation results in a surplus to the Group, the 
recognised asset is limited to the present value of any available 
future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions 
to the plan. Payments to defined contribution plans are recognised 
in profit as they fall due.
Taxation
The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit differs from reported profit because taxable profit 
excludes items that are never taxable or tax deductible. The Group’s 
current tax assets and liabilities are calculated using tax rates that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, 
providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts 
used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised to 
the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the asset can be utilised. This requires judgements 
to be made in respect of the availability of future taxable income.
No deferred tax asset or liability is recognised in respect of temporary 
differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches 
and joint ventures where the Group is able to control the timing 
of reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the 
temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The Group’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using 
tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability 
is settled or the asset realised based on tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Accruals for tax contingencies require management to make 
judgements and estimates of exposures in relation to tax audit issues. 
Tax benefits are not recognised unless the tax positions will probably 
be sustained. Once considered to be probable, management reviews 
each material tax benefit to assess whether a provision should be 
taken against full recognition of that benefit on the basis of potential 
settlement through negotiation and/or litigation. All provisions are 
included in current liabilities. Any liability to interest on tax liabilities 
is provided for in the tax charge. See Note 25 for further details.
Share-based payments
All plans are assessed and have been classified as equity settled. 
The grant date fair value of employee share plan awards is calculated 
using a modified version of the binomial model. In accordance with 
IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’, the resulting cost is recognised in 
profit over the vesting period of the awards, being the period in which 
the services are received. The value of the charge is adjusted to 
reflect expected and actual levels of awards vesting, except where 
the failure to vest is as a result of not meeting a market condition. 
Cancellations of equity instruments are treated as an acceleration 
of the vesting period and any outstanding charge is recognised  
in profit immediately.
Research and development
Research expenditure is recognised in profit in the year in which it 
is incurred.
Internal development expenditure is capitalised only if it meets the 
recognition criteria of IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’. Where regulatory 
and other uncertainties are such that the criteria are not met, the 
expenditure is recognised in profit and this is almost invariably the 
case prior to approval of the drug by the relevant regulatory authority. 
Where, however, recognition criteria are met, intangible assets are 
capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful 
economic lives from product launch. At 31 December 2012, no 
amounts have met recognition criteria.
Payments to in-licence products and compounds from third parties 
for new research and development projects (in-process research 
and development), generally taking the form of up front payments 
and milestones, are capitalised. Where payments made to third 
parties represent future research and development activities, an 
evaluation is made as to the nature of the payments. Such payments 
are expensed if they represent compensation for subcontracted 
research and development services not resulting in a transfer of 
intellectual property. By contrast, payments are capitalised if they 
represent compensation for the transfer of intellectual property 
developed at the risk of the third party. Since acquired products and 
compounds will only generate sales and cash inflows following 
launch, our policy is to minimise the period between final approval 
and launch if it is within AstraZeneca’s control to do so. Assets 
capitalised are amortised, on a straight-line basis, over their useful 
economic lives from product launch. Under this policy, it is not 
possible to determine precise economic lives for individual classes of 
intangible assets. However, lives range from three years to 20 years. 
Intangible assets relating to products in development (both internally 
generated and externally acquired) are subject to impairment testing 
annually. All intangible assets are tested for impairment when there 
are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Any 
impairment losses are recognised immediately in profit. Intangible 
assets relating to products which fail during development (or for which 
development ceases for other reasons) are tested for impairment 
at the point of termination and are written down to their recoverable 
amount (which is usually zero).
Business combinations and goodwill
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the 
identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities unless the 
fair value cannot be measured reliably, in which case the value is 
subsumed into goodwill. Where fair values of acquired contingent 
liabilities cannot be measured reliably, the assumed contingent 
liability is not recognised but is disclosed in the same manner as 
other contingent liabilities. Goodwill is the difference between the fair 
value of the consideration and the fair value of net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to an 
impairment review, both annually and when there is an indication that 
the carrying value may not be recoverable. Between 1 January 1998 
and 31 December 2002, goodwill was amortised over its estimated 
useful life; such amortisation ceased on 31 December 2002.
The Group’s policy up to and including 1997 was to eliminate 
goodwill arising upon acquisitions against reserves. Under IFRS 1 
‘First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’ 
and IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, such goodwill will remain 
eliminated against reserves.
Jointly controlled operations
The Group has one arrangement over which it has joint control. 
The form of this arrangement is a jointly controlled operation under 
IAS 31 ‘Interests in Joint Ventures’. The Group recognises its share 
of income that it earns from the jointly controlled operation and   Financial Statements | Group Accounting Policies
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 148
The Group’s other financial instruments include:
 > cash and cash equivalents
 > fixed deposits
 > other investments
 > bank and other borrowings
 > derivatives.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, current balances 
with banks and similar institutions and highly liquid investments 
with maturities of three months or less when acquired. They are 
readily convertible into known amounts of cash and are held at 
amortised cost.
Fixed deposits
Fixed deposits, comprising principally funds held with banks and 
other financial institutions, are initially measured at fair value, plus 
direct transaction costs, and are subsequently remeasured to 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method at each 
reporting date. Changes in carrying value are recognised in profit.
Other investments
Where investments have been classified as held for trading, they 
are measured initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to 
fair value at each reporting date. Changes in fair value are recognised 
in profit.
In all other circumstances, the investments are classified as ‘available 
for sale’ , are initially measured at fair value (including direct transaction 
costs) and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each 
reporting date. Changes in carrying value due to changes in exchange 
rates on monetary available for sale investments or impairments are 
recognised in profit. All other changes in fair value are recognised 
in other comprehensive income.
Impairments are recorded in profit when there is a decline in the 
value of an investment that is deemed to be other than temporary. 
On disposal of the investment, the cumulative amount recognised 
in other comprehensive income is recognised in profit as part  
of the gain or loss on disposal.
Bank and other borrowings
The Group uses derivatives, principally interest rate swaps, to 
hedge the interest rate exposure inherent in a portion of its fixed 
interest rate debt. In such cases the Group will either designate 
the debt as fair value through profit or loss when certain criteria 
are met or as the hedged item under a fair value hedge.
If the debt instrument is designated as fair value through profit or 
loss, the debt is initially measured at fair value (with direct transaction 
costs being included in profit as an expense) and is remeasured 
to fair value at each reporting date with changes in carrying value 
being recognised in profit (along with changes in the fair value of 
the related derivative). Such a designation has been made where 
this significantly reduces an accounting mismatch which would 
result from recognising gains and losses on different bases.
If the debt is designated as the hedged item under a fair value hedge, 
the debt is initially measured at fair value (with direct transaction 
costs being amortised over the life of the bonds), and is remeasured 
for fair value changes in respect of the hedged risk at each reporting 
date with changes in carrying value being recognised in profit 
(along with changes in the fair value of the related derivative).
Other interest-bearing loans are initially measured at fair value 
(with direct transaction costs being amortised over the life of the 
bond) and are subsequently remeasured to amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate method at each reporting date.  
Changes in carrying value are recognised in profit.
Derivatives
Derivatives are initially measured at fair value (with direct transaction 
costs being included in profit as an expense) and are subsequently 
Property, plant and equipment
The Group’s policy is to write off the difference between the cost 
of each item of property, plant and equipment and its residual value 
over its estimated useful life on a straight-line basis. Assets under 
construction are not depreciated.
Reviews are made annually of the estimated remaining lives and 
residual values of individual productive assets, taking account of 
commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear 
and tear. Under this policy it becomes impractical to calculate 
average asset lives exactly. However, the total lives range from 
approximately 10 to 50 years for buildings, and three to 13 years for 
plant and equipment. All items of property, plant and equipment 
are tested for impairment when there are indications that the carrying 
value may not be recoverable. Any impairment losses are recognised 
immediately in profit.
Borrowing costs
The Group has no borrowing costs with respect to the acquisition 
or construction of qualifying assets. All other borrowing costs are 
recognised in profit as incurred and in accordance with the effective 
interest rate method.
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases if they transfer substantially 
all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership, otherwise they 
are classified as operating leases. Assets and liabilities arising on 
finance leases are initially recognised at fair value or, if lower, the 
present value of the minimum lease payments. The discount rate 
used in calculating the present value of the minimum lease payments 
is the interest rate implicit in the lease. Finance charges under 
finance leases are allocated to each reporting period so as to 
produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance 
of the finance liability. Rentals under operating leases are charged 
to profit on a straight-line basis.
Subsidiaries
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, directly or indirectly, by 
AstraZeneca PLC. Control is regarded as the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits 
from its activities.
The financial results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date 
control is obtained until the date that control ceases.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
The first in, first out or an average method of valuation is used. 
For finished goods and work in progress, cost includes directly 
attributable costs and certain overhead expenses (including 
depreciation). Selling expenses and certain other overhead expenses 
(principally central administration costs) are excluded. Net realisable 
value is determined as estimated selling price less all estimated costs 
of completion and costs to be incurred in selling and distribution.
Write-downs of inventory occur in the general course of business 
and are recognised in cost of sales.
Trade and other receivables
Financial assets included in trade and other receivables are 
recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition 
they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method, less any impairment losses.
Trade and other payables
Financial liabilities included in trade and other payables are recognised 
initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments include interests in leases, trade 
and other receivables and payables and rights and obligations 
under employee benefit plans which are dealt with in specific 
accounting policies. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 149

on the greater of its value in use and its fair value less cost to sell. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows, adjusted 
for the risks specific to each asset, are discounted to their present 
value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the general risks affecting the 
pharmaceutical industry. For the purpose of impairment testing, 
assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets 
that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely 
independent of the cash flows of other assets. Impairment losses 
are recognised in profit.
International accounting transition
On transition to using adopted IFRSs in the year ended 31 December 
2005, the Company took advantage of several optional exemptions 
available in IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption of International Financial 
Reporting Standards’. The major impacts which are of continuing 
importance are detailed below:
 > Business combinations – IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ has 
been applied from 1 January 2003, the date of transition, rather 
than being applied fully retrospectively. As a result, the combination 
of Astra and Zeneca is still accounted for as a merger, rather 
than through purchase accounting. If purchase accounting 
had been adopted, Zeneca would have been deemed to have 
acquired Astra.
 > Cumulative exchange differences – the Group chose to set the 
cumulative exchange difference reserve at 1 January 2003 to zero.
Applicable accounting standards and interpretations 
issued but not yet adopted
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ was reissued in October 2010. It is 
applicable to financial assets and financial liabilities. For financial 
assets it requires classification and measurement in either the 
amortised cost or the fair value category. For a company’s own debt 
held at fair value, the standard requires the movement in the fair value 
as a result of changes in the company’s own credit risk to be included 
in other comprehensive income. It is effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2015. The standard has not yet been 
endorsed by the EU. The adoption of IFRS 9 is not expected to have 
a significant impact upon the Group’s net results or net assets.
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’, IFRS 11 ‘Joint 
Arrangements’, IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’ 
and IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ were issued in May 2011, 
along with consequential amendments to IAS 27 ‘Separate Financial 
Statements’ and IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint 
Ventures’. The new and revised standards were endorsed by the EU 
in December 2012, with an effective date of 1 January 2014 (except 
for IFRS 13 which has an effective date of 1 January 2013) but 
with early adoption permitted. The Group intends to adopt the 
new and revised standards from 1 January 2013. The adoption is 
not expected to have a significant impact upon the Group’s net 
results, net assets or disclosures.
The amendments to IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ are effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 and were 
endorsed by the EU in June 2012. The amendments result in a 
change to the methodology used in calculating the expected return 
on pension assets, reported as finance income. Finance income will 
be lower as a result. On adoption, prior period finance income will 
be restated with decreases of approximately $70m for 2012 and 
$85m for 2011. The adoption of the IAS 19 amendments is not 
expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s net assets. 
The amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Items in Other 
Comprehensive Income’ and amendments to IAS 32 and IFRS 7 on 
offsetting financial assets and liabilities are effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012, and 1 January 2014 
(IAS 32) and 1 January 2013 (IFRS 7) respectively. They are not 
expected to have a significant impact upon the Group’s net results, 
net assets or disclosures. These amendments were endorsed  
by the EU in 2012.
remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. Changes in carrying 
value are recognised in profit.
Foreign currencies
Foreign currency transactions, being transactions denominated in 
a currency other than an individual Group entity’s functional currency, 
are translated into the relevant functional currencies of individual 
Group entities at average rates for the relevant monthly accounting 
periods, which approximate to actual rates.
Monetary assets, arising from foreign currency transactions,  
are retranslated at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. 
Exchange gains and losses on loans and on short-term foreign 
currency borrowings and deposits are included within finance 
expense. Exchange differences on all other foreign currency 
transactions are recognised in operating profit in the individual 
Group entity’s accounting records.
Non-monetary items arising from foreign currency transactions are 
not retranslated in the individual Group entity’s accounting records.
In the Consolidated Financial Statements, income and expense 
items for Group entities with a functional currency other than US 
dollars are translated into US dollars at average exchange rates, 
which approximate to actual rates, for the relevant accounting 
periods. Assets and liabilities are translated at the US exchange 
rates prevailing at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising 
on consolidation are recognised in other comprehensive income.
If certain criteria are met, non-US dollar denominated loans or 
derivatives are designated as net investment hedges of foreign 
operations. Exchange differences arising on retranslation of net 
investments, and of foreign currency loans which are designated in 
an effective net investment hedge relationship, are recognised in other 
comprehensive income in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Foreign exchange derivatives hedging net investments in foreign 
operations are carried at fair value. Effective fair value movements are 
recognised in other comprehensive income, with any ineffectiveness 
taken to the income statement. Gains and losses accumulated in 
the translation reserve will be recycled to profit when the foreign 
operation is sold.
Litigation and environmental liabilities
Through the normal course of business, AstraZeneca is involved 
in legal disputes, the settlement of which may involve cost to the 
Group. Provision is made where an adverse outcome is probable 
and associated costs, including related legal costs, can be estimated 
reliably. In other cases, appropriate disclosures are included.
Where it is considered that the Group is more likely than not to 
prevail, or in the rare circumstances where the amount of the 
legal liability cannot be estimated reliably, legal costs involved in 
defending the claim are charged to profit as they are incurred.
Where it is considered that the Group has a valid contract which 
provides the right to reimbursement (from insurance or otherwise) 
of legal costs and/or all or part of any loss incurred or for which a 
provision has been established, the best estimate of the amount 
expected to be received is recognised as an asset only when it is 
virtually certain.
AstraZeneca is exposed to environmental liabilities relating to its past 
operations, principally in respect of soil and groundwater remediation 
costs. Provisions for these costs are made when there is a present 
obligation and where it is probable that expenditure on remedial 
work will be required and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
cost. Provisions are discounted where the effect is material.
Impairment
The carrying values of non-financial assets, other than inventories 
and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at least annually to determine 
whether there is any indication of impairment. For goodwill, intangible 
assets under development and for any other assets where such 
indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated based  Financial Statements | Notes to the Group Financial Statements

2 Operating profit
Operating profit includes the following items:
Research and development expense
In 2012, research and development includes a $50m impairment following the decision by AstraZeneca not to pursue a regulatory filing 
for TC-5214. In 2011, research and development includes a $285m impairment charge related to the termination of development of the 
investigational compound olaparib for the maintenance treatment of serous ovarian cancer and $150m impairment charge related to 
the intangible assets held in relation to TC-5214. In 2010, research and development included a $445m impairment of intangible assets 
related specifically to motavizumab. Further details of impairment charges for 2012, 2011 and 2010 are included in Notes 7 and 9.
Selling, general and administrative costs
In 2012, selling, general and administrative costs includes net legal provisions of $72m, in respect of net legal provision charges relating 
to ongoing Seroquel franchise legal matters, Average Wholesale Price litigation in the US, the Toprol-XL antitrust litigation and Nexium 
commercial litigation. In 2011, selling, general and administrative costs included $135m of net legal provision charges, all of which were 
in respect of the ongoing Seroquel franchise legal matters, Average Wholesale Price litigation in the US and the Toprol-XL antitrust 
litigation. In 2010, selling, general and administrative costs included legal provision charges of $617m, of which $592m was in respect 
of Seroquel franchise legal matters. The current status of these matters is described in Note 25. These provisions constituted our best 
estimate at that time of losses expected for these matters. Also included within selling, general and administrative costs in 2010 were 
gains of $791m arising from changes made to benefits under certain of the Group’s post-retirement benefit plans, chiefly the Group’s  
UK pension plan. Further details of this gain are included in Note 18.
Profit on disposal of subsidiary
The profit on disposal of subsidiary in 2011 of $1,483m relates to the sale of the Astra Tech business to DENTSPLY International Inc. 
Further details are included in Note 22.

4 Taxation continued
Taxation has been provided at current rates on the profits earned for the periods covered by the Group Financial Statements. The 2012 
prior period current tax adjustment relates to a benefit of $259m arising from a number of tax settlements (including settlement of a transfer 
pricing matter), partially offset by an increase in provisions for other tax contingencies and tax accrual to tax return adjustments. The 2011 
prior period current tax adjustment relates to a benefit of $520m arising from a number of tax settlements, partially offset by an increase 
in provisions for other tax contingencies and tax accrual to tax return adjustments. The 2010 prior period current tax adjustment relates 
mainly to an increase in provisions for tax contingencies and double tax relief partially offset by a benefit of $342m arising from a number 
of tax settlements and tax accrual to tax return adjustments. The 2012 prior period deferred tax adjustment relates to a benefit of $102m 
arising from a number of tax settlements (including settlement of a transfer pricing matter) and tax accrual to tax return adjustments. 
The 2011 and 2010 prior period deferred tax adjustments relate mainly to tax accrual to tax return adjustments and a reclassification 
from deferred tax to current tax of amounts provided in relation to tax contingencies for prior periods.
To the extent that dividends remitted from overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are expected to result in additional taxes, 
appropriate amounts have been provided for. No deferred tax has been provided for unremitted earnings of Group companies overseas 
as these are considered permanently employed in the business of these companies. Unremitted earnings may be liable to overseas taxes 
and/or UK taxation (after allowing for double tax relief) if distributed as dividends. The aggregate amount of temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised totalled approximately 
$8,655m at 31 December 2012 (2011: $9,155m; 2010: $16,768m).
Factors affecting future tax charges
As a group involved in worldwide operations, AstraZeneca is subject to several factors that may affect future tax charges, principally 
the levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions, transfer pricing regulations, tax rates imposed and tax regime reforms. It is the 
UK government’s intention to enact legislation which will reduce the main rate of UK Statutory Corporation Tax to 21% by 2014. In 2012, 
the UK government also enacted legislation as part of its programme of corporate tax reforms including the introduction of a patent box 
regime, under which UK profits arising from certain UK owned patents will be subject to a reduced rate of UK Statutory Corporation Tax 
effective 1 April 2013. The Swedish government has enacted legislation to reduce the Sweden Statutory Corporation Tax rate from 26.3% 
to 22% effective 1 January 2013. Details of material tax exposures and items currently under audit and negotiation are set out in Note 25.

 The 2012 item relates to the reduction in the Sweden Statutory Corporation Tax rate from 26.3% to 22% effective 1 January 2013 and the UK Statutory Corporation Tax rate from 25% (the tax rate 
which was substantively enacted as effective from 1 April 2012 as at 31 December 2011) to the tax rate of 23% effective from 1 April 2013. The 2011 item relates to the reduction in the UK Statutory 
Corporation Tax rate from 27% (the tax rate which was substantively enacted as effective from 1 April 2011 as at 31 December 2010) to the tax rate of 25% effective from 1 April 2012. The 2010 item 
relates to the reduction in the UK Statutory Corporation Tax rate from 28% to 27% effective from 1 April 2011.
The tax rate of 18% for the year ended 31 December 2012 is lower than the UK Statutory Corporation Tax rate of 24.5% mainly as 
a result of the $230m adjustment to deferred tax balances following substantive enactment of a reduction in the Sweden Statutory 
Corporation Tax rate from 26.3% to 22% effective 1 January 2013, the $240m release of a tax provision following the settlement of 
a transfer pricing matter and the difference in effective overseas tax rates as discussed below. Excluding the effects of the one-off 
benefits totalling $470m mentioned above, the tax rate is 24.1%.
AstraZeneca is domiciled in the UK but operates in other countries where the tax rates and tax laws are different to those in the UK. 
The impact of differences in effective overseas tax rates on the Group’s overall tax charge is shown above. Profits arising from our 
manufacturing operation in Puerto Rico are granted special status and are taxed at a reduced rate compared with the normal rate  
of tax in that territory under a tax incentive grant that expires in 2016. Financial Statements | Notes to the Group Financial Statements

Unrecognised deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets of $120m have not been recognised in respect of deductible temporary differences (2011: $169m; 2010: $128m) 
because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits therefrom.

6 Segment information
AstraZeneca is engaged in a single business activity of pharmaceuticals and the Group does not have multiple operating segments. 
Our pharmaceuticals business consists of the discovery and development of new products, which are then manufactured, marketed 
and sold. All of these functional activities take place (and are managed) globally on a highly integrated basis. We do not manage these 
individual functional areas separately. 
We consider that the SET is AstraZeneca’s chief operating decision making body (as defined by IFRS 8). The operation of the SET is 
principally driven by the management of the commercial operations, R&D, and manufacturing and supply. The SET also includes Finance, 
HR and Corporate Affairs, Compliance and General Counsel representation. All significant operating decisions are taken by the SET. 
While members of the SET have responsibility for implementation of decisions in their respective areas, operating decision making is at 
SET level as a whole. Where necessary these are implemented through cross-functional sub-committees that consider the Group-wide 
impact of a new decision. For example, product launch decisions would be initially considered by the SET and, on approval, passed to 
an appropriate sub-team for implementation. The impacts of being able to develop, produce, deliver and commercialise a wide range 
of pharmaceutical products drive the SET decision making process.
In assessing performance, the SET reviews financial information on an integrated basis for the Group as a whole, substantially in the 
form of, and on the same basis as, the Group’s IFRS Financial Statements. The high upfront cost of discovering and developing new 
products coupled with the relatively insignificant and stable unit cost of production means that there is not the clear link that exists in 
many manufacturing businesses between the revenue generated on an individual product sale and the associated cost and hence 
margin generated on a product. Consequently, the profitability of individual drugs or classes of drugs is not considered a key measure 
of performance for the business and is not monitored by the SET.
Resources are allocated on a Group-wide basis according to need. In particular, capital expenditure, in-licensing, and R&D resources 
are allocated between activities on merit, based on overall therapeutic considerations and strategy under the aegis of the Group’s 
Portfolio Investment Board to facilitate a Group-wide single combined discovery and development strategy. The Group’s acquisitions  
in the biologics area, MedImmune and Cambridge Antibody Technology Group plc (CAT), have been integrated into the existing 
management structure of AstraZeneca both for allocation of resources and for assessment and monitoring of performance purposes. 
As such, although biologics is a relatively new technological area for the Group, it does not operate as a separate operating segment.

Revenue is recognised at the point of delivery, which is usually when title passes to the wholesaler. Transactions with two wholesalers 
(2011: two; 2010: two) individually represented greater than 10% of total revenue. The values of these transactions recorded as revenue 
were $3,517m and $3,155m (2011: $4,298m and $4,170m; 2010: $4,164m and $4,129m). AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 157

For the purpose of impairment testing of goodwill, the Group is regarded as a single cash-generating unit.
The recoverable amount is based on value in use using discounted risk-adjusted projections of the Group’s pre-tax cash flows over  
10 years which is considered by the Board as a reasonable period given the long development and life-cycle of a medicine. The 
projections include assumptions about product launches, competition from rival products and pricing policy as well as the possibility  
of generics entering the market. In setting these assumptions we consider our past experience, external sources of information (including 
information on expected increases and ageing of the populations in our established markets and the expanding patient population in 
newer markets), our knowledge of competitor activity and our assessment of future changes in the pharmaceutical industry. The 10 year 
period is covered by internal budgets and forecasts. Given that internal budgets and forecasts are prepared for all projections, no 
general growth rates are used to extrapolate internal budgets and forecasts for the purposes of determining value in use. No terminal 
value is included as these cash flows are more than sufficient to establish that an impairment does not exist. The methods used to 
determine recoverable amounts have remained consistent with the prior year.
In arriving at value in use, we disaggregate our projected pre-tax cash flows into groups reflecting similar risks and tax effects. For each 
group of cash flows we use an appropriate discount rate reflecting those risks and tax effects. In arriving at the appropriate discount rate 
for each group of cash flows, we adjust AstraZeneca’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital (7 .0% for 2012, 2011 and 2010) to reflect 
the impact of relevant industry risks, the time value of money and tax effects. The weighted average pre-tax discount rate we used was 
approximately 10% (2011: 10%; 2010: 10%).
As a further check, we compare our market capitalisation to the book value of our net assets and this indicates significant surplus  
at 31 December 2012 (and 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010).
No goodwill impairment was identified.
The Group has also performed sensitivity analysis calculations on the projections used and discount rate applied. The Directors have 
concluded that, given the significant headroom that exists, and the results of the sensitivity analysis performed, there is no significant 
risk that reasonable changes in any key assumptions would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its value in use. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 159

Amortisation and impairment charges
The 2012 impairment of product, marketing and distribution rights includes a charge of $50m following the decision by AstraZeneca not 
to pursue a regulatory filing for TC-5214, based on the final results of Phase III efficacy and tolerability studies of the compound as an 
adjunct therapy to an anti-depressant in patients with major depressive disorder who do not respond adequately to initial anti-depressant 
treatment. The remaining $149m charge relates to the termination of other development projects during the year. 
The 2011 impairment of product, marketing and distribution rights includes a charge of $285m following the termination of development 
of the investigational compound olaparib for the maintenance treatment of serous ovarian cancer. The 2011 impairment of product, 
marketing and distribution rights also includes an impairment of $150m reflecting a lower probability of success assessment for TC-5214, 
based on the results of the first two of four Phase III efficacy and tolerability studies. The remaining $117m charge relates to the termination 
of other development projects during the year.
The 2010 impairment of product, marketing and distribution rights results from the withdrawal of the biological licence application 
pending at the FDA for motavizumab ($445m) and the termination of the lesogaberan development ($128m) and other development 
projects in the year. The 2010 impairment of other intangibles chiefly results from a reassessment of the future royalties expected  
to be received relating to the HPV cervical cancer vaccine.
The write downs in value of intangible assets, other than those arising from termination of research and development activities, were 
determined based on value in use calculations using discounted risk-adjusted projections of the products’ expected cash flows over 
a period reflecting the patent-protected lives of the individual products. The full period of projections is covered by internal budgets and 
forecasts. In arriving at the appropriate discount rate to use for each product, we adjust AstraZeneca’s post-tax weighted average cost 
of capital (7.0% for 2012, 2011 and 2010) to reflect the impact of risks and tax effects specific to the individual products. The weighted 
average pre-tax discount rate we used was approximately 14% (2011: 14%; 2010: 14%).

Collaboration with BMS on Amylin products
On 8 August 2012, BMS completed its acquisition of Amylin. On that date, AstraZeneca and BMS entered into collaboration arrangements, 
based substantially on the framework of the existing diabetes alliance, regarding the development and commercialisation of Amylin’s 
portfolio of products. Under the terms of the collaboration, the companies will jointly undertake the global selling and marketing activities 
in relation to the collaboration products. BMS will undertake all manufacturing activities with AstraZeneca receiving collaboration product 
at cost. Profits and losses arising from the collaboration will be shared equally.
The total consideration for AstraZeneca’s participation in the collaboration is $3.7bn, including an amount of $135m relating to an option 
of AstraZeneca contained in the collaboration agreement to acquire certain additional governance rights in respect of the collaboration. 
The Group notified BMS of its decision to exercise the option in August 2012 and the balance of $135m will be payable once applicable 
anti-trust and competition approvals are received by AstraZeneca. The Group expects to make this payment in the first half of 2013. 
Upon such payment, the additional governance rights of AstraZeneca granted by the option will become legally effective.
AstraZeneca considers that the key strategic and financial decisions over which the collaboration agreement and the governance rights 
that are subject to the option grant joint control, represent the activities most relevant in affecting the success of the collaboration. 
AstraZeneca accounts for the collaboration as a jointly controlled operation. The Group has recognised a 50% share of collaboration 
revenues amounting to $128m, cost of sales of $36m and other costs, excluding amortisation, of $133m, in its income statement 
from 9 August 2012. An amount of $165m was owed to BMS under this arrangement, recorded within trade and other payables, 
at 31 December 2012.
AstraZeneca’s payment to BMS for its participation in the collaboration primarily results in the purchase of intangible assets, valued at 
$3,358m, related to the collaboration products: Byetta (exenatide) injection and Bydureon (exenatide extended-release for injectable 
suspension/exenatide 2mg powder and solvent for prolonged release suspension for injection) that are approved for use in both the US 
and Europe, Symlin (pramlinitide acetate) injection that is approved for use in the US, and metreleptin, a leptin analogue currently under 
review at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of diabetes and/or hypertriglyceridaemia in patients with rare forms 
of inherited or acquired lipodystrophy. In addition, a prepayment of $0.4bn has been recognised representing payments in advance for 
collaboration products.
Arrangements with Merck
In 1982, Astra set up a joint venture with Merck & Co., Inc. (now Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of the new Merck & Co., 
Inc. that resulted from the merger with Schering-Plough) (‘Merck’) for the purposes of selling, marketing and distributing certain Astra 
products in the US. In 1998, this joint venture was restructured (the ‘Restructuring’). Under the agreements relating to the Restructuring 
(the ‘Agreements’), a US limited partnership (the ‘Partnership’) was formed, in which Merck is the limited partner and AstraZeneca is 
the general partner, and AstraZeneca obtained control of the joint venture’s business subject to certain limited partner and other rights 
held by Merck and its affiliates. These rights provide Merck with safeguards over the activities of the Partnership and place limitations 
on AstraZeneca’s commercial freedom to operate. The Agreements provide, in part, for: 
 > Annual contingent payments; and 
 > Termination arrangements which cause Merck to relinquish its interests in AstraZeneca’s products and activities in stages, some  
of which are mandatory and others optional. 
The termination arrangements and payments include: 
 > the Advance Payment 
 > the Partial Retirement 
 > the True-Up 
 > the Loan Note Receivable 
 > the First Option 
 > the Second Option. 
AstraZeneca considers that the termination arrangements described above represent the acquisition, in stages, of Merck’s interests in 
the Partnership and Agreement products (including Merck’s rights to contingent payments). Once all payments are made, AstraZeneca 
will have unencumbered discretion in its operations in the US market. AstraZeneca anticipates that the benefits that accrue under all  
of the termination arrangements arise from: 
 > The substantial freedom over products acquired or discovered after the merger of Astra and Zeneca in 1999; and 
 > Enhanced contributions from, and substantial freedom over, those products that have already been launched  
(for example, Prilosec, Nexium, Brilinta, Pulmicort, Symbicort, Rhinocort and Atacand) and those that are in development. 
Economic benefits include relief from contingent payments and other cost efficiencies, together with the strategic advantages of increased 
freedom to operate. 
The intangible assets relating to purchased product rights are subject to impairment testing and would be partially or wholly impaired  
if a product is withdrawn or if activity in any of the affected therapy areas is significantly curtailed. 
Annual Contingent Payments
AstraZeneca makes ongoing payments to Merck based on sales of certain of its products in the US (the ‘contingent payments’ on  
the Agreement products). Contingent payments in respect of Prilosec and Nexium will continue until the Second Option is exercised 
and consummated (as discussed under Second Option below). Contingent payments on all other agreement products have ceased  
as discussed under First Option below. Financial Statements | Notes to the Group Financial Statements

9 Intangible assets continued 
Advance Payment 
The merger between Astra and Zeneca in 1999 triggered the first step in the termination arrangements. Merck relinquished all rights, 
including contingent payments on future sales, to potential Astra products with no existing or pending US patents at the time of the 
merger. As a result, AstraZeneca now has rights to such products and is relieved of potential obligations to Merck and restrictions in 
respect of those products (including annual contingent payments), affording AstraZeneca substantial freedom to exploit the products 
as it sees fit. At the time of the merger, the Advance Payment of $967m was made. The Advance Payment has been accounted for as 
an intangible asset and is being amortised over 20 years. Although the rights obtained apply in perpetuity, the period of amortisation  
of 20 years is used to reflect the typical timescale of development and marketing of a product. 
Partial Retirement, True-Up and Loan Note Receivable 
On 17 March 2008, AstraZeneca made a net cash payment to Merck of approximately $2.6bn in connection with the Partial Retirement, 
the True-Up and the Loan Note Receivable. This payment resulted in AstraZeneca acquiring Merck’s interests in certain AstraZeneca 
products (including Pulmicort, Rhinocort, Symbicort and Toprol-XL), AstraZeneca ceasing contingent payments on these products  
and AstraZeneca obtaining the ability to exploit these products and other opportunities in the Respiratory therapy area. Intangible 
assets of $994m were recognised at the time with the balance of the net payment ($1,656m) representing payments on account for 
future product rights associated with the First Option and the Second Option as detailed below. These ‘non-refundable deposits’  
were classified as intangible assets. 
First Option 
On 26 February 2010, AstraZeneca exercised the First Option. Payment of $647m to Merck was made on 30 April 2010. This payment 
resulted in AstraZeneca acquiring Merck’s interests in products covered by the First Option including Entocort, Atacand, Plendil and certain 
products in development at the time (principally Brilinta and lesogaberan; development of lesogaberan subsequently was discontinued). 
Also on 30 April 2010, contingent payments on these products ceased with respect to periods after this date and AstraZeneca obtained 
the ability to exploit these products and other opportunities in the Cardiovascular and Neuroscience Therapy Areas. These rights were 
valued at $1,829m and were recognised as intangible assets from 26 February 2010 ($1, 182m having been transferred from non-refundable 
deposits to supplement the payment of $647m to Merck). Of these rights, $689m was allocated to contingent payment relief and $1,140m 
to intangible assets reflecting the ability to fully exploit the products in the Cardiovascular and Neuroscience Therapy Areas. The 
remaining non-refundable deposits of $474m relate to benefits that would be secured upon AstraZeneca exercising the Second Option.
Second Option
The Agreements provided that AstraZeneca may exercise a Second Option to purchase Merck’s interests in the Merck affiliates that hold 
the limited partner and other rights referred to above. Exercise of the Second Option would result in the repurchase by AstraZeneca of 
Merck’s interests in Prilosec and Nexium in the US. This option was exercisable by AstraZeneca in May to October of 2012, or in 2017 , 
or if combined annual sales of the two products fell below a minimum amount. 
On 26 June 2012, AstraZeneca and Merck agreed to amend certain provisions of the Agreements with respect to the Second Option. 
The principal areas covered by the amendments are a change in the timing for AstraZeneca to exercise the Second Option, and 
agreement on the valuation methodology for setting certain aspects of the option exercise price. Under the amended Agreements, 
Merck has granted to AstraZeneca a new Second Option exercisable by AstraZeneca between 1 March 2014 and 30 April 2014, with 
closing on 30 June 2014. Options exercisable in 2017 or if combined annual sales fall below a minimum amount also remain available 
to AstraZeneca. In addition to this revised timing for the Second Option, AstraZeneca and Merck have also reached agreement on the 
valuation methodology for setting certain components of the option exercise price for a 2014 exercise. In lieu of third-party appraisals, 
the valuation for a 2014 exercise is now a fixed sum of $327m, based on a shared view by AstraZeneca and Merck of the forecasts for 
sales of Nexium and Prilosec in the US market. The agreed amount that would be payable on 30 June 2014 is subject to a true-up in 
2018 that replaces a shared forecast with actual sales for the period from closing in 2014 to June 2018. In addition, the exercise price 
for the Second Option also includes a multiple of ten times Merck’s average 1% annual profit allocation in the Partnership for the three 
years prior to exercise. AstraZeneca currently expects this amount to be around $80m. The component of the exercise price of the 
Second Option that includes the net present value of up to 5% of future US sales of Vimovo, with the precise amount dependent on 
an annual sales threshold that has not yet been achieved and the timing of the option exercise, will continue.
AstraZeneca believes that the amendments provide a greater degree of certainty to the valuation of the Second Option that is preferable 
to the previous arrangements and, barring unforeseen circumstances, AstraZeneca now intends to exercise the Second Option in 2014.
Under the amendments, if AstraZeneca exercises in 2014, Merck’s existing rights to manufacture Nexium and Prilosec would cease upon 
closing. In connection with the amendments, Merck also granted AstraZeneca flexibility to exploit certain commercial opportunities with 
respect to Nexium. 
AstraZeneca now considers that exercise of the Second Option is virtually certain. This judgement is supported by management’s view 
that: AstraZeneca is fully committed to exercising the Second Option in 2014, barring unforeseen circumstances; external announcements 
of that intention constructively oblige AstraZeneca to exercise in 2014, barring unforeseen circumstances; and the Second Option price 
is highly favourable, giving economic compulsion for AstraZeneca to exercise in 2014. As such, AstraZeneca has applied an accounting 
treatment to reflect the Second Option as if the date of exercise were 26 June 2012 (the date of amendment of the Agreements), resulting 
in liabilities to Merck of approximately $1.5bn ($1.1bn of which will be paid by way of monthly contingent payments between 1 July 2012 
and 30 June 2014 and the balance as a lump sum on 30 June 2014), and a corresponding increase to intangible assets, from that date. 
These intangible assets, and the $474m from the First Option (detailed above), in aggregate, reflect the value of the ability to exploit 
opportunities in the Gastrointestinal Therapy Area and relief from contingent payments. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 163

Equity securities available for sale which are analysed at Level 3 represent investments in private biotech companies. In the absence of 
specific market data, these unlisted investments are held at cost, adjusted as necessary for impairments, which approximates to fair value. 
Hence, carrying value is adjusted only for additions, sales and permanent impairment and for no other movement. Consequently, in the 
current year, no change has been made to the fair value of individual investments.

 Included within borrowings held at amortised cost are amounts designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations of $1,551m (2011: $1,505m; 2010: $1,528m) held at amortised cost. 
The fair value of these borrowings was $1,808m at 31 December 2012 (2011: $1,752m; 2010: $1,687m).
The fair value of fixed-rate publicly traded debt is based on year end quoted market prices; the fair value of floating rate debt is nominal 
value, as mark to market differences would be minimal given the frequency of resets. The carrying value of loans designated at fair value 
through profit or loss is the fair value, this falls within the Level 1 valuation method as defined in Note 10. For loans designated in a fair 
value hedge relationship, carrying value is initially measured at fair value and remeasured for fair value changes in respect of the hedged 
risk at each reporting date. All other loans are held at amortised cost.
A loss of $10m was made during the year on the fair value of bonds designated at fair value through profit or loss, due to decreased 
credit risk. A gain of $34m has been made on these bonds since designation due to increased credit risk. Changes in credit risk had 
no material effect on any other financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value in the Group’s Financial Statements. The change in 
fair value attributable to changes in credit risk is calculated as the change in fair value not attributable to market risk. The amount payable 
at maturity on bonds designated at fair value through profit or loss is $1,037m.
The interest rates used to discount future cash flows for fair value adjustments, where applicable, are based on market swap curves  
at the reporting date, and were as follows:

All derivatives are held at fair value and fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as defined in Note 10. None of the derivatives have 
been reclassified in the year.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps is estimated using appropriate zero coupon curve valuation techniques 
to discount future contractual cash flows based on rates at current year end.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows using appropriate yield 
curves based on market forward foreign exchange rates at the year end. The majority of forward foreign exchange contracts for existing 
transactions had maturities of less than one month from year end. 
The interest rates used to discount future cash flows for fair value adjustments, where applicable, are based on market swap curves  
at the reporting date, and were as follows:

AstraZeneca is undergoing a global restructuring initiative which involves rationalisation of the Global Supply Chain, the Sales and 
Marketing Organisation, IS and business support infrastructure and R&D. Employee costs in connection with the initiatives are recognised 
in severance provisions.
Details of the environmental and legal provisions are provided in Note 25.
Employee benefit provisions include the executive deferred bonus plan. Further details are included in Note 24.
Other provisions comprise amounts relating to specific contractual or constructive obligations and disputes.
No provision has been released or applied for any purpose other than that for which it was established.

Pensions
Background
The Company and most of its subsidiaries offer retirement plans which cover the majority of employees in the Group. Many of these plans 
are ‘defined contribution’, where AstraZeneca’s contribution and resulting charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees’ 
pay. However, several plans, mainly in the UK, the US and Sweden, are ‘defined benefit’, where benefits are based on employees’ length 
of service and average final salary (typically averaged over one, three or five years). The major defined benefit plans, apart from the 
collectively bargained Swedish plan (which is still open to employees born before 1979), have been closed to new entrants since 2000.
The major defined benefit plans are funded through legally separate, fiduciary-administered funds. The cash funding of the plans, which 
may from time to time involve special payments, is designed, in consultation with independent qualified actuaries, to ensure that the assets 
together with future contributions should be sufficient to meet future obligations. The funding is monitored rigorously by AstraZeneca 
and appropriate fiduciaries specifically with reference to AstraZeneca’s credit rating, market capitalisation, cash flows and the solvency 
of the relevant pension scheme.
Financing Principles
97% of the Group’s defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2012 are in schemes within the UK, the US, Sweden or Germany. In these 
countries, the pension obligations are funded with reference to the following financing principles:
 > The Group has a fundamental belief in funding the benefits it promises to employees.
 > The Group considers its pension arrangements in the context of its broader capital structure. In general, it does not believe in committing 
excessive capital for funding while it has better uses of capital within the business nor does it wish to generate surpluses.
 > The pension funds are not part of the Group’s core business. The Group believes in taking some rewarded risks with the investments 
underlying the funding, subject to a medium to long-term plan to reduce those risks if opportunities arise.
 > The Group recognises that deciding to hold certain investments may cause volatility in the funding position. The Group would not  
wish to amend its contribution level for relatively small deviations from its preferred funding level, because it is expected that there  
will be short-term volatility, but it is prepared to react appropriately to more significant deviations. 
 > In the event that local regulations require an additional level of financing, the Group would consider the use of alternative methods  
of providing this that do not require immediate cash funding but help mitigate exposure of the pension arrangement to the credit risk 
of the Group.
These principles are appropriate to AstraZeneca’s business at the present date; should circumstances change they may require review. Financial Statements | Notes to the Group Financial Statements
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 168
18 Post-retirement benefits continued
AstraZeneca has developed a funding framework to implement these principles. This determines the cash contributions payable to the 
pension funds, but does not affect the IAS 19 liabilities. To reduce the risk of committing excess capital to pension funds, liability valuations 
are based on the expected return on the actual pension assets, rather than a corporate bond yield. At present, this puts a different, lower 
value on the liabilities than IAS 19.
UK
With regard to the Group’s UK defined benefit fund, the above principles are modified in light of the UK regulatory requirements and 
resulting discussions with the Pension Fund Trustee. The most recent full actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 March 2010.  
The next valuation is due at 31 March 2013.
Under the agreed funding principles for the UK, cash contributions will be paid to the UK Pension Fund to target a level of assets in excess 
of the current expected cost of providing benefits. In addition, AstraZeneca will make contributions to an escrow account which will  
be held outside of the UK Pension Fund. The escrow account assets will be payable to the fund in agreed circumstances, for example, 
in the event of AstraZeneca and the Pension Fund Trustee agreeing on a change to the current long-term investment strategy.
The market value of the fund’s assets at the valuation date was £3,129m ($4,832m equivalent), representing 79% of the fund’s actuarially 
assessed liabilities (Technical Provisions). The Company agreed to fund the shortfall by making payments of £72.5m ($112m) a year until 
31 December 2011 and then lump sum payments totalling £715m ($1,103m). The first of these lump sum payments of £180m ($278m) 
was paid into the UK Pension Fund in December 2011 from existing investments held in escrow for the Pension Fund. A further £300m 
($463m) was paid into the UK Pension Fund during January 2012 from existing investments held in escrow and the balance will be paid 
in due course. This is in addition to the contributions required to meet the ongoing benefits accruing in the region of £24m ($37m) per 
annum. In 2011, £132m ($213m) was paid into the escrow account and a further £230m ($355m) was paid in during January 2012. 
At 31 December 2012, £462m ($748m) of escrow fund assets are included within other investments (see Note 10).
Under the agreed funding principles used to set the Technical Provisions, the key assumptions as at 31 March 2010 are as follows: 
long-term UK price inflation set at 3.8% per annum, salary increases at 0% per annum (as a result of pensionable pay levels being 
frozen in 2010), pension increases at 3.55% per annum and investment returns at 5.9% per annum.
During the first half of 2010, following consultation with its UK employees’ representatives, AstraZeneca introduced a freeze on pensionable 
pay at 30 June 2010 levels for defined benefit members of the UK Pension Fund. The defined benefit fund remains open to existing 
members and employees who choose to leave the defined benefit fund will retain a deferred pension in addition to being offered membership 
in a new Group Self Invested Personal Pension Plan.
The amendment to the UK defined benefit fund to freeze pensionable pay at 30 June 2010 levels represents an accounting curtailment 
of certain pension obligations. The majority of members opted to remain in the defined benefit fund and continue benefit accrual with 
frozen pensionable pay. In accordance with IAS 19, the scheme obligations were revalued by the scheme actuaries immediately prior 
to the change and assumptions reviewed at that date. The resulting credit of $693m was recognised in profit in 2010.
Rest of Group
The IAS 19 positions as at 31 December 2012 are shown below for each of the other countries with significant defined benefit plans. 
These plans account for 92% of the Group’s defined benefit obligations outside of the UK. These plans are funded in line with the 
financing principles and contributions paid as prescribed by the funding framework.
 > The US defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2012, when plan obligations were $1,917m and plan 
assets were $1,679m. This includes obligations in respect of the non-qualified plan which is largely unfunded.
 > The Swedish defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2012, when plan obligations were estimated 
to amount to $1,889m and plan assets were $1,125m.
 > The German defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2012, when plan obligations amounted 
to $355m and plan assets were $23m. 
On current bases, it is expected that contributions (excluding those in respect of past service cost) during the year ending 31 December 
2013 to the four main countries will be $537m.
Post-retirement benefits other than pensions
In the US, and to a lesser extent in certain other countries, AstraZeneca’s employment practices include the provision of healthcare and 
life assurance benefits for retired employees. As at 31 December 2012, some 3,528 retired employees and covered dependants currently 
benefit from these provisions and some 8,893 current employees will be eligible on their retirement. AstraZeneca accrues for the present 
value of such retiree obligations over the working life of the employee. In practice, these benefits will be funded with reference to the 
financing principles.
The cost of post-retirement benefits other than pensions for the Group in 2012 was $16m (2011: $12m; 2010: $18m). Plan assets  
were $301m and plan obligations were $363m at 31 December 2012. These benefit plans have been included in the disclosure  
of post-retirement benefits under IAS 19. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 169

Qualified independent actuaries have updated the actuarial valuations under IAS 19 of the major defined benefit schemes operated by 
the Group to 31 December 2012. The assumptions used by the actuaries are chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions 
which, due to the long-term nature of the schemes, may not necessarily be borne out in practice. These assumptions were as follows:

 Pensionable pay frozen at 30 June 2010 levels following UK fund changes.
The expected return on assets is determined with reference to the expected long-term level of dividends, interest and other returns 
derived from the plan assets, together with realised and unrealised gains or losses on the plan assets, less any costs of administering 
the plan, less any tax payable by the plan. The expected returns are based on long-term market expectations and analysed on a regular 
basis to ensure that any sustained movements in underlying markets are reflected.
Demographic assumptions
The mortality assumptions are based on country-specific mortality tables. These are compared to actual AstraZeneca experience and 
adjusted where sufficient data is available. Additional allowance for future improvements in life expectancy is included for all major schemes 
where there is credible data to support this continuing trend.
The table below illustrates life expectancy assumptions at age 65 for male members retiring in 2012 and members expected to retire  
in 2032 (2011: 2011 and 2031 respectively).

Post-retirement scheme deficit
The assets and obligations of the defined benefit schemes operated by the Group at 31 December 2012, as calculated in accordance 
with IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’, are shown below. The fair values of the schemes’ assets are not intended to be realised in the short 
term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised. The present value of the schemes’ obligations is derived from 
cash flow projections over long periods and is therefore inherently uncertain.

Included in total assets and obligations for the UK is $427m (2011: $388m) in respect of members’ defined contribution sections of  
the scheme. Group costs in respect of defined contribution schemes during the year were $249m (2011: $262m). $127m past service 
cost in 2012 relates predominantly to enhanced pensions on early retirement in the UK and Sweden. $50m settlements and curtailments 
credit in 2012 predominantly relate to a settlement credit of $30m recognised in the US, where a proportion of deferred inactive 
participants who are not yet eligible for retirement elected to exchange their plan benefit for immediate cash lump sums, and a $25m 
curtailment credit recognised in Sweden as a consequence of the Södertälje site closure. During 2011, the Group disposed of Astra 
Tech (see Note 22) resulting in a curtailment gain of $44m.

2012 acquisitions
Ardea
On 19 June 2012, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Ardea. Ardea is a US (San Diego, California) based biotechnology company 
focused on the development of small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of serious diseases. AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Ardea’s 
shares for cash consideration of $1,268m. The acquisition strengthens our research and development capabilities in the respiratory and 
inflammation therapy area.
In most business acquisitions, there is a part of the cost that is not capable of being attributed in accounting terms to identifiable assets 
and liabilities acquired and is therefore recognised as goodwill. In the case of the acquisition of Ardea, this goodwill is underpinned by 
a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified. Most significant among these is the premium attributable to a highly- 
skilled workforce and established experience in the field of gout. 
Ardea’s results have been consolidated into the Group’s results from 20 June 2012. For the period from acquisition to 31 December 2012, 
Ardea’s revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Group’s revenue, and its loss after tax was $43m. If the acquisition had taken effect 
at the beginning of the reporting period (1 January 2012), on a pro forma basis, the revenue of the combined Group for 2012 would have 
been unchanged and the profit after tax would have been $6,245m. This pro forma information has been prepared taking into account 
any amortisation, interest costs and related tax effects but does not purport to represent the results of the combined Group that actually 
would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2012 and should not be taken to be representative of future results.

Astra Tech
On 31 August 2011, the Group completed the sale of the Astra Tech business to DENTSPLY International Inc. On the loss of control, 
the Group derecognised the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary. The surplus arising on the loss of control is recognised in profit. 
Astra Tech’s results were consolidated for the period until disposal and contributed $386m in 2011 (2010: $535m) in revenue and $16m

Novexel
On 3 March 2010, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Novexel. Novexel is a research company focused on the infection therapy 
area and is based in France. This acquisition strengthens our research capabilities in the infection therapy area. AstraZeneca acquired 
100% of Novexel’s shares for an upfront consideration of $427m; with additional consideration of up to $75m becoming payable to 
Novexel shareholders on the completion of certain development milestones. At both the date of acquisition and at 31 December 2010, 
the fair value of this contingent consideration was $50m. For the ten month period post-acquisition to the end of 2010 and the full 2010 
year, Novexel had no revenues and its loss was immaterial.

Subsequent to the completion of the acquisition of Novexel, AstraZeneca entered into a collaboration with Forest on the future 
co-development and commercialisation of two late-stage antibiotic development programmes acquired with Novexel: ceftazidime/NXL -104 
(CAZ-104) and ceftaroline/NXL -104 (CEF-104). These antibiotic combinations utilise Novexel’s novel investigational beta-lactamase inhibitor 
NXL -104 to overcome antibiotic resistance and treat the increasing number of infections resistant to existing therapies. In addition, Forest 
acquired rights to CAZ-104 in North America and bought down payment obligations to Novexel in relation to CEF-104 from previous existing 
licence arrangements. In consideration for these rights, Forest paid Novexel, then an AstraZeneca Group company, a sum of $210m 
on 3 March 2010 and will also pay additional sums equivalent to half of any future specified development milestone payments that 
become payable by AstraZeneca. This consideration is equivalent to the fair value attributed on acquisition to those assets and hence 
there was no profit impact from this divestment.
In 2011, the contingent consideration of $50m became fully payable. The fair value of the remaining contingent consideration arising  
on the Novexel acquisition is $nil. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 175
Strategy Performance Corporate Governance Additional Information Financial Statements Overview
23 Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, finance leases, loans, current and non-current 
investments, cash and short-term deposits. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Group’s funding and liquidity 
requirements. The Group has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from 
its operations. 
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of liquidity, interest rate, foreign currency and credit. Each of these 
is managed in accordance with Board-approved policies. These policies are set out below.
The Group uses foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps for the purpose 
of hedging its foreign currency and interest rate risks. The Group may designate certain financial instruments as either fair value hedges or 
net investment hedges in accordance with IAS 39. Key controls applied to transactions in derivative financial instruments are: to use only 
instruments where good market liquidity exists, to revalue all financial instruments regularly using current market rates and to sell options 
only to offset previously purchased options. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Capital management
The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders’ equity (Note 20), debt (Note 14) and cash (Note 13). For the foreseeable future, 
the Board will maintain a capital structure that supports the Group’s strategic objectives through:
 > managing funding and liquidity risk
 > optimising shareholder return
 > maintaining a strong, investment-grade credit rating.
Funding and liquidity risk are reviewed regularly by the Board and managed in accordance with policies described below.
The Board’s distribution policy comprises a regular cash dividend, and subject to business needs, a share repurchase component. 
The Board regularly reviews its shareholders’ return strategy and in 2012 decided to suspend share repurchases in order to retain strategic 
flexibility. In addition, we are restating our dividend cover target in terms of reported earnings adjusted for restructuring costs, intangible 
asset amortisation and impairments and other items as determined by the Group, and are targeting two times cover on this measure.
The Group’s net funds position (loans and borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents, current investments and derivative financial 
instruments) has decreased from $2,849m at the beginning of the year to a net debt position of $1,369m at 31 December 2012 as a 
result of reduced operating cash inflows, substantial investment activities and share repurchases in 2012, offset by reduced tax cash 
outflows and fixed deposits maturing in the year.
Liquidity risk
The Board reviews the Group’s ongoing liquidity risks annually as part of the planning process and on an ad hoc basis. The Board considers 
short-term requirements against available sources of funding, taking into account forecast cash flows. The Group manages liquidity risk 
by maintaining access to a number of sources of funding which are sufficient to meet anticipated funding requirements. Specifically, the 
Group uses US commercial paper, committed bank facilities and cash resources to manage short-term liquidity and manages long-term 
liquidity by raising funds through the capital markets. The Group is assigned short-term credit ratings of P-1 by Moody’s and A-1+ by 
Standard and Poor’s. The Group’s long-term credit rating is A1 negative outlook by Moody’s and AA- stable outlook by Standard and Poor’s.
In addition to cash and cash equivalents of $7 ,701m, fixed deposits of $46m, less overdrafts of $105m at 31 December 2012, the Group 
has committed bank facilities of $3.0bn available to manage liquidity. At 31 December 2012, the Group has issued $1,551m under a Euro 
Medium Term Note programme and $7 ,796m under a SEC-registered programme. The Group regularly monitors the credit standing of the 
banking group and currently does not anticipate any issue with drawing on the committed facilities should this be necessary. The committed 
facilities of $3.0bn mature in April 2017 and were undrawn at 31 December 2012. Financial Statements | Notes to the Group Financial Statements

Where interest payments are on a floating rate basis, it is assumed that rates will remain unchanged from the last business day of each 
year ended 31 December.
It is not expected that the cash flows in the maturity profile could occur significantly earlier or at significantly different amounts.
Market risk
Interest rate risk
The Group maintains a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. The portion of fixed rate debt was approved by the Board and any variation 
requires Board approval. A significant portion of the long-term debt entered into in 2007 in order to finance the acquisition of MedImmune 
has been held at fixed rates of interest. The Group uses interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage this mix.
At 31 December 2012, the Group held interest rate swaps with a notional value of $1.8bn, converting the 5.4% callable bond maturing in 
2014, and the 7% guaranteed debentures payable in 2023 to floating rates and partially converting the 5.9% callable bond maturing in 2017 
to floating rates. No new interest rate swaps were entered into during 2012 or 2011. At 31 December 2012, swaps with a notional value 
of $0.75bn were designated in fair value hedge relationships and swaps with a notional value of $1.0bn related to debt designated as fair 
value through profit or loss. Designated hedges are expected to be effective and therefore the impact of ineffectiveness on profit is not 
expected to be material. The accounting treatment for fair value hedges and debt designated as fair value through profit or loss is disclosed 
in the Group Accounting Policies section from page 146.
The majority of surplus cash is currently invested in US dollar liquidity funds earning floating rates of interest. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 177

In addition to the financial assets above, there are $7 ,924m (2011: $8,747m; 2010: $7 ,829m) of other current and non-current asset 
investments and other financial assets on which no interest is received. 
Foreign currency risk
The US dollar is the Group’s most significant currency. As a consequence, the Group results are presented in US dollars and exposures 
are managed against US dollars accordingly.
Translational
Approximately 62% of Group external sales in 2012 were denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, while a significant proportion 
of manufacturing and research and development costs were denominated in pounds sterling and Swedish krona. Surplus cash generated 
by business units is substantially converted to, and held centrally in, US dollars. As a result, operating profit and total cash flow in US 
dollars will be affected by movements in exchange rates.
This currency exposure is managed centrally, based on forecast cash flows including the principal currencies of Swedish krona (SEK), 
pounds sterling (GBP), euro (EUR), Australian dollar (AUD), Canadian dollar (CAD), Japanese yen (JPY), Romanian leu (RON) and Russian 
ruble (RUB). The impact of movements in exchange rates is mitigated significantly by the correlations which exist between the major 
currencies to which the Group is exposed and the US dollar. Monitoring of currency exposures and correlations is undertaken on  
a regular basis and hedging is subject to pre-execution approval. 
Where there is non-US dollar debt and an underlying net investment of that amount in the same currency, the Group applies net investment 
hedging. As at 31 December 2012, 5.4% of interest-bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in pounds sterling and 9.6% of 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in euros. Exchange differences on the retranslation of debt designated as net 
investment hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective. Any ineffectiveness is taken 
to profit. Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings not designated in a hedge relationship are taken to profit.
During 2012, the Group entered into a cross-currency swap to convert $750m of the 1.95% 2019 maturing bond into fixed Japanese 
yen debt. This instrument was designated in a net investment hedge against the foreign currency risk of the Group’s Japanese yen net 
assets. Fair value movements on the revaluation of the cross-currency swap are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent 
that the hedge is effective. Any ineffectiveness would be taken to profit.
Transactional
One hundred percent of the Group’s major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up 
to three months, are hedged, where practicable, using forward foreign exchange contracts against individual Group companies’ reporting 
currency. In addition, the Group’s external dividend, which is paid principally in pounds sterling and Swedish krona, is fully hedged from 
announcement to payment date. Foreign exchange gains and losses on forward contracts transacted for transactional hedging are taken 
to profit.
The table below sets out the principal foreign exchange contracts outstanding at 31 December 2012, 31 December 201 1 and 31 December 
2010 along with the underlying gross exposure as defined above.

Sensitivity analysis 
The sensitivity analysis set out below summarises the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes 
in market rates and prices. The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflects our view of changes which are reasonably 
possible over a one-year period. Market values are the present value of future cash flows based on market rates and prices at the valuation 
date. For long-term debt, an increase in interest rates results in a decline in the fair value of debt.
The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31 December 
2012, with all other variables held constant. Based on the composition of our long-term debt portfolio as at 31 December 2012, a 1% 
increase in interest rates would result in an additional $30m in interest expense being incurred per year. The exchange rate sensitivity 
analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 31 December 2012, with all other 
variables held constant. The +10% case assumes a 10% strengthening of the US dollar against all other currencies and the -10% case 
assumes a 10% weakening of the US dollar.
Each incremental 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have approximately the same effect as the initial 10% detailed 
in the table below and each 1% change in interest rates would have approximately the same effect as the 1% detailed in the table below.

There has been no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the above sensitivity analysis over the three-year period.
Credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets, such as cash balances (including fixed deposits and cash and cash equivalents), 
derivative instruments, trade and other receivables. The Group is also exposed in its net asset position to its own credit risk in respect 
of the 2023 debentures and 2014 bonds which are accounted for at fair value through profit and loss.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate 
for the customer. The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government-backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately 
owned pharmacies, and the underlying local economic and sovereign risks vary throughout the world. Where appropriate, the Group 
endeavours to minimise risks by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance. The Group establishes  
an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of specific trade and other receivables where it is 
deemed that a receivable may not be recoverable. When the debt is deemed irrecoverable, the allowance account is written off against 
the underlying receivable. 
In the US, sales to three wholesalers accounted for approximately 73% of US sales (2011: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 
75%; 2010: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 73%). AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 179

The allowance for impairment has been calculated based on past experience and is in relation to specific customers. Given the profile 
of our customers, including large wholesalers and government-backed agencies, no further credit risk has been identified with the trade 
receivables not past due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made.
Other financial assets
The Group may hold significant cash balances as part of its normal operations, with the amount of cash held at any point reflecting the 
level of cash flow generated by the business and the timing of the use of that cash. The majority of excess cash is centralised within the 
Group treasury entity and is subject to counterparty risk on the principal invested. This risk is mitigated through a policy of prioritising 
security and liquidity over return, and as such cash is only invested in high credit quality investments. Counterparty limits are set according 
to the assessed risk of each counterparty and exposures are monitored against these limits on a regular basis. The majority of the Group’s 
cash is invested in US dollar AAA-rated liquidity funds and short-term bank deposits.
The most significant concentration of financial credit risk at 31 December 2012 was $6,589m invested in five US dollar AAA-rated liquidity 
funds. The liquidity fund portfolios are managed by the related external third party fund managers to maintain the AAA rating. No more 
than 15% of fund value is invested within each individual fund. There were no other significant concentrations of financial credit risk  
at the reporting date.
All financial derivatives are transacted with commercial banks, in line with standard market practice. The Group has agreements with some 
bank counterparties whereby the parties agree to post cash collateral, for the benefit of the other, equivalent to the market valuation of 
the derivative positions above a predetermined threshold. The carrying value of such cash collateral held by the Group at 31 December 
2012 was $230m (2011: $21m; 2010: $13m).

The Directors believe that, together with the basic salary system, the Group’s employee incentive schemes provide competitive and 
market-related packages to motivate employees. They should also align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, as a 
whole, through long-term share ownership in the Company. The Group’s current UK, Swedish and US schemes are described below; 
other arrangements apply elsewhere.
Bonus plans
The AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan
Employees of participating AstraZeneca UK companies are invited to participate in this bonus plan, which rewards strong individual 
performance. Bonuses in respect of performance during 2012 will be paid in cash, as they were in 2011 and 2010. The Company also 
offers UK employees the opportunity to buy Partnership Shares (Ordinary Shares). Employees may invest up to £1,500 over a 12 month 
accumulation period and purchase Partnership Shares in the Company with the total proceeds at the end of the period. The purchase 
price for the shares is the lower of the price at the beginning or the end of the 12 month period. In 2010, the Company introduced a 
Matching Share element in respect of Partnership Shares, the first award of which was made in 2011. Partnership Shares and Matching 
Shares are held in the HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC)-approved All-Employee Share Plan. At the Company’s AGM in 2002, shareholders 
approved the issue of new shares for the purposes of the All-Employee Share Plan.
The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme
This scheme is a performance bonus scheme for Directors and senior employees who do not participate in the AstraZeneca UK 
Performance Bonus Plan. Annual bonuses are paid in cash and reflect both corporate and individual performance measures. The 
Remuneration Committee has discretion to reduce or withhold bonuses if business performance falls sufficiently short of expectations 
in any year such as to make the payment of bonuses inappropriate.
The AstraZeneca Deferred Bonus Plan
This plan was introduced in 2006 and is used to defer a portion of the bonus earned under the AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus 
Scheme into Ordinary Shares in the Company for a period of three years. The plan currently operates only in respect of Executive Directors 
and members of the SET. Awards of shares under this plan are typically made in February each year, the first award having been made 
in February 2006.
Sweden
In Sweden, an all-employee performance bonus plan is in operation, which rewards strong individual performance. Bonuses are paid 50% 
into a fund investing in AstraZeneca equities and 50% in cash. The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme, the AstraZeneca 
Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan all operate in respect of relevant AstraZeneca employees 
in Sweden.
US
In the US, there are two all-employee short-term or annual performance bonus plans in operation to differentiate and reward strong 
individual performance. Annual bonuses are paid in cash. There is also one senior staff long-term incentive scheme, under which 76 
participants may be eligible for awards granted as AstraZeneca ADSs. AstraZeneca ADSs necessary to satisfy the awards are purchased 
in the market or funded via a share trust. The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan 
operate in respect of relevant employees in the US.
Share plans 
The charge for share-based payments in respect of share plans is $139m (2011: $153m; 2010: $120m). The plans are equity settled.
The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan
This plan was approved by shareholders in 2005 for a period of 10 years. Generally, awards can be granted at any time, but not during 
a close period of the Company. The first grant of awards was made in June 2005. The main grant of awards in 2012 under the plan was 
in March, with a further smaller grant in August. Awards granted under the plan vest after three years and can be subject to the achievement 
of performance conditions. For awards to all participants in 2012, except employees of MedImmune, 50% of the award will vest subject 
to the performance of the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) compared with that of a selected peer group of other pharmaceutical 
companies, and 50% will vest subject to the achievement of a net cash flow target. A separate performance condition applies to employees 
of MedImmune. The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for agreeing any awards under the plan and for setting the policy for the 
way in which the plan should be operated, including agreeing performance targets and which employees should be invited to participate. 
Further details of this plan can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report from page 122.

The AstraZeneca Investment Plan
This plan was introduced in 2010 and approved by shareholders at the 2010 AGM. The main grant of awards in 2012 under the plan was 
in March, with a further smaller grant in October. Awards granted under the plan vest after eight years and are subject to performance 
conditions measured over a period of between three and eight years. For awards granted in 2012, the performance conditions relate  
to the annual dividend paid to shareholders and dividend cover over a four year performance period. The awards are then subject to a 
four year holding period before they can vest. The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for agreeing any awards under the plan 
and for setting the policy for the way in which the plan should be operated, including agreeing performance targets and which employees 
should be invited to participate. Further details of this plan can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report from page 122.

Share option plans
The charge for share-based payments in respect of share options is $7m (201 1: $37m; 2010: $53m) which is comprised entirely of equity-
settled transactions. At 31 December 2012, the only significant options outstanding were under the AstraZeneca Share Option Plan.
AstraZeneca Share Option Plan
This is a share option plan for employees of participating AstraZeneca Group companies which was approved by shareholders at the 
Company’s AGM in 2000 for a period of 10 years. The first grant of options occurred in August 2000. The final grant of options under 
the plan was in August 2009, since when no further grants have been or will be made. Options are not transferable. Options were granted 
over AstraZeneca Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
The price per Ordinary Share payable upon the exercise of an option is not less than an amount equal to the average of the middle-market 
closing price for an Ordinary Share or ADS of the Company on the London or New York Stock Exchange on the three consecutive dealing 
days immediately before the date of grant (or as otherwise agreed with HM Revenue & Customs). Where the option is an option to subscribe, 
the price payable upon exercise cannot be less than the nominal value of an Ordinary Share of the Company.
An option will normally be exercisable between three and 10 years following its grant provided any relevant performance condition has 
been satisfied. Options may be satisfied by the issue of new Ordinary Shares or by existing Ordinary Shares purchased in the market. 
The Remuneration Committee sets the policy for the Company’s operation of the plan including as regards whether any performance 
target(s) will apply to the grant and/or exercise of each eligible employee’s option. Options normally lapse on cessation of employment. 
Exercise is, however, permitted for a limited period following cessation of employment either for reasons of injury or disability, redundancy 
or retirement, or at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, and on an amalgamation, take-over or winding-up of the Company.

Research and development collaboration payments
The Group has various ongoing collaborations including in-licensing and similar arrangements with development partners. Such collaborations 
may require the Group to make payments on achievement of stages of development, launch or revenue milestones, although the Group 
generally has the right to terminate these agreements at no cost. The Group recognises research and development milestones as 
intangible assets once it is committed to payment, which is generally when the Group reaches set trigger points in the development 
cycle. Revenue-related milestones are recognised as intangible assets on product launch at a value based on the Group’s long-term 
revenue forecasts for the related product. The table below indicates potential development and revenue-related payments that the 
Group may be required to make under such collaborations.

The table includes all potential payments for achievement of milestones under ongoing research and development arrangements. 
Revenue-related milestone payments represent the maximum possible amount payable on achievement of specified levels of revenue as 
set out in individual contract agreements, but exclude variable payments that are based on unit sales (eg royalty-type payments) which 
are expensed as the associated sale is recognised. The table excludes any payments already capitalised in the financial statements  
for the year ended 31 December 2012.
The future payments we disclose represent contracted payments and, as such, are not discounted and are not risk adjusted. As detailed 
in the Principal risks and uncertainties section from page 75, the development of any pharmaceutical product candidate is a complex and 
risky process that may fail at any stage in the development process due to a number of factors (including items such as failure to 
obtain regulatory approval, unfavourable data from key studies, adverse reactions to the product candidate or indications of other safety 
concerns). The timing of the payments is based on the Group’s current best estimate of achievement of the relevant milestone.
Environmental costs and liabilities
The Group’s expenditure on environmental protection, including 
both capital and revenue items, relates to costs which are necessary 
for implementing internal systems and programmes, and meeting 
legal and regulatory requirements for processes and products.
They are an integral part of normal ongoing expenditure for carrying 
out the Group’s research, manufacturing and commercial operations 
and are not separated from overall operating and development 
costs. There are no known changes in legal, regulatory or other 
requirements resulting in material changes to the levels of expenditure 
for 2010, 2011 or 2012.
In addition to expenditure for meeting current and foreseen 
environmental protection requirements, the Group incurs costs in 
investigating and cleaning up land and groundwater contamination. 
In particular, AstraZeneca has environmental liabilities at some 
currently or formerly owned, leased and third party sites.
In the US, Zeneca Inc., and/or its indemnitees, have been named as 
potentially responsible parties (PRPs) or defendants at approximately 
19 sites where Zeneca Inc. is likely to incur future environmental 
investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance costs under 
federal, state, statutory or common law environmental liability 
allocation schemes (together, US Environmental Consequences). 
Similarly, Stauffer Management Company LLC (SMC), which was 
established in 1987 to own and manage certain assets of Stauffer 
Chemical Company acquired that year, and/or its indemnitees, 
have been named as PRPs or defendants at 28 sites where SMC 
is likely to incur US Environmental Consequences. AstraZeneca 
has also given indemnities to third parties for a number of sites 
outside the US. These environmental liabilities arise from legacy 
operations that are not currently part of the Group’s business 
and, at most of these sites, remediation, where required, is either 
completed or nearing completion.
AstraZeneca has made provisions for the estimated costs of future 
environmental investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance 
activity beyond normal ongoing expenditure for maintaining the 
Group’s R&D and manufacturing capacity and product ranges, 
where a present obligation exists, it is probable that such costs will 
be incurred and they can be estimated reliably. With respect to such 
estimated future costs, there were provisions at 31 December 2012 
in the aggregate of $88m (201 1: $92m; 2010: $1 19m), mainly relating 
to the US. Where we are jointly liable or otherwise have cost-sharing 
agreements with third parties, we reflect only our share of the 
obligation. Where the liability is insured in part or in whole by 
insurance or other arrangements for reimbursement, an asset  
is recognised to the extent that this recovery is virtually certain.
It is possible that AstraZeneca could incur future environmental costs 
beyond the extent of our current provisions. The extent of such 
possible additional costs is inherently difficult to estimate due to 
a number of factors, including: (1) the nature and extent of claims 
that may be asserted in the future; (2) whether AstraZeneca has or 
will have any legal obligation with respect to asserted or unasserted 
claims; (3) the type of remedial action, if any, that may be selected 
at sites where the remedy is presently not known; (4) the potential 
for recoveries from or allocation of liability to third parties; and 
(5) the length of time that the environmental investigation, remediation 
and liability allocation process can take. Notwithstanding and 
subject to the foregoing, we estimate the potential additional loss for 
future environmental investigation, remediation, remedial operation 
and maintenance activity above and beyond our provisions to 
be, in aggregate, between $50m to $90m (2011: $50m to $90m; 
2010: $20m to $40m) which relates solely to the US. Financial Statements | Notes to the Group Financial Statements
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 184
IP claims include challenges to the Group’s patents on various 
products or processes and assertions of non-infringement of patents. 
A loss in any of these cases could result in loss of patent protection 
or loss of exclusivity on the related product. The consequences of 
any such loss could be a significant decrease in product sales, which 
could have a material adverse effect on our results. The lawsuits 
filed by AstraZeneca for patent infringement against companies 
that have filed ANDAs in the US, seeking to market generic forms 
of products sold by the Group prior to the expiry of the applicable 
patents covering these products, typically also involve allegations 
of non-infringement, invalidity and unenforceability of these patents 
by the ANDA filers. In the event that the Group is unsuccessful 
in these actions or the statutory 30 month stay expires before 
a ruling is obtained, the ANDA filers involved will also have the 
ability, subject to FDA approval, to introduce generic versions  
of the product concerned.
AstraZeneca has full confidence in, and will vigorously defend  
and enforce, its IP .
Over the course of the past several years, including in 2012, 
a significant number of commercial litigation claims in which 
AstraZeneca is involved have been resolved, particularly in the  
US, thereby reducing potential contingent liability exposure arising 
from such litigation. Similarly, in part due to patent litigation and 
settlement developments, greater certainty has been achieved 
regarding possible generic entry dates with respect to some of our 
patented products. At the same time, like other companies in the 
pharmaceutical sector and other industries, AstraZeneca continues 
to be subject to government investigations around the world. 
Patent Litigation
Arimidex (anastrozole) 
Patent/regulatory proceedings outside the US
In March 2012, the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal dismissed 
Mylan Pharmaceuticals ULC’s appeal against a decision prohibiting 
the Canadian Minister of Health from issuing it with a marketing 
authorisation. There is no remaining Arimidex litigation in Canada.
Atacand Plus (candesartan cilexetil/hydrochlorothiazide) 
Patent/regulatory proceedings outside the US 
In Canada, in February and May 2012, AstraZeneca settled notice 
of compliance proceedings with Cobalt Pharmaceuticals Inc., 
and Apotex Inc. respectively allowing each company to enter  
the Canadian market on 23 September 2012, or earlier, in certain 
circumstances. Generic candesartan cilexetil/hydrochlorothiazide 
entered the Canadian market in September 2012. There is no 
remaining Atacand Plus litigation in Canada.
Crestor (rosuvastatin calcium) 
US patent litigation/regulatory proceedings 
In December 2012, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit 
affirmed the decision of the US District Court for the District of 
Delaware that the substance patent protecting Crestor is valid and 
enforceable. The Federal Circuit also held that Apotex Corp. (Apotex) 
was liable as a submitter and is therefore bound by the District 
Court’s decision. In January 2013, defendants Aurobindo Pharma 
Limited, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., Mylan Pharmaceuticals 
Inc., Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, LTD., and, separately, Apotex, 
filed petitions for rehearing and rehearing en banc of aspects  
of the Federal Circuit’s decision.
AstraZeneca is also engaged in patent litigation in the US District 
Court for the District of Delaware in which it contends that a §505(b)(2) 
NDA for rosuvastatin zinc tablets infringes the substance patent for 
Crestor tablets. In March 2012, the Court ruled that, based on the 
NDA application alone, it did not have subject matter jurisdiction 
over AstraZeneca’s claims for infringement of its patents relating 
to methods of using rosuvastatin compounds to treat certain 
cardiovascular conditions. In November 2012, the Court ruled that 
Legal proceedings 
AstraZeneca is involved in various legal proceedings considered 
typical to its business, including actual or threatened litigation and/or 
actual or potential government investigations relating to employment 
matters, product liability, commercial disputes, pricing, sales and 
marketing practices, infringement of IP rights, the validity of certain 
patents and competition laws. The more significant matters are 
discussed below.
Most of the claims involve highly complex issues. Often these issues 
are subject to substantial uncertainties and, therefore, the probability 
of a loss, if any, being sustained and an estimate of the amount 
of any loss is difficult to ascertain. Consequently, for a majority  
of these claims, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate  
of the expected financial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate 
resolution of the proceedings. In these cases, AstraZeneca discloses 
information with respect to the nature and facts of the cases.
With respect to each of the legal proceedings described below, 
other than those for which provision has been made, we are unable 
to make estimates of the possible loss or range of possible losses 
at this stage, other than as set forth in this section. We also do not 
believe that disclosure of the amount sought by plaintiffs, if known, 
would be meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings. 
This is due to a number of factors, including: (1) the stage of the 
proceedings (in many cases trial dates have not been set) and the 
overall length and extent of pre-trial discovery; (2) the entitlement of 
the parties to an action to appeal a decision; (3) clarity as to theories 
of liability, damages and governing law; (4) uncertainties in timing 
of litigation; and (5) the possible need for further legal proceedings 
to establish the appropriate amount of damages, if any.
While there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any 
of the legal proceedings referred to in this Note 25, based on 
management’s current and considered view of each situation, 
we do not currently expect them to have a material adverse effect 
on our financial position. This position could of course change 
over time, not least because of the factors referred to above.
In cases that have been settled or adjudicated, or where quantifiable 
fines and penalties have been assessed and which are not subject 
to appeal (or other similar forms of relief), or where a loss is probable 
and we are able to make a reasonable estimate of the loss, we 
indicate the loss absorbed or the amount of the provision accrued. 
Further details of the legal provisions taken during the year are 
provided in Note 17.
Where it is considered that the Group is more likely than not to 
prevail, legal costs involved in defending the claim are charged 
to profit as they are incurred.
Where it is considered that the Group has a valid contract which 
provides the right to reimbursement (from insurance or otherwise) 
of legal costs and/or all or part of any loss incurred or for which 
a provision has been established, and we consider recovery to be 
virtually certain, the best estimate of the amount expected to be 
received is recognised as an asset.
Assessments as to whether or not to recognise provisions or assets, 
and of the amounts concerned, usually involve a series of complex 
judgements about future events and can rely heavily on estimates 
and assumptions. AstraZeneca believes that the provisions recorded 
are adequate based on currently available information and that the 
insurance recoveries recorded will be received. However, given the 
inherent uncertainties involved in assessing the outcomes of these 
cases, and in estimating the amount of the potential losses and 
the associated insurance recoveries, we could in the future incur 
judgments or insurance settlements that could have a material 
adverse effect on our results in any particular period.

Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium)
US patent litigation 
In 2012, AstraZeneca entered into separate agreements with three 
generic companies settling AstraZeneca’s patent infringement 
action against each generic company’s ANDA product. As part 
of each settlement, each generic company was granted a licence 
to enter the US market with its proposed ANDA version of generic 
esomeprazole magnesium on 27 May 2014, subject to regulatory 
approval, or earlier, in certain circumstances.
In January 2012, AstraZeneca received a Paragraph IV notice letter 
from Mylan Laboratories Ltd. (Mylan Laboratories). In March 2012, 
AstraZeneca commenced a patent infringement action in the 
US District Court for the District of New Jersey against Mylan 
Laboratories regarding its generic ANDA product. Trial against 
Mylan Laboratories may be scheduled in 2013. 
In 2011, AstraZeneca commenced a patent infringement action in 
the US District Court for the District of New Jersey against Hanmi 
USA Inc., et al. (Hanmi) in response to the filing of an NDA under 
§505(b)(2) for FDA approval to market 20mg and 40mg esomeprazole 
strontium capsules. Trial against Hanmi may be scheduled in 2013.
Patent proceedings outside the US
AstraZeneca is involved in proceedings in several countries outside 
the US regarding patent and/or regulatory exclusivity for Nexium, 
including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, the Czech 
Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Philippines, 
Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and 
Turkey. There is generic entry in many European markets. 
In the European Patent Office (EPO), in June and July 2011, the 
Opposition Division revoked EP 1020461 (the ’461 patent) (which 
relates to Nexium) and EP 1020460 (the ’460 patent) (which relates 
to Nexium i.v.). AstraZeneca appealed the Opposition Division’s 
decision. In November 2012, separate EPO Technical Boards of 
Appeal granted AstraZeneca’s appeals and maintained both the 
’461 patent and the ’460 patent.
In Canada, in March 2012, AstraZeneca discontinued its notice of 
compliance proceeding pending with Mylan Pharmaceuticals ULC 
(Mylan) with respect to the Canadian Nexium substance patent 
number 2.290.963 after Mylan withdrew its notice of allegation.
Also, in Canada, in October 2012, the Federal Court prohibited 
Pharmascience Inc. from receiving a marketing authorisation  
for its esomeprazole magnesium product until May 2018.
Pulmicort Respules (budesonide inhalation suspension) 
US patent litigation 
AstraZeneca’s consolidated patent infringement lawsuits against 
various generic companies for infringement of US patents directed 
to methods of use and the formulation and form of active ingredient 
for Pulmicort Respules began trial on 7 November 2012 in the 
US District Court for the District of New Jersey. Closing arguments 
are scheduled for 8 February 2013 and AstraZeneca expects 
a decision shortly thereafter. 
Seroquel IR (quetiapine fumarate) 
US regulatory proceedings 
In March 2012, in response to the FDA’s notice that generic 
Seroquel IR had been granted final approval, AstraZeneca filed 
a lawsuit in the US District Court for the District of Columbia seeking 
a temporary restraining order to vacate these approvals, and an 
injunction to enjoin any further approvals of generic quetiapine. 
In June 2012, the Court denied AstraZeneca’s motion for summary 
judgment and granted the FDA’s cross motion for summary judgment 
on the issue of exclusivity for Seroquel IR. In July 2012, AstraZeneca 
appealed that ruling to the US Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia Circuit. Generic quetiapine fumarate (Seroquel IR) entered 
the US market in March 2012.
defendant Watson Laboratories, Inc. (Watson) was precluded from 
relitigating its defence of invalidity. In December 2012, defendant 
EGIS Pharmaceuticals PLC was dismissed from the case by 
stipulation where it conceded the validity and enforceability of  
the Crestor substance patent and also agreed to be bound by 
any judgment against Watson. Trial took place in December 2012 
on the sole remaining issue of infringement of the substance 
patent. The Court will render a decision after submission of 
post-trial briefs from both parties.
As previously reported, in November 2011, AstraZeneca filed a 
Citizen Petition with the FDA in respect of Crestor requesting the 
FDA to withhold approval of any generic rosuvastatin drug product 
that omits from its labelling the diabetes-related warning and adverse 
reaction information which AstraZeneca was required to include 
in Crestor’s labelling when the FDA approved Crestor’s primary 
prevention of cardiovascular disease indication. In May 2012,  
the FDA denied the Petition. 
AstraZeneca is also defending a patent infringement lawsuit filed in 
April 2011 in the US District Court for the District of South Carolina 
by Palmetto Pharmaceuticals, LLC (Palmetto), which, among other 
claims, asserts that AstraZeneca’s Crestor sales induce infringement 
of a Palmetto patent. 
Patent proceedings outside the US 
AstraZeneca is engaged in proceedings in Australia, Brazil, Canada, 
Malaysia, Mexico, Portugal and Singapore regarding patent and/
or regulatory exclusivity for Crestor. Generic drug manufacturers 
have commenced sales of generic rosuvastatin drug products in 
Brazil, Canada, Malaysia and Mexico.
In Australia, as previously reported in 2011, AstraZeneca instituted 
proceedings against Apotex Pty Ltd asserting infringement of 
various formulation and method patents for Crestor. In January 
2012, AstraZeneca instituted similar proceedings against Watson 
Pharma Pty Ltd. and Actavis Australia Pty Ltd. AstraZeneca was 
granted preliminary injunctions against all three parties. A trial was 
held in October 2012 and a decision is pending.
In Canada, in February 2012, AstraZeneca reached settlement 
with Pharmascience Inc. (PMS) resolving the litigation regarding 
AstraZeneca’s Crestor substance patent and, as part of the 
agreement, PMS was permitted to enter the Canadian market  
on 2 April 2012, or earlier, in certain circumstances. Generic 
rosuvastatin calcium entered the Canadian market in April 2012.
Entocort EC (budesonide) 
US patent litigation
In April 2012, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed 
the US District Court for the District of Delaware’s decision that 
Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s generic budesonide product does 
not infringe AstraZeneca’s patent protecting Entocort EC.
Losec/Prilosec (omeprazole)
US patent litigation 
AstraZeneca continues litigation to recover patent infringement 
damages against Andrx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Apotex Corp. 
and Apotex Inc. 
Patent proceedings outside the US 
In Canada, the AstraZeneca patent infringement proceeding 
against Apotex Inc. regarding omeprazole capsules and tablets 
remains pending.
In May 2012, in Canada, the Federal Court found AstraZeneca 
liable to Apotex Inc. for section 8 damages arising from notice 
of compliance proceedings that had been finally dismissed in 
December 2003. The actual amount of damages owing, if any, 
will be determined at a future date by a court reference procedure. 
AstraZeneca has appealed the Federal Court’s decision.

Vimovo (naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium) 
US patent litigation
In January 2013, AstraZeneca and Pozen commenced a patent-
infringement action in the US District Court for the District of New 
Jersey in response to an ANDA challenge to seven patents listed 
in the Orange Book including the patent in-licensed from Pozen. 
Three additional patent-infringement actions regarding generic 
versions of Vimovo are also pending in the Court. 
Zestril (lisinopril dihydrate)

As previously disclosed, in 1996, two of AstraZeneca’s predecessor 
companies, Zeneca Limited and Zeneca Pharma Inc. (as licensees), 
Merck & Co., Inc. and Merck Frosst Canada Inc. (together Merck 
Group) commenced a patent infringement action in Canada against 
Apotex, Inc. (Apotex), alleging infringement of Merck Group’s 
lisinopril patent. In 2010, after having established Apotex’s liability, 
AstraZeneca and the Merck Group initiated proceedings to recover 
damages and that damages claim remains pending.
Product Liability Litigation
Crestor (rosuvastatin calcium) 
AstraZeneca is defending 15 lawsuits in California state courts 
involving a total of 263 plaintiffs claiming physical injury from 
treatment with Crestor. The lawsuits allege multiple types of injuries 
including diabetes mellitus, various cardiac injuries, rhabdomyolysis, 
and liver and kidney injuries. Fourteen cases have been consolidated 
into one co-ordinated proceeding in Los Angeles, California.
Iressa (gefitinib) 
Between 2004 and 2008, seven claims were filed against 
AstraZeneca in Japan, in the Osaka and Tokyo District Courts alleging 
that Iressa caused a fatal incidence of interstitial lung disease in 
Japanese patients. As previously reported, in November 2011, the 
Tokyo High Court reversed the Tokyo District Court’s decision and 
ruled that neither AstraZeneca, nor the Japanese Ministry of Health, 
Labour and Welfare (MHLW), had any liability for any of the claims. 
Following that decision, on 25 May 2012, the Osaka High Court 
reversed the Osaka District Court decision and ruled that neither 
AstraZeneca, nor the MHLW, had any liability for any of the claims. 
The plaintiffs have appealed both decisions to the Japanese 
Supreme Court.
Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium) 
As previously disclosed, AstraZeneca has been named as a 
defendant in product liability lawsuits brought by plaintiffs alleging 
bone deterioration, loss of bone density and/or bone fractures 
caused by Nexium and/or Prilosec in various federal and state 
courts in the US. Currently, there are approximately 1,900 plaintiffs. 
In December 2012, the US Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation 
ordered that the federal cases be co-ordinated for proceedings  
in the US District Court for the Central District of California.
Seroquel IR (quetiapine fumarate)
With regard to Seroquel IR product liability litigation in the US, 
AstraZeneca is aware of approximately 10 cases in active litigation 
in various jurisdictions. Provisions associated with diabetes-related 
claims were reduced by approximately $18m in 2012.
Four putative class actions were initiated in Canada in the provinces 
of Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec, alleging that 
AstraZeneca failed to provide adequate warnings in connection 
with an alleged association between Seroquel IR and the onset of 
diabetes. Class certification was denied in the Ontario proceedings 
in 2012 and in Quebec in 2011. Both decisions were appealed. On 
12 December 2012, the Quebec Court of Appeal approved plaintiff’s 
motion to abandon the appeal of the lower court’s decision to deny 
class certification. 
Seroquel XR (an extended release formulation 
of quetiapine fumarate) 
US patent litigation/regulatory proceedings 
In October 2011, the US District Court for the District of New Jersey 
conducted a trial in the patent infringement actions involving the 
Seroquel XR formulation patent against certain generic drug 
manufacturers. In March 2012, the Court found the Seroquel XR 
formulation patent to be valid. The Court also found that Anchen 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Osmotica Pharmaceutical Corporation, 
Torrent Pharmaceuticals Limited, Torrent Pharma Inc., Mylan 
Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Mylan Inc. have infringed the Seroquel XR 
formulation patent. The decision has been appealed.
In July 2012, AstraZeneca settled its patent infringement action 
against Intellipharmaceutics Corp. and Intellipharmaceutics 
International Inc. (together, Intellipharmaceutics) pending in the 
US District Court for the Southern District of New York by granting 
a licence to the Seroquel XR product patent, effective 1 November 
2016, or earlier, in certain circumstances.
In July 2012, AstraZeneca received a Paragraph IV notice letter from 
Amneal Pharmaceuticals, LLC (Amneal) relating to Seroquel XR. 
In August 2012, AstraZeneca commenced a patent infringement 
action against Amneal and related Amneal entities in the US District 
Court for the District of New Jersey. In January 2013, AstraZeneca 
settled its patent infringement action against Amneal by granting 
a licence to the Seroquel XR product patent, effective 1 November 
2016, or earlier, in certain circumstances.
In September 2012, AstraZeneca received a Paragraph IV notice 
letter from Lupin Ltd. (Lupin) relating to Seroquel XR. In November 
2012, AstraZeneca commenced a patent infringement action against 
Lupin in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey.
Patent proceedings outside the US 
In the Netherlands, in March 2012, the District Court in the Hague 
upheld the validity of the formulation patent protecting Seroquel XR. 
In the UK, in March 2012, the UK High Court found the Seroquel XR 
formulation patent invalid. 
In Spain, in July 2012, the Commercial Court in Barcelona found 
the Seroquel XR formulation patent valid.
In Germany, in September 2012, the Regional Court in Düsseldorf 
affirmed preliminary injunctions against Heumann Pharma 
GmbH & Co, Heumann Verwaltungs GmbH, Ratiopharm GmbH, 
CT Arzneimittel GmbH and AbZ Pharma GmbH. However, in 
November 2012, the Federal Patent Court found the Seroquel XR 
patent invalid and outstanding injunctions have been lifted. 
Generic versions of Seroquel XR have been launched in Austria, 
Denmark, Germany, Italy, Portugal, UK, Romania and elsewhere. 
While AstraZeneca continues to have confidence in the patent 
protecting Seroquel XR and will continue to take appropriate 
legal action, additional generic launches and adverse court rulings 
are possible.
Symbicort (budesonide/formoterol)
US patent litigation 
AstraZeneca is defending a complaint alleging patent infringement 
filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas  
by Accuhale LLC (Accuhale). Accuhale is purportedly the owner  
of US patent no. 5,718,355, which Accuhale alleges is infringed  
by sales of Symbicort.

Co-Payment Subsidy Litigation
In March 2012, the New England Carpenters Health and Welfare 
Fund, on behalf of a proposed class of payers that reimbursed 
consumers for Nexium and Crestor prescriptions as to which 
AstraZeneca subsidised the consumer’s co-payment obligation, 
brought an action against AstraZeneca in the US District Court 
for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. On 5 September 2012, 
the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their complaint against 
AstraZeneca while reserving the right to file a new complaint 
against AstraZeneca in the future. 
Shionogi Arbitration Crestor Royalty Calculation 
In July 2012, Shionogi & Co. Ltd initiated arbitration proceedings to 
resolve issues relating to the treatment of certain excise taxes and 
other specific items in the calculation of royalties on Crestor sales. 
Nexium Settlement Anti-trust Litigation 
AstraZeneca is a defendant in numerous nearly identical putative 
class actions alleging that AstraZeneca’s settlements of patent 
litigation relating to Nexium violated US anti-trust law and various 
state laws. In December 2012, the US Judicial Panel on Multi-District 
Litigation ordered that the cases be co-ordinated for proceedings 
in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts. 
Average Wholesale Price (AWP) litigation 
Of the various lawsuits against AstraZeneca and other pharmaceutical 
manufacturers involving allegations that, by causing the publication 
of allegedly inflated wholesale list prices, defendants caused entities 
to overpay for prescription drugs, AstraZeneca remains in litigation 
with the Attorneys General of the states of Utah, Wisconsin, and, 
as discussed below, with the Commonwealth of Kentucky.
During 2012, settlements were reached with the Attorneys General 
of the states of Louisiana and Oklahoma and provisions were taken.
AstraZeneca prevailed in its appeal before the Commonwealth 
of Kentucky Court of Appeals. In that case, AstraZeneca sought 
reversal of the judgment against it in the case brought by the 
Attorney General of Kentucky and the corresponding award 
of damages and penalties. Following the underlying 2009 trial, 
a Kentucky jury found AstraZeneca liable under the Commonwealth 
of Kentucky’s Consumer Protection and Medicaid Fraud statutes and 
awarded $14.72m in compensatory damages and $100 in punitive 
damages. The trial court subsequently awarded an additional $5.4m 
in statutory penalties. On 12 October 2012, the Kentucky Court of 
Appeals reversed the trial court’s decision and held that AstraZeneca 
was not liable for damages. The Court of Appeals remanded the 
case to the trial court for entry of judgment in favour of AstraZeneca. 
On 13 November 2012, the Commonwealth filed its Motion for 
Discretionary Review (appeal) in the Kentucky Supreme Court. 
There are no remaining AWP cases pending against MedImmune.
Medco qui tam litigation (Schumann)
AstraZeneca has been named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed 
in Federal Court in Philadelphia under the qui tam (whistleblower) 
provisions of the federal and certain state False Claims Acts alleging 
overpayments by federal and state governments resulting from 
alleged false pricing information reported to the government and 
improper payments intended to influence the formulary status of 
Prilosec and Nexium to Medco and its customers. The action was 
initially filed in September 2003 but remained under seal until July 
2009, at which time AstraZeneca was served with a copy of the 
amended complaint following the US government’s decision not 
to intervene in the case. On 25 January 2013, the Court granted 
AstraZeneca’s motion and dismissed the case with prejudice.
With regard to insurance coverage for the substantial legal defence 
costs and settlements that have been incurred in connection with 
the Seroquel IR product liability claims in the US related to alleged 
diabetes and/or other related injuries (which now exceed the total 
amount of insurance coverage available), disputes continue with 
insurers and legal proceedings have commenced in the UK about 
the availability of coverage under certain insurance policies. These 
policies have aggregate coverage limits of $300m. No insurance 
receivable can be recognised under applicable accounting standards 
at this time.
Commercial Litigation 
Crestor (rosuvastatin calcium) 
On 29 November 2012, a Motion to Certify a Claim as a Class Action 
and Related Statement of Claim were filed in Israel in the District 
Court in Tel Aviv – Jaffa, against AstraZeneca and four other 
pharmaceutical companies. With respect to AstraZeneca, in addition 
to other causes of action, the Statement of Claim alleges that 
AstraZeneca engaged in deception and failed to disclose material 
facts to consumers of Crestor regarding certain adverse events 
associated with the drug. 
Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium) 
Of the various putative class actions in the US alleging that 
AstraZeneca’s promotion, advertising and pricing of Nexium to 
physicians, consumers and third party payers was unfair, unlawful 
and deceptive, only one case remains pending. In the Massachusetts 
State Court case, AstraZeneca reached an agreement in principle 
to settle the matter in September 2012, and a provision has been 
taken. Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary approval of the settlement 
will be heard by the Court on 5 February 2013. The Delaware State 
Court case has been stayed since May 2005.
Seroquel (quetiapine fumarate)
Of the various state law claims brought by state Attorneys General 
generally alleging that AstraZeneca made false and/or misleading 
statements in marketing and promoting Seroquel, AstraZeneca 
remains in litigation with the Attorney General of Mississippi. In 2012, 
AstraZeneca settled the cases brought by the Attorneys General 
of the states of Montana, New Mexico, South Carolina and Utah, 
and also finalised previously reported agreements in principle with 
Alaska and Arkansas. In December 2012, AstraZeneca also agreed 
in principle to a settlement of similar claims with the Attorney General 
of Kentucky, which was finalised in January 2013. Provisions for  
the foregoing settlements were taken in 2012.
Synagis (palivizumab) 
In September 2011, MedImmune, filed an action against Abbott 
International, LLC (Abbott) in the Circuit Court for Montgomery 
County, Maryland, seeking a declaratory judgment in a contract 
dispute. Abbott’s motion to dismiss was granted. In September 201 1, 
Abbott filed a parallel action against MedImmune in the Illinois State 
Court. Abbott’s motion to hold the disputed funds in escrow was 
rejected. In February 2012, the Court denied MedImmune’s motion 
to dismiss and is expected to set a trial date for 2013.
Toprol-XL (metoprolol succinate) 
AstraZeneca is defending anti-trust claims in the US regarding the 
listing and enforcement of patents protecting Toprol-XL. In March 
2013, the US District Court for the District of Delaware will hold 
a hearing to review the agreement in principle to settle the remaining 
claims alleged by the end-payers, for which a provision was taken 
in 2012.

Seroquel (quetiapine fumarate)
Attorney General of Texas investigation
In July 2012, AstraZeneca received a civil investigative demand from 
the Office of the Attorney General for the State of Texas in connection 
with an investigation related to sales and marketing activities 
potentially involving Seroquel.
Synagis (palivizumab) 
As previously disclosed, on 30 June 2011, MedImmune received  
a demand from the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District 
of New York requesting certain documents related to the sales 
and marketing activities of Synagis. On 1 July 2011, MedImmune 
received a similar court order to produce documents from the 
Office of the Attorney General for the State of New York Medicaid 
and Fraud Control Unit pursuant to what the government attorneys 
advised was a joint investigation. MedImmune has accepted receipt 
of these requests and is co-ordinating with the government offices 
to provide the appropriate responses and co-operate with any 
related investigation. 
In May 2012, MedImmune, received a subpoena duces tecum from 
the Office of Attorney General for the State of Florida Medicaid and 
Fraud Control Unit requesting certain documents related to the sales 
and marketing activities of Synagis. MedImmune has accepted 
receipt of the request and is co-ordinating with the Florida government 
to provide the appropriate responses and co-operate with any 
related investigation. AstraZeneca is unaware of the nature or focus 
of the investigation, however, based on the nature of the requests 
it appears to be similar to the inquiries from the State of New York 
and Department of Justice (which is mentioned above).
Other government investigations/proceedings
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
In connection with an investigation into Foreign Corrupt Practices 
Act issues in the pharmaceutical industry, AstraZeneca has received 
inquiries from the US Department of Justice and the SEC regarding, 
among other things, sales practices, internal controls, certain 
distributors and interactions with healthcare providers and other 
government officials in several countries. AstraZeneca is co-operating 
with these inquiries. AstraZeneca is investigating indications 
of inappropriate conduct in certain countries, including China. 
Resolution of this matter could involve the payment of fines and/or 
other remedies. 
Average Manufacturer’s Price qui tam litigation (Streck) 
AstraZeneca is one of several manufacturers named as a defendant 
in a lawsuit filed in the US Federal Court in Philadelphia under 
the qui tam (whistleblower) provisions of the federal and certain 
state False Claims Acts alleging inaccurate reporting of Average 
Manufacturer’s Prices to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services. The action was initially filed in October 2008 but remained 
under seal until May 2011, following the US government’s decision 
not to intervene in the case with regard to certain manufacturers, 
including AstraZeneca. As to AstraZeneca, the Court dismissed 
plaintiffs’ claims, both state and federal, for all Average Manufacturer 
Price submissions made before 1 January 2007 but denied 
AstraZeneca’s motion to dismiss all claims regarding submissions 
made after 1 January 2007. 
Drug importation and anti-trust litigation
As previously disclosed, in August 2004, Californian retail pharmacy 
plaintiffs filed an action in the Superior Court of California alleging 
a conspiracy by AstraZeneca and other pharmaceutical manufacturer 
defendants to set the price of drugs sold in California at or above 
the Canadian sales price for those drugs and otherwise restrict the 
importation of pharmaceuticals into the US. After the court granted 
the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, and that decision 
was affirmed on appeal, in October 2012, the plaintiffs filed a petition 
for review by the California Supreme Court, which was denied.
Employment – wage/hour litigation
On 18 June 2012, the US Supreme Court in Christopher vs. 
SmithKline Beecham Corporation (GSK) handed down a decision 
concerning whether pharmaceutical sales representatives are 
exempt from overtime pay regulations under the US Department of 
Labor’s outside sales exemption. The decision favoured GSK and 
by implication AstraZeneca and the pharmaceutical industry as a 
whole. As a result of the Christopher decision, the final wage and 
hour class action lawsuits against AstraZeneca were dismissed  
in October 2012.
Government investigations/proceedings 
Except as otherwise noted, the precise parameters of the following 
inquiries are unknown, and AstraZeneca is not in a position at this 
time to predict the scope, duration or outcome of these matters, 
including whether they will result in any liability to AstraZeneca.
Losec/Prilosec (omeprazole) 
European Commission case 
In December 2012, the Court of Justice of the EU ruled on the 
cross-appeals from the General Court of the EU’s judgment 
regarding the European Commission’s 2005 decision fining 
AstraZeneca €60m (reduced to €52.5m by the General Court) for 
abuse of a dominant position regarding omeprazole. The Court 
of Justice dismissed all of the cross-appeals and confirmed the 
judgment of the General Court in all material respects. No further 
appeals are possible. 
Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium) 
Department of Justice/Attorney General of Texas investigation
AstraZeneca has received a subpoena from the Department of 
Justice and a Civil Investigative Demand issued by the Attorney 
General of Texas in connection with an investigation of the possible 
submission of false or otherwise improper pricing information for 
certain formulations of Nexium to the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services. The Department of Justice has filed a notice of 
non-intervention in the federal case. The Attorney General of Texas 
has stated that it plans to file a similar notice in the Texas False 
Claims Act case pending in state court in Texas. AstraZeneca 
and counsel for relator are currently negotiating the language  
of stipulations of dismissal. AstraZeneca expects these cases  
to be formally dismissed shortly.

Strategy Performance Corporate Governance Additional Information Financial Statements Overview
Transfer pricing and other international tax contingencies
The total net accrual included in the Group Financial Statements to 
cover the worldwide exposure to transfer pricing audits is $423m, 
a reduction of $226m compared to 2011 primarily due to the 
settlement of a transfer pricing matter as detailed in Note 4.
AstraZeneca faces a number of transfer pricing audits in jurisdictions 
around the world and, in some cases, is in dispute with the tax 
authorities. The issues under discussion are often complex and 
can require many years to resolve. Accruals for tax contingencies 
require management to make estimates and judgements with 
respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit, and actual results 
could vary from these estimates. The international tax environment 
presents increasingly challenging dynamics for the resolution of 
transfer pricing disputes. These disputes usually result in taxable 
profits being increased in one territory and correspondingly 
decreased in another. Our balance sheet positions for these matters 
reflect appropriate corresponding relief in the territories affected. 
Management considers that at present such corresponding relief 
will be available, but given the challenges in the international tax 
environment will keep this aspect under careful review.
Management continues to believe that AstraZeneca’s positions 
on all its transfer pricing audits and disputes are robust and that 
AstraZeneca is appropriately provided. 
For transfer pricing audits where AstraZeneca and the tax authorities 
are in dispute, AstraZeneca estimates the potential for reasonably 
possible additional losses above and beyond the amount provided 
to be up to $522m (2011: $375m); however, management believes 
that it is unlikely that these additional losses will arise. It is possible 
that some of these contingencies may reduce in the future to the 
extent that any tax authority challenge is unsuccessful, or matters 
lapse following expiry of the relevant statutes of limitation resulting 
in a reduction in the tax charge in future periods.
Other tax contingencies 
Included in the tax accrual is $1,846m relating to a number of other 
tax contingencies, an increase of $174m mainly due to the impact 
of an additional year of transactions relating to contingencies for 
which accruals had already been established and exchange rate 
effects. For these tax exposures, AstraZeneca does not expect 
material additional losses. It is, however, possible that some of 
these contingencies may reduce in the future if any tax authority 
challenge is unsuccessful or matters lapse following expiry of the 
relevant statutes of limitation resulting in a reduction in the tax 
charge in future periods. 
Timing of cash flows and interest 
It is not possible to estimate the timing of tax cash flows in relation 
to each outcome, however, it is anticipated that a number of 
significant disputes may be resolved over the next one to two 
years. Included in the provision is an amount of interest of $248m 
(2011: $291m). Interest is accrued as a tax expense.
Serbia
In August 2011, AstraZeneca’s Representative Office in Belgrade, 
Serbia was served with a criminal indictment alleging that local 
employees of AstraZeneca and several other pharmaceutical 
companies who are also named defendants in the indictment, 
made allegedly improper payments to physicians at the Institute of 
Oncology and Radiology of Serbia. The indictment was subsequently 
amended. In March 2012, the Court denied AstraZeneca’s request 
to dismiss the amended indictment and joined the proceedings 
against AstraZeneca and the other named pharmaceutical 
companies with the pending proceedings against the allegedly 
involved individual defendants. AstraZeneca has filed an appeal 
with the Serbian Constitutional Court. 
India
On 23 February 2012, the Indian Central Bureau of Investigation 
filed a First Information Report in the court in Delhi against 
AstraZeneca and public officials of the Central Procurement Agency 
of the Delhi Directorate of Health Services (DHS) in connection with 
circumstances surrounding the submission by AstraZeneca of an 
alleged false affidavit in relation to pricing as part of a tender for 
Meronem entered into by AstraZeneca with the DHS in 2009. 
AstraZeneca is co-operating with the investigation.
Other US Attorney’s Offices investigations
The US Attorney’s Offices in Alabama, Delaware and Texas 
are conducting investigations related to sales and marketing 
activities potentially involving more than one product, including 
Crestor and Seroquel XR, in response to the filing of qui tam 
(whistleblower) lawsuits.
The US Attorney’s Office for the District of Delaware, Criminal 
Division, is conducting an investigation relating to AstraZeneca’s 
relationship with Medco and sales of Nexium, Plendil, Prilosec 
and Toprol-XL. 
Additional government inquiries
As is true for most, if not all, major prescription pharmaceutical 
companies operating in the US, AstraZeneca is currently involved 
in multiple US federal and state inquiries into drug marketing and 
pricing practices. In addition to the investigations described above, 
various federal and state law enforcement offices have, from time 
to time, requested information from the Company. There have been 
no material developments in those matters.
Tax
Where tax exposures can be quantified, an accrual is made based 
on best estimates and management’s judgement. Details of the 
movements in relation to material tax exposures are discussed 
below. As accruals can be built up over a long period of time but 
the ultimate resolution of tax exposures usually occurs at a point 
in time and given the inherent uncertainties in assessing the 
outcomes of these exposures (which sometimes can be binary 
in nature), we could, in future periods, experience adjustments  
to these accruals that have a material positive or negative effect 
on our results in any particular period.

Company Balance Sheet
at 31 December Financial Statements | Company Accounting Policies
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 194
Basis of accounting
The Company Financial Statements are prepared under the historical 
cost convention, modified to include revaluation to fair value of 
certain financial instruments as described below, in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006 and UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (UK GAAP). The Group Financial Statements 
are presented on pages 142 to 191 and have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and as issued by  
the IASB and in accordance with the Group Accounting Policies 
set out on pages 146 to 149.
The following paragraphs describe the main accounting policies 
under UK GAAP, which have been applied consistently.
New accounting standards
The Company has adopted the Amendments to FRS 29 (IFRS 7) 
‘Disclosures – Transfers of Financial Assets’ during the year. 
The adoption had no impact on the net results or net assets of 
the Company.
Foreign currencies
Profit and loss account items in foreign currencies are translated 
into US dollars at average rates for the relevant accounting periods. 
Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates prevailing 
at the date of the Company Balance Sheet. Exchange gains and 
losses on loans and on short-term foreign currency borrowings 
and deposits are included within net interest payable. Exchange 
differences on all other transactions, except relevant foreign currency 
loans, are taken to operating profit.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the result for the year and takes 
into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between 
the treatment of certain items for taxation and for accounting 
purposes. Full provision is made for the effects of these differences. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is more likely than  
not that the amount will be realised in the future. These estimates 
require judgements to be made including the forecast of future 
taxable income. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Accruals for tax contingencies require management to make 
judgements and estimates in relation to tax audit issues. Tax 
benefits are not recognised unless the tax positions will probably 
be sustained. Once considered to be probable, management 
reviews each material tax benefit to assess whether a provision 
should be taken against full recognition of that benefit on the basis 
of potential settlement through negotiation and/or litigation.
Any recorded exposure to interest on tax liabilities is provided for 
in the tax charge. All provisions are included in creditors due within 
one year.
Investments
Fixed asset investments, including investments in subsidiaries, are 
stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if there are indications 
that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Share-based payments
The issuance by the Company to employees of its subsidiaries of 
a grant over the Company’s options represents additional capital 
contributions by the Company to its subsidiaries. An additional 
investment in subsidiaries results in a corresponding increase in 
shareholders’ equity. The additional capital contribution is based 
on the fair value of the grant issued, allocated over the underlying 
grant’s vesting period.
Financial instruments
Loans and other receivables are held at amortised cost. Long-term 
loans payable are held at amortised cost.
Litigation
Through the normal course of business, the AstraZeneca Group is 
involved in legal disputes, the settlement of which may involve cost 
to the Company. Provision is made where an adverse outcome is 
probable and associated costs can be estimated reliably. In other 
cases, appropriate descriptions are included.

During the year management conducted an impairment review of the Company’s investment in AstraZeneca Holding GmbH because 
of a deterioration in the trading outlook in Germany. The review indicated that AstraZeneca Holding GmbH’s carrying amount exceeded 
its value by $21m and consequently the carrying amount has been written down by this amount. The impairment loss has been 
recognised in operating costs within the profit and loss account.

All loans are at fixed interest rates. Accordingly, the fair values of the loans will change as market rates change. However, since the loans 
are held at amortised cost, changes in interest rates and the credit rating of the Company do not have any effect on the Company’s 
net assets.

7 Litigation and environmental liabilities
In addition to those matters disclosed below, there are other cases where the Company is named as a party to legal proceedings.  
These include the Seroquel IR product liability litigation and the Nexium product liability litigation each of which are described more  
fully in Note 25 to the Group Financial Statements.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
In connection with an investigation into Foreign Corrupt Practices Act issues in the pharmaceutical industry, AstraZeneca has received 
inquiries from the US Department of Justice and the SEC regarding, among other things, sales practices, internal controls, certain 
distributors and interactions with healthcare providers and other government officials in several countries. AstraZeneca is co-operating 
with these inquiries. AstraZeneca is investigating indications of inappropriate conduct in certain countries, including China. Resolution 
of this matter could involve the payment of fines and/or other remedies.
Dutch National Competition Authority investigation
In the Dutch National Competition Authority (NMa) investigation into alleged abuse of a dominant position, the investigation team issued 
a report alleging foreclosure of generic versions of certain proton pump inhibitors other than esomeprazole. The file has now been passed 
to the Legal Department of the NMa. AstraZeneca completed its defence in April 2012 and awaits a decision by the Board of the NMa 
later in 2013.
Other
The Company has guaranteed the external borrowing of a subsidiary in the amount of $288m.

 Investing activities and Financing activities were restated in 2011 to reclassify cash paid in hedge contracts relating to dividend payments from Investing activities to Financing activities.
For the purpose of computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings consist of the income from continuing ordinary activities 
before taxation of Group companies and income received from companies owned 50% or less, plus fixed charges. Fixed charges 
consist of interest on all indebtedness, amortisation of debt discount and expense and that portion of rental expense representative  
of the interest factor.

Development Pipeline
as at 31 December 2012
Throughout the development process, we strive to obtain patent protection consistent with our patent process (as described in the 
Intellectual Property section from page 35). However, until marketing approval in individual countries is obtained, it is not possible to 
accurately predict the maximum period of product protection available from any such patents. While the most signiﬁcant uncertainties  
for development pipeline products progressing to launch are meeting development targets and obtaining regulatory marketing approvals 
(as detailed in the Risk section from page 74), the date and language of any actual marketing approval will crucially determine the length  
of Patent Term Extension and the full range, if any, of pending patents that will protect the marketed product. Further details of possible 
periods of patent, RDP and related IP protections which may protect pipeline products once marketed are included from page 35.

 Includes Euroclear and ADR holdings.
At 31 December 2012, the Company had 111,111 registered holders of 1,246,779,548 Ordinary Shares. There were 122,617 holders  
of Ordinary Shares held under the Euroclear Services Agreement, representing 12.9% of the issued share capital of the Company  
and approximately 235,000 holders of ADRs, representing 11.0% of the issued share capital of the Company. The ADRs, each of  
which is equivalent to one Ordinary Share, are issued by JPMorgan Chase Bank (JPMorgan).
During 2012, under AstraZeneca’s share repurchase programme, which was introduced in 1999, 57 .8 million Ordinary Shares were 
repurchased and subsequently cancelled at a total cost of $2,635 million, representing 4.6% of the total issued share capital of the 
Company at 31 December 2012. The average price paid per Ordinary Share in 2012 was 2879 pence. This brings the total number  
of Ordinary Shares repurchased to date since the beginning of the repurchase programme in 1999, to 615.2 million Ordinary Shares  
(at an average price of 2777 pence per Ordinary Share) for a consideration, including expenses, of $29,352 million. The excess of the 
consideration over the nominal value was charged against the proﬁt and loss account reserve. Ordinary Shares issued in respect of  
share schemes in 2012 totalled 12.2 million. The Company suspended its share repurchase programme effective 1 October.
In 1999, in connection with the merger between Astra and Zeneca through which the Company was formed, the Company’s share capital 
was redenominated in US dollars. On 6 April 1999, Zeneca shares were cancelled and US dollar shares issued, credited as fully paid  
on the basis of one dollar share for each Zeneca share then held. This was achieved by a reduction of capital under section 135 of the 
Companies Act 1985. Upon the reduction of capital becoming effective, all issued and unissued Zeneca shares were cancelled and the 
sum arising as a result of the share cancellation credited to a special reserve, which was converted into US dollars at the rate of exchange 
prevailing on the record date. This US dollar reserve was then applied in paying up, at par, newly created US dollar shares.
At the same time as the US dollar shares were issued, the Company issued 50,000 Redeemable Preference Shares for cash, at par.  
The Redeemable Preference Shares carry limited class voting rights, no dividend rights and are capable of redemption, at par, at the 
option of the Company on the giving of seven days’ written notice to the registered holder of the Redeemable Preference Shares.
A total of 826 million Ordinary Shares were issued to Astra shareholders who accepted the merger offer before the ﬁnal closing date,  
21 May 1999. The Company received acceptances from Astra shareholders representing 99.6% of Astra’s shares and the remaining  
0.4% was acquired in 2000, for cash.

decrease would have arisen unless the holding moved up or down through a whole number percentage level. The percentage level may increase (on the cancellation of shares following a repurchase 
of shares under the Company’s share repurchase programme) or decrease (on the issue of new shares under any of the Company’s share plans). 
So far as the Company is aware, no other person held a notiﬁable interest in shares, comprising 3% or more of the issued Ordinary Share 
capital of the Company.

is that there is no gain or loss for UK capital gains tax purposes on gifts of shares through ShareGift, and it may now also be possible  
to obtain UK income tax relief on the donation. Further information about ShareGift can be found on its website, sharegift.org, or by 
contacting ShareGift on 020 7930 3737 or at 17 Carlton House Terrace, London SW1Y 5AH. ShareGift is administered by The Orr

Taxation for US residents
The following summary of material UK and US federal income tax consequences of ownership of Ordinary Shares or ADRs held as capital 
assets by the US resident holders described below is based on current UK and US federal income tax law, including the US/UK double 
taxation convention relating to income and capital gains, which entered into force on 31 March 2003 (the Convention). This summary  
does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant in light of the US resident holders’ particular circumstances and  
tax consequences applicable to US resident holders subject to special rules (such as certain ﬁnancial institutions, entities treated as 
partnerships for US federal income tax purposes, persons whose functional currency for US federal income tax purposes is not the  
US dollar, tax-exempt entities, or persons holding Ordinary Shares or ADRs in connection with a trade or business conducted outside  
of the US). US resident holders are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding the UK and US federal income tax consequences  
of the ownership and disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADRs in their particular circumstances. 
This summary is based in part on representations of JPMorgan as depositary for ADRs and assumes that each obligation in the deposit 
agreement among the Company, JPMorgan and the holders from time to time of ADRs and any related agreements will be performed  
in accordance with its terms. The US Treasury has expressed concerns that parties to whom American depository shares are released 
before shares are delivered to the depositary (pre-release), or intermediaries in the chain of ownership between holders and the issuer  
of the security underlying the American depository shares, may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming, by US holders  
of American depository shares, of foreign tax credits for US federal income tax purposes. Such actions would also be inconsistent with  
the claiming of the reduced tax rates, described below, applicable to dividends received by certain non-corporate US resident holders. 
Accordingly, the availability of the reduced tax rates for dividends received by certain non-corporate US resident holders could be  
affected by actions that may be taken by parties to whom ADRs are pre-released.
For the purposes of this summary, the term ‘US resident holder’ means a beneﬁcial owner of Ordinary Shares or ADRs that is, for US 
federal income tax purposes, a citizen or resident of the US, a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation) created or organised 
in or under the laws of the US, any state in the US or the District of Columbia, or an estate or trust the income of which is subject to US 
federal income taxation regardless of its source.
This summary assumes that we are not, and will not become, a passive foreign investment company, as discussed below.
UK and US income taxation of dividends
The UK does not currently impose a withholding tax on dividends paid by a UK company, such as the Company.
For US federal income tax purposes, distributions paid by the Company to a US resident holder are included in gross income as foreign 
source ordinary dividend income to the extent paid out of the Company’s current or accumulated earnings and proﬁts, calculated in 
accordance with US federal income tax principles. Because the Company does not maintain calculations of its earning and proﬁts  
under US federal income tax principles, it is expected that distributions generally will be reported to US resident holders as dividends.  
The amount of the dividend will be the US dollar amount received by the depositary for US resident holders of ADRs (or, in the case of 
Ordinary Shares, the US dollar value of the pounds sterling payments made, determined at the spot pound sterling/US dollar rate on the 
date the dividend is received by the US resident holders, regardless of whether the dividend is converted into US dollars), and it will not  
be eligible for the dividends received deduction generally available to US corporations. If the dividend is converted into US dollars on the 
date of receipt, US resident holders of Ordinary Shares generally should not be required to recognise foreign currency gains or losses in 
respect of the dividend income. They may have foreign currency gain or loss if the amount of such dividend is converted into US dollars 
after the date of its receipt.
Subject to applicable limitations and the discussion above regarding concerns expressed by the US Treasury, dividends received by 
certain non-corporate US resident holders of Ordinary Shares or ADRs may be taxable at favourable US federal income tax rates. US 
resident holders should consult their own tax advisers to determine whether they are subject to any special rules which may limit their 
ability to be taxed at this favourable rate.
Taxation on capital gains
Under present UK law, individuals who are neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the UK, and companies which are not resident  
in the UK, will not be liable for UK tax on capital gains made on the disposal of their Ordinary Shares or ADRs, unless such Ordinary 
Shares or ADRs are held in connection with a trade, profession or vocation carried on in the UK through a branch or agency or other 
permanent establishment.
A US resident holder will generally recognise US source capital gains or losses for US federal income tax purposes on the sale or 
exchange of Ordinary Shares or ADRs in an amount equal to the difference between the US dollar amount realised and such holder’s US 
dollar tax basis in the Ordinary Shares or ADRs. US resident holders should consult their own tax advisers about the treatment of capital 
gains, which may be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income for non-corporate US resident holders and capital losses, the deductibility 
of which may be limited.
Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC) rules
We believe that we were not a PFIC for US federal income tax purposes for the year ended 31 December 2012. However, since PFIC 
status depends on the composition of our income and assets and the market value of our assets (including, among others, less than 25% 
owned equity investments) from time to time, there can be no assurance that we will not be considered a PFIC for any taxable year. If we 
were treated as a PFIC for any taxable year during which Ordinary Shares or ADRs were held, certain adverse tax consequences could 
apply to US resident holders. Overview Strategy Performance Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 207
Information reporting and backup withholding
Payments of dividends and sales proceeds that are made within the US or through certain US-related ﬁnancial intermediaries may be 
subject to information reporting and backup withholding, unless (i) the US resident holder is a corporation or other exempt recipient or (ii) 
in the case of backup withholding, the US resident holder provides a correct taxpayer identiﬁcation number and certiﬁes that it is not 
subject to backup withholding. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a US resident holder will be allowed as a credit 
against the holder’s US federal income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that the required information is supplied 
to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on time.
Certain US resident holders who are individuals (and under proposed US Treasury regulations, certain entities), may be required to report 
information relating to securities issued by non-US persons (or foreign accounts through which the securities are held), generally on IRS 
Form 8938, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for securities held in accounts maintained by US ﬁnancial institutions). 
US resident holders should consult their tax advisers regarding their reporting obligations with respect to the Ordinary Shares or ADRs.
UK inheritance tax
Under the current Double Taxation (Estates) Convention (the Estate Tax Convention) between the US and the UK, Ordinary Shares or 
ADRs held by an individual shareholder who is domiciled for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention in the US, and is not for the 
purposes of the Estate Tax Convention a national of the UK, will generally not be subject to UK inheritance tax on the individual’s death  
or on a chargeable gift of the Ordinary Shares or ADRs during the individual’s lifetime, provided that any applicable US federal gift or 
estate tax liability is paid, unless the Ordinary Shares or ADRs are part of the business property of a permanent establishment of the 
individual in the UK or, in the case of a shareholder who performs independent personal services, pertain to a ﬁxed base situated in  
the UK. Where the Ordinary Shares or ADRs have been placed in trust by a settlor who, at the time of settlement, was a US domiciled 
shareholder, the Ordinary Shares or ADRs will generally not be subject to UK inheritance tax unless the settlor, at the time of settlement, 
was a UK national, or the Ordinary Shares or ADRs are part of the business property of a permanent establishment of the individual  
in the UK or, in the case of a shareholder who performs independent personal services, pertain to a ﬁxed base situated in the UK. In the 
exceptional case where the Ordinary Shares or ADRs are subject to both UK inheritance tax and US federal gift or estate tax, the Estate 
Tax Convention generally provides for double taxation to be relieved by means of credit relief.
UK stamp duty reserve tax and stamp duty
A charge to UK stamp duty or UK stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT) may arise on the deposit of Ordinary Shares in connection with the 
creation of ADRs. The rate of stamp duty or SDRT will generally be 1.5% of the value of the consideration or, in some circumstances,  
the value of the Ordinary Shares. However, following a recent ruling in the UK, there is no 1.5% SDRT charge on the issue of Ordinary 
Shares (or, where it is integral to the raising of new capital, the transfer of Ordinary Shares) into the ADR arrangement. 
No UK stamp duty will be payable on the acquisition or transfer of existing ADRs provided that any instrument of transfer or written 
agreement to transfer is executed outside the UK and remains at all times outside the UK. An agreement for the transfer of ADRs will  
not give rise to a liability for SDRT.
A transfer of or an agreement to transfer Ordinary Shares will generally be subject to UK stamp duty or SDRT at 0.5% of the amount  
or value of any consideration, provided, in the case of stamp duty, it is rounded to the nearest £5.
Transfers of Ordinary Shares into CREST will generally not be subject to stamp duty or SDRT unless such a transfer is made for  
a consideration in money or money’s worth, in which case a liability to SDRT will arise, usually at the rate of 0.5% of the value of  
the consideration. Paperless transfers of Ordinary Shares within CREST are generally liable to SDRT at the rate of 0.5% of the value  
of the consideration. CREST is obliged to collect SDRT from the purchaser on relevant transactions settled within the system.
Exchange controls and other limitations affecting security holders
There are no governmental laws, decrees or regulations in the UK restricting the import or export of capital or affecting the remittance  
of dividends, interest or other payments to non-resident holders of Ordinary Shares or ADRs.
There are no limitations under English law or the Articles on the right of non-resident or foreign owners to be the registered holders  
of, or to exercise voting rights in relation to, Ordinary Shares or ADRs or to be registered holders of notes or debentures of Zeneca 
Wilmington Inc. or the Company.

Additional Information | Corporate Information
History and development  
of the Company
AstraZeneca PLC was incorporated in 
England and Wales on 17 June 1992 under 
the Companies Act 1985. It is a public 
limited company domiciled in the UK. The 
Company’s registered number is 2723534 
and its registered ofﬁce is at 2 Kingdom 
Street, London W2 6BD (telephone +44 
(0)20 7604 8000). From February 1993 until 
April 1999, the Company was called Zeneca 
Group PLC. On 6 April 1999, the Company 
changed its name to AstraZeneca PLC.
The Company was formed when the 
pharmaceutical, agrochemical and specialty 
chemical businesses of Imperial Chemical 
Industries PLC were demerged in 1993.  
In 1999, the Company sold the specialty 
chemical business. Also in 1999, the 
Company merged with Astra of Sweden.  
In 2000, it demerged the agrochemical 
business and merged it with the similar 
agribusiness of Novartis to form a new 
company called Syngenta AG.
In 2007 , the Group acquired MedImmune,  
a biologics and vaccines business based  
in the US.
The Group owns and operates numerous 
R&D, production and marketing facilities 
worldwide. Its corporate ofﬁce is at  
2 Kingdom Street, London W2 6BD.
Articles
Objects
The Company’s objects are unrestricted.
Any amendment to the Articles requires  
the approval of shareholders by a special 
resolution at a general meeting of the 
Company.
Directors
The Board has the authority to manage  
the business of the Company, for example, 
through powers to allot and repurchase  
its shares, subject where required to 
shareholder resolutions. Subject to certain 
exceptions, Directors do not have power  
to vote at Board meetings on matters in 
which they have a material interest.
The quorum for meetings of the Board is  
a majority of the full Board, of whom at  
least four must be Non-Executive Directors. 
In the absence of a quorum, the Directors do 
not have power to determine compensation 
arrangements for themselves or any 
member of the Board.
The Board may exercise all the powers  
of the Company to borrow money. Variation 
of these borrowing powers would require 
the passing of a special resolution of the 
Company’s shareholders.
All Directors must retire from ofﬁce at  
the Company’s AGM each year and  
may present themselves for election or 
re-election. Directors are not prohibited, 
upon reaching a particular age, from 
submitting themselves for election or 
re-election.
Within two months of the date of their 
appointment, Directors are required to 
beneﬁcially own Ordinary Shares of an 
aggregate nominal amount of at least  
$125, which currently represents  
500 shares.
Rights, preferences and restrictions 
attaching to shares
As at 31 December 2012, the Company had 
1,246,779,548 Ordinary Shares and 50,000 
Redeemable Preference Shares in issue. 
The Ordinary Shares represent 99.98% and 
the Redeemable Preference Shares represent 
0.02% of the Company’s total share capital 
(these percentages have been calculated by 
reference to the closing mid-point US$/GBP 
exchange rate on 31 December 2012 as 
published in the London edition of the 
Financial Times newspaper). As agreed by 
the shareholders at the Company’s AGM 
held on 29 April 2010, the Articles were 
amended with immediate effect to remove 
the requirement for the Company to have 
an authorised share capital, the concept of 
which was abolished under the Companies 
Act 2006. Each Ordinary Share carries  
the right to vote at general meetings of  
the Company. The rights and restrictions 
attaching to the Redeemable Preference 
Shares differ from those attaching to 
Ordinary Shares as follows: 
 > The Redeemable Preference Shares  
carry no rights to receive dividends.
 > The holders of Redeemable Preference 
Shares have no rights to receive notices 
of, attend or vote at general meetings 
except in certain limited circumstances. 
They have one vote for every 50,000 
Redeemable Preference Shares held.
 > On a distribution of assets of the 
Company, on a winding-up or other return 
of capital (subject to certain exceptions), 
the holders of Redeemable Preference 
Shares have priority over the holders  
of Ordinary Shares to receive the capital 
paid up on those shares.
 > Subject to the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006, the Company has the right  
to redeem the Redeemable Preference 
Shares at any time on giving not less  
than seven days’ written notice.
There are no speciﬁc restrictions on  
the transfer of shares in the Company, 
which is governed by the Articles and 
prevailing legislation.
The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between holders of shares  
that may result in restrictions on the transfer  
of shares or that may result in restrictions  
on voting rights.
Action necessary to change the rights 
of shareholders
In order to vary the rights attached to any 
class of shares, the consent in writing of  
the holders of three-quarters in nominal 
value of the issued shares of that class or 
the sanction of an extraordinary resolution 
passed at a general meeting of such 
holders is required.
General meetings
AGMs and other general meetings, as  
from time to time may be required, where  
a special resolution is to be passed or a 
Director is to be appointed, require 21 clear 
days’ notice to shareholders. Subject to  
the Companies Act 2006, other general 
meetings require 14 clear days’ notice.
For all general meetings, a quorum of  
two shareholders present in person or by 
proxy, and entitled to vote on the business 
transacted, is required unless each of the 
two persons present are corporate 
representatives of the same corporation;  
or each of the two persons present are 
proxy of the same shareholder.
Shareholders and their duly appointed 
proxies and corporate representatives are 
entitled to be admitted to general meetings.
Limitations on the rights to own shares
There are no limitations on the rights to  
own shares.
Property
Substantially all of our properties are held 
freehold, free of material encumbrances  
and are ﬁt for their purpose.

of this Annual Report
Cautionary statement regarding  
forward-looking statements
The purpose of this Annual Report is to provide 
information to the members of the Company. The 
Company and its Directors, employees, agents and 
advisers do not accept or assume responsibility to  
any other person to whom this Annual Report is  
shown or into whose hands it may come and any  
such responsibility or liability is expressly disclaimed.  
In order, among other things, to utilise the ‘safe  
harbour’ provisions of the US Private Securities Litigation 
Reform Act of 1995 and the UK Companies Act 2006, 
we are providing the following cautionary statement:  
This Annual Report contains certain forward-looking 
statements with respect to the operations, performance 
and ﬁnancial condition of the Group. Forward-looking 
statements are statements relating to the future which 
are based on information available at the time such 
statements are made, including information relating  
to risks and uncertainties. Although we believe that  
the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report  
are based on reasonable assumptions, the matters 
discussed in the forward-looking statements may be 
inﬂuenced by factors that could cause actual outcomes 
and results to be materially different from those 
expressed or implied by these statements. The 
forward-looking statements reﬂect knowledge and 
information available at the date of the preparation of  
this Annual Report and the Company undertakes no 
obligation to update these forward-looking statements. 
We identify the forward-looking statements by using the 
words ‘anticipates’, ‘believes’, ‘expects’, ‘intends’ and 
similar expressions in such statements. Important 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 
from those contained in forward-looking statements, 
certain of which are beyond our control, include, among 
other things, those factors identiﬁed in the Principal risks 
and uncertainties section from page 75 of this Annual 
Report. Nothing in this Annual Report should be 
construed as a proﬁt forecast.
Inclusion of Reported performance,  
Core ﬁnancial measures and constant  
exchange rate growth rates
AstraZeneca’s determination of non-GAAP measures 
together with our presentation of them within our 
ﬁnancial information may differ from similarly titled 
non-GAAP measures of other companies.
Statements of competitive position,  
growth rates and sales
In this Annual Report, except as otherwise stated, 
market information regarding the position of our 
business or products relative to its or their competition  
is based upon published statistical sales data for the  
12 months ended 30 September 2012 obtained from 
IMS Health, a leading supplier of statistical data to the 
pharmaceutical industry. For the US, dispensed new or 
total prescription data and audited sales data are taken, 
respectively, from IMS Health National Prescription Audit 
and IMS National Sales Perspectives for the 12 months 
ended 31 December 2012; such data is not adjusted  
for Medicaid and similar rebates. Except as otherwise 
stated, these market share and industry data from  
IMS Health have been derived by comparing our sales 
revenue to competitors’ and total market sales revenues 
for that period. Except as otherwise stated, growth  
rates are given at CER. For the purposes of this Annual 
Report, unless otherwise stated, references to the world 
pharmaceutical market or similar phrases are to the  
54 countries contained in the IMS Health MIDAS 
Quantum database, which amounted to approximately 
92% (in value) of the countries audited by IMS Health.
