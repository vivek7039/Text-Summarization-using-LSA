–  The UK has a well developed system of public and

ideally situated to deal with the growing demand  
for higher severity services.
–  The Government cannot resolve these challenges by  
itself. The private sector must play a key role too.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements A year of 
transition
The performance of the business  
in 2017 has been in line with the 
Board’s expectations and good 
progress has been made.”
Christopher Kemball
Chairman
Chairman� s statement
Overview
Following the sale of our Adult Services 
business to Cygnet Health Care Limited 
(Cygnet), a wholly owned subsidiary of the 
US company Universal Health Services, Inc. 
at the end of 2016, Cambian became a pure 
children’s specialist education and behavioural 
health services business, offering a full range 
of essential services from therapeutic fostering 
through to specialist schools and residential 
care. As at the end of 2017, we managed 
222 facilities and employed over 4,500 staff, 
looking after 1,920 children and young people.
2017 has been a year of transition as we 
established our platform to achieve modest 
growth and become the leading provider in 
children’s services. As part of the conditions 
of the sale of our Adult Services business to 
Cygnet, we undertook to support these activities 
through a transitional services agreement 
(TSA) on commercial terms with Cygnet, which 
required significant management and staff 
resources until the TSA completed at the end of 
June. We were not therefore able to right size 
all our cost base until the second half of last 
year. However, since then we have undertaken 
a significant cost-cutting exercise. This will result 
in approximately £8.5 million of cost reductions 
on an annualised basis, half of which have 
been reflected in 2017.
We have also spent 2017 repositioning the 
business towards a differentiated integrated 
recovery model incorporating care, education 
and therapy for children with the highest needs, 
which is where we believe there is a significant 
shortage of care and education facilities. 
This transformation has led us to review all 
of our facilities and where appropriate we 
have closed certain facilities that cannot be 
re-positioned cost-effectively . We have largely 
completed this process with one facility likely to 
be closed or sold in 2018. This transformation 
has also led us to review the strength of our 
management team and its ability to deliver 
more acute services, as a result of which 
we have made a number of senior hires, 
comprising Head of Special Educational Needs, 
Head of Fostering, Director of Quality and 
Director of People. We are confident that we 
now have the right senior management team 
to successfully manage and grow the business.
Our focus during the year has been to fill 
existing capacity, increase fee levels from 
higher acuity services and reduce the cost 
base to increase margins. Good progress has 
been made on increasing average fee levels 
and average occupancy levels have been 
maintained whilst re-positioning services.

Board changes
We were delighted to welcome Anoop Kang 
who joined the Board as Chief Financial Officer 
on 12 July 2017. Anoop’s most recent role was 
as Group Financial Controller at Kier Group plc, 
having previously held senior positions in the 
construction industry . Martin Hopcroft, who 
joined the Group in late 2015, stepped down 
as Chief Financial Officer on this date. We now 
have a strong triumvirate running the business 
with Saleem Asaria as CEO, Anne Marie Carrie 
as COO and Anoop Kang as CFO.
At the conclusion of the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting on 5 June 2017, both Alison 
Halsey , Chair of the Audit Committee, and 
Chris Brinsmead, Senior Independent Director 
and Chair of the Remuneration Committee, 
stepped down from the Board.
At the same date, Dr. Graham Rich became 
Senior Independent Director in addition to his 
role as Chair of the Quality and Safeguarding 
Committee. Mike Butterworth took over as 
Chair of the Audit Committee on 1 January 
2017 and Donald Muir took over as Chair of  
the Remuneration Committee on 5 June 2017.
We would like to thank Martin, Alison and 
Christopher for the extremely valuable 
contribution they made to Cambian during  
a time of significant transition.
We also appointed Catherine Apthorpe as our 
new Company Secretary on 1 March 2017.
Following an independent Board review 
undertaken by The People Stuff towards the 
end of last year, we have decided to appoint 
an additional non-executive director with 
significant experience in children’s services. We 
expect to make the appointment during 2018.
Standards of care
We rightly judge ourselves on the high 
quality care and successful outcomes which 
we achieve for children placed under our 
care. Although this is not the only standard, 
80% of our services were rated “Good” or 
“Outstanding” by our regulators at year end 
(2016: 83%). One of our Key Performance 
Indicators is to increase this percentage in  
the medium term to over 85% and to have  
no facilities rated as “Inadequate”.
Dividends and dividend policy
Following the sale of the Adult Services 
business, the Board reviewed the future 
cash requirements of the business and 
decided to return an element to shareholders. 
Accordingly , on 15 September 2017, a special 
dividend of £50 million (27.1 pence per share) 
was paid to shareholders.
In addition following a review of the  
Company’s capital requirements for the  
next three years, on 30 January 2018 the 
Board declared a further special dividend  
of £15 million (8.2 pence per share).  
This was paid on 28 February 2018.
The Board intends to maintain a progressive 
dividend policy . Following the reinstatement of 
the dividend at the 2017 half year (0.14 pence 
per share paid on 31 October 2017) and the 
Board’s commitment to resume a progressive 
dividend policy , the Board is recommending  
a full year dividend, for the year ended  
31 December 2017, of 0.39 pence per share 
(2016: nil pence). Subject to shareholder 
approval, the final dividend of 0.25 pence  
per share (2016: nil pence) will be paid on  
31 July 2018 to shareholders on the register  
at the close of business on 6 July 2018.
Our people
Nothing of what we do to improve the lives 
of the children placed in our care would 
be achievable without the hard work 
and dedication of the front-line staff and 
managers throughout our organisation. We 
are, first and foremost, a care business and 
the quality of our work and outcomes has 
been, and will always be, our priority.
With the appointment of a new and highly 
experienced Director of People at the end of 
last year, we are reviewing our recruitment, 
training and induction processes to ensure 
that we offer rewarding and satisfying 
career prospects to all members of our 
staff, thus ensuring a stable, skilled and 
contented workforce.
Future strategy
Our aim is to be the highest quality provider 
of specialist education and behavioural 
health services for children. We are 
concentrating on those areas that have 
a high severity of need, covering the full 
range of services from residential care 
and education to day education and 
therapeutic fostering. Our focus is on those 
with autism, learning difficulties, emotional 
and social difficulties, mental health 
needs, and those suffering as a result of 
sexual abuse or exploitation. We estimate 
our target market to be 88,000 children. 
We intend to achieve this by building the 
industry’s best leadership and workforce, 
installing robust processes and systems, 
improving quality levels and occupancy, and 
driving capacity led but measured growth.

Financial results and position
Revenue increased by 8% to £196.0 million 
(2016: £182.1 million), after the inclusion of 
£2.4 million TSA income, with 6% underlying 
growth in revenue from operations, while 
adjusted EBITDA was £18.7 million (2016: 
£16.2 million). Operating profits before 
exceptional items were £2.4 million (2016: 
£0.2 million loss). Adjusted earnings per 
share were 3.6 pence (2016: 2.4 pence). 
On a statutory basis, we are reporting  
an operating loss of £8.8 million (2016:  
£7.6 million loss), pre-tax loss of  
£9.0 million (2016: £37.4 million loss) and 
loss for the year from continuing operations

for the year from discontinued operations 
was £3.6 million (2016: £155.0 million 
profit) and the total loss for the year was 
£11.4 million (2016: £123.8 million profit). 
The statutory basic loss per share from 
continuing operations was 4.3 pence  
(2016: 17.2 pence loss). 
The Group’s closing capacity was 1,643 places, 
a decrease of 6% over prior year end places 
of 1,744 in line with the plan, with average 
utilisation of 78% (2016: 74%).
We ended the year with a strong balance 
sheet. Net assets were £311.4 million, with  
net cash
2
 of £82.8 million and no debt. We 
also entered into a three year £30 million 
revolving credit facility agreement in May with 
a fixed margin of 2.0% over LIBOR payable on 
the amounts drawn. This facility is undrawn.
Notes:
1  Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before net finance costs, tax, 
depreciation, amortisation, profit or loss on disposal of 
assets, merger and acquisition (M&A) costs, IPO share

Market context
High severity services are required by 
approximately 88,000 individuals, in 
England, within the market segments  
that Cambian serves. The annual spend  
on these individuals is approximately  
£7.2 billion (Company estimate). Around 
half of this population’s needs are currently 
met by independent providers with the 
remainder met by public sector provision. 
We see a number of drivers contributing 
to increasing levels of demand in our 
addressable market: population growth; 
increasing underlying rates of incidence 
of certain conditions; greater awareness 
of needs; and improving diagnosis of 
conditions and comorbidities.
Services provided by Cambian divisions
• Residential Care 
• Specialist Education
• Therapeutic Fostering
Legal and political environment
The independent sector’s role in the market 
has increased in recent years following the 
continued reduction in public sector capacity. 
Independent providers can also offer benefits 
for commissioners through greater levels 
of specialisation. We believe that the trend 
towards outsourcing specialist education 
and behavioural health services to specialist 
independent providers will continue, 
especially in higher severity services.
Constraints on social care budgets, despite 
increasing levels of demand, have forced 
local authorities to carefully ration resources. 
We have chosen to focus on higher severity 
services, for the most vulnerable children 
and young adults, which have been largely 
protected from budget cuts by local authorities.
Regulation
The market that Cambian serves is regulated 
primarily by the Office for Standards in 
Education, Children’s Services and Skills 
(Ofsted) and the Care Quality Commission 
(CQC). These bodies control and administer 
the registration, inspection and complaints 
procedures set out under applicable laws 
and regulations. In order to open a service, 
it needs to be registered with Ofsted or the 
CQC, and must pass regular inspections  
to ensure it meets the minimum standards 
and requirements prescribed under laws 
and regulations.
As the largest children’s services provider, we 
continue to work closely with regulators and 
commissioners across England and Wales.

service in our specialist markets 
• Rigorous governance and  
risk management

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Overview
The clear focus in 2017 was to navigate 
our Group towards becoming the highest 
quality provider of specialist education and 
behavioural health services for children and 
young people. To that end, I am pleased to 
report that we made significant progress 
across the following key objectives:
• Maintained focus on quality.
• Completed the Transitional Services 
Agreement (TSA) with Cygnet in June 
2017, allowing us to focus purely on  
our Children’s Services business.
• Began right-sizing our cost base to  
align our business with its sole focus  
on Children’s Services. We continue to 
identify further operational efficiencies.
• Strengthened our executive  
management team.
• Identified four detailed execution 
components to deliver our medium-term 
plan alongside KPIs against which to  
be measured.
Business performance
During what has been a year of significant 
change following the sale of the Adult 
Services business I am pleased to report 
that the underlying business has performed 
in line with our expectations. This is a huge 
credit to all the teams across the Group. 
At the same time, we are proud to have 
improved the lives of the children in our care 
with 80% of our services rated “Good” or 
“Outstanding” with our regulators at year 
end (2016: 83%).
Revenue increased by 8% to £196.0 million 
(2016: £182.1 million) including £2.4 million 
one-off other income during the period from 
the TSA. Underlying growth in revenue was 
6% driven by an increase in average fee 
levels, which reflected a planned shift to 
focusing on higher severity services. 
Focus on 
execution
Cambian Group is now focused  
on being a market leading provider  
of specialist children’s services.”

Chief Executive Officer
Chief Executive’s strategic review
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 14 Our adjusted EBITDA increased by 15%, 
to £18.7 million (2016: £16.2 million) with 
adjusted EBITDA margins of 9.5% (2016: 
8.9%) reflecting the growth in revenue as 
well as cost savings made in our head 
office functions. These positives were offset 
by one-off impacts resulting from the sale of 
the Adult Services business and a provision 
made for changes to legislation regarding 
staff “sleep-ins” at our facilities.
Operating profit before exceptional  
items was £2.4 million (2016: £0.2 million 
loss) with a statutory operating loss of  
£8.8 million (2016: £7.6 million loss). The 
loss from discontinued operations following 
the sale of the Adult Services business was  
£3.6 million (2016: £155.0 million profit).
Average occupancy was broadly level 
at 1,286 places (2016: 1,294) with an 
underlying transition towards higher severity 
cases during the year. Average utilisation 
increased to 78% (2016: 74%) following a 
planned reduction in operational capacity  
to 1,643 (2016: 1,744).
Average occupancy in the fostering division 
was 634 (2016: 645) with 649 placements  
at the end of the year. 
Creating a strong Children’s  
Services platform
The completion of the TSA allowed us to 
focus on reducing our central costs to align 
our business with its new scale and focus 
on Children’s Services with an efficient 
overhead structure. We reduced our cost 
base in the second half of the year and are 
continuing to identify further operational 
efficiencies that will be delivered during 
2018 and 2019.
During the period, I am pleased to report 
that we have significantly strengthened 
our management team to ensure we 
are able to execute on our strategy. Our 
key appointments include the following 
experienced leaders:
• Anoop Kang, formerly at Kier Group and 
Balfour Beatty, joined us as CFO.
• Rob Walker, previously at Mencap, joined 
us as People Director.
• Dr Sharon Menghini, formerly Director of 
Children’s Services at a number of local 
authorities, joined us as Quality Director.
• Tommy McDonald-Milner, previously 
Chief Executive of Minerva Education and 
Options Group, joined us as Managing 
Director of Special Educational Needs.
• Lynn Webb, formerly Chief Operating 
Officer at Foster Care Associates, joined 
us as Managing Director of Fostering.
I am delighted to reiterate the strategic 
intent for the Group, announced in January 
2018, which outlines our ambition over the 
medium-term:
• Highest quality – aligned to our vision 
to be the highest quality provider of 
specialist education and behavioural 
health services to children and young 
people in the UK.
• Focus on higher severity children –  
a continuation of the strategy that we 
started in 2016. We currently hold a 
market leading position with consistent 
and robust demand for our services. 
Average fee levels are higher than the 
industry average and commensurate  
with the higher severity needs of our 
children and young people.
• Building a platform to change lives  
and create value – consisting of the 
following factors: 
 – a specialist focus on higher  
severity children;
 – established quality and safeguarding 
protocols;
 – the in-house skills and expertise 
necessary to operate the platform;
 – defined models for care and  
therapeutic intervention;
 – real time data and measurable 
outcomes for the children we look after;
 – value for money for the customers who 
refer children to us;
 – a defined strategy for recruitment, 
training and development;
 – a national footprint;
 – fully operational real estate and sales 
and marketing functions;
 – a strong brand backed by a culture  
of innovation;
 – robust business information and 
systems; and
 – a strong balance sheet.
We also defined our aspirations for the 
Group by outlining our medium-term 
KPIs. Our ambition is to increase revenue 
by a compound annual growth rate of 
more than 5% with an adjusted EBITDA 
margin in excess of 16%. We have also 
set targets to increase our average scores 
with our regulators to over 85% “Good” or 
“Outstanding”, increase occupancy levels to 
more than 85% and to continue to increase 
our average daily fee through re-positioning 
to higher severity services.
Our capital expenditure plan targets 
investment of £50 million on growth and 
capacity increases, £15 million to £20 
million to enhance and upgrade our existing 
facilities and £15 million to £20 million on 
systems and IT investment by 2020. Our 
ambition is to deliver a return on capital 
employed on new projects in excess of 20% 
and over 85% operating cash conversion.
This plan is targeted while maintaining a 
strong balance sheet, net debt to adjusted 
EBITDA of less than 1.5x and a progressive 
dividend policy backed by consistent  
EPS growth.

We have defined four components to execute our strategy. 
Build the industry’s  
best leadership  
and workforce
Drive capacity  
led growth
Put in enabling  
systems and data 
Optimise cost  
and operations 
We will continue to build our leadership 
teams, ensuring we have the right 
people in place across the Group to 
manage our facilities and also mentor 
and develop all Cambian staff to ensure 
high quality standards of care. This 
will require investment in training and 
quality assurance. We will strengthen our 
procedures and recruitment resources to 
build a leading workforce capacity with 
highly qualified and experienced staff 
running our teams across the Group. 
We will also focus on our employee 
engagement, producing measurable 
improvements in their engagement in the 
business with the aim of reducing staff 
turnover to less than 20%, minimising 
reliance on agency staff to less than 3% of 
our total employee cost and improving our 
employee net promoter score to +45%.
 Read more on page 22
Finally, we will deploy £15 million to 
£20 million over the next three years to 
enhance and upgrade existing facilities 
as we improve the environments of those 
in our care as well as completing the 
re-positioning of our facilities to higher 
severity services. We shall also begin a 
measured return to increasing capacity by 
developing new facilities organically, using 
our experienced in-house property team,  
 
as well as continuing to evaluate targeted 
bolt-on acquisitions as we begin to  
deploy £50 million with a targeted return 
on capital employed in excess of 20%. 
These investments combined have led us 
to a comprehensive plan for investing  
£85 million in capital expenditure by 2020.
 Read more on page 29
As important to the future will be the need 
to capture high quality data – not only 
to monitor both the performance and 
development of our staff, and to manage 
the performance of our business, but also 
to give high quality clinical evidence of the 
quality of the outcomes that we offer our 
children. We will invest over the next three 
years in integrated systems and IT that  
 
will allow us to achieve these important, 
and differentiating, back and front office 
capabilities across finance, HR and IT as 
well as the therapeutic interventions and 
outcomes of our service users.
 Read more on page 25
We will continue to optimise our cost base 
and identify further operational efficiencies 
across the Group. In addition, we will 
maintain our relentless focus on the 
quality of service delivery across the Group 
and industry leading regulatory scores.

Execution components and 2018
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 16 Quality and regulatory
Our aim is to be the highest quality  
provider of specialist education and 
behavioural health services for our  
children and young people.
At year end 80% of our services were  
rated “Good” or “Outstanding” with Ofsted 
or the Care Quality Commission (CQC) 
(2016: 83%). This performance is against 
a backdrop of the continued raising of 
quality standards in the sector reflected 
in an increasingly stringent regulatory 
environment and an enhanced rigour of 
inspections. We welcome this evolution in 
the drive to improve the focus on quality 
of care and appropriate outcomes for our 
children. Our success in achieving our 
targeted regulatory ratings, and occupancy 
levels, is directly aligned to our ambition 
of building the industry’s best leadership 
and workforce over the medium-term. 
This journey may not be linear, with some 
areas of outstanding practice and others 
where additional focus may be required. 
The percentage of our facilities rated “Good” 
and “Outstanding” may fluctuate in the 
short-term as we continue to re-position to 
higher severity and improve the capability  
of our workforce. 
Our independent Quality and Safeguarding 
Committee, chaired by Dr. Graham Rich, 
provides rigorous oversight of our regulatory 
and safeguarding performance and has 
been strengthened by the appointment of 
Dr Sharon Menghini as Director of Quality.
We are continually examining ways in 
which we can improve our standards of 
care and are investing significantly in better 
selection, training and induction of staff. 
It was therefore particularly disappointing 
that Cambian was featured in a current 
affairs television programme broadcast in 
December 2017, which included undercover 
video footage taken, without notice or 
permission, at a number of care facilities 
managed by independent providers; three 
of which are operated by Cambian. Since 
then, we have identified areas where we 
believe we can improve our service and 
discussed these in detail with our regulator, 
Ofsted, prior to implementing them.
Summary and outlook
2018 will be a year of consolidation and we 
will continue to invest in the systems and 
support for our staff necessary to deliver on 
our plans to return, in a measured fashion, 
to capacity led growth.
The year has started broadly in line with the 
Board’s expectations taking into account 
the temporary setback following the current 
affairs television programme, in December 
2017, and further investment in quality and 
workforce capability. Our focus this year 
is to continue to improve quality whilst re-
positioning services to higher severity with 
corresponding fee increases.
We remain confident for the medium-
term outlook and the Group’s longer-term 
potential, while in the short-term we expect 
to continue to make progress in 2018 and 
look forward to the future with confidence.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Quality 
The vulnerable young people we care for 
and educate have had extremely challenging 
starts in life. We are committed to providing 
them all with a safe and stable home in 
which they can experience meaningful 
attachments and a sense of permanence. 
This provides the foundation upon which we 
support them to realise their personal best.
Our aim is to be the highest quality provider 
of specialist education and behavioural 
health services. Our business is about 
managing and holding risk and we are 
transitioning to a position where we are 
looking after higher acuity children and 
young people. Our success in achieving our 
targeted regulatory ratings, and occupancy, 
is directly aligned to building, and investing 
in, a workforce that has the right capabilities 
and culture. This journey may not be linear, 
and may fluctuate, with some areas of 
outstanding practice and others where 
additional focus may be required as we 
continue to re-position to higher severity.
Our unwavering commitment to quality 
informs our approach to recruitment, 
staff training and development, and our 
policies and procedures. We want the best 
staff, delivering consistently excellent and 
personalised care and education. It also 
means we are committed to providing high 
quality home and learning environments 
that are equipped to meet both today’s and 
emerging needs of those we are care for. 
Our young people deserve nothing less.
We are a reliable and responsible service 
provider delivering excellent outcomes for 
our children and young people. From their 
first day with us, for every young person 
in our care, we are already planning for a 
successful transition and a brighter future. 
We have built and continue to strengthen an 
open and honest working relationship with 
our regulators and those who commission 
us to deliver services. At the 31 December 
2017, 80% of inspection ratings were rated 
“Good” or “Outstanding” (or equivalent) by 
our regulators.
Commitment  
to high quality
I have committed my working life to improving  
the lives of the most vulnerable children in  
society. I believe Cambian has a unique and 
critical role to play in providing the highest  
quality care, therapy and education for these 
children on their journey to a brighter future.”

Operational Quality
Capacity (places) Average utilisation (%) Average daily fee (£) Regulatory rating (%) – facilities rated “Good” or “Outstanding”
Description 
Capacity is the number of places available for 
service users. Capacity excludes fostering places 
which are reported separately. Places are only 
included in capacity once they are handed over 
from our property development team to our 
operations team. Capacity is important as it 
measures the potential size of the business as it 
currently stands, whether or not the places are filled.
Description 
Average utilisation is the average number  
of occupants in the year divided by the  
average capacity. This measures the degree  
to which our units were full in the year.
Description 
Average daily fee is the total revenue in the year 
from operations, less other income, divided by 
the total number of occupied ‘bed days’ for all 
occupants in the year. This measures the average 
fee per day recognised in the year.
Description

Performance 
Capacity decreased by 6.0% in the year in line with 
the plan to re-position service to higher severity. 
The decrease is due to the focus on re-positioning 
existing units to be able to accept higher severity 
service users and filling existing capacity rather  
than increasing capacity.
Performance 
Average utilisation increased by 4ppt in the  
year, following a reduction in capacity, as the 
Group focused on maintaining utilisation whilst  
re-positioning to higher severity.
Performance 
Average daily fee increased by 9% in the year. This 
reflects higher fees from higher severity services.
Performance 
As at the end of 2017, 80% of Children’s Services’ 
facilities were rated “Good “ or “Outstanding”  
(or equivalent) with the relevant regulator.

Operational Quality
Capacity (places) Average utilisation (%) Average daily fee (£) Regulatory rating (%) – facilities rated “Good” or “Outstanding”
Description 
Capacity is the number of places available for 
service users. Capacity excludes fostering places 
which are reported separately. Places are only 
included in capacity once they are handed over 
from our property development team to our 
operations team. Capacity is important as it 
measures the potential size of the business as it 
currently stands, whether or not the places are filled.
Description 
Average utilisation is the average number  
of occupants in the year divided by the  
average capacity. This measures the degree  
to which our units were full in the year.
Description 
Average daily fee is the total revenue in the year 
from operations, less other income, divided by 
the total number of occupied ‘bed days’ for all 
occupants in the year. This measures the average 
fee per day recognised in the year.

Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 31
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Risk management
Improving our  
risk management 
systems and 
approach
within the business throughout 2017, 
this process was maintained to provide 
oversight, to ensure ownership and 
accountability for risk management. Moving 
into 2018 the Board and management have 
agreed that although the framework has 
been working well, this should be updated 
to reflect the change in our business 
environment to focus on the provision of 
leading children’s specialist education 
and behavioural health. PwC have been 
engaged to support us in a review of the 
framework, our principal risks and the 
further embedding of risk management 
throughout the business. Further detail is 
given in the section on page 34 ‘How we 
manage risk at Cambian’.
Throughout the significant changes within 
the business, the Board has continued to 
work closely with the senior management 
team to monitor the principal risks. This 
included from 1 January 2017, the creation 
of the Quality and Safeguarding Committee, 
which alongside the Audit Committee 
(which primarily focuses on financial  
risks), has focused on the monitoring  
of operational and clinical risks in relation  
to the safeguarding of our children and  
young people.
Further information regarding financial 
risk management objectives and policies 
and exposure to price, credit, liquidity and 
cash flow risk is contained in note 31 to the 
financial statements.
Cambian risk management framework
The Board is ultimately responsible for 
maintaining sound risk management, 
internal control and quality systems across 
the Group and monitoring these systems, 
although responsibility for risk and control 
oversight is principally delegated to the 
committees, as described above. The 
Board ensures that there are sound risk 
management and internal control systems 
and, at least annually, carries out a review 
of their effectiveness and reports on that 
review to shareholders. Further detail on  
this is provided under Corporate 
Governance on page 50.
Understanding the risks and ensuring 
these are effectively managed
The Board recognises that understanding 
our principal risks, and ensuring that we 
have sufficient controls in place, is critical 
to the provision of a safe and secure 
environment for the care of vulnerable 
children and young people. Although 
we operate in a fast changing business 
environment, we have considered our 
principal risks alongside our strategy over 
the medium-term.
The Board recognises the importance of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code and 
where this should apply to a well governed 
business. As covered in the 2016 Annual 
Report, we designed and implemented a 
risk management framework to allow the 
Board to assess the main risks facing the 
business. Due to the significant changes 
Our business involves the care of 
vulnerable people with complex needs, 
involving it in significant risks. The effective 
management of risk is a core competence 
and operational focus of Cambian.”

Committee
The executive management team is 
responsible for defining, debating  
and challenging the nature of the  
principal risks and for sponsoring risk 
management activity across the Group.  
It is also responsible for implementing  
the framework and providing challenge  
on risk issues and their mitigation. 
While the Group’s focus on the quality of 
the services it delivers acts as its principal 
tool for the management of operational 
risks, the risk management framework 
supports the delivery of its risk management 
objectives and outlines policy, application 
principles, risk oversight structures, key 
accountabilities and requirements for 
identifying, assessing, reporting and 
monitoring risk. However, effective risk 
management is not just about meeting 
regulatory requirements. Understanding 
the risks Cambian faces, and managing 
them appropriately will enhance its ability 
to make more informed decisions, deliver 
on objectives and subsequently improve 
its performance. In addition, managing 
risk effectively will protect and enhance 
the benefits and commitments the Group 
has made to our service users and 
shareholders, and it is this overarching 
principle that is the backbone of our 
approach to risk and control management.
Responsibility for risk and quality rests  
with each and every person in the business 
and is monitored by each site manager 
on a daily basis, and through regional 
managers and operations directors 
weekly and monthly. Every site is set both 
quality and safeguarding targets for the 
year. These targets are then translated 
into individual staff member’s personal 
objectives. Every month every care service, 
with the exception of fostering, receives  
an unannounced independent inspection  
in accordance with regulations. On an 
annual basis safeguarding policy and 
procedure is fully reviewed to ensure it 
accords with legislation.
The Children’s Services Leadership Team 
(CSLT) meets monthly to review prioritised 
safeguarding and operational risk matters 
raised from sites. It also analyses trends 
in safeguarding and quality data to inform 
improved practice. Any issues of immediate 
concern are raised either at the weekly 
Executive Leadership Team (ELT) or escalated 
further to the Chair of the Quality and 
Safeguarding Committee, and ultimately  
the Board.
The executive management team at  
the ELT considers whether, in the light  
of incidents reported from operations,  
the risks have significantly changed.  
The meeting also considers the 
effectiveness of existing controls against  
the risks and any mitigating actions 
identified in response to specific incidents.
The output of the review focuses on the 
potential impact of the risk on the Group,  
as well as the steps that are being taken  
to provide further control or management 
as needed. A summary of this periodic 
review, is tabled at each Board meeting  
for consideration by the directors.
In this way we believe that we have  
been able to bring together consideration 
of medical, clinical, safeguarding and 
regulatory risks with other commercial  
risks, and monitor during the year. 
The Group oversight structure as described 
above has been developed to provide  
three lines of defence as outlined in the 
diagram below.

the principal risks and had adequate

applicable. During these discussions the 
Board has given consideration to the 
potential impact of these against our 
inherent risk appetite to ensure we are 
comfortable with the potential impact  
to the business.
The priorities for risk management 
throughout 2018 will be to:
• define our risk appetite against the 
principal risks to allow for informed 
decision making against our strategic 
priorities;
• continue to embed the risk management 
framework encouraging ownership and 
accountability throughout the business;
How we manage risk at Cambian
Throughout 2017 we have looked to 
maintain the framework and process 
developed in 2016, with changes made 
to the oversight provided by the Audit 
Committee and Quality and Safeguarding 
Committee as described earlier. During 
early 2018 we have completed a top down 
review, with the support of PwC, through 
the executives and senior management 
of the risk management framework and 
our key risks. The framework was found to 
be sound in principal with some updates 
required to reflect the focus on children’s 
services, revised oversight structure and 
changes in the management team. The 
Board and executives also reviewed the 
risks to ensure that we had clarity over  
Quality and Safeguarding risk areas
• complete a bottom up review through  
the operations to provide greater detail  
on the risk information available including 
the development of key risk indicators; and
• embed the ‘three lines of defence’ 
approach to assurance through the 
business, management and independent 
assurance where appropriate.
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 34 Going concern and viability statements
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Board believes that a robust 
assessment has been undertaken to assess 
the principal risks facing the business. 
Consideration has been given to those 
which could threaten the successful delivery 
of our strategy, impact on our future 
performance, solvency or liquidity.
When considering risk we understand that 
quality and safeguarding is at the heart  
of everything Cambian does as a business. 
During the course of the review in early 
2018, risks have been grouped under key 
themes, which a member of the executive 
management team have responsibility  
for, although it is recognised that these  
all have interdependencies.
The table on pages 36 to 39 lists the 
principal risks and uncertainties that may 
affect the Group and provides further detail 
on a number of additional areas from 2016, 
including the developments in 2017, the 
focus for 2018 and the risk trend.
There have been two risks which have been 
removed from our principal risks which 
were associated with the sale of the Adult 
Services business, which completed in 2017. 
These risks were the separation of services 
and warranties and indemnities.
Going concern statement
The directors have considered the Group’s 
financial resources including a review of 
the medium-term financial plan, which 
includes a review of the Group’s cash 
flow forecasts for the period of at least 
12 months from the date of approval of 
these financial statements. The directors 
have reviewed the assumptions that 
underlie the cash flow forecasts produced 
by management and considered the 
availability of cash following the return 
of capital in February 2018. Based on 
these considerations, the directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for at 
least 12 months from the date of approval 
of these financial statements. For this 
reason, the directors continue to adopt  
the going concern basis in preparing  
the accounts.
Viability statement
The Group’s business model, found on 
pages 12 to 13 and strategy, found on 
page 20 are central to an understanding 
of its prospects. The directors have 
assessed these prospects over a three 
year period to 31 December 2020, and 
have considered this to be the most 
appropriate time period since it conforms 
with the Group’s strategic plan. 
In making their assessment, the directors 
considered Cambian’s availability of cash 
following the return of capital in February 
2018; considered the current financial 
and operational position; considered 
the contracted and forecast capital 
expenditure of the Group; and assessed 
the potential impacts of the identified risks 
and uncertainties as set out on pages 
36 to 39. Based on this assessment, the 
directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and the Group will be 
able to continue in operation and meet 
their liabilities as they fall due through to 
31 December 2020.

Average occupancy remained broadly flat during the year whilst the Group continues to re-position its services. Average utilisation 
increased to 78% (2016: 74%) reflecting sustained conversion of service user referrals as well as the planned reduction in capacity. 
Operational capacity was reduced by a net 101 places in the year predominantly within the Specialist Education division in the first half. 
Excluding the impact of reduced capacity from re-positioning, average occupancy was 73%. Fostering placements were down 2% at

extinguished items, net of the tax effect of these adjustments (note 10).
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 41
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Chief Financial Officer’s review continued
Operating profit/(loss)
Operating profit before exceptional items 
increased by £2.6 million to £2.4 million 
(2016: £0.2 million operating loss), which 
reflect the benefits of the operational 
efficiencies and focus on the Children’s 
Services business. Depreciation for the  
year was £11.1 million (2016: £9.9 million). 
Amortisation of acquired intangibles 
remained flat at £4.2 million.
The charge on IPO option plans of  
£1.1 million (2016: £2.2 million) arises on  
the Continuation Option Plan shares 
awarded as part of the IPO, the impact of 
which is excluded from adjusted EBITDA. 
The decrease reflected the vesting of the 
first tranche of this plan after the transfer  
of certain participants to the Adult Services 
business. Charges on future or post-IPO 
share-based awards are included within 
adjusted EBITDA. After exceptional items, 
the operating loss was £8.8 million (2016: 
£7.6 million loss) for the year.
Exceptional items
The directors have used judgement in 
determining those items which, individually 
or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, need  
to be disclosed separately due to their size 
or incidence in order to obtain a more clear 
and consistent presentation of the Group’s 
underlying performance.
Exceptional items of £11.2 million were 
recorded in the year (2016: £7.4 million). 
£5.2 million relates to the impairment of  
an asset that could not be cost effectively  
re-positioned to higher severity. £3.5 million 
relates to the potential impact of the 
National Minimum Wage Regulations  
2015 (sleep-ins) for 2016 and prior years. 
£1.2 million relates to costs associated with 
the disposal of the Adult Services business. 
£0.9 million relates to costs of Group 
restructuring and reorganisation and  
£0.6 million relates to costs associated  
with IT restructuring post the disposal  
of the Adult Services business. 
Taxation
The tax credit for the year was £1.2 million 
(2016: £6.2 million tax credit), equating to  
an effective tax rate of 18.2% (2016: 24.9%) 
on an underlying basis before exceptional 
items. The difference between the current 
statutory rate and the effective tax rate is 
principally due to the recognition of historic 
tax losses that are expected to be utilised  
in future periods. 
Earnings per share
The adjusted earnings per share increased 
by 50% to 3.6 pence per share (2016:  
2.4 pence per share). The statutory loss  
per share from continuing operations was  
4.3 pence per share (2016: 17.2 pence per 
share). Taking into account discontinued 
operations the total statutory loss per share 
was 6.3 pence per share (2016: 68.6 pence 
per share profit). The 2016 earnings per 
share principally relates to discontinued 
operations as a result of the profit on sale  
of the Adult Services business.
Return of capital
On 15 September 2017, a special dividend  
of £50 million (27.1 pence per share) was 
paid to shareholders in line with previous 
announcements on the return of capital to 
shareholders following the sale of the Adult 
Services business.
In addition, following a review of the Group’s 
capital requirements over the medium  
term, the Board declared a further special 
dividend of £15 million in January 2018.  
This was paid on 28 February 2018.
Revenue
Group revenue increased by 8% to  
£196.0 million (2016: £182.1 million) 
reflecting the re-positioning to higher 
severity services and increases in fees.  
This also included £2.4 million of other 
income in connection with the disposal  
of the Adult Services business. Underlying 
revenue growth, excluding other income, 
was 6%. As part of the sale, the Group 
entered into a TSA to provide services 
relating to IT , finance, procurement and 
estates to the purchasers. These services 
ended on 28 June 2017 allowing the Group 
to focus on its core operations. Fostering 
revenue remained flat at £30.6 million 
(2016: £30.5 million) with improvements  
in fees being offset by the number  
of placements.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA increased by 15% to  
£18.7 million (2016: £16.2 million). This 
reflects the growth in revenue from 
improved fee levels as well as benefiting 
from central cost reduction initiatives. 
Administrative expenses increased by 3% 
from £44.8 million to £46.2 million. The 
adjusted EBITDA was partially impacted  
by delays in transferring back to the Group 
five assets temporarily stranded following 
the sale of the Adult Services business 
(Stranded Assets). All of these assets were 
successfully transferred back to the Group 
by 30 June 2017. Despite the Group also 
incurring additional costs to accelerate the 
completion of the TSA, the adjusted EBITDA 
margin percentage improved from 8.9% to 
9.5% in the year.
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 42 Dividend
Following the sale of the Adult Services 
business, the balance sheet strength and 
confidence in the Group‘s outlook over  
the medium term, the Board decided to 
reinstate the dividend at an appropriate 
level during 2017. The Board is 
recommending a full year dividend, for  
the year ended 31 December 2017, of  
0.39 pence per share (2016: nil pence).  
An interim dividend of 0.14 pence per share 
was paid on 31 October 2017. Subject to 
shareholder approval, the final dividend  
of 0.25 pence per share (2016: nil pence) 
will be paid on 31 July 2018 to shareholders  
on the register at the close of business on  
6 July 2018.

Discontinued operations relates to the 
disposal of the Adult Services business. The 
disposal took place on 28 December 2016 
for an initial consideration of £383.0 million 
excluding directly attributable costs.
The Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA)  
for the disposal of the Adult Services 
business required agreement of a Closing 
Statement, as is customary in such 
transactions. This was concluded on  
19 September 2017, after agreement was 
reached between the Group and the buyer, 
and is reflected in the results for the period. 
Following a net adjustment of £4.0 million 
payable to the buyer the final consideration 
for the Adult Services business is £379.0 
million excluding directly attributable costs. 
Cash flow
Net cash from operating activities was an 
inflow of £29.9 million (2016: £3.4 million), 
with working capital movements reflecting 
an excellent performance on cash 
collections in the second half of the year. 
This represents an operating cash to 
adjusted EBITDA conversion rate of 151%. 
Net cash was £82.8 million at the year  
end (2016: £116.1 million). This movement 
reflected the positive operating cash flow 
partially offset by the payment of dividends 
in the year of £49.7 million.
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure was £10.8 million  
(2016: £6.4 million) in the year, of which  
£6.1 million (2016: £4.5 million) was spent 
on the development of new capacity and 
£4.7 million (2016: £1.9 million) on the 
maintenance of existing units. Going 
forward, capital expenditure will increase  
as the Group invests in growth and capacity 
increases, enhancements and upgrades  
to existing facilities, and systems and IT .
Financing facilities
In May 2017, the Group entered into a three 
year £30 million revolving credit facility with 
Barclays for general corporate purposes 
with a fixed margin of 2.0% over LIBOR on 
amounts drawn under the facility, together 
with customary fees, covenants, baskets 
and undertakings. No drawdowns have 
been made to date.

Fulfilling our 
responsibilities
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 44 The young people that  
we support expect great 
services. Our continued 
success depends on 
acknowledging and fulfilling 
our responsibilities to them.
Our commitment to our young people
We believe the success of those entrusted  
in our care is our most important corporate 
responsibility. 
Their achievements provide us with a  
huge source of pride and also provide a 
significant benefit to society and the local 
communities where our services operate. 
There are many examples of this and for 
example, in 2017:
• A team of three from Southlands School 
were the winners of the Longitude Explorer 
Prize 2017, a scheme run by innovation 
foundation, Nesta and supported by 
technology company, IBM. The team was 
awarded prize money to fund their project 
‘Octoptix’, a wearable device that will help 
people with autistic spectrum disorder to 
better communicate their emotions, and 
bring the product to market.
• Three young people from By the Bridge 
with Cambian were part of a group of 
ten selected to meet the Minister for 
Children and Families and the Children’s 
Commissioner. They took part in 
workshops and a round table discussion 
on fostering and their input will be used  
in the final report and recommendations.
• A young person who had completed a 
first aid course under the “Get a Lifestyle 
Skills Award” programme, used his new 
skills to help stabilise a person who had 
collapsed and subsequently won an 
award from the local authority.
• One of our foster children won Rotary 
Citizen of the Year for their advocacy work. 
She appeared on the BBC, numerous 
radio stations and spoke to a group 
of young people with disabilities at 
Doncaster College on “never giving up 
and achieving your potential”.
• An ex-pupil from Cambian New 
Elizabethan School was taken on as a 
volunteer to assist with teaching in the 
school and is now an integral part of  
the team. 
• One of our young people with severe 
autism was nominated for a “Dorset 
Young People’s Award” for his 
commitment to his work experience 
placement at our local library.
We are committed to playing a positive role 
in the communities in which we operate 
and recognise their contribution they make 
to help us.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Our corporate and social responsibility continued
• A young person who regularly attended  
a youth club in Wolverhampton,  
made waterproof cardboard shelters  
for the homeless.
• As part of their John Muir Award, students 
from Cambian Whinfell School supported 
the National Park Rangers to clear the 
woods, maintaining pathways and 
planting trees.
• All the young people and staff members 
of one of our residential homes, Queens 
Park, attended the local residential 
association meetings, which has helped 
to break down negative stereotypes of 
“naughty children”. 
• Students at Hill House School have 
worked collaboratively with Brockenhurst 
Mainstream Sixth Form College to learn new 
skills such as plumbing and brick laying.
• Purbeck View has developed links with  
the Parish of Shaftesbury and the local 
Mayor and Mayor’s office to raise 
awareness of autism and opportunities 
for inclusion. Links have also been 
developed with local secondary schools 
and colleges to develop mentoring 
schemes and work related learning 
opportunities for our students. 
• Students from The Forum School attended 
the local “Park Run” supporting local running 
groups and regularly attended inclusion 
lessons with a local Independent School.
We also encourage everyone in the Group 
to support both local and national charities 
and to participate in all manner of 
fundraising activities. Some examples in 
2017 include:
• Hill House School supported the Music  
for Autism charity through a range of  
fund raising initiatives.
• Local villagers near Cambian New 
Elizabethan School, attended  
fundraising events such as Macmillan 
Coffee mornings. 
• Young people in the army cadets who live 
in our residential homes Abbey Close and 
Willoughby homes, supported the poppy 
appeal and assisted with community fund 
raising events in Halton and Widnes.
• Students at Purbeck View School have 
been actively involved with the Swanage 
Christmas Tree festival and the Swanage 
Carnival raising funds for local charities  
as well as decorating floats.
• A young person and the home manager 
of Linden House, organised a charity 
bike ride around the football grounds of 
Newcastle United, Middlesbrough and 
Sunderland after the loss of his mother the 
previous year to cancer, raising hundreds 
of pounds for charity. 
• Three young people from By the Bridge 
with Cambian contributed to the 
sustainable development programmes 
with Raleigh International by volunteering 
in Nicaragua, Borneo and Nepal.
• As part of World Kindness day, our foster 
children in the Thames Valley collected old 
newspapers, clean blankets and towels 
for a local vet who distributed them to  
a local animal sanctuary on our behalf. 
• Two staff members from Cambian 
Whinfell School spent two weeks  
of their annual holiday in Eldoret,  
Kenya, participating in the Open  
Arms Orphanage programme helping  
to develop special needs services. 
We recognise that corporate social 
responsibility also extends as to how we 
treat our employees. By providing the 
training, support and development they 
need it helps us maintain our position as  
a leading provider of specialist behavioural 
health services in the UK for children.
Our commitment to the local 
communities in which our  
service operates
Building close ties with the local 
communities in which we work, helps them 
to understand the work that we do and the 
problems our young people face, whilst 
also providing therapeutic and educational 
benefits for those in our care. Examples of 
our community participation in 2017 include:
• A young person at Cedar Drive, a residential 
home, acted as a mentor for other young 
people at their local Barnardos.
• Ten students from Cambian Wing College 
took up voluntary befriending roles at a 
local elderly care home in Bournemouth.
• Cambian New Elizabethan School leased 
their cricket pitch and pavilion during the 
summer to a local cricket team and also 
hosted local Parish Council meetings. 
• The Forum School host the local Bee 
Keeping club, allowing the children to 
meet and learn about bees.
• A young person at The Fields, a residential 
home for young people who have 
experienced sexual exploitation, spent 
last Christmas volunteering at a food bank 
serving Christmas dinner and playing 
games with young children.
• Students at Hill House school regularly 
took part in community lunch clubs where 
they planned, prepared and cooked hot 
food for local residents whilst also gaining 
an understanding of the world of work.
• Cambian Whinfell School participated  
in the Kendal Comic Art Festival, which 
they won.
• Our students from Purbeck View,  
provided a free newspaper round  
to their neighbours.
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 46 Our commitment to our employees
The young people who we support expect 
great services, so we expect our staff to be 
professional and dedicated; focused on 
continually seeking to enable the young 
people in our care to achieve their personal 
best. Our intention is to be the employer of 
choice within our sector which is key to 
helping us achieve our ambition of Cambian 
being the leading provider of behavioural 
health services for young people. We have 
committed to a three year strategic HR plan 
which includes:
Cambian will celebrate the success  
of our people 
2018/2019 will see the continued 
development of our employee recognition 
programme, our desire is to inclusively 
reward all our people and recognise those 
who work hard to help the young people  
in our care achieve their personal best, our 
homes and schools to meet the high-quality 
care standards we set ourselves and  
allow employees to share in the success  
of our business.
In addition, throughout the coming year 
through new employee recognition awards, 
there will be opportunities to recognise our 
commitment to continued personal 
development and to acknowledge the great 
work that is achieved across our company. 
We firmly believe that it is our responsibility 
to ensure that all our people have the 
opportunity to achieve their personal best.
We value our people
Our people are as diverse and as individual 
as the young people whom we support.  
We are committed to promoting equal 
opportunities and encourage all our people 
to treat one another and those we support 
with honesty and respect. We create a 
family environment in all our homes, 
schools and offices.
We are resolutely focused on providing 
equal opportunities to prospective and 
existing employees at Cambian and 
continue to strive to adopt best practice 
initiatives to ensure we remain consistent 
and equitable.
An employer of choice
We know we could do more to attract 
people to Cambian and improve how long 
they stay working with us. High turnover not 
only has an impact on costs, but we can 
often lose the vital skills that in our homes 
and schools can have a real impact on the 
young people in our care.
In 2018 we will embark on our new 
employee branding and with our insight 
into our engagement exercises we now 
know why our people leave, at what points 
and have actions in place to encourage 
people to stay. We will be in a position to 
improve our employee population so it is 
more representative and will be able to 
enjoy an improved conversion rate within  
all stages of our recruitment process.
Reward, recognition & communication
There is a need to improve attraction and 
retention of our employees and how valued 
people feel at Cambian. This needs to  
be felt as relevant, tangible and visible. 
Fairness is key at Cambian, our aspiration  
is that all our:
• People would see improvements to our 
approach to pay so it would be seen as 
fair, transparent and consistent. 
• People feel at Cambian that we are doing 
the very best we can in terms of pay  
with the resource we have in this, 
aligned with our financial planning and 
organisational objectives. 
• Reward is benchmarked externally as 
appropriate to particular roles/areas.
• Compensatory benefits are marketed  
well internally and externally.
• Non pay benefits are marketed well 
internally and are meaningful.
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 47
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Our aspiration is to provide a  
highly competitive benefits and  
rewards package
We also strive to be as environmentally 
friendly as possible. We recognise the  
need to care for and protect the 
environment in which we work and  
to reduce our carbon footprint.
Our environmental commitment 
As a listed company, we are required to 
report on our greenhouse gas emissions 
pursuant to the Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ Report 
Regulations 2013). We are committed to 
reducing our impact on the environment 
and strive to use our resources in an 
efficient manner that minimises waste 
production and meets all legislative 
requirements. During 2017, we:
• promoted where feasible the use of rail 
travel and cycle to work schemes;
• encouraged all employees and those in 
our care to recycle as much as possible;
• reduced the number of printers we have 
in our facilities; 
• implemented tracker devices on our fleet 
of vehicles;
• continued to update our buildings and 
facilities so that they are more energy 
efficient to achieve the minimum BREAM 
standards where possible; 
• continued to implement a range of 
energy efficiency projects including the 
introduction of more energy efficient 
condenser boilers into our facilities and 
better insulation specifications at all sites 
unless prohibited by Listed Building or 
Conservation Areas; and 
• continued to review the market for  
new technologies to help reduce  
our emissions.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions  
(GHG emissions) reporting
Under the Large and Medium-Sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 as amended in 
August 2013, we are required to report our 
GHG emissions for which we deem we are 
responsible and are material. 
Reporting boundary
The data collated is consistent with what is 
required for consolidation purposes in the 
financial statements. An operationally 
controlled approach is used to define our 
organisational boundary and emissions 
such as business travel via commercial 
flights and or those not within our control, 
have not been reported.
Methodology
The GHG emissions report has been 
prepared in line with UK mandatory 
reporting requirements, set by the 
Department for Environment, Food and Rural 
Affairs (DEFRA). The mandatory requirement 
is for the disclosure of scope 1 and 2 
emissions only. These are direct emissions 
such as heating, vehicle fuel and indirect 
emissions, for example purchased gas and 
electricity. The Group’s total GHG footprint  
in line with DEFRA’s mandatory reporting 
requirements is 21.6 million tonnes of CO
2
e.
Intensity ratio
In order to express our annual emissions in 
relation to a quantifiable factor associated 
with our activities, we have used revenue “r” 
in our intensity ratio calculation, as this is the 
most relevant indication of our growth and 
provides for a good comparative measure 
over time.
Along with our commitment to the 
environment, we recognise the need for 
strong social and governance practices 
including our commitment to acting  
ethically in all areas of our organisation  
and in meeting forthcoming data  
protection regulations. 
Modern Slavery Act 2015
The Modern Slavery Act 2015 came into 
force in October 2015 consolidating 
legislation surrounding modern slavery and 
human trafficking. We have a zero tolerance 
approach towards modern slavery or 
human trafficking across all areas of our 
organisation including in our supply chains, 
and are committed to acting ethically and 
with integrity throughout all of our dealings. 
We aim to work in partnership with all of our 
contractors, suppliers and other business 
partners to ensure that they share and work 
towards the same values we hold against 
slavery and human trafficking.

statement can be found on our website.
Our corporate and social responsibility continued
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 48 Anti-bribery and corruption
The Company maintains a policy for 
anti-bribery and corruption and has a  
zero tolerance towards such activities.  
The Company requires compliance with  
the laws of the UK, including the Bribery  
Act 2010 in respect of its conduct both in  
the UK and overseas.
Internally we operate a suite of policies that 
are embedded into our culture and help 
govern our activities. Examples of these 
policies include:
• Code of Conduct Policy – this sets out the 
behaviours we expect of our employees 
when acting for Cambian.
• Recruitment Policy – all of our employees 
are recruited after a robust recruitment 
process in line with UK employment 
laws and are required to undertake 
appropriate CRB checks.
• Whistleblowing Policy – employees are 
encouraged to raise any concerns about 
wrongdoing or malpractice. We recognise 
the importance of allowing our employees 
to raise any concerns without the fear  
of retaliation. 
We also continue to regularly monitor the 
risks we face. All risks are reviewed by 
either our Audit Committee or our Quality 
and Safeguarding Committee. Going 
forward, we plan to embed a new risk 
management framework and will continue 
to review and monitor our procedures  
and processes.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Dear Shareholder
Governance framework 
Our governance framework supports the 
development of good governance practices 
throughout our Group, and the Board 
works closely with the Executive Committee, 
which is responsible for ensuring that 
the policies and behaviours set at Board 
level are effectively communicated and 
implemented across the Group. We receive 
regular updates at Board and Committee 
meetings from the Chief Executive Officer, 
Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer. The Board and senior management 
attend a two day strategy off-site away 
from the office in November to discuss 
and agree the three year strategy for the 
business and to set the parameters for the 
next year’s budget. We also meet regularly 
with members of the Executive Committee 
throughout the year to establish how the 
business is progressing. Through regular 
discussion with the executive directors 
and other members of the Executive 
Committee, we are comfortable that our 
existing framework continues to ensure 
that the principles of good governance 
are rooted in the Cambian culture and 
no changes to the framework have been 
required in the year. We continue to strive 
for excellence in governance, and as such 
keep our structure, policies and procedures 
under close review. The Board meetings 
are usually preceded by a Board dinner 
during which specific topics are raised 
by the Executive which do not require an 
immediate decision by the Board.
Non-executive director site visits 
All our non-executive directors are  
required to visit one or more of our sites  
at least once a year. This helps them to 
further their knowledge and understanding 
of our facilities and local staff and 
management. The visits, combined with  
the presentations by members of the 
Executive received during the year, help  
the Board to understand better the 
operational challenges and other issues 
facing the business.

Chairman
How we apply the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016
Section of the Code Further information
Leadership
A company must be headed by an effective board which is collectively 
responsible for the long-term success of the company. There should be  
clear divisions of responsibility between the running of the board (led by  
the Chairman) and the executive. 
Board leadership, 
Page 54
Effectiveness
The established board and its committees will have the relevant level of and 
appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of  
the company in order to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities 
effectively. Such knowledge is certified by rigorous procedures regarding the 
appointment of new, and the re-appointment of existing, directors. All directors 
should allocate sufficient time to the company.
Evaluation, Page 57 
Accountability
At all times, the board must present a fair, balanced and understandable 
evaluation of the company’s position and prospects. Such future prospects  
are considered against risks that the company is facing, or may face, moving 
forward; it is the board’s responsibility to ensure that effective and appropriate 
risk management and internal control procedures are in place.
Strategic report 
Pages 2 to 49
Remuneration
While it is necessary for levels of remuneration to attract, retain and motivate 
directors of sufficient quality, at no point should the company allocate more than 
is necessary. Where possible, remuneration should be designed to promote  
the long-term success of the company, linked to performance and, at all times, 
established through formal and transparent procedures of which no one director 
is involved in his or her own remuneration.

Governance overview
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 50 Strategic oversight
I have had regular meetings during the  
year with our Chief Executive Officer,  
Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer, and other members of the executive 
management team at Cambian and will 
continue to do so in 2018. These meetings 
enable me to stay abreast of developments 
in the business between Board meetings 
and to confirm that we are continuing to 
perform against our strategic objectives.
Independence and potential  
conflicts of interest
The Board is currently comprised of four 
independent and one non-independent 
non-executive directors, and three executive 
directors and we therefore comply with 
the independence requirements of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code for smaller 
companies. The independence of our non-
executive directors is reviewed annually by 
the Nomination Committee (described in the 
Nomination Committee’s report on pages 
65 to 66). Their independence could be 
impinged where a director has a conflict of 
interest, and the Board therefore operates 
procedures to identify and manage 
situations where such a conflict could arise. 
During the year, all directors confirmed  
(as they are required to do annually) that 
they have been able to allocate sufficient 
time to discharge their responsibilities 
effectively. Directors are also required to 
notify me and the Board of any alterations 
to their external commitments that arise 
during the year with an indication of the 
time commitment involved. 
Performance evaluation 
Given the significant changes to both the 
business and the Board over the last two 
years, we decided to appoint The People 
Stuff (TPS), an external consultancy, to 
evaluate the Board last November and 
December. This involved TPS conducting 
an online survey followed by one-on-
one interviews with each member of the 
Board and designated members of senior 
management below Board level. They also 
observed one Board meeting.
TPS produced a detailed report on the 
performance of the Board as a whole and 
individual assessments of each director 
with recommended areas of improvement, 
the former of which was discussed by 
the whole Board and the latter with each 
individual director. The Chairman then 
followed this up with one-on-one meetings 
to discuss any areas of improvement 
individually with each director. Following  
this evaluation, the Board resolved to  
action a number of specific points within 
strategy, performance management, 
internal controls and risk management, 
roles responsibilities and relationships,  
and shareholder engagement. 
The annual evaluation process is an 
important mechanism for ensuring that 
best practice is at the forefront of all Board 
and Committee actions. The review of my 
performance is led by Dr. Graham Rich,  
our senior independent director, who  
has confidential discussions with the  
non-executive directors whilst taking into 
account the views of executive directors. 
Shareholder engagement 
We are committed to proactive and 
constructive engagement with shareholders 
and recognise the important and valuable 
role that shareholders play in safeguarding 
the Group’s governance. The Board receives 
regular updates on the views of our 
shareholders through briefings and reports 
from our interaction with shareholders 
during the year and from our brokers. 
In the event that shareholders have any 
concerns, which the normal channels 
of communication to the Chief Executive 
Officer, the Chief Financial Officer or me 
have failed to resolve or for which contact 
is inappropriate, our senior independent 
director, Dr. Graham Rich, is available to 
address them. To that end, both Graham 
and I make ourselves available, when 
requested, for meetings with shareholders 
on issues relating to the Group’s 
governance and strategy. The Committee 
Chairs and I also receive correspondence 
from shareholders, institutional investors 
and proxy voting agencies, typically in the 
lead up to the Annual General Meeting 
(AGM). This correspondence is presented 
to the Board or relevant Committee as 
appropriate.
Shareholder engagement activities during 
2017 included meetings or telephone 
conversations by the Executive and 
separately by me with each of our four 
major shareholders: G.I. Partners, Richard 
Griffiths, Teleios Capital Partners LLC, and 
Lombard Odier Asset Management Europe.
Analyst and investor meetings  
and presentations 
In common with most listed companies, 
we hold analyst and investor meetings 
and presentations following the release of 
our annual, half year and trading update 
announcements. We aim to ensure that all 
questions are comprehensively dealt with 
at these meetings. We also ensure that the 
presentations are available on our website 
immediately after broadcast.
On 30 January 2018, we held a 
Capital Markets Day at one of our 
facilities, Potterspury Lodge School in 
Northamptonshire, for investors and 
analysts. It gave us the opportunity to 
explain our sector in detail, present our 
strategy and introduce members of  
our senior management team below  
Board level.
Other shareholder meetings 
In 2017, frequent meetings and conference 
calls were held with existing and potential 
shareholders, either as one-off meetings 
or as part of a roadshow. These meetings 
were attended by the Chief Executive 
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer and 
sometimes the Chief Operating Officer. 
The meetings focused primarily on trading 
operations and the implementation of our 
business strategy. Any significant views 
expressed are recorded and circulated to 
the Board to keep them up to date with 
shareholder and investor sentiment.

Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 53
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Corporate governance report
Appliance of the UK Corporate Governance Code
In April 2016, the Financial Reporting Council published the 2016 
edition of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) (a copy 
of which is available on the Financial Reporting Council’s website 
(www.frc.org.uk)) which contains broad principles and specific 
provisions to assist with how boards operate. 
Save as disclosed below, the Board has complied with the 
provisions of the Code throughout the year.
As disclosed in the directors’ remuneration report on page 84,  
a nil-cost option award was made to the Chief Executive Officer 
(which was made prior to the Company’s admission to the main 
market) which vests as to one-third of the award on each of 
the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of admission. 
This award does not contain any performance-related vesting 
conditions as recommended in Schedule A of the Code since 
it was made prior to admission and in part to reward for past 
performance and to provide a long-term retention mechanism  
for the executive directors and key senior managers.
Due to the intensive process of completing the transitional services 
agreement with Cygnet Healthcare Limited which concluded at 
the end of June 2017, the Nomination Committee did not lead the 
process for board appointments in the first quarter of 2017; nor did 
it prepare a description of the roles and capabilities required for  
the appointments as recommended in B.2.1.1 and B.2.2 of the Code. 
Instead, the appointment of Anoop Kang as Chief Financial Officer 
in July 2017 was handled as a special item in the main Board 
meeting. An external search consultancy, Korn Ferry, was used  
in connection with his appointment.
The senior independent director has not attended meetings  
with major shareholders as recommended in E.1.1 of the Code, 
although was available to attend such meetings if so requested. 
The Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial 
Officer have attended such meetings.
Board leadership
Role of the Board
The Board has collective responsibility for the management, 
direction and performance of the Company. It provides leadership 
within a framework of prudent and effective controls seeking 
to enable risk to be appropriately assessed and managed. The 
Board has established the governance framework (as described 
in the risk management section on pages 32 to 39) to support the 
development of good governance practices throughout the Group.
The Board takes a long-term outlook and sees itself as responsible 
to a wide range of stakeholders including shareholders, customers, 
care commissioning bodies and employees, whilst pursuing its 
objectives in a manner consistent with its statutory duties.
Board composition and balance
As at 31 December 2017, the Board comprised the Chairman, 
the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief 
Operating Officer, together with three independent non-executive 
directors (including one senior independent director) and one 
further non-executive director.
The list of current directors, their roles and respective dates of 
appointment are set out in the table below.
Director’s name Title Appointed
Christopher Kemball Independent non-executive director, 
Chairman
March 2014
Saleem Asaria Executive director, CEO March 2014
Anoop Kang Executive director, CFO July 2017
Anne Marie Carrie Executive director, COO December 
2016
Dr. Graham Rich Senior Independent non-executive 
director
July 2015
Alfred Foglio Non-executive director March 2014
Mike Butterworth Independent non-executive director April 2016
Donald Muir Independent non-executive director June 2016
Further biographical information on each of the Company’s 
directors can be found on pages 52 and 53, which shows the 
breadth of strategic and financial management insight brought to 
the Company’s Board. The independent non-executive directors 
bring industry experience from a wide range of backgrounds 
including finance, business services, pharmaceuticals, telecoms, 
software and the NHS.
The principle of boardroom diversity is strongly supported by the 
Board. It is the Board’s policy that appointments will always be 
based on merit so that the Board has the right individuals in place. 
The Board ensures that diversity is an important consideration and 
part of the selection criteria used to assess candidates to achieve  
a balanced board.
The Board also reviews non-executive directors’ independence 
on an annual basis, taking into account such factors as their 
contribution to unbiased and independent debate during meetings. 
All non-executive directors (other than Alfred Foglio) are considered 
by the Board to be independent of management and free of any 
relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of 
their independent judgement, as explained above. Alfred Foglio 
is not considered to be independent for the purposes of the 
Code as a result of his being the director appointed to the Board 
by GI Partners in accordance with the terms of the Relationship 
Agreement as described on page 58.
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 54 To safeguard their independence, a director is not entitled to  
vote on any matter in which they have a material personal interest 
unless the rest of the Board unanimously decides otherwise.  
Where necessary, directors are required to absent themselves from 
a meeting of the Board while such matters are being discussed, 
although no such situations arose in 2017. The Board has an 
annual process of formally reviewing conflicts disclosed and 
governing the authorisations given (including such conditions as 
the Board may determine in each case). Any conflicts, or potential 
conflicts, considered by the Board and any authorisations given 
are recorded in the Board minutes and in a register of directors’ 
conflicts which is maintained by the Company Secretary. 
Induction Programme
When Anoop Kang joined the Company, the Board, in conjunction 
with the Company Secretary, provided a tailored induction 
programme designed to ensure that Anoop obtained a 
comprehensive picture of Cambian’s operations and culture. 
How the Board functions
The Board meets regularly, with eight scheduled meetings held in 
2017. In addition, four other meetings (including sub-committee 
meetings) were held outside this schedule, which dealt with signing 
off final documentation relating to the special dividend, the interim 
dividend, and an emergency meeting concerning the broadcasting 
of the ITV programme that involved Cambian. In November, the 
Board held a two day off-site strategy meeting which involved 
all the directors, in addition to a number of senior members of 
the executive team. This enabled the non-executive directors to 
get to know senior management from the operational side of 
the business who each presented their function, how each of 
their teams operate and a detailed synopsis into each part of the 
business. It gave the Board the opportunity to consider and form 
high level strategic objectives for the Group’s three year plan. 
During the year, the Chairman met with the other non-executives 
in the absence of the executive directors to re-confirm and take 
account of their views. 
Roles and responsibilities

Executive Officer (Saleem Asaria) are separated and clearly defined.

In addition to receiving reports from the Board’s committees, reviewing the financial and operational performance of the Group and 
considering reports from the Company’s risk management and quality and safeguarding functions at the Board meetings, key matters 
considered by the Board during 2017 included ensuring the completion of the transitional services agreement with Cygnet Healthcare 
Limited following the disposal of the Adult Services business, the return of £50 million of capital to shareholders by way of special dividend,

2 Resigned 5 June 2017.
3 Appointed to Remuneration Committee and the Nomination Committee 5 June 2017.
4 Appointed 12 July 2017.
With effect from 1 January 2017, the Audit & Risk Committee was 
split to form the Audit Committee (which is, inter alia, responsible 
for reporting to the Board on financial risks) and the Quality and 
Safeguarding Committee (which is responsible for reporting to 
the Board on issues of safeguarding, clinical or operational risk). 
The composition of these committees is set out on page 53 and a 
report on each of the committees activities in 2017 (as appropriate) 
is set out on pages 59 to 87. The minutes of these committees 
are circulated and noted by the Board. The Company Secretary is 
secretary to each of these committees. The terms of reference for 
the Audit Committee, the Nomination Committee, the Quality and 
Safeguarding Committee and the Remuneration Committee are 
available to view on the Company’s website. 
Day-to-day management of Cambian is delegated to the Executive 
management. 
Risk
Under the Code, the Board is responsible for determining the nature 
and extent of the principal risks it is willing to take in achieving its 
strategic objectives. The Board should maintain a sound system 
of risk management and internal control systems (Main Principle 
C.2). During the year and with the assistance of both the Audit 
Committee and the Quality and Safeguarding Committee, the Board 
has carried out an assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Company, including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity. The Board also carried out 
a review of the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management 
and internal control systems. These risks, and the steps taken by 
Cambian to mitigate them, are described more fully on pages 32 
and 39. The viability statement required to be made under Code 
provision C.2.2. is set out on page 35.
Responsibility and delegation
There remains in place a formal schedule of matters specifically 
reserved for Board consideration and approval, which includes  
the matters set out below: 
• approval of the Group’s long-term objectives and  
commercial strategy;
• approval of the annual operating and capital expenditure 
budgets and any material changes to them;
• major acquisitions and disposals;
• the extension of the Group’s activities into any new business  
or geographic areas, or to cease any material operations;
• changes in the Company’s capital structure or entering into any 
material bank facilities or granting security;
• approval of treasury policies, including foreign currency 
exposures and use of financial derivatives;
• the entering into of agreements that are not in the ordinary 
course of business or material either strategically or by reason  
of their size;
• changes to the size, composition or structure of the Board and  
its committees; and
• corporate governance matters.
In 2017, the Board delegated certain of its responsibilities to a 
number of committees of the Board to assist in the discharge  
of its duties. The principal committees of the Board were: the  
Audit Committee, the Quality and Safeguarding Committee,  
the Remuneration Committee and the Nomination Committee. 
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 56 Board balance
The Board comprises individuals with wide business experience 
gained in various industry sectors related to the Group’s business 
and it is the intention of the Board to ensure that the balance of  
the directors reflects the changing needs of the business.
The Chairman and the rest of the Board continue to support Lord 
Davies’ aspiration for female board representation. At the end of 
2017, one Board director and the Company Secretary were women, 
and the Board plans to increase this ratio. There are also a number 
of women who hold senior positions within the Group. Further 
details on the diversity of the workforce of the Group generally are 
set out on page 45.
While not having a specific policy regarding the constitution and 
balance of the Board, potential new directors are considered on 
their own merits with regards to their skills, knowledge, experience 
and credentials.
Evaluation
A full performance evaluation of the Board, its Committees and 
the Chairman’s performance was carried out in 2017, led by the 
independent Board Review carried out by The People Stuff. Further 
details of this are included in the Nomination Committee report on 
pages 65 to 66.
Board tenure
In accordance with the articles of association of the Company, every 
new director appointed in the year is required to stand for election 
by shareholders at the AGM next following their appointment, and 
at each AGM any director who shall have been a director at each  
of the two preceding AGMs shall retire.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the articles of association, the 
Board has decided to comply with the Code requirements that 
directors of companies in the FTSE 350 Index submit themselves  
for re-election annually. Therefore, all the directors are seeking  
their re-appointment at this year’s AGM.
The Board has collectively agreed that the directors proposed for 
re-election or election (as the case may be) at this year’s AGM 
have made significant contributions to the business since their 
appointment, election or last re-election (as the case may be)  
and each has a key role to play in the formulation of the Group’s 
future strategy.
Time commitment and training
All directors are aware of the need to allocate sufficient time to  
the Company in order to discharge their responsibilities effectively. 
The Company provides the non-executive directors with appropriate 
support and facilities for the consideration of the Company’s 
strategy and performance, and a dialogue with the Chairman 
is encouraged so that any issues regarding time pressures or 
conflicting commitments are addressed appropriately. The Board 
monitors the extent of directors’ external interests and any conflicts 
on a continuing basis. The letters of appointment for non-executive 
directors set out the time commitment expected to be necessary to 
perform their duties.
During the year, the non-executive directors received a number of 
presentations from the executive directors and senior management 
in relation to the business of the Group, including presentations on 
the services provided by the Group. There will be a continued focus 
during 2018 on ensuring that through a combination of presentations, 
teach-ins and site visits, the non-executive directors are provided 
with sufficient information for them to fully understand the challenges 
and opportunities in the services provided by the Group, particularly 
since the business changed to a purely children’s services business 
following the disposal of the Adult Services business.
The Chairman consults with the directors on their respective training 
and development requirements as part of the annual review 
process. All directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary and a procedure is in place for them to take 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense should 
this be required.
Information and training provided to directors
The Company Secretary is responsible for ensuring good information 
flows within the Board and its Committees and between the senior 
management and the non-executive directors and for arranging 
any additional training that the directors may require. The Board 
uses a secure, web-based system which provides quick, easy and 
secure access to Board papers and materials. Prior to each Board 
meeting, the directors receive (through this system) the agenda and 
supporting papers to ensure that they have all the latest and relevant 
information in advance of the meeting. After each Board meeting, the 
Company Secretary operates a comprehensive follow-up procedure 
to ensure that actions are completed as agreed by the Board. 
Where a director was unable to attend a meeting, they were 
provided with all the papers and information relating to that meeting 
and were able to discuss issues arising directly with the Chair of  
that meeting.
Directors’ and Officers’ indemnity insurance
The Company recognises that all directors are equally and 
collectively accountable under the law for the proper stewardship 
of the Company’s affairs. The Company maintains a Directors’ and 
Officers’ liability insurance policy for the benefit of the Company and 
the directors.
Relationship with shareholders
The Board is responsible for ensuring that the Company maintains a 
satisfactory dialogue with shareholders. The Chairman and the Senior 
Independent Director are available to major shareholders. Formal 
trading updates are given to the market during the year. Following 
each of these announcements, conference calls are held with 
shareholders and analysts and after the full year and interim results 
a presentation is made to the shareholders and analysts. Analyst 
research is circulated to the Board. A programme of meetings and 
conference calls is also organised at appropriate times during the 
year at which the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer 
comment on Company performance and respond to any issues 
raised by investors. Members of the Board, and in particular non-
executive directors, are kept informed of investors’ views in the main 
through distribution of analysts’ and brokers’ briefings.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Corporate governance report continued
(vii)  it will not exercise any of its voting rights to vary the articles of 
association of the Company which would: (a) be contrary to 
the maintenance of the Company’s independence (including 
the Company’s ability to operate and make decisions 
independently of GI Partners’ Group); (b) prevent the election  
of independent directors; or (c) be inconsistent with, undermine 
or breach any provision of the Relationship Agreement or the 
Listing Rules; and
(viii)   it will abstain from voting on any resolution: (a) required 
by paragraph 11.1.7R(3) of the Listing Rules to approve a 
transaction with a related party involving GI Partners or any 
Potential Controlling Shareholders; and (b) proposed by the 
Company in respect of the election or appointment of an 
Independent Director (whether or not the same is required  
by the Listing Rules) where the Company shall have given  
GI Partners written notice requiring it to abstain.
The Chairman periodically reviews the operation of the Relationship 
Agreement and believes that the Company has complied with 
its obligations under the Relationship Agreement and, so far as 
the Company is aware, the independence provisions included in 
the Relationship Agreement have been complied with during the 
period under review by GI Partners and/or any Potential Controlling 
Shareholders. The Board believes that the provisions of the 
Relationship Agreement and of Rule 11 of the Listing Rules provide 
reassurance that GI Partners and GI Partners UK Limited will not 
seek to exercise its shareholding capriciously and reinforces the 
independence of the Company.
Details of any related party transactions are set out in note 32 to  
the financial statements on page 129 of this document.
Constructive use of the AGM
The 2018 AGM will be held on 22 June 2018 at 2.30pm at The 
Cambian Group, The Waterfront, 4th floor Waterfront Building, 
Chancellors Road, Hammersmith Embankment, W6 9RU. Formal 
notice of the meeting and details of and an explanation for the 
reasons for the resolutions to be put to shareholders, are contained 
in the separate notice of meeting that accompanies this report.
The Board views the AGM as an opportunity to communicate with 
investors. All directors are expected to attend the Company’s AGM 
and shareholders are invited to ask questions during the meeting 
and to meet directors after the formal proceedings have ended. 
It is intended that, as was the case at the previous AGM of the 
Company, there shall be a poll vote on each resolution at the  
2018 AGM. The audited, final results of the poll votes will be 
released to the London Stock Exchange and published on the 
Company’s website, as soon as is practicable after the conclusion 
of the meeting.
Shareholders are encouraged to participate in the AGM.
The major shareholders of the Company are listed in the Directors’ 
Report on page 89.
Powers of directors
Please refer to page 88 to 94 of the Directors’ Report for details of:
• restrictions on voting rights;
• rules about appointment and replacement of directors and 
amendments to the articles of association; and
• the powers of directors. 
Relationship Agreement
The Company’s largest shareholder, GI Partners (through Care 
Aspirations II LLC, Advanced Childcare LLC and Cambian Holdings 
LLC) (GI Partners) is one of the Group’s founders. In accordance with 
the requirements of the Listing Rules, the Company, GI Partners and 
GI Partners UK Limited entered into a relationship agreement on 
11 April 2014 (the “Relationship Agreement”). The principal purpose 
of the Relationship Agreement is to ensure that the Company and 
the Group are capable at all times of carrying on their business 
independently of GI Partners and certain persons deemed to be 
connected with it (together the “Potential Controlling Shareholders”) 
and that agreements and transactions with GI Partners and/or any 
Potential Controlling Shareholders will be at arm’s length and on 
normal commercial terms. The Relationship Agreement entitles  
GI Partners to nominate one person to be a director of the Company 
for so long as the Potential Controlling Shareholder controls at 
least 10% of the voting rights attaching to the ordinary shares of the 
Company. The current nominee is Alfred Foglio.
Under the Relationship Agreement, GI Partners and GI Partners UK 
Limited have agreed (inter alia) that:
(i)  it will vote its shares in such a manner so as to procure 
that each member of the Group is capable of carrying 
on its business independently of the Potential Controlling 
Shareholders;
(ii)  it will not exercise any of the voting rights attaching to its 
shares in such a manner so as to procure any amendment 
to the articles of association which would be inconsistent with, 
undermine or breach any of the provisions of the Relationship 
Agreement;
(iii)  it will not take any action which has or would have the effect 
of preventing the Company or any other member of the Group 
from carrying on its business independently of GI Partners or 
any Potential Controlling Shareholders;
(iv)  it will not take any action which has or would have the effect 
of preventing the Company or any other member of the Group 
from complying with its obligations under the Listing Rules;
(v)  it will not exercise any of its voting rights with respect to its 
shares in a manner that would require the Company to 
operate or make decisions solely for the benefit of any member 
of the GI Group;
(vi)  it will not propose or procure the proposal of a resolution of 
the shareholders (or any class thereof) which is intended or 
reasonably appears to be intended to circumvent the proper 
application of the Listing Rules;

Reporting to the Board

discussed at the meetings and the minutes of the meetings are available to all 
members of the Board.
The Committee’s full terms of reference were reviewed by the Board during  
the year. 
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to give you an overview of the operation and scope  
of the Committee and report on our work over the past year.
The 2016 edition of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) 
requires the board of directors to be responsible for determining 
the nature and extent of the principal risks it is willing to take in 
achieving its strategic objectives. In this regard the Board should 
maintain sound risk management and internal control systems.
As set out on page 32, the Board has overall responsibility for 
determining the nature of the risk it is willing to take and ensuring 
that risks are managed effectively across the Group. The way  
in which the Company manages risk is set out on pages 32 to  
35, with the principal risks facing the Group set out on pages 
36 to 39. We have reviewed the continuing effectiveness of the 
Company’s risk management processes as part of our review  
of the effectiveness of internal controls.
The Board recognises the paramount importance of the quality of 
care in all our facilities. From 1 January 2017, responsibility for the 
monitoring of the systems and processes in place to ensure the 
delivery of high standards of care quality was transferred to the 
Quality and Safeguarding Committee, whose report is set out on 
pages 63 to 64.
The Audit Committee has a vital role in providing assurance that 
the financial statements provide a true and fair view of the Group’s 
financial affairs. As part of this assurance, we conduct a review of 
any significant financial judgements made during the year and any 
key financial reporting issues. The Committee concluded that we 
are satisfied with the judgements being made on all of these issues. 
More details can be found on pages 60 to 62 of this report.
Having been asked to do so by the Board, we also conducted a 
comprehensive review of the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts 
and confirmed that they are fair, balanced and capable of being 
understood by shareholders and that they include all the necessary 
information to allow our shareholders to assess Cambian’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy. We have advised the 
Board accordingly.
Following a review of the external auditor’s independence and 
effectiveness, the Committee has made a recommendation to 
the Board that the external auditors are re-appointed for the year 
ending 31 December 2018. Further information on this review and 
our policy on non-audit fees can be found on page 62 of this report.
During the year I have met, individually and in private, with 
management in order to understand more fully the context and 
challenges of their business operations and thereby ensure the 
Committee’s time was used most effectively. I also met informally 
with a number of members of management below Board level 
to gain a deeper insight into areas relevant to the role of the 
Committee. The activities of the Committee members during the 
year have enabled it to gain a good understanding of the culture of 
the organisation, the risks and challenges faced and the adequacy 
and timeliness of the remedial actions being taken to address them.

Audit Committee report
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 59
Strategic report Governance Financial statements In addition, the Committee also considered the judgements made 
in relation to the valuation methodology adopted by management 
to support the carrying value of other intangible assets and the 
investments in subsidiaries, in particular the appropriateness of the 
discount rate applied. The Committee considered the assumptions, 
estimates and judgements made by management to support 
their models that underpin the valuation of intangible assets in 
the balance sheet. The key assumptions applied in the calculation 
relate to the future performance expectations of the business unit. 
Business plans and cash flow forecasts prepared by management 
supporting the future performance expectations used in the 
valuation were reviewed. The Committee received a report on the 
outcome of the impairment review performed by management. 
The impairment review was also an area of focus for the external 
auditor, who reported its findings to the Committee. The Committee 
satisfied itself that no material impairments were required to the 
carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets.
Carrying value of property, plant and equipment  
(see note 15 to the financial statements)
The Committee also considered whether the carrying value of fixed 
assets at loss-making sites could be supported on the basis of a 
comparison of net asset value, value in use or fair value less sale 
cost or whether asset impairments might be required under IAS 36: 
Impairment of assets. The Committee considered management’s 
assumptions and basis of valuation for those assets covered by the 
review. The Committee satisfied itself that the review was robust 
and that an impairment to the carrying value of property, plant and 
equipment should be made.
Exceptional items (see note 6 to the financial statements)
The Committee has considered the disclosure of exceptional items 
during the financial year, arising predominantly from restructuring 
and re-organisation initiatives and “sleep in” provisions. The 
Committee noted that whether a cost is exceptional or not is an 
area of significant judgement and is an area of particular focus. 
The Audit Committee reviewed the exceptional items to ensure 
they were appropriately classified and consistent with the Group’s 
accounting policy. The Committee was satisfied that exceptional 
items were appropriately classified.
Disposal of the Adult Services business  
(see note 11 to the financial statements)
The sale and purchase agreement (SPA) for the disposal of the 
Adult Services business, which completed on 28 December 2016, 
required agreement of a Closing Statement, as is customary in such 
transactions. This was concluded on the 19 September 2017, after 
agreement was reached between the Group and the buyer, and a 
corresponding adjustment was made to the final consideration for 
the disposal. The Committee has considered the appropriateness 
of management’s calculations in determining the final consideration 
and the resulting loss recognised and is satisfied that the loss on 
disposal is correctly calculated. 
Recovery of trade receivables  
(see note 16 to the financial statements)
Given the nature of the Group’s customers, who are typically 
health and social care authorities, debts are often overdue beyond 
the contractual payment date and the Group has a significant 
level of aged debt. The Committee therefore considered the 
appropriateness of the Group’s policy for provision for debts and 
Role of the Committee
The Committee’s principal functions are to monitor the integrity of 
the Group’s financial reports; to assist the Board to monitor the 
Company’s risk management and internal control systems; and 
to manage the Board’s relationship with the Group’s outsourced 
internal audit team and its external auditors. The functions of the 
Committee are summarised on page 59.
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference include all relevant 
matters required by Rule 7.1.3 of the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules and the Code and are available on the Company’s website  
or on request from the Company Secretary.
Committee activities
The Committee met four times during the year. All members of the 
Committee are non-executive directors and all are considered by 
the Board to be independent. Its work included:
• agreeing a strategic risk register for the Company and a framework 
within which to report on and manage risks within the business;
• agreeing on the retention of PwC as internal auditors to the 
Company and their scope of work in the year under review  
and for the first half of 2018; 
• subjecting the financial control improvement programme to periodic 
review to assess progress updates, priorities and resourcing; 
• reviewing the final and interim financial statements and matters 
raised by management and the external auditors. This review 
included consideration of the key judgements applied in the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements, which are 
described in the relevant accounting policies and detailed in the 
notes to the financial statements on pages 105 to 130;
• updating the Committee’s terms of reference;
• reviewing the effectiveness of Deloitte’s external audit for the year 
ended 31 December 2016;
• approving an updated Group policy on the provision of non-audit 
services, in alignment with new EU rules;
• reviewing the arrangements by which staff may , in confidence, raise 
concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting 
or other financial matters. Matters raised by staff relating to care 
quality are reviewed by the Quality and Safeguarding Committee; and
• conducting a review of the Committee’s effectiveness.
The Board considers that Mike Butterworth, who became Chair on  
1 January 2017, has sufficient recent and relevant financial experience 
to discharge his duties as Chair of the Committee. Mike Butterworth 
is a Chartered Accountant and former Chief Financial Officer of a FTSE 
250 business. Mike is also Chairman of the audit committee at St Ives 
plc, Johnston Press plc and Stock Spirits Group plc. The Board also 
considers that the Audit Committee has, as a whole, competence 
relevant to the sector through the membership of Dr. Graham Rich 
and Donald Muir, both of whom have health service experience.
Significant financial matters
The Committee reviews all significant issues concerning the 
financial statements. The principal matters we considered 
concerning the 2017 financial statements were:
Value of goodwill & intangible assets  
(see notes 13 and 14 to the financial statements)
The Committee considered the judgements associated with the 
carrying value of goodwill in the single only cash-generating unit. 
Audit Committee report continued
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 60 easy to read; for example, is the narrative broken up by quotes, 
tables, case studies and other graphics? Does the Annual Report 
have a consistent tone across all sections and provide clear 
signposting to where additional information can be found?
After careful review, the Committee was satisfied that, taken as a 
whole, the Annual Report was fair, balanced and capable of being 
understood by shareholders, and advised the Board accordingly.
Internal audit
The internal audit function plays an important role in assessing 
the effectiveness of internal controls by a programme of reviews 
based on a continuous assessment of the strategic risk register. 
It is important that the internal audit function is appropriately 
resourced with the skills and experience relevant to the operations 
of the Group, and is supported by specialist resources where 
required. Given the importance of the internal audit function and 
the resources required, the Board determined to retain PwC as 
internal auditor responsible for reviewing, reporting and monitoring 
improvements in internal control performance across its operations. 
During the course of 2017, the internal audit work of PwC has been 
limited as the Group underwent a significant period of transition. 
This commenced with the disposal of the Adult Services business 
in December 2016. As part of the sale, the Group entered into a 
transitional services agreement to provide services relating to 
IT , finance, procurement and estates to the purchasers. These 
services ended on 28 June 2017, allowing the Group to focus 
more extensively on its core operations. In addition, the sale and 
purchase agreement required agreement of a Closing Statement, 
as is customary in such transactions. This was finally concluded 
on 19 September 2017 after agreement was reached between the 
Group and the buyer. These activities placed a considerable strain 
on management resources, and following regular meetings with 
PwC throughout 2017 which provided the Committee with advice 
on the priorities of financial control and other risk management 
improvement projects, certain identified and approved internal 
audit reviews were deferred to 2018.
At the end of 2017, the Committee agreed the scope of PwC’s 
internal audit work to be performed in the first half of 2018. This 
work, which has been aligned with the Group’s strategic risk 
register, is to include high spot reviews of areas of high financial 
risk, a review of cyber security, a review of the status of the Group’s 
readiness in respect of the forthcoming EU General Data Protection 
Regulation, and a review of the adequacy of the Group’s insurance 
and claims management processes. Once this work is completed 
in the first half of 2018, the scope of PwC’s internal work for the 
second half of 2018 will be agreed with the Committee. 
The system of internal controls and audit is designed to ensure 
legal and regulatory compliance and manage, rather than 
eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. It can 
therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
Internal control & risk management
The Company has in place internal controls in relation to the 
Company’s financial reporting process and the Group’s process 
for preparation of consolidated accounts. These systems include 
policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions 
the level of risk that exists around the recoverability of overdue 
debts. The audit plan (agreed with the external auditors) placed 
emphasis on a detailed review of aged receivables, and included an 
assessment of recoverability from a sample of receivables. Following 
this review, the Committee was satisfied that adequate provisions 
were being made for any potentially irrecoverable debtor balances.
Completeness of liabilities  
(see note 19 to the financial statements)
A number of providers in the industry are undergoing a National 
Living Wage (NLW) assessment by HMRC. Cambian could be 
exposed to liabilities depending on the conclusions of these 
investigations. A provision for “sleep-ins” has been calculated by 
management and presented to the Committee. The Committee has 
considered the appropriateness of the assumptions and judgement 
made by management and is satisfied that the amount provided 
for is reasonable.
Change in cost allocation  
(see note 34 to the financial statements)
At the time of the 2017 interim financial statements, the Group 
reviewed its previous allocation of divisional and central costs 
between cost of sales and administrative expenses, and realigned 
the classification to be more representative of the business 
model and the environment in which the Group operates. These 
changes result in the financial statements providing reliable and 
more relevant information about the effects of transactions on 
the entity’s financial position and performance. Having reviewed 
management’s reports on the calculation of the adjustments, the 
Committee is satisfied that they are appropriate.
Restatement of equity (see note 33 to the financial statements)
At the time of the 2017 interim financial statements, the Group 
reviewed the classification of a certain balance within equity which 
related to a Group restructuring that was enacted in 2014. This 
review resulted in a reclassification of the balance within equity from 
share premium to merger reserve. Having reviewed management’s 
reports on the accounting for the 2014 Group restructuring, and as 
confirmed by external legal and accounting advice, the Committee  
is satisfied that the restatement is appropriate.
Review of the 2017 Annual Report
At the request of the Board, the Committee was asked to consider 
whether the 2017 Annual Report was fair, balanced and capable  
of being understood by shareholders. In order to arrive at a position 
where the Committee was satisfied with the overall fairness, 
balance and clarity of the Annual Report, a comprehensive review 
process was followed.
During the course of the Committee’s review, the following 
questions were considered for debate:
• Fairness and balance: Is the Annual Report open and honest? 
Does it report on weaknesses, difficulties and challenges as well 
as successes? Is there consistency between different sections 
of the Annual Report, including between the narrative and the 
financial statements? Does the Annual Report explain our key 
performance indicators (KPIs) and their linkage to strategy?
• Understandable: Does the Annual Report contain simple 
explanations of business models, strategies and accounting 
policies, using precise and clear language? Is the Annual Report

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Audit Committee report continued
Non-audit work undertaken
The Company has a formal policy on the use of external auditors for 
non-audit work. This policy is reviewed annually by the Committee 
and was updated in 2017 to reflect recent changes in EU rules. The 
provision of non-audit services by the external auditors is subject 
to pre-approval. Other accounting firms were used for larger, non-
audit services, including taxation and consultancy advice. Details 
of services provided by the auditor and its associates are included 
in note 7 on page 113. The focus of the policy is to ensure that the 
independence of the external auditor is not compromised and, 
where possible and appropriate, other accounting firms are used. 
During 2017, the external auditor conducted engagements for the 
provision of non-audit services, principally relating to a review of 
the half year financial statements, totalling £136,000 (including VAT), 
approximately 30% of the total audit and non-audit fee. 
Auditor’s effectiveness
Deloitte was re-appointed as the auditor at the Annual General 
Meeting in June 2017. The firm was appointed auditor when the 
Company was incorporated as it had acted as auditor to all of 
the companies that were brought together to form the Group 
immediately prior to the initial public offer in April 2014 and so had 
extensive knowledge of the business. Continuity and consistency 
of audit quality are important and the Committee has no current 
intention to initiate an audit re-tendering process. Going forward, 
the Committee will consider a formal tender process in accordance 
with the provisions of the Code which would be in 2023. The 
Committee will comply with the Competition & Markets Authority 
order relating to the statutory audit market for FTSE 350 companies, 
as applicable.
The Committee has adopted a formal framework for the review and 
assessment of the effectiveness of the external audit process and 
audit quality, which includes the following aspects:
• assessment of the engagement partner, other partners and 
members of the audit team;
• audit approach and scope, including clarification of audit  
risk areas;
• execution of the audit;
• interaction with management;
• communication with and support to the Committee;
• insights, management letter points and reporting; and
• independence, objectivity and scepticism.
The Committee assesses the effectiveness of the management 
of the external audit process by considering timely identification 
and resolution of areas of accounting judgement, the quality and 
timeliness of papers reporting to the Committee on these matters 
and the quality of any other documents provided to the Committee 
during the external audit process.

and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS); require representatives of the businesses 
to certify that their reported information gives a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the business and its results for the period; and 
review and reconcile reported data. The Committee is responsible  
for monitoring these internal control and risk management systems.
The Company’s internal controls are based on the assessment 
of risk and a framework of control procedures to manage risks 
and to monitor compliance with procedures. The procedures for 
accountability and control are split between operational and financial 
matters. Financial controls are reviewed and their effectiveness 
assessed by the Committee and tested by work undertaken by the 
internal auditors. In particular, at the end of 2016, given the cost 
control issues that impacted the Company’s performance in that 
year, PwC was commissioned to undertake a detailed review of key 
balance sheet controls through the preparation of a Governance, 
Financial Reporting and Operating Procedures Memorandum. PwC 
was similarly commissioned to update this report at the end of 2017.
With respect to operational matters, the Group’s activities expose 
it to significant operational risks, principally medical, and health 
& safety risks. As described on pages 32 to 35, the Group has 
in place risk management systems and protocols in relation to 
the operational risks facing the Group. Cambian’s governance 
protocols are aimed at ensuring consistently high quality care to 
mitigate these risks. Responsibility for monitoring these operational 
risks was passed by the Board from the Audit Committee to the 
Quality and Safeguarding Committee with effect from 1 January 
2017. The report of this Committee is set out on pages 63 to 64.
External audit
The Committee manages the relationship with the external 
auditor (currently, Deloitte LLP (Deloitte)) on behalf of the Board. 
This includes assessing the independence of the external auditor, 
conducting annual evaluations of the external auditor and providing 
final recommendations to the Board on their reappointment, 
remuneration and the level of non-audit fees paid to the auditors.
Auditor’s independence
The Board undertakes a formal assessment of the auditor’s 
independence each year, which includes:
• a review of non-audit related services provided to the Company 
and related fees;
• discussion with the auditor of a written report detailing all 
relationships with the Company and any other parties which 
could affect independence or the perception of independence;
• a review of the auditor’s own procedures for ensuring 
independence of the audit firm and partners and staff involved  
in the audit, including the rotation of the audit partner;
• obtaining written confirmation from the auditors that they are 
independent; and
• a review of fees paid to the auditors in respect of audit and  
non-audit services.

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to give you an overview of the operation and scope  
of the Committee and report on our work over the past year.
The Board recognises the paramount importance of the quality of 
care in all our facilities. From 1 January 2017, responsibility for the 
monitoring of the systems and processes in place to ensure the 
delivery of high standards of care quality was transferred from the 
Audit and Risk Committee to the newly established Quality and 
Safeguarding Committee. 
The Committee has a vital role in providing assurance that the 
quality and safeguarding systems and processes are effective.  
As part of this assurance, we reviewed Ofsted and CQC  
judgements of Cambian services made during the year and 
identified the key themes for improvement. The Committee 
recognises that Cambian is on a quality improvement journey  
and that systems and processes will need to evolve as the 
Company continues to improve the quality of its services.
Having been asked to do so by the Board, we conducted a 
comprehensive review of the handling and lessons learnt from a 
TV programme which used footage obtained by an undercover 
reporter. It was disappointing, but the Company has learnt from 
it. As part of the review, senior executive colleagues and I met with 
Ofsted to discuss the Group’s services and our approach to quality 
improvement which was indeed constructive and positive. 
During the year I have met, individually and in private, with 
management in order to understand more fully the context and 
challenges of provision of care and education and thereby to 
ensure the Committee’s time was used most effectively. I also met 
informally with a number of members of management below 
Board level to gain a deeper insight into areas relevant to the role 
of the Committee. All Committee members completed their child 
protection training and conducted individual site visits and held 
discussions with management during the year. This has enabled 
the Committee to gain a good understanding of the culture of the 
organisation, the quality and safeguarding challenges faced and 
the adequacy and timeliness of the remedial actions being taken  
to address them.
Purpose of the Committee
The Committee’s purpose is to assure itself that robust and effective 
arrangements (systems, processes, procedures and reporting) are 
in place with respect to Cambian’s statutory responsibilities and 
duties for safeguarding and promoting the welfare of all children 
and young people.
In focusing on the care of the children and young people served by 
the Company, the Committee also evaluates quality, clinical risks 
and regulatory issues that could adversely affect the achievement 
of the Company’s objectives, give rise to reputational issues and 
impact negatively on the financial performance of the Company, 
and oversees the operational governance and regulatory risk 
management functions within the Company.
The Quality and Safeguarding Committee’s terms of reference 
are available on the Company’s website or on request from the 
Company Secretary.

Committee activities
The Committee met four times during the year. All members of the 
Committee are non-executive directors except Susan Marshall who 
was appointed to serve as an independent expert on governance 
and quality improvement, and brings experience from health and 
other children’s services. Its work included:
• refining the Committee’s draft terms of reference, and putting 
these to the Board for approval;
• reviewing the Children’s Services Quality and Safety  
Governance structure;
• reviewing the escalation process for reporting incidents from site 
level to the Board;
• reviewing regulatory performance of all services, and the themes 
arising from reports;
• reviewing key quality performance indicators and serious 
untoward incidents;
• approving the appointment of a Director of Quality, who 
commenced in November 2017;
• reviewing progress and implementation of the 2017 quality 
improvement plan;
• reviewing the whistleblowing arrangements by which staff 
may, in confidence, raise concerns about quality of care or 
safeguarding as well as regularly reviewing a summary of  
such reports;
• reviewing health and safety (RIDDOR) reports;
• discussing the Cambian Therapeutic Framework which is being 
developed for use across all the services;
• agreeing that the 2018 quality improvement programme should 
focus on further improving risk assessments, supervision of staff, 
safeguarding practice, staffing and training;
• reviewing the likelihood and potential impact of the “Quality 
of Service” and “Regulatory Breach” risks according to the 
Company’s risk matrix;
• conducting a review of the Committee’s effectiveness; and
• reviewing the content of an ITV programme aired in December 
and taking on board the lessons to be learned.
The Board considers that Dr. Graham Rich, who became Chair 
on 1 January 2017, has sufficient recent and relevant operational, 
governance experience to discharge his duties as chair of the 
Committee. Dr. Graham Rich qualified as a GP , has a postgraduate 
Diploma in Child Health and has been Chief Executive of a large 
healthcare organisation which included children’s services.

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to give you an overview of the operation and scope  
of the Committee and report on our work in 2017.
The Nomination Committee comprises Christopher Kemball (Chair), 
and all of the independent non-executive directors. Alfred Foglio 
is entitled to attend meetings of the Committee as an observer. 
Details of the Chair’s other significant commitments are set out 
on page 52. The Nomination Committee meets at least once a 
year and on an as needed basis and members’ attendance is set 
out in the table opposite. The Nomination Committee reviews the 
structure, size and composition of the Board and its committees 
and makes recommendations with regard to any changes 
considered necessary in the identification and nomination of new 
directors, the re-appointment of existing directors and appointment 
of members to the Board’s committees. It also assesses the roles 
of the existing directors in office to ensure that there continues to 
be a balanced Board in terms of skills, knowledge, experience 
and diversity. The Nomination Committee reviews the senior 
leadership needs of the Group to enable it to compete effectively 
in the marketplace. The Nomination Committee also advises the 
Board on succession planning for executive director appointments 
although the Board itself is responsible for succession generally. 
The Nomination Committee seeks to ensure that all Board 
appointments are made on merit and measured against objective 
criteria and with due regard for the benefits of diversity on the 
Board. The Board is committed to ensuring a broad mix of gender, 
age, nationality, experience and skills throughout the business. The 
composition of the Board itself is based on a range and balance of 
skills, knowledge, experience and merit and remains appropriate 
for a business of its size. The Nomination Committee ensures that 
diversity is an important consideration and part of the selective 
criteria used to assess candidates to achieve a balanced Board.
In November and December 2017, the Board took part in an 
independent Board Review which was carried out by The People 
Stuff (TPS). The review consisted of one-on-one interviews with 
each Board member and the Company Secretary, each member 
completing a questionnaire, and the independent reviewer 
assessing one of the Company’s Board meetings.
Following the review, TPS presented a report incorporating all 
findings, where there was a further one-on-one follow up with  
the reviewer, and a final one-on-one with the Chair, for each  
Board member. 
From the feedback, the Board has drawn up a list of objectives 
which has been approved to action for 2018, in all areas including 
strategy, performance management, succession planning, internal 
controls and risk management, effectiveness of board meetings 
and committees, roles, responsibilities and relationships, behaviour 
and communication, and shareholder engagement. These are 
listed on page 51.

Nomination Committee report
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 65
Strategic report Governance Financial statements The Board Review incorporated the annual performance evaluation 
for each director in addition to any training and development needs. 
In addition, the non-executive directors met (led by the senior 
independent director) without the Chair present to appraise the 
Chair’s performance throughout the year, taking into account the 
views of the executive directors.
The Nomination Committee met once in 2017 in December. 
Following the outcome of the independent Board review, the 
feedback included the proposal to appoint another non-executive 
director to the Board. This was discussed in greater detail at the 
Nomination Committee meeting. The purpose of the new non-
executive director’s role would be to challenge the operational  
side of the business. This search is currently being carried out by  
an independent recruitment process run by Saxton Bampfylde.  
Saxton Bampfylde has no other connection with the Company. 
Also discussed when the Nomination Committee met was the 
tenure of the Chair. It was noted that the Board was very content 
with the Chair’s performance, and that his tenure should therefore 
be extended for another three year term following on from the 
end of his first term. The applicability of the Committee’s terms of 
reference was also considered to continue to be appropriate for  
the Company. 
Due to the intensive process of preparing and then selling the 
Group’s Adult Services business, and then subsequently completing 
the transitional services agreement which concluded at the end of 
June 2017, the Nomination Committee did not lead the process for 
board appointments in 2017; nor did it prepare a description of the 
roles and capabilities required for the appointments. Instead, the 
appointment of Anoop Kang as Chief Financial Officer in July 2017 
was handled as a special item in the main Board meeting.

Dear Shareholder
As the new Chair of Cambian’s Remuneration Committee, I am 
pleased to present our remuneration report for the financial year 
ended 31 December 2017. 
At the 2016 Annual General Meeting (AGM), the shareholders voted 
by a majority of 90% of the votes cast to approve the directors’ 
remuneration policy as set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
contained in the Cambian 2015 Annual Report and Accounts. Since 
this time there have been significant changes within the structure 
of Cambian’s business and the Committee has reviewed the 
remuneration policy this year to ensure that it remains appropriate. 
Based on this review, we are proposing minor revisions to our 
remuneration policy in respect of the performance conditions of the 
long-term incentive plan (LTIP).
The Committee determined that it would be appropriate to 
incorporate a care quality metric within the LTIP to measure 
this factor over the long-term. Within the current policy this is 
not possible as the LTIP must contain purely financial metrics 
and therefore the Committee is proposing a revised policy for 
shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM. There are no further substantive 
changes to the policy. The proposed policy is intended to apply for 
a period of three years from the date of approval. All arrangements 
operated by the Company during the year were in line with the 
current Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
Business context 
As highlighted in the Strategic Report, during 2016 the Board carried 
out a strategic review of its businesses and concluded that focusing 
on the Children’s Services business represented the best way to 
create value for shareholders. As such, Cambian completed the 
sale of the Adult Services business to Cygnet Health Care Limited 
in December 2016 to enable Cambian to focus all its resources 
on becoming a high quality provider of specialist education and 
behavioural health services for children, whilst at the same time 
repaying all of the Cambian Group’s existing bank debt.
On 23 August 2017, Cambian announced a £50 million return of 
capital to shareholders by way of a special dividend. This followed 
the sale of the Adult Services business in late 2016 and the Board’s 
review of the Company’s cash requirements, it resulted in a special 
dividend of 27.1p per ordinary share (around 13% of share price 
prior to announcement).
An interim dividend of 0.14 pence per share was also paid on 
31 October 2017. 
Financial results
Over the year, Company revenues increased to £196.0 million 
(2016: £182.1 million) and Adjusted EBITDA increased to £18.7 million 
(2016: £16.2 million). The business has performed in line with the 
Board’s expectations. LTIPs were first granted under the current 
plan in respect of 2016, following shareholder approval of the 
remuneration policy, and therefore no awards under these plans 
vested during the year.

4. Consideration of adjustments to awards  
in respect of special dividend
On 23 August 2017, Cambian announced a £50 million return of 
capital to shareholders by way of a special dividend. The LTIP and 
COP1 awards do not allow for dividend equivalents to be paid in 
respect of a special dividend. As such, the Committee applied 
its discretion within the policy to increase the number of options 
under both the 2017 LTIP award and the COP1 arrangement to 
compensate participants for the loss of value resulting from  
the special dividend. Award quanta were increased by 13% to 
reflect the reduction in share price resulting from the special 
dividend. Further details are shown within the Annual Report  
on Remuneration.
Conclusion
The report that follows consists of three sections:
• an ‘At a glance’ summary on pages 69 to 72, which includes  
a summary of the remuneration policy;
• a policy report on pages 73 to 81 setting out the proposed 
amended directors’ remuneration policy, subject to a binding 
shareholder vote at our 2018 AGM; and
• an annual report on remuneration, detailing how our directors 
were paid during 2017 and how the remuneration policy will be 
applied in 2018, on pages 82 to 87.
As a Committee, we work hard to ensure that the executive 
remuneration structure supports the Company’s strategy and aligns 
with the long-term interests of shareholders. We take an active 
interest in your views and hope to receive your support again at the 
AGM, where I will be available to respond to any questions which 
shareholders may have on this report or in relation to any of the 
Committee’s activities.
This is my first statement as Chair of the Committee following  
Chris Brinsmead stepping down as non-executive director after 
the 2017 AGM. I would therefore like to thank my colleagues on 
the Board, as well as Christopher, for their support during my 
transition into this role. If you would like to discuss any aspect of our 
remuneration policy and this report, please contact our Company 
Secretary in the first instance.

Key activities and decisions made during the year
1. Review of remuneration package for Anoop Kang  
on appointment to the Board
Anoop Kang became the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and an 
executive director of Cambian Group in 2017. Anoop Kang’s base 
salary was set at £250,000, with an annual bonus opportunity 
of 100% of salary, LTIP opportunity of 100% of salary, 15% pension 
contribution and benefits in line with policy. As part of the 
agreement to join the business an award of nil cost options under 
the LTIP amounting to 150% of salary was awarded in July 2017. 
No further LTIP award was made to him in 2017. The Committee 
viewed that a larger initial LTIP award as part of joining the business 
was appropriate in order to secure this high calibre individual 
and incentivise and align him with the success of the long-term 
performance of the business. It is intended that going forward,  
the LTIP awards will remain within the normal annual limits. 
2. Review of annual bonus outcomes
In respect of the 2017 financial year the financial target that 
underpins the performance targets for the payment of the bonus, 
which was the achievement of Adjusted EBITDA of not less than 
£19.9 million, was not met. As such, no bonus was payable to the 
executive directors in respect of 2017.
3. Long Term Incentive Awards
On 18 July 2017, the Committee granted awards in respect of 2017 
under the LTIP . As with the 2016 awards, the Committee considered 
it was appropriate to use an absolute shareholder return metric.  
Full vesting will occur if a shareholder return target of 225p is met 
on the third anniversary of the date of grant, with nil vesting below 
this target.
For the 2018 LTIP award, as noted above, the Committee is 
proposing a minor amendment to the policy to include both 
financial and non-financial metrics to reflect the key strategic 
priorities of the business. The proposed metrics for the 2018  
awards are:
• 1/3rd on growth in Adjusted Earnings Per Share.
• 1/3rd on growth in Adjusted EBITDA margin. 
• 1/3rd on care quality (assessed as the proportion of facilities rated 
“Good” or “Outstanding” by Ofsted).
These performance conditions have been chosen as the Committee 
believes that achievement of these metrics will drive shareholder 
value over the coming years.
Note:
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to The Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 as amended in 2013 and the 
provisions of the 2016 Corporate Governance Code and the Listing Rules.

Introduction
In this section, we summarise the purpose of our remuneration 
policy, its linkage to our corporate strategic objectives and we 
highlight the performance and remuneration outcomes for the  
2017 financial year. Details of the proposed policy are set out later  
in this report.
Our principles of remuneration
The Company’s remuneration strategy is to provide remuneration 
packages that:
• attract, motivate and retain high performing employees;
• encourage and support a strong care and service culture;
• reward the achievement of the overall business objectives  
of the Company;
• align employees’ interests with those of shareholders; and
• are consistent with the Company’s risk policies and systems.
Consistent with this remuneration strategy, the Committee has 
agreed a remuneration package for the management team, 
whereby:
• performance-related pay will form a significant part of 
remuneration packages;
• there will be an appropriate balance between short and longer-
term performance targets linked to delivery of the Group’s 
objectives; and
• in the event of a failure in the quality of care provided by the 
Group, or a failure to achieve threshold financial performance,  
this would act as an override to prevent payment of any bonus 
that might otherwise be payable in respect of that year.

Summary of remuneration policy
Our current policy was approved at the 2016 AGM, however the Committee is proposing a minor amendment to the policy in 2017.

Changes since  
2015 policy
Executive directors
Base salary Provides a base level of remuneration to support recruitment  
and retention of executive directors with the necessary experience 
and expertise to deliver the Group’s strategy.
In general, salary rises for executive 
directors will be in line with the rise to 
all other employees. Individuals who 
are recruited or promoted to the Board 
may, on occasion, have their salaries 
set below the targeted policy level  
until they become established in role. 
In such cases subsequent increases  
in salary may be higher than the 
average until the positioning is 
increased to the targeted level.
None.
Benefits The executive directors receive family private health cover, death in 
service life assurance, permanent health insurance and subsistence 
expenses. In addition, the executive directors may take part in a car 
leasing programme.
The cost of the benefits provided. None.
Pension May be provided in the form of a salary supplement. 15% salary p.a. None.
Annual Bonus  
Plan
The Annual Bonus Plan is based on a mix of financial and 
non-financial conditions and is measured over a period of one 
financial year. The financial measures will account for no less than 
50% of the bonus opportunity. Payment under the Annual Bonus 
Plan is conditional upon achievement of the threshold performance 
of the financial target and there being no regulated enforced 
closure of any of the Group’s facilities. Malus and clawback 
provisions apply.
150% of salary for the CEO.
100% of salary for other executive 
directors.
Up to 60% of the maximum bonus  
will be payable for on-target 
performance.
The Bonus Plan for 
2018 is based purely  
on Adjusted EBITDA.
Annual Option 
Plan (AOP)
The AOP operates in conjunction with the Annual Bonus Plan.  
The Committee can determine that part of the bonus earned under 
the Annual Bonus Plan is provided in the form of an award of nil 
cost options under the AOP .
Deferred options are exercisable on the third anniversary of the 
date on which the bonus vests.
The annual bonus will be paid in cash 
and, at the discretion of the Committee, 
deferred in part into share options.
None.
Long-Term 
Incentive Plan  
(LTIP)
Awards are granted annually to executive directors in the form  
of conditional share awards or nil cost options. These will vest at 
the end of a three year period, subject to continued employment 
and the satisfaction of financial and non-financial performance 
conditions. 
The Committee retains the discretion to subject the LTIP awards  
to a holding period of up to two years post vesting and malus  
and clawback provisions apply.
100% of salary. Inclusion of 
non-financial metrics

shareholding 
requirement
Executives have five years to accumulate the required 
shareholding. Required holdings are 200% of base salary for  
the CEO and 150% of base salary for other executive directors.
Not applicable. None.
Non-executive directors
Fees Non-executive directors are paid a base fee and additional fees  
for chairmanship of committees. The Chair does not receive any 
additional fees for membership of committees. Fees are set  
at broadly the median of the chosen comparator group. 
Non-executive directors do not participate in any variable 
remuneration or benefits arrangements.
In general, the level of fee increase  
for the non-executive directors will  
be set taking account of any change 
in responsibility and will take into 
account the general rise in salaries 
across the UK workforce.
None.

Sign-on compensation The Committee’s policy is not to provide sign-on compensation.
However, in exceptional circumstances where the Committee decides to provide 
this type of compensation it will endeavour to provide the compensation in equity, 
subject to a holding period during which cessation of employment will generally 
result in forfeiture and subject to the satisfaction of performance targets. The 
maximum value of this one-off compensation will be proportionate to the overall 
remuneration offered by the Company and in all circumstances is limited to  
150% of salary.
Maximum – Exceptional circumstances  
were invoked and 150% of salary was 
awarded in shares on the same terms  
as other executives. No additional LTIP 
award was made in 2017. 
“Buy-out” of incentives 
forfeited on cessation  
of employment 
The Committee’s policy is not to provide buy-outs as a matter of course.
However, should the Committee determine that the provision of a buy-out is 
justified, the equivalent value of any incentives that will be forfeited on cessation  
of a director’s previous employment will be calculated taking into account  
the following:
• the proportion of the performance period completed;
• the performance conditions attached to the vesting of these incentives  
and the likelihood of them being satisfied; and
• any other terms and conditions having a material effect on their value  
(lapsed value).
No buy-out arrangements made.
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 72 Remuneration policy
Introduction
In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 (as amended) the directors’ remuneration policy (the “Policy”) as set out 
below will become formally effective at the Annual General Meeting on 22 June 2018 and will apply for the period of three years from the 
date of approval. This policy, if approved, will replace the Directors’ Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the Company’s 2016 
annual general meeting.
Policy summary
The Committee determines the Policy for the executive directors, Chairman and other senior executives for current and future years and  
this is reviewed on an annual basis. The Policy is designed to support the strategic objectives of the Company and to allow the business  
to attract, retain and motivate the quality of senior management needed to shape and execute strategy and deliver shareholder value.
The Policy aims to align the interests of the executive directors, senior management and employees to the interests of shareholders 
and aims to support a high performance culture with appropriate reward for superior performance without creating incentives that will 
encourage excessive risk taking or unsustainable Company performance. The Committee is satisfied that the design of the Policy promotes 
the long-term success of the Company.
The Committee considers that a successful Policy needs to be sufficiently flexible to take account of future changes in the Company’s 
business environment and in remuneration practice.
Discretion
The Committee has discretion in several areas of Policy as set out in this report. The Committee may also exercise operational and 
administrative discretions under relevant option plan rules as set out in those rules. In addition, the Committee has the discretion to amend 
the Policy with regard to minor or administrative matters where it would be, in the opinion of the Committee, disproportionate to seek or 
await shareholder approval.
It is the Committee’s intention that commitments made in line with its policies prior to the date of the 2016 AGM will be honoured, even if 
satisfaction of such commitments is made post the AGM and may be inconsistent with the remuneration policies set out below and overleaf.
Differences in policy from the wider employee population
The Company aims to provide a remuneration package for all employees that is market competitive and operates the same core structure 
as for the executive directors. The Company operates variable pay plans for all executive directors and senior managers, with pension 
provisions provided for all executives and employees.
Remuneration policy
As set out in the Chairman’s statement, the current remuneration policy was approved by shareholders in 2016 but the Committee are 
proposing a minor amendment to this policy. The only change since the previous policy is the inclusion of non-financial metrics within the LTIP 
to enable measurement of care quality over the long-term. Shareholders will be required to vote on the policy overleaf at the 2018 AGM.

How it supports the Company’s short  
and long-term strategic objectives Operation Opportunity Performance metrics
Salary Policy Provides a base level of remuneration to support 
recruitment and retention of executive directors 
with the necessary experience and expertise to 
deliver the Group’s strategy.
An executive director’s basic salary is set on appointment and reviewed annually  
or when there is a change in position or responsibility.
When determining an appropriate level of salary, the Committee considers:
• remuneration practices within the Company;
• the performance of the individual executive director;
• the individual executive director’s experience and responsibilities;
• the general performance of the Company;
• salaries within the ranges paid by the companies in the comparator group used 
for remuneration benchmarking; and
• the economic environment.
Individuals who are recruited or promoted to the Board may, on occasion, have their 
salaries set below the targeted policy level until they become established in their 
role. In such cases subsequent increases in salary may be higher than the average 
until the target positioning is achieved.
When determining pay, the comparator group used comprises 
listed companies of a comparable market capitalisation to the 
Company and excludes any financial services and oil and gas 
companies. The Committee intends to review the list of companies 
each year and may add or remove companies from the group as it 
considers appropriate. Any changes to the comparator group will 
be disclosed in the part of the report setting out the operation of 
the Policy for the future year.
In general, salary rises to executive directors will be in line with the 
rise to all other employees.
The Company will set out in the section headed ”Implementation  
of remuneration policy” in the following financial year the salaries 
for that year for each of the executive directors (see page 86).
n/a
Benefits 
Policy
Provides a benefits package in line with standard 
market practice relative to its comparator group 
to enable the Company to recruit and retain 
executive directors with the experience and 
expertise to deliver the Company’s strategy.
The executive directors receive family private health cover, death in service life 
assurance, permanent health insurance and subsistence expenses. In addition,  
the CEO and COO may take part in a car leasing programme and the CFO receives  
a car allowance.
The Committee recognises the need to maintain suitable flexibility in the 
determination of benefits that ensure it is able to support the objective of attracting 
and retaining personnel. Accordingly, the Committee would expect to be able to 
adopt benefits such as relocation expenses, tax equalisation and support in meeting 
specific costs incurred by directors to ensure the Company and the individuals 
comply with their obligations in the reporting of remuneration.
The maximum will be set at the cost of providing the benefits described.

Pensions  
Policy
Provides a standard UK market level of retirement 
funding to enable the Company to recruit and 
retain executive directors with the experience and 
expertise to deliver the Company’s strategy.
Employee retirement funding is determined as a percentage of gross basic salary, 
up to a maximum limit of 15%. This may be provided in the form of a salary 
supplement, which would not itself be pensionable or form part of salary for the 
purposes of determining the extent of participation in the Company’s incentive 
arrangements.

Annual Bonus 
Plan Policy
The Annual Bonus Plan provides a significant 
incentive to the executive directors linked to 
achievement in delivering goals that are closely 
aligned with the Company’s strategy and the 
creation of value for shareholders.
In particular, the Plan supports the Company’s 
objectives allowing the setting of annual targets 
based on the businesses’ strategic objectives  
at that time, meaning that a wider range of 
performance metrics can be used that are 
relevant and achievable.
The Committee will determine the maximum annual participation in the Annual 
Bonus Plan for each year, which will not exceed 150% of salary for the CEO and 100% 
of salary for other executive directors.
The Company will set out in the section headed “Implementation of Remuneration 
Policy” in the following financial year, the nature of the targets and their weighting  
for each year (see page 86).
Details of the performance conditions, targets and their level of satisfaction for the 
year being reported on will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
The maximum bonus opportunity is 150% of salary for the  
CEO and 100% of salary for other executive directors.
Up to 60% of the maximum bonus will be payable for  
on-target performance.
The Annual Bonus Plan is based on a mix of financial and non-financial conditions and 
is measured over a period of one financial year. The financial measures will account 
for no less than 50% of the bonus opportunity. Payment under the Annual Bonus Plan 
is conditional upon achievement of the threshold performance of the financial target 
and there being no regulatory enforced closure of any of the Group’s facilities.
The Committee retains discretion in exceptional circumstances to change 
performance measures and targets and the weightings attached to performance 
measures part-way through a performance year if there is a significant and material 
event which causes the Committee to believe the original measures, weightings and 
targets are no longer appropriate. Discretion may also be exercised in cases where 
the Committee believes that the bonus outcome is not a fair and accurate reflection 
of business performance.
The Committee is of the opinion that given the commercial sensitivity arising in relation 
to the detailed financial targets used for the annual bonus, disclosing precise targets 
for the bonus plan in advance would not be in shareholder interests. Actual targets, 
performance achieved and awards made will be published at the end of the 
performance periods so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any pay-outs 
under the annual bonus.
The annual bonus contains both malus and clawback provisions.

When determining an appropriate level of salary, the Committee considers:
• remuneration practices within the Company;
• the performance of the individual executive director;
• the individual executive director’s experience and responsibilities;
• the general performance of the Company;
• salaries within the ranges paid by the companies in the comparator group used 
for remuneration benchmarking; and
• the economic environment.
Individuals who are recruited or promoted to the Board may, on occasion, have their 
salaries set below the targeted policy level until they become established in their 
role. In such cases subsequent increases in salary may be higher than the average 
until the target positioning is achieved.
When determining pay, the comparator group used comprises 
listed companies of a comparable market capitalisation to the 
Company and excludes any financial services and oil and gas 
companies. The Committee intends to review the list of companies 
each year and may add or remove companies from the group as it 
considers appropriate. Any changes to the comparator group will 
be disclosed in the part of the report setting out the operation of 
the Policy for the future year.
In general, salary rises to executive directors will be in line with the 
rise to all other employees.
The Company will set out in the section headed ”Implementation  
of remuneration policy” in the following financial year the salaries 
for that year for each of the executive directors (see page 86).
n/a
Benefits 
Policy
Provides a benefits package in line with standard 
market practice relative to its comparator group 
to enable the Company to recruit and retain 
executive directors with the experience and 
expertise to deliver the Company’s strategy.
The executive directors receive family private health cover, death in service life 
assurance, permanent health insurance and subsistence expenses. In addition,  
the CEO and COO may take part in a car leasing programme and the CFO receives  
a car allowance.
The Committee recognises the need to maintain suitable flexibility in the 
determination of benefits that ensure it is able to support the objective of attracting 
and retaining personnel. Accordingly, the Committee would expect to be able to 
adopt benefits such as relocation expenses, tax equalisation and support in meeting 
specific costs incurred by directors to ensure the Company and the individuals 
comply with their obligations in the reporting of remuneration.
The maximum will be set at the cost of providing the benefits described.
The cost of the benefits provided. n/a
Pensions  
Policy
Provides a standard UK market level of retirement 
funding to enable the Company to recruit and 
retain executive directors with the experience and 
expertise to deliver the Company’s strategy.
Employee retirement funding is determined as a percentage of gross basic salary, 
up to a maximum limit of 15%. This may be provided in the form of a salary 
supplement, which would not itself be pensionable or form part of salary for the 
purposes of determining the extent of participation in the Company’s incentive 
arrangements.

Annual Bonus 
Plan Policy
The Annual Bonus Plan provides a significant 
incentive to the executive directors linked to 
achievement in delivering goals that are closely 
aligned with the Company’s strategy and the 
creation of value for shareholders.
In particular, the Plan supports the Company’s 
objectives allowing the setting of annual targets 
based on the businesses’ strategic objectives  
at that time, meaning that a wider range of 
performance metrics can be used that are 
relevant and achievable.
The Committee will determine the maximum annual participation in the Annual 
Bonus Plan for each year, which will not exceed 150% of salary for the CEO and 100% 
of salary for other executive directors.
The Company will set out in the section headed “Implementation of Remuneration 
Policy” in the following financial year, the nature of the targets and their weighting  
for each year (see page 86).
Details of the performance conditions, targets and their level of satisfaction for the 
year being reported on will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
The maximum bonus opportunity is 150% of salary for the  
CEO and 100% of salary for other executive directors.
Up to 60% of the maximum bonus will be payable for  
on-target performance.
The Annual Bonus Plan is based on a mix of financial and non-financial conditions and 
is measured over a period of one financial year. The financial measures will account 
for no less than 50% of the bonus opportunity. Payment under the Annual Bonus Plan 
is conditional upon achievement of the threshold performance of the financial target 
and there being no regulatory enforced closure of any of the Group’s facilities.
The Committee retains discretion in exceptional circumstances to change 
performance measures and targets and the weightings attached to performance 
measures part-way through a performance year if there is a significant and material 
event which causes the Committee to believe the original measures, weightings and 
targets are no longer appropriate. Discretion may also be exercised in cases where 
the Committee believes that the bonus outcome is not a fair and accurate reflection 
of business performance.
The Committee is of the opinion that given the commercial sensitivity arising in relation 
to the detailed financial targets used for the annual bonus, disclosing precise targets 
for the bonus plan in advance would not be in shareholder interests. Actual targets, 
performance achieved and awards made will be published at the end of the 
performance periods so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any pay-outs 
under the annual bonus.
The annual bonus contains both malus and clawback provisions.

The maximum award for the CEO and other executive directors  
is equal to 100% of base salary.
Vesting of awards under the LTIP will be dependent on the achievement of financial 
and non-financial metrics over a three year measurement period. The financial

The Committee may change the balance of measures, or use different measures for 
subsequent awards, as appropriate. The Committee retains discretion in exceptional 
circumstances to change performance measure targets and the weightings attached 
to performance part way through a performance period if there is a significant and

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Directors’ remuneration report continued
Recruitment policy
The Company’s approach is that the remuneration of any newly recruited executive director will be assessed in line with the same 
principles applying to the executive directors, as set out in the remuneration policy table prior. The Committee’s approach to recruitment 
remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary to attract candidates of the appropriate calibre and experience needed for the role from 
the market in which the Company competes.
The Committee is mindful that it wishes to avoid paying more than it considers necessary to secure the preferred candidate and will have 
regard to guidelines and shareholder sentiment regarding one-off or enhanced short-term or long-term incentive payments made on 
recruitment and the appropriateness of any performance measures associated with an award.
The Company’s detailed policy when setting remuneration for the appointment of new directors is summarised in the table below:
Remuneration element Recruitment policy
Salary Salary will be set in line with the policy for existing executive directors.
Benefits The standard benefit package for existing executive directors will apply.
Pension The maximum employer contribution will be set in line with the Company’s policy for existing directors.
Annual Bonus and 
Annual Share Option 
Plan
Maximum annual participation will be set in line with the Company’s policy for existing directors  
and will not exceed 150% of salary.
LTIP Any award of long-term incentives will be in line with the Company’s policy for existing directors  
and will not exceed 100% of salary.
Maximum variable pay 
(Incentive opportunity)
In the year of recruitment the maximum variable pay will be 250% of salary (400% if maximum sign-on compensation  
is provided).
Sign-on  
compensation
The Committee’s policy is not to provide sign-on compensation.
However, in exceptional circumstances where the Committee decides to provide this type of compensation it will endeavour  
to provide the compensation in equity, subject to a holding period during which cessation of employment will generally result  
in forfeiture and subject to the satisfaction of performance targets. The maximum value of this one-off compensation will be 
proportionate to the overall remuneration offered by the Company and in all circumstances is limited to 150% of salary.
“Buy-Out” of  
incentives forfeited  
on cessation of 
employment
The Committee’s policy is not to provide buy-outs as a matter of course.
However, should the Committee determine that the individual circumstances of recruitment justified the provision of a “buy-out”, 
the equivalent value of any incentives that will be forfeited on cessation of a director’s previous employment will be calculated 
taking into account the following:
• the proportion of the performance period completed on the date of the director’s cessation of employment;
• the performance conditions attached to the vesting of these incentives and the likelihood of them being satisfied; and
• any other terms and condition having a material effect on their value (lapsed value).
The Committee may then grant up to the same value as the lapsed value, where possible, under the Company’s incentive plans. 
To the extent that it was not possible or practical to provide the buy-out within the terms of the Company’s existing incentive 
plans, a bespoke arrangement would be used.
Where an existing employee is promoted to the Board, the policy set out above would apply from the date of promotion but there would be 
no retrospective application of the policy in relation to subsisting incentive awards or remuneration arrangements.
Accordingly, prevailing elements of the remuneration package for an existing employee would be honoured and form part of the ongoing 
remuneration of the person concerned. These would be disclosed to shareholders in the remuneration report for the relevant financial year.
The Company’s policy when setting fees for the appointment of new non-executive directors is to apply the policy which applies to current 
non-executive directors.
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 78 Service agreements and letters of appointment
Each of the executive directors’ service agreements is for a rolling term and may be terminated by the Company or the executive director  
by giving six months’ notice.
The Committee’s policy for setting notice periods is that a six month period will apply for executive directors. The Committee may, in 
exceptional circumstances arising on recruitment, allow a longer period, which would in any event reduce to six months following the  
first year of employment.

The non-executive directors of the Company (including the Chairman) do not have service contracts. The non-executive directors are 
appointed by letters of appointment. Each independent non-executive director’s term of office runs for an initial period of three years unless 
terminated earlier upon written notice or upon their resignations.
The terms of the non-executive directors’ positions are subject to their re-election by the Company’s shareholders at the AGM scheduled to 
be held on 22 June 2018 and to re-election at any subsequent AGM at which the non-executive directors stand for re-election.
The Company follows the UK Corporate Governance Code’s recommendation that all directors of FTSE 350 companies be subject to annual 
re-appointment by shareholders.

Payment for loss of office
The Committee will honour executive directors’ contractual entitlements. Service contracts do not contain liquidated damages clauses. If 
a contract is to be terminated, the Committee will determine such mitigation as it considers fair and reasonable in each case. There are 
no contractual arrangements that would guarantee a pension with limited or no abatement on severance or early retirement. There is no 
agreement between the Company and its executive directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or employment 
that occurs because of a takeover bid. The Committee reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are made in 
good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation); or by way of settlement or 
compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of an executive director’s office or employment.
Non-executive directors would be paid in accordance with their entitlement as set out in their letter of appointment on loss of office, other 
than in the circumstances where they were not re-elected at the AGM.

The Committee considers that performance conditions for all incentives are suitably demanding, having regard to the business strategy, 
shareholder expectations, the markets in which the Group operates and external advice. To the extent that any performance condition is 
not met, the relevant part of the award will lapse. There is no retesting of performance.
Bonus awards
In respect of the 2017 financial year, the financial target that underpins the performance targets for the payment of bonus, which was the 
achievement of Adjusted EBITDA of not less than £19.9 million, was not met. Therefore no bonus was payable to the executive directors 
in respect of 2017, even though the quality condition was met in part. If the financial target has not been met, then other elements of the 
bonus are not payable. Full details of achievement against the performance conditions are set out in the table below:

The individual performance for each executive was considered, but given that the threshold performance required for EBITDA was not met, 
it was determined that no bonus payment would be made to any director.
Long-term incentives awarded in 2016 and 2017 (audited)
As a consequence of the transaction involving the sale of the Adult Services business, the Company was unable to make LTIP awards 
during 2016 prior to the sale due to share dealing restrictions. Therefore, as set out in the Circular dated 9 December 2016, a 2016 LTIP 
award was made to the CEO and COO of 100% of the revised base salaries, and this was granted in early 2017 following completion of 
the transaction. The Committee took the view that these performance conditions in the awards will be in line with the strategic plan and 
therefore subject to an absolute shareholder return metric, with a share price target of 225p, over the three year period to 8 December 
2019. The share price used to calculate the amount of the awards was based on the five day average share price following the publication 
of the Circular. Full vesting will occur if the share price target of 225p is met, with nil vesting below this target. On 18 July 2017, the 
Committee also granted awards under the 2017 LTIP with a face value of 100% of salary for the CEO and COO and 150% of the salary for 
the CFO as a one off sign on award as noted earlier in the report. Similarly to the awards in respect of 2016, the Committee considered the 
performance conditions set out in the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts and took the view that in light of the strategic plan, it was more 
appropriate to continue to use an absolute shareholder return metric. The share price used to calculate the awards was based on the five 
day average share price from grant. Full vesting will occur on the third anniversary of the date of grant (July 2020), if a shareholder return 
target of 225p is met at the end of the performance period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019, with nil vesting below this target.

The figures shown in the table above reflect this adjustment.
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 83
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Outstanding share awards
In 2014, Saleem Asaria was awarded nil-cost options over 2,222,223 ordinary shares under the Cambian IPO Continuation Option Plan 
No1 (COP1), having a value of £5,000,000 at the time of the award. The first tranche of options, representing one third of the total award, 
became exercisable on 16 April 2017 and was exercised on 9 June 2017. A total of 740,741 options was exercised and 350,000 shares 
were sold in order to cover the tax and National Insurance liabilities. The share price on the date of exercise was 163 pence and the gain 
on exercise was £1,207,408 and these were the only options exercised by the directors during the year. The number of outstanding options 
was increased by 13% to reflect the loss of value following the payment of a special dividend on 15 September 2017. Outstanding options 
will become exercisable in equal tranches on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the Company’s admission to the main market of the 
London Stock Exchange.

The graph below shows the value of £100 invested in the Company’s shares since listing compared to the FTSE All Share index. The graph 
shows the total shareholder return generated by both the movement in share value and the reinvestment over the same period of dividend 
income. The Committee considers that the FTSE All Share index is the appropriate index because the Company has been a member of this 
since listing. This graph has been calculated in accordance with Regulations. It should be noted that the Company listed in April 2014 and 
therefore only has a listed share price for the period of 11 April 2014 to 31 December 2017.

The table below sets out the total remuneration delivered to the Chief Executive Officer over the last four years valued using the 
methodology applied to the single total figure of remuneration. The Committee does not believe that the remuneration payable in its earlier 
years as a private company bears any comparative value to that paid in its later years and therefore the Committee has chosen to disclose 
remuneration only for the four most recent financial years:

Change in CEO’s remuneration compared with employees
The following table sets out the change in the remuneration paid to the Chief Executive Officer from 2016 to 2017 compared with the 
average percentage change for employees.
The CEO’s remuneration disclosed in the table below has been calculated to take into account base salary, taxable benefits, excluding his 
allowance in lieu of pension, and annual bonus (including any amount deferred). The employee pay (on which the average percentage 
change is based) is calculated using the increase in the earnings of all employees (including part-time and casual staff) using P60 and P11D 
data from tax years 2016 and 2017. Part time employees have been excluded from the analysis.

Anoop was employed by the Company.
Non-executives
No changes have been made to the fees due to the non-executive directors. A breakdown of fees payable to the non-executives in 2017  
is as follows:
Chairman’s fee £125,000
Base fee £40,000
Chair of Committee fee £7,000
Senior Independent Director £3,000
Benefits and pension
No changes are proposed to benefits or pension.
Executive directors are now eligible to participate in the Company’s defined contribution plan or receive a salary supplement  
equivalent to 15% of base salary.
Annual Bonus Plan
It is intended that the executive directors will be able to earn an annual bonus. It is considered that the disclosure of the targets is 
commercially sensitive. The Company will disclose performance against target in full in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.  
The metrics chosen, weighting of the bonus target and proposed payout based on threshold, target and maximum performance  
are set out below (malus and clawback provisions apply):
Measure Weighting Threshold Target Maximum
Adjusted EBITDA 100% 96% of target (25% of 
opportunity)
100% of target (50% of 
opportunity)
104% of target (100% of 
opportunity)
Given the introduction of care quality into the LTIP , we have removed care quality from the Annual Bonus Plan to prevent duplication.
Directors’ remuneration report continued
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 86 Long-Term Incentive Plan
It is intended that an award of nil-cost options will be made under the LTIP to the executive directors representing a maximum of 100% 
of base salary. Any awards will vest following the end of the 2020 financial year, if performance conditions measured over a three year 
period have been met. It is proposed that these awards will vest on achievement of EPS, EBITDA margin and care quality (assessed as the 
proportion of facilities rated “Good” or “Outstanding” by Ofsted) conditions with equal weightings on each and targets as set out below.
Measure Weighting
Threshold (25% 
of opportunity)
Target (60% of

Maximum (100%

Adjusted EPS 1/3rd 8p 9p 10p
Adjusted EBITDA margin 1/3rd 15% 16% 18%
Care Quality 1/3rd 82% 86% 90%
Straight-line vesting will occur between the above levels for both performance conditions. No vesting will occur for performance below 
threshold level and 100% of awards will vest for performance above the maximum level.
Malus and clawback provisions will apply.
Consideration by the directors of matters relating to directors’ remuneration
Composition and terms of reference of the Committee
The Board has delegated to the Committee, under agreed terms of reference, responsibility for the remuneration policy and for determining 
specific packages for the executive directors, the Chairman and other members of the executive management team. The Company 
consults with key shareholders in respect of remuneration policy and the introduction of new incentive arrangements. The terms of 
reference for the Committee are available on the Company’s website and from the Company Secretary at the registered office.
All members of the Committee are independent non-executive directors. The Committee received assistance from the Company Secretary, 
who attended meetings by invitation, except when issues relating to their own remuneration were being discussed. Alfred Foglio, the 
representative of GI Partners, the Company’s largest shareholder, and the CEO also attended by invitation on occasions. The Committee 
met six times during the financial year. Meeting attendance is shown on page 67 of the Annual Report and Accounts.
Advisers to the Committee
The Committee has engaged the services of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) as independent remuneration adviser and they attended 
meetings of the Committee by invitation. PwC were appointed by the committee in 2014 following a review of advisers post the IPO of  
the Company.
During the financial year, PwC advised the Committee on all aspects of remuneration policy for executive directors and members of the 
executive management committee. PwC also provided advice to the Company in relation to the drafting and implementation of executive 
and employee incentives. Fees paid during the year for these services were £37,600.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice received was objective and independent. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group 
and the voluntary code of conduct of that body is designed to ensure objective and independent advice is given to remuneration committees.
Shareholder voting at general meeting
Our most recent remuneration report and remuneration policy received the following votes from shareholders (broken down as follows):

with regards to all aspects of the Company’s directors’ remuneration policy and its implementation. The Remuneration Report was

Introduction
Principal activities
The Company was incorporated and registered in England and 
Wales under the Companies Act as a public company limited by 
shares on 7 March 2014 under the name Project Zelda plc, with 
registered number 08929371. The Company changed its name  
to Cambian Group plc on 19 March 2014.
Since the disposal of the Adult Services business on 28 December 
2016, the principal activity of the Company and its remaining 
subsidiaries is the provision of specialist educational and 
behavioural health services for children in the UK. 
Results & dividend
The results of the financial year ended 31 December 2017 are set 
out in the consolidated income statement on page 101. Revenues 
for the year from continuing operations amounted to £196.0 million 
and operating profit for the year before exceptional items for 
continuing operations amounted to £2.0 million. 
Following the sale of the Adult Services business, the Board reviewed 
the future cash requirements of the business and decided that a 
portion of the cash proceeds from the sale would not be needed. 
Accordingly, on 15 September 2017, a special dividend of £50 million 
(27.1 pence per share) was paid to ordinary shareholders. 
In addition, following a review of the Company’s capital 
requirements for the next three years, on 30 January 2018  
the Board declared a further special dividend of £15 million  
(8.2 pence per share). This was paid to ordinary shareholders  
on 28 February 2018. Please refer to the important events since  
the year end on page 93.
The Board intends to maintain a progressive dividend policy.  
An interim dividend of 0.14 pence per share was paid on  
31 October 2017.

Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 88 Directors’ indemnities
The Company’s articles of association permit it to indemnify 
directors of the Company (or of any associated company) in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The Company may  
fund expenditure incurred by directors in defending proceedings 
against them.
The Company may indemnify any director of the Company or of  
any associated company against liabilities. However, the Company 
may not provide an indemnity against: (i) any liability incurred by  
the director to the Company or to any associated company; or  
(ii) against any liability incurred by the director to pay a criminal or 
regulatory penalty; or (iii) against any liability incurred by the director 
in defending criminal proceedings in which they are convicted; or 
(iv) in defending any civil proceedings brought by the Company 
(or an associated company) in which judgement is given against 
them; or (v) in connection with certain court applications under the 
Companies Act 2006. No indemnity was provided and no payments 
were made pursuant to these provisions during the year.
The Company also maintains directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance which gives appropriate cover for any legal action 
brought against its directors.
The articles of association of the Company confer the following 
powers upon and contain the following provisions relating to the 
appointment and removal of the directors:
Number of directors
Unless and until otherwise determined by the Company by ordinary 
resolution, the number of directors (other than any alternate 
directors) shall not be less than two and there shall be no maximum 
number of directors.
Powers of directors
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the articles of 
association of the Company and to any directions given by special 
resolution, the business of the Company shall be managed by the 
Board, which may exercise all the powers of the Company.
The directors were empowered by resolutions of the Company 
passed on 5 June 2017 to, inter alia:
• allot equity securities (as defined by the Companies Act 2006) 
for cash (other than in connection with a pre-emptive offer to all 
shareholders) up to an aggregate nominal amount of £184,100.  
A resolution authorising the directors to allot shares will be sought 
from shareholders at the forthcoming AGM; and
• make market purchases of the Company’s shares, up to a 
maximum aggregate number of 27,445,613 ordinary shares. It is 
proposed to seek renewal of this authority at the forthcoming AGM.
Appointment of directors
Subject to the articles of association of the Company, and without 
prejudice to the power of the Company to appoint any person to be 
a director, the Board shall have power at any time to appoint any 
person who is willing to act as a director, either to fill a vacancy or as 
an addition to the existing Board, but the total number of directors 
shall not exceed any maximum number fixed in accordance with the 
articles of association. Any director so appointed shall hold office only 
until the next AGM of the Company following such appointment and 
shall then be eligible for re-election.
Retirement of directors
At each AGM, any director who was a director at each of the two 
preceding AGMs, and who was not appointed or re-appointed by 
the Company in general meeting at or since either such meeting,  
is required to retire and stand for re-election as a director. 
However, the Company follows the UK Corporate Governance 
Code’s recommendation that all directors of FTSE 350 companies 
are subject to annual re-appointment by shareholders.
Removal of directors
In addition to any powers of removal conferred by the Companies 
Act 2006, the Company may by ordinary resolution (of which 
special notice has been given) remove any director before the 
expiration of his or her period of office and may (subject to the 
articles of association of the Company) by ordinary resolution, 
appoint another person who is willing to act in his or her place.

Rights attaching to shares under the articles of association
The Company’s articles of association do not contain any specific 
restrictions on the size of a shareholder’s holding.
Voting rights
Subject to any special rights or restrictions as to voting attached to 
any shares by or in accordance with the articles of association, on a 
show of hands every member who is present in person or by proxy 
and entitled to vote has one vote and on a poll every member who 
is present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote has one vote for 
every share of which he, she or it is the holder.
Restrictions on voting
No member shall, unless the Board otherwise determines, be 
entitled to be present at or vote at a general meeting or at any 
separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares, either in 
person or by proxy, in respect of any share held by him, her or it 
or to exercise any right as a member unless all calls or other sums 
presently payable by him, her or it in respect of that share have 
been paid to the Company. In addition, any member (or other 
person appearing to be interested in the shares (a third party)), 
who having been served with a notice under section 793 of the 
Companies Act 2006 by the Company (requiring such member 
to disclose to the Board in writing within such reasonable period 
as may be specified in such notice, details of any past or present 
beneficial interest of such member or any such third party in 
the shares or any other interest of any kind whatsoever which a 
member or third party may have in the shares and the identity of 
the person having or having had any such interest) fails to do so, 
may be disenfranchised by service of a notice by the Board.
Transfer
Any member may transfer all or any of his uncertificated shares 
by means of a relevant system in such manner provided for, and 
subject as provided, in the CREST Regulations and the rules of any 
relevant system. Subject to the articles of association, any member 
may transfer all or any of his, her or its certificated shares by an 
instrument of transfer in any usual or common form or in any other 
form which the Board may approve.
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the Board 
may, in its absolute discretion, decline to register any transfer of any 
share which is not a fully paid share provided that where such a 
share is a member of a class of share admitted to the Official List, 
such discretion may not be exercised in such a way as to prevent 
dealings in shares of that class from taking place on an open and 
proper basis.
The Board may only decline to register a transfer of an 
uncertificated share in the circumstances set out in the CREST 
Regulations, and where, in the case of a transfer to joint holders, 
the number of joint holders to whom the uncertificated share is to 
be transferred exceeds four.
Capital structure
As at 31 December 2017, the Company had 184,198,746 issued 
ordinary shares of 1 pence each. The Company has, and as at  
31 December 2017 had, one class of ordinary shares and 
each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings of 
the Company and to participate in any dividends declared in 
accordance with the articles of association. No person has any 
special rights of control over the Company’s share capital.
The authority under the Companies Act 2006 granted on 5 June 
2017 at the Company’s 2017 AGM for the directors to issue new 
shares for cash remains valid until the forthcoming AGM when  
it is intended that a resolution will be put forward to shareholders  
to renew the authority to issue shares for cash. 
Cambian Group Employee Benefit Trust (the “EBT”)
The EBT , a discretionary trust for the benefit of executive directors 
and employees, was established on 14 April 2014. The trustee, 
Lutea Trustees Limited (incorporated in Jersey), is not a subsidiary 
of the Company. The EBT operates in conjunction with the Cambian 
Group 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Cambian Group Annual 
Share Option Plan, the Cambian Group IPO Continuation Plan No.1 
and the Cambian Group IPO Continuation Plan No.2 (together, the 
“Employee Plans”). The number of shares held by the EBT at any 
time, when added to the number of shares held by any other trust 
established by the Company for the benefit of employees, will not 
exceed 5% of the issued share capital of the Company.
The EBT is funded by loans from the Company which are then used 
to acquire, either via market purchase or subscription, ordinary 
shares to satisfy conditional share awards granted under the 
Employee Plans. For the purpose of the financial statements, the EBT 
is consolidated into the Company and Group. As a consequence, 
the loans are eliminated and the cost of the shares acquired is 
deducted from equity as set out in note 2 on page 105 of the 
financial statements.
In relation to its operation in conjunction with the Employee Plan, 
the EBT does not transfer the beneficial interest in the shares to the 
executive directors and employees until such share awards are 
vested. On establishment of the EBT , the Company contributed an 
initial trust fund of £1,000 and provided a sum of £34,662 to the  
EBT by way of gift for the purpose of subscribing at par for 
3,466,222 ordinary shares of one penny each. As at 31 December 
2017, the EBT held a non-beneficial interest in 1,796,072 shares  
in the Company.
While any shares are held by the EBT it will refrain from exercising 
any voting rights unless the Company otherwise directs and is not 
obliged to exercise such voting rights in a manner requested by 
the employee beneficiaries. The EBT has agreed to waive dividends 
in respect of any shares held in the EBT unless and to the extent 
otherwise directed by the Company.
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 90 The Board may, in its absolute discretion, decline to register any 
duly executed and stamped instrument of transfer of a certificated 
share unless the instrument of transfer is: (i) left at the registered 
office of the Company, or at such other place as the Board may 
decide for registration and is accompanied by the certificate for the 
shares to be transferred and such other evidence as the Board may 
reasonably require to prove the title of the transferor and the due 
execution of the transfer; or (ii) in respect of only one class of share; 
and (iii) in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint 
holders to whom the share is to be transferred does not exceed four.
Amendment of the Company’s articles of association
Any amendments to the Company’s articles of association may be 
made in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 
by way of special resolution.
Other matters
Related party transactions
The Chairman reviewed the operation of the relationship agreement 
between the Company, Care Aspirations II LLC, Advanced Childcare 
LLC, Cambian Group Holdings LLC and GI Partners UK Limited (the 
“Relationship Agreement”) during the financial year to 31 December 
2017 and is satisfied that the provisions in the Relationship 
Agreement that are intended to protect the independence of the 
Company have been complied with in all respects during the period 
of the review. Details of the Relationship Agreement are set out on 
page 58 and details of all related party transactions are set out in

applied for, and the aptitude and ability of the applicant concerned. 
In the event of members of staff becoming disabled, every effort is 
made to ensure that their employment with the Group continues

should, as far as possible, be identical to that of other employees.
Employee involvement
The Group remains keen to involve all employees and keep them 
informed of matters affecting not only the performance of the 
Group, but more importantly, them as the Group’s employees.  
In 2017 Cambian sent out regular email updates to all employees 
reporting on the progress of the business and operational 
highlights. The Group also carried out an engagement survey to ask 
staff what matters to them, which was followed up with a further 
engagement workshop. Staff forums across the Group were also 
used to give staff a voice on what matters to them. Certain directors, 
heads, principals and home managers also visited sites and met 
with employees to gather their feedback.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the financial statements including the Directors’ remuneration report 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare such financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have 
also chosen to prepare the parent company financial statements 
under Financial Reporting Standards (FRS) 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework. Under company law, the directors must not approve 
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company. In 
preparing these financial statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a  
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time  
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ statement pursuant to the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in the 
Board of Directors’ section on pages 52 and 53, confirm that, to the 
best of their knowledge:
• the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, 
are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy;
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
• the Annual Report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and its subsidiary undertakings, together with a description of  
the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
Each director at the date of this report also confirms that:
• so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• the director has taken all steps that he or she ought to have 
taken as a director in order to make himself/herself aware of 
any relevant audit information or to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information. This confirmation is given 
and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of 
section 418 Companies Act 2006.  
 
Approved by the Board and signed on behalf of the Board.

Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 94 Independent auditors’ report 
to the members of Cambian Group plc
Report on the audit of the financial statements
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2017 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)  
as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice including Financial Reporting Standard 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards  
to the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements of Cambian Group plc (the “parent Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”)  
which comprise:
• the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income;
• the Consolidated Balance Sheet;
• the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity;
• the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement; 
• the related notes 1 to 35;
• the Parent Company Balance Sheet;
• the Parent Company Statement of Changes in Equity; and 
• the related notes to the parent Company financial statements 1 to 12.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent 
Company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure 
Framework” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the Parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Independent auditors’ report

Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
• Revenue recognition;
• Assessment of the carrying value of goodwill; and
• Provision for National Minimum Wage payments for sleep-ins.
Materiality The materiality that we used for the Group financial statements was £0.35m which was determined  
by reference to a number of benchmarks. 
Scoping Our Group audit scope covers 100% of the Group’s subsidiaries, all of which conduct activities in the UK.
Significant changes  
in our approach
In the prior year, materiality was determined only on the basis of 5% of pre-tax profit adjusted for 
exceptional items. In the current year, following the change in the Group resulting from the disposal of the 
Adult Services business, we assessed materiality by reference to a number of benchmarks, including 
revenue, net assets and EBITDA, and concluded that a materiality of £0.35m was appropriate. 
In the prior year, key audit matters included impairment of plant, property and equipment, recoverability 
of trade receivables, presentation of exceptional items and the accounting for the disposal of the Adult 
business. Following the disposal of the Adult business at the end of 2016 and the consequent change  
in the risk profile of the Group, we have determined that we no longer report on impairment of property, 
plant and equipment, presentation of exceptional items and accounting for the disposal of the  
Adult business. We have considered the recoverability of trade receivables within our work on revenue 
recognition and therefore no longer report on this separately.
Conclusions relating to going concern, principal risks and viability statement
Going concern
We have reviewed the directors’ statement in note 2 to the financial statements about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their 
identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and company’s ability to continue to do so 
over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to 
that statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is materially inconsistent 
with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have  
nothing material to report,  
add or draw attention to  
in respect of these matters.
Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering whether they were consistent  
with the knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, including the knowledge obtained in  
the evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern, we are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to:
• the disclosures on pages 36 to 39 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being 
managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ confirmation on page 63 that they have carried out a robust assessment  
of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model,  
future performance, solvency or liquidity; or
• the directors’ explanation on page 35 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, 
over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their 
statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including 
any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement relating to the prospects of the Group 
required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have  
nothing material to report,  
add or draw attention to  
in respect of these matters.
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 96 Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources 
in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Revenue recognition
Key audit matter 
description
The Group recognised revenue of £196.0m (2016: £182.1m) over the period in which its behavioural health 
services in specialist high severity care are provided as set out in the accounting policies in note 2.  
The Group measures revenue at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable in respect of 
services rendered.
A significant proportion of the Group’s services are billed in advance based on the expected services to be 
provided. Where services delivered differ from those expected, credit notes are issued to ensure revenue  
is accurately recorded. Due to the manual nature of the information on which billings and credit notes are 
based a key audit matter has been identified around the risk of inaccurate revenue recognition.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to  
the key audit matter
We developed an expectation of recorded revenue based on key metrics, including occupancy data and 
fee rates (a sample of which were traced to source documentation), on a site by site basis and compared 
this to the actual revenue recognised. Where a reasonable expectation could not be formed, e.g. due to 
new sites or changes in service conditions, we traced a sample of transactions to invoice.
We tested the accuracy of invoicing by sampling credit notes from after year end and confirmed their 
accuracy through comparison to occupancy data and the original invoice that had been raised. We also 
assessed the recoverability of the invoices sampled. We gained assurance over the completeness of credit 
notes through ensuring credit notes had been raised in sequential order.
Key observations We have assessed revenue on a site by site basis to be in line with our expectations and we consider 
revenue to be free from material misstatement.
Assessment of the carrying value of goodwill 
Key audit matter 
description
The carrying value of goodwill (2017 & 2016 – £75.8m), is considered a key audit matter due to the  
size of the balance and the significant judgement involved in the annual impairment assessment. 
Judgemental aspects include assumptions of future profitability, revenue growth, margins and the 
selection of appropriate discount rates, all of which may be susceptible to management bias. Due  
to number of judgements involved, we have determined that there was a potential for fraud through 
possible manipulation of this balance.
This key audit matter is discussed in the Audit Committee report on page 60 as a significant judgement,  
in the Goodwill note on page 117 and in the accounting policies in note 13 to the financial statements.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
We have obtained management’s goodwill impairment review calculations and assessed the mechanical 
accuracy of the model. Furthermore, we challenged the assumptions and inputs used in the impairment 
model including the revenue growth rates and margins, discount rates, long term growth rates and the 
sensitivities applied and disclosed. We have also assessed management’s historical forecasting accuracy.
Our procedures included reviewing forecast cash flows with reference to historical trading performance 
and the Board approved budgets and consulting with our valuation specialists who benchmarked 
assumptions such as the discount rate to macroeconomic and market data.
The long term growth rate used in the cash flow projections was assessed to check that it did not 
materially differ to the average long term growth rate for the UK.
We have also performed sensitivity analysis on the impairment model to determine if a reasonable 
possible adverse change in the key assumptions, results in the carrying amount exceeding the recoverable 
amount for any cash generating unit.
Key observations We concluded that the assumptions and judgements set out in management’s model are reasonable and 
we concur with the directors’ assessment that there is no impairment. We also considered the disclosures 
within the consolidated financial statements to be appropriate.

Provision for National Living Wage payments for ‘sleep-ins’ 
Key audit matter 
description
As discussed in the Audit Committee report on page 61 the Group, in common with a number of mental 
health care providers in the industry, is undergoing a National Living Wage audit by HMRC. During 2017 
there have been developments relating to other social care employers that indicate that this matter  
is being pursued by HMRC and that the outcome of cases is based on the individual set of circumstances.
Given the complexity of applying the regulations and judgment involved in calculating the provision, 
management has identified this as a key source of estimation uncertainty, as described in note 3.  
This has been identified as a key audit matter and a risk of fraud in relation to this judgement has  
been identified.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
We reviewed the Group’s records of policies and procedures with regard to compliance with the National 
Living Wage regulations and in particular, the process for employees working on sleep-in shifts.
We consulted with our in-house employment tax specialists in order to challenge management’s 
assumptions on the application of the regulations and implications of non-compliance.
We challenged the underlying assumptions and adequacy of the provision through testing the 
mathematical accuracy of the provision and testing the underlying data on which the provision is based  
on a sample basis.
We performed a sensitivity analysis on the provision by flexing management’s key assumptions to 
ascertain a range of possible outcomes based on reasonably possible movements in such assumptions.
Key observations We consider the judgements made by management to be appropriate in light of the complexity of the 
assessment and we concur that this is a key source of estimation uncertainty.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions 
of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit 
work and in evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent financial statements
Materiality £0.35m (2016: £0.60m) £0.33m (2016: £0.58m)
Basis for 
determining 
materiality
In the prior year, materiality was determined only  
on the basis of 5% of pre-tax profit adjusted for 
exceptional items. In the current year, we assessed 
materiality by reference to a number of benchmarks, 
including revenue, net assets, EBITDA and pre-tax 
profit adjusted for exceptional items (as described  
in note 6), and concluded that a materiality of £0.35m 
was appropriate. 
1% of total assets restricted to an amount below  
the Group overall materiality.
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
Based on our professional judgement given the 
impact on profit of transition costs in the year as the 
Group moves to a smaller, focused Child services 
business we have assessed materiality by reference 
to revenue, EBITDA, and net assets. The resultant 
materiality is 0.2% of revenue, 1.9% of EBITDA and 0.1% 
of net assets.
We believe that the total assets is the primary 
measure used by stakeholders in assessing  
the position of the entity, and is an accepted  
auditing benchmark.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £17,500 (2016: £32,000)  
for the Group, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report  
to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 98 An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit scope covers 100% of the Group’s subsidiaries, all of which conduct activities in the UK. 
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the 
information, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent 
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent  
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to  
be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required  
to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude  
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material 
misstatements of the other information include where we conclude that:
• Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the directors that they consider  
the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained 
in the audit; or
• Audit Committee reporting – the section describing the work of the Audit Committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the 
directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s compliance with  
the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in 
accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report 
in respect of these matters.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is  
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 104 1. General information
Cambian Group plc (“Company”) is incorporated in Great Britain under the Companies Act 2006. The principal activity of the Company  
and its subsidiaries (“Group”) is the provision of high quality behavioural health services.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the  
Group operates.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The financial 
statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial 
statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below and overleaf. 
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The historical cost convention has been applied except in respect of those financial instruments that have been measured at fair value at 
the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies below and overleaf. Historical cost is generally based on the fair 
value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation 
technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market 
participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for 
measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-
based payment transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 2, leasing transactions within the scope of IAS 17 , and measurements that 
have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as value in use in IAS 36.
In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the 
inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which 
are described as follows:
• Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the 
measurement date;
• Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly  
or indirectly; and
• Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Going concern
As indicated on page 35 of the Annual Report, the directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, they have adopted the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. The directors have considered 
the Group and Company’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, and are 
satisfied that the Group and Company should be able to operate within the level of its current facilities.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial information incorporates the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company  
(the “subsidiaries”) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved when a company:
• has power over the investee;
• is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
• has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to  
the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group. All intra-group 
transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the “acquisition date”). Goodwill is 
measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair 
value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is not amortised but reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to 
each of the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. CGUs to which goodwill has 
been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the 
recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each 
asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at 
the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).
Intangible assets acquired in business combinations are comprised of customer relationships, and contractual obligations entered into by 
the vendor not to provide competing services with the Group for a determined period (non-compete agreements).
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and any impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives and charged to 
administrative expenses on the following basis:
Customer relationships 7 to 18 years
Non-compete agreements Shorter of the agreement term or 5 years
The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in 
estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.
Tax
The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at year end in the UK where the 
Company’s subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax 
returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where 
appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying values for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by year end and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred 
income tax liability is settled. Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be 
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on 
investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the 
same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets (other than land and assets under construction) less their residual values over 
their useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following basis:
Buildings 2%
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 20% − 33%
Motor vehicles 20% − 25%
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 106 Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, 
over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or scrappage of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and, for 
qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. Depreciation of these assets, on the same 
basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is 
estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from 
other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with 
an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss 
is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the 
Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance 
sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows 
estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is 
recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.
Restructurings
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid 
expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to 
those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, 
which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity.
Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the grant date. The fair value excludes the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises 
its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. The 
impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised 
estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Financial assets
All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract 
whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured  
at fair value.
All financial assets, other than cash and cash equivalents and derivatives, are classified as “loans and receivables”.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are 
classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition  
of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there is 
objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future 
cash flows of the investment have been affected.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are, in addition, 
assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s  
past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period of 
60 days, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade 
receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against 
the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the 
financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor 
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained 
interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards  
of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised 
borrowing for the proceeds received.
Financial liabilities and equity
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual 
arrangement.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity 
instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or other financial liabilities. In certain 
circumstances the Group is required to undertake the responsibility of Corporate Appointee for individuals under the Group’s care, as they 
lack the capacity to manage their own finances. The responsibility involves safeguarding the individual’s financial assets and ensuring  
that the support they receive from the UK Government is apportioned appropriately. The Group segregates these funds from its own in 
restricted bank accounts and records a corresponding liability.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense 
recognised on an effective yield basis.
Effective interest method
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the 
relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the 
financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 108 Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable in respect of services provided in the normal course of 
business, net of discounts, estimated rebates and VAT. In all cases revenue is recognised over the period in which the service is provided. 
Additional services provided by the Group are recognised on provision of the service. Sales rebate accruals and provisions are established 
in the same period as the revenue to which they relate.
Revenue invoiced in advance is included in deferred revenue until the service is provided.
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to  
state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Group’s obligations 
under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as 
a finance lease obligation.
Finance lease payments are apportioned between finance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate 
of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Interest expense is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where 
another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate 
benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except where another 
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items reflect items of non-recurring expenditure which, individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, need to be disclosed 
separately due to their size or incidence in order to obtain a more clear and consistent presentation of the Group’s underlying performance.
Adoption of new and revised standards
In the current year, the following new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted:
Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses
Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure initiative
None of the new or revised standards that have been adopted affected the amounts reported in the financial statements.
Standards not affecting the reported results and financial position
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements the Group had not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been 
issued but are not yet effective:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 16 Leases
Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions
Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty of Income Tax Treatments
Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2014-16 Cycle (Dec 2016) Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2014-16 Cycle – IFRS 1 and IAS 28 Amendments
The directors expect that the adoption of the standards listed above, other than IFRS 16, will not have a material impact on the financial 
information of the Group in future reporting periods. This includes IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers. To this extent, the Group has reviewed its existing contracts and revenue streams and do not anticipate a material impact.
Management are currently performing a detailed review of the Group’s lease arrangements and are deciding on how IFRS 16 will be 
implemented and are considering which practical expedients might apply and whether or not the standard will be implemented on a  
full or partial retrospective basis. The full impact of IFRS 16 is therefore not yet known.

3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
The following are the critical judgements that the directors have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that 
have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the historical financial information. Those involving estimations are dealt with 
separately below.
Exceptional items
The directors have used judgement in determining those items which, individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, need to be disclosed 
separately due to their size or incidence in order to obtain a more clear and consistent presentation of the Group’s underlying performance.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Sleep-ins
A sleep-in refers to a type of work shift, commonly used in the care industry, where employees “sleep-in” and are paid an allowance for 
doing so. HMRC’s view is that hours spent by employees performing sleep-in count as “working time” and therefore should be included 
when calculating whether or not someone has been paid in accordance with the National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015. In November 
2017 , HMRC reiterated its position and invited companies to join the Social Care Compliance Scheme, a self-reporting scheme aimed at 
concluding historic payments regarding sleep-ins. Cambian have opted into the scheme. Whilst a number of other care service providers 
have challenged HMRC’s original view, if it is ultimately individually determined that Cambian had to pay each individual engaged in a 
sleep-in an amount by reference to the National Living Wage, the additional cost could be material. The directors have used their 
judgement to provide for this matter. The amount has not been separately disclosed to avoid prejudicing the dispute.
Onerous contract
Cambian is a party to an exclusive supply agreement in respect of pharmaceutical supplies at its sites. This contract did not automatically 
transfer with the Adult Services business. The supplier has indicated that in its view the sale is in breach of the agreement and is seeking 
either a novation of the agreement or compensation. Litigation has been formally threatened but not yet commenced, and the directors 
have used their judgement to provide for this. The amount has not been separately disclosed to avoid prejudicing the dispute.
Carrying value of property, plant and equipment
Determining whether property, plant and equipment is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use, and if required, estimation of 
the fair value less costs of disposal. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from 
the property, plant and equipment, and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
4. Business and geographical segments
Products and services from which reportable segments derive their revenues
Following the sale of the Adult Services business, management has determined there is one remaining operating segment.
On 28 December 2016, Cambian Group made a substantial disposal with the sale of the Adult Services business. Prior to this disposal, 
Cambian Group provided behavioural healthcare services to both children and adults. Following this disposal Cambian Group is wholly 
focused on Children’s Services. As required by accounting standards, Children’s Services are treated as “continuing operations” and Adult 
Services are treated as “discontinued operations”.
The Group assesses performance using adjusted EBITDA as its primary measure. This reflects the underlying performance of the business 
and provides an additional useful comparison of how the business is managed and measured on a day to day basis. Our KPIs are  
aligned to our strategy and together are used to measure the performance of our business and form the basis of the performance 
measures for remuneration.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before net finance costs, tax, depreciation, amortisation, profit or loss on disposal of assets, merger 
and acquisition costs, IPO share option charges, and exceptional items.
All revenue for the Group is generated from within the UK.

Impairment of property, plant and equipment relates to an impairment charge relating to of one of Cambian’s sites. Sleep-ins is the 
provision for 2016 and prior years relating to the potential impact of National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015 (see note 2). Costs 
associated with the disposal of the Adult Services business relate to costs related specifically to the disposal and largely consist of 
professional fees associated with the completion process and staff retention incentives incurred during the transitional services agreement. 
Post disposal restructuring and reorganisation costs relate to costs incurred in restructuring the central functions. IT systems costs relate 
predominantly to professional fees incurred in connection with process simplification and system costs following the sale of the Adult 
Services business. Reversal of prior period exceptional provision relates to a tax liability provided for relating to the acquisition of By the 
Bridge Holdings Limited.
Refinancing costs include the engagement of legal and financial specialists to assist in the financial restructuring in April 2016. Capitalised 
finance costs written off relate to the previously capitalised finance fees included in the carrying value of the borrowings prior to the financial 
restructuring in April 2016. IT project costs written off relate to a decision taken in late 2015 to cancel a project to integrate Finance, HR and 
CRM systems.
A cash outflow of £12.4m (2016: £5.3m) occurred as a result of exceptional items, and is included as part of net cash inflow from

exceptional costs will be deductible, which has reduced the tax charge by £1.0m (2016: £1.6m). The Group has also released historic 
exceptional tax provisions, which has reduced the tax charge by £0.6m (2016: nil).
Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 114 11. Sale of discontinued operations
On 5 December 2016, the Group entered into a sale agreement to dispose of Cambian Healthcare Limited and its subsidiaries, Care 
Aspirations Developments Limited and its subsidiaries, and Cambian Care Services, (the Adult Services business), which carried out all  
of the Group’s Adult Services operations. The disposal was completed on 28 December 2016, on which date control of the Adult Services 
business passed to the acquirer, Cygnet Health Care Limited (Cygnet).
A profit of £144.3m was reported in the year ended 31 December 2016 on the disposal of the Adult Services business, being the difference 
between the proceeds of disposal and the carrying amount of the subsidiaries’ net assets sold. Under the terms of the Share Purchase 
Agreement, Cambian delivered a Closing Statement on 24 April 2017 to Cygnet. The Closing Statement was agreed between the Company 
and Cygnet on 19 September 2017 resulting in a reduction in the purchase price of £4.0m to £379.0m (excluding directly attributable costs). 
The final consideration after directly attributable costs of £3.6m was £375.4m.

12. Earnings per share (EPS)
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company, by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the year. Diluted EPS is calculated by excluding the effect of the weighted average number of share options under the 
Continuation Option Plans outstanding that were anti-dilutive for the periods presented but could dilute loss per share in the future.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit 
from that business combination.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The Group’s Child business is the sole CGU to which goodwill is allocated.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less cost of disposal and the value in use of the CGU, has been determined  
based on value in use calculations. These calculations use cash flow projections for operational assets at the balance sheet date based  
on financial budgets approved by the Board of Directors for the forthcoming year and forecasts for up to three years which are based  
on assumptions of the business, industry and economic growth. Cash flows beyond this year are extrapolated using growth rates, which 
do not exceed the expected long-term economic growth rate. The cash flows are discounted to the net present value using pre-tax  
discount rates.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, long-term growth rates, mature occupancy rates, 
asset level fill rates, patient fee rates and costs. Mature occupancy rates, asset level fill up rates, patient fee rates and direct costs are 
derived from bottom up, asset by asset level analysis produced as part of management’s annual budget process and are not dissimilar to 
past experience at the point of budget production. The Group has assumed a growth rate of 2% (2016: 2%) into perpetuity when assessing 
its future cash flows. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the market assessment of the time value of 
money as at each balance sheet date, adjusted for the risks specific to the CGUs.
The pre-tax rate used to discount cash flow forecasts of the CGU is 8.6% (2016: 7 .9%).

13. Goodwill (continued)
Sensitivities
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on each of the base case assumptions used for assessing the goodwill with other variables held 
constant. Consideration of sensitivities to key assumptions can evolve from one financial year to the next.
The current headroom is £129.0m (2016: £134.2m restated). The prior year headroom has been restated to reflect a refined model used by 
management that reflects the terminal value more accurately. Following this restatement the directors have considered the amount by 
which the value assigned to each key assumption must change, after incorporating any consequential effects of that change on the other 
variables used to measure recoverable amount, in order for the Child CGU’s recoverable amount to be equal to its carrying amount. This  
is illustrated in the below table, which represents the change in respective percentage that would be required before an impairment  
would occur:
2017 2016 (restated)
Current value Break even change Current value Break even change
Average annual revenue growth rate 5.7% (13.3%) 4.9% (13.2%)
Average annual EBITDA margin 14.7% (5.2%) 12.7% (3.7%)

In addition, the Group’s obligations under finance leases (see note 20) are secured by the lessor’s title to the leased assets, which have a 
carrying amount of £0.3m (2016: £0.6m). These assets are included under motor vehicles.
Impairment losses recognised in the year
During the year the Group carried out an assessment of impairment indicators in its property, plant and equipment. A review of the 
recoverable amount of those assets with impairment indicators was performed. The recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair  
value less cost of disposal and the value in use, has been determined initially based on value in use calculations. These calculations  
use cash flow projections for operational assets at the balance sheet date based on financial budgets approved by the Board of Directors 
for the forthcoming year and forecasts for up to three years which are based on assumptions of the business, industry and economic 
growth. Cash flows beyond this year are extrapolated using growth rates, which do not exceed the expected long-term economic  
growth rate. The review has led to an impairment loss of £5.2m in land and buildings, which has been recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, long-term growth rates, mature occupancy rates, 
asset level fill rates, patient fee rates and costs. Mature occupancy rates, asset level fill up rates, patient fee rates and direct costs are 
derived from bottom up, asset by asset level analysis produced as part of management’s annual budget process and are not dissimilar  
to past experience at the point of budget production. The Group has assumed a growth rate of 2% into perpetuity when assessing its future 
cash flows. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the market assessment of the time value of money as at 
each balance sheet date, adjusted for the risks specific to the Group.
Where the value in use has indicated an impairment, the Group also estimated fair value less costs of disposal of the related land and 
buildings, through use of external valuations, based on recent market prices of assets with similar age and obsolescence.
The discount rate used in measuring value in use was 8.5% (2016: 7 .9%) per annum. An impairment assessment was performed in 2016  
but there was no indication of impairment.
The impairment losses have been included in profit or loss in the administrative expenses line item.

Invoices to customers are due for payment within 60 days of issue. Trade receivables disclosed above include amounts (see below for aged 
analysis) which are past due at the reporting date. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited due to its customers being principally local 
authorities controlled by the UK Government. The Group has recognised an allowance for doubtful receivables at each reporting date by 
considering the receivables which are overdue. The average age of receivables is 41 days (2016: 72 days).
The Group does not hold collateral or other credit enhancements over its trade receivables nor does it have a legal right of offset against 
amounts owed by the Group to the counterparty.

Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all tax losses and other temporary differences where the directors believe it is 
probable that these assets will be recovered.
In addition to the recognised losses disclosed above the Group has unused tax losses at the balance sheet date, relating to a mixture of 
trading losses, non-trade deficits and management expenses, of £16.5m (2016: £13.9m) available for offset against suitable future taxable 
profits. A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of any of these losses as it is not considered probable that there will be 
sufficient future taxable profits available.
At the balance sheet date the Group has unused tax capital losses of £3.9m (2016: £3.9m) available for offset against future capital gains. 
No deferred tax asset has been recognised for these losses as no future capital gains are currently expected to arise. There is no expiry 
date for any of the recognised and unrecognised tax losses.

The entity has a forfeitable share scheme for the executive directors and qualifying employees (participant). The participant will forfeit the 
forfeitable shares if they cease to be an employee of the Group before the vesting date, unless otherwise determined by the Board.
During 2014, and prior to IPO, nil-cost options were awarded to certain employees and executives of the Group under Continuation Option 
Plan 1 and Continuation Option Plan 2. 3,199,997 nil-cost options over ordinary shares were awarded under Continuation Option Plan 1, and 
a third of these become exercisable on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of IPO and remain exercisable until the 
tenth anniversary of the date of IPO. 246,225 nil-cost options over ordinary shares were awarded under Continuation Option Plan 2, and 
these become exercisable 18 months from the date of IPO and remain exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the date of IPO. All of the 
nil-cost options awarded under these plans were awarded at the then fair value market price of 225 pence.
The total fair value charge of £7 .8m is being expensed over the vesting periods, ranging between 18 months and 5 years. The total expense 
recognised in the year was £1.0m (2016: £2.2m) (note 5).
The number of share under option under COP1 were adjusted during the period to preserve the rights of the holder as a result of the special 
dividend made on 31 August 2017 .

On 15 February 2017 nil-cost options were awarded to certain executives of the Group under its Long-Term Incentive Plan. 663,982 nil-cost 
options over ordinary shares were awarded, these become exercisable on the third anniversary on the date of grant subject to an absolute 
total shareholder return metric being met and these remain exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the grant date.
On 18 July 2017 nil-cost options were awarded to certain employees and executives of the Group under its Long-Term Incentive Plan. 
1,087 ,917 nil-cost options over ordinary shares were awarded, these become exercisable on the third anniversary on the date of grant 
subject to an absolute total shareholder return metric being met and these remain exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the grant date.
The total fair value charge of £1.3m in relation to the 2017 Long Term Incentive Plans is being expensed over the vesting period. The total 
expense recognised in the year was £0.3m (2016: £nil). The fair value charge was calculated using a Monte-Carlo model incorporating the 
total shareholder return metric and the following table sets out the assumptions used:

Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for its central Head Office properties, a portion of its operating 
properties and other operating leases. Leases are generally negotiated for a term of between three and ten years for properties and 
between three and five years for other operating leases.
30. Retirement benefit schemes
The Group operates a stakeholder pension scheme as required by the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 and the Stakeholder 
Pensions Scheme Regulations 2000. The Group does not contribute to the scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from 
those of the Group in an independently administered fund.
The Group contributes to a defined benefit scheme for the benefit of the teaching staff employed by subsidiary companies. The assets are 
administered by the Teachers’ Pension Scheme. The Teachers’ Pension Scheme is a multi-employer scheme run by the UK Government 
where the employer’s liability is limited to providing defined contributions on behalf of its employees. As such, the scheme is treated as a 
defined contribution scheme.
The total cost charged to income of £1.4m (2016: £1.3m) represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified 
in the rules of the schemes. As at 31 December 2017 , contributions of £0.3m (2016: £0.3m) due in respect of the current reporting year had 
not been paid over to the schemes.
31. Financial instruments
The Group seeks to reduce exposures to interest rate and other financial risks, to ensure liquidity is available to meet the foreseeable needs 
of the Group and to invest cash assets safely and profitably. The Group does not engage in speculative trading in financial instruments and 
transacts only in relation to underlying business requirements.
Significant accounting policies
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted (including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and 
the bases for recognition of income and expenses) for each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed 
in note 2.

31. Financial instruments (continued)
Capital risk
The Group’s objectives when managing capital (defined as borrowings plus equity) are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern in order to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, while optimising returns to shareholders 
through an appropriate balance of debt and equity funding.
As at 31 December 2017 there is a Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) of £30m in place (2016: no RCF in place).

Cash at bank and in hand 83,056 116,657
Borrowings
Amounts due under hire purchase obligations (276) (550)
Net cash 82,780 116,107
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group manages its exposure to 
liquidity risk by reviewing the cash resources required to meet its business objectives through both short and long-term cash flow forecasts. 
The Group maintains sufficient cash balances to ensure that it has sufficient funds for general corporate purposes including working capital.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a customer may default on their obligation to the Group in relation to lending, settlement and other financial 
activities. The Group’s credit risk primarily arises from trade and other receivables. The amounts included in the balance sheet are net of 
allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous 
experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows. The Group has a very low operational credit risk due to the Group 
providing services principally to local authorities. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with the exposure spread over a 
large number of local authorities and combined commissioning groups. The credit risk on liquid funds is considered to be low, as virtually 
all of the customers are backed by the UK Government. The Group invests its excess funds in cash and cash equivalents and term-deposits 
being regarded as highly liquid and secure products, and only with financial institutions with strong credit ratings.
Interest rate risk
The Group is not exposed to significant interest rate risk as it has no outstanding borrowings.
Foreign currency risk
The Group does not trade internationally, and has no material foreign currency risk.
Maturity of non-derivative financial instruments
The Group’s non-derivative financial assets consist of cash and trade and other receivables, both of which are non-interest bearing.  
The Group’s expected maturity for its non-derivative financial assets is less than one year.
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities with agreed repayment 
periods. The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which 
the Group can be required to pay. The tables include both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, 
the undiscounted amount is derived from the prevailing 3-month LIBOR rate at the balance sheet date. The contractual maturity is based  
on the earliest date on which the Group may be required to pay.

All related party transactions are all considered to be on arm’s-length terms and in the ordinary course of business.
33. Restatement
Cambian Group plc acquired Cambian Capital Limited, Care Aspirations Capital Limited and Advanced Childcare Capital Limited and their 
underlying subsidiaries on 15 April 2014. The difference between the initial cost of Cambian Group plc’s investments in these subsidiaries 
(determined by reference to their fair value at the date of acquisition) and the nominal value of the shares issued in exchange was initially 
classified as share premium. Following further review and analysis, and as confirmed by external legal and accounting advice, it has been 
determined that this difference of £366.2m should instead have been classified as a merger reserve as required by section 612 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Consequently, the Company has retrospectively restated the equity classification of this £366.2m balance from share 
premium to merger reserve. There are no further adjustments required as a result.
A merger reserve created as a result of a share placement of Cambian Group plc shares in March 2015 that was previously categorised as 
part of other reserves as no separate merger reserve account existed has been reclassified as merger reserve.

34. Re-presentation
The Group has reviewed its allocation of divisional and central costs between cost of sales and administrative expenses, and realigned the 
classification to be more representative of the business model and the environment in which the Group operates. This change results in the 
financial statements providing reliable and more relevant information about the effects of transactions on the entity’s financial position and 
performance. The resulting change is reflected below:

Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 132 Notes to the Parent Company financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2017
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The individual financial statements of Cambian Group plc (the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with UK law and applicable 
UK accounting standards. The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 100, issued  
by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework. The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except in respect of those financial 
instruments that have been measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value  
of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to 
share-based payment, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, 
presentation of a cash flow statement and certain related party transactions.
Investments in subsidiary companies
Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment. All investments held by the Company 
are in its subsidiaries.
Going concern
As indicated on page 35 of the Annual Report, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources  
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future having considered the Company forecasts and projections, taking account  
of reasonably possible changes in trading performance and the current economic uncertainty. Accordingly, they have adopted the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity and the shares are fully paid up. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares 
or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Share issue costs incurred directly in connection with a 
business combination are shown as a deduction from equity.
Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the grant date. The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the Company 
revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. 
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised 
estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
2. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Company’s accounting policies, which are described in note 1, the directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods, if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements in applying the Company’s accounting policies
There were no critical judgements that the directors have made in the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies that have  
had a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the historical financial information. Those involving estimations are dealt with 
separately below.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have  
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year,  
are discussed below.
Carrying value of investments
Determining whether an investment is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the investment. The value in use calculation 
requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise, and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.

8. Other reserves

9. Restatement
Cambian Group plc acquired Cambian Capital Limited, Care Aspirations Capital Limited and Advanced Childcare Capital Limited and their 
underlying subsidiaries on 15 April 2014. The difference between the initial cost of Cambian Group plc’s investments in these subsidiaries 
(determined by reference to their fair value at the date of acquisition) and the nominal value of the shares issued in exchange was initially 
classified as share premium. Following further review and analysis, and as confirmed by external legal and accounting advice, it has been 
determined that this difference of £366.2m should instead have been classified as a merger reserve as required by section 612 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Consequently, the Company has retrospectively restated the equity classification of this £366.2m balance from share 
premium to merger reserve. There are no further adjustments required as a result.
A merger reserve created as a result of a share placement of Cambian Group plc shares in March 2015 that was previously categorised as 
part of other reserves as no separate merger reserve account existed has been reclassified as merger reserve.
