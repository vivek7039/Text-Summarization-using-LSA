STATEMENTS
The Group reported another strong 
performance in 2017 and delivered 
robust underlying growth in more 
confident global economies. The 
Board remains focused on executing 
the Group’s established strategy 
which is designed to deliver strong 
growth in earnings and shareholder 
value over the economic cycle.
The Group has a long track record 
of consistent delivery against its key 
performance metrics by compounding 
stable “GDP plus” underlying growth 
with carefully selected, value enhancing 
acquisitions, funded by the Group’s 
free cash flow. This strategy has been 
successfully designed and executed 
under the outstanding leadership of 
Bruce Thompson since he became 
CEO of Diploma PLC in 1996. Over the 
last 15 years, since emerging from a 
major restructuring of the Group led 
by Bruce, the Group has delivered 
strong double-digit growth in earnings, 
dividends and share price and has 
grown market capitalisation from ca. 
£60m to ca. £1.2bn today, without 
any new equity having been issued. 
In September of this year, the Board 
received notice from Bruce of his 
intention to retire as CEO before the 
end of 30 September 2018. This notice 
period ensures sufficient time to 
complete a thorough search process and 
a smooth transition of responsibilities. 
Bruce will be leaving the Group with a 
clearly defined and sustainable strategy, 
with a substantial runway for future 
growth and an experienced senior

Results
Group revenues increased in 2017 by 
18% to £451.9m (2016: £382.6m), with 
the Group’s results again boosted by 
currency effects from translating the 
results of the overseas businesses, 
following the substantial depreciation 
in UK sterling. After adjusting for the 
contribution from acquisitions completed 
both this year and last year, net of a small 
disposal and for these currency effects on 
translation, Group revenues increased by 
7% on an underlying basis. The Controls 
businesses delivered robust underlying 
revenue growth of 14% and both the Life 
Sciences and Seals businesses reported 
a 4% growth in underlying revenues.
Adjusted operating profit increased by 
19% to £78.2m (2016: £65.7m) reflecting 
the strong growth in revenues and a 
small increase of 10bps in adjusted 
operating margins to 17.3% (2016: 17.2%). 
Adjusted profit before tax increased 
by 19% to £77.5m (2016: £64.9m) and 
adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”) also 
increased by 19% to 49.8p (2016: 41.9p).
The Group’s free cash flow remained 
robust at £55.7m (2016: £59.0m) as 
working capital increased by £4.0m 
to support the stronger trading 
environment across the Group. Last year’s 
free cash flow included an inflow of £6.3m 
from reduced working capital and £4.6m 
of cash realised on the sale of assets. 
Capital expenditure of £3.3m (2016: £3.7m) 
remained at a similar level to last year. 
The Group has invested ca. £90m 
over three years in acquiring value 
enhancing businesses. However, 
expenditure on acquisitions slowed 
this year to £20.1m (2016: £32.7m) as 
some vendors postponed their exit 
plans in the face of a more favourable 
macroeconomic environment. There are 
still a number of good quality businesses 
in our acquisition pipeline which we 
are confident of completing when the 
vendors are ready to move forward. 
The Group’s balance sheet remains 
robust with cash funds at 30 September 
2017 of £22.3m (2016: £10.6m), after 
investing £20.1m in acquisitions and 
making distributions to shareholders of 
£23.5m (2016: £21.0m). The Group also 
has renewed committed bank facilities 
of £30m with an accordion option to 
extend these facilities up to £60m. 
Dividends
The combination of strong results and 
free cash flow, supported by a robust 
balance sheet has led the Board to 
recommend an increase in the final 
dividend of 16% to 16.0p per share 
(2016: 13.8p). Subject to shareholder 
approval at the Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”), this dividend will be paid on 
24 January 2018 to shareholders on 
the register at 1 December 2017.
The total dividend per share for the 
year will be 23.0p (2016: 20.0p) which 
represents a 15% increase on 2016. 
With underlying adjusted earnings 
increasing by 19%, the level of 
dividend cover increases slightly to 
2.2 times on an adjusted EPS basis, 
from 2.1 times in recent years.
Governance
The Board’s Committees, led by the 
non-Executive Directors, have had 
a productive year. Anne Thorburn 
led the Audit Committee through 
an audit tender process which in 
September resulted in a proposal to 
appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
as Company and Group auditor from 
next year. Andy Smith has also led the 
Remuneration Committee through 
a thorough review of the Company’s 
Remuneration Policy, in advance of the 
triennial vote by shareholders at the 
AGM on 17 January 2018. I have worked 
closely with Charles Packshaw as Senior 
Independent Director and with the 
Nomination Committee to commence 
a search for a new CEO to lead the 
Group, following the intended retirement 
of Bruce Thompson later in 2018.
 
Employees
Our employees remain our most 
important asset and their hard work 
continues to be a driving force behind 
our consistent and strong performance. 
Diploma is very much a people business 
and success is always a team effort. 
I wish to thank all of our employees 
for their support and contribution to 
the success of the Group this year.
Outlook
Diploma reported another strong 
performance in 2017, delivering 
strong double-digit growth in 
revenue and earnings. All of the 
Group’s Sectors contributed to this 
growth with a particularly strong 
performance from Controls. 
 
Principal corporate  
objectives
Achieve double-
digit growth in 
adjusted EPS over 
the business cycle
Generate TSR 
growth in the  
upper quartile of 
the FTSE 250
Deliver progressive 
dividend growth 
with two times

The Group’s performance in 2017 
provides confidence in the Group’s 
prospects for solid underlying growth in 
the year ahead, which we aim to enhance 
by unlocking value enhancing acquisition 
opportunities. With a proven business 
model, broad geographic spread of 
businesses, robust balance sheet and 
consistently strong free cash flow, the 
Board is confident that further progress 
will be made in the next financial year. 04 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017

STRATEGIC REPORT
STATEMENTS
Group strategy 
The Group’s “compounding” strategy 
is designed to generate strong growth 
in earnings and shareholder value 
over the business cycle, while building 
larger, broader-based businesses 
in the three Group Sectors of Life 
Sciences, Seals and Controls. 
The businesses target stable “GDP 
plus” underlying revenue growth over 
the business cycle with sustainable 
attractive margins and then convert 
the profit into strong free cash flow by 
tightly managing working capital and 
focused capital investments. The free 
cash flow generated then funds healthy 
growing dividends and selective value 
enhancing acquisitions which accelerate 
growth in revenues and profit to double-
digit levels. The strategy consistently 
delivers a return in excess of 20% 
pre-tax on total capital invested and 
steadily increasing shareholder value.
Business model and KPIs
Stable and resilient “GDP plus” underlying 
revenue growth is achieved through 
our focus on essential products and 
services funded by customers’ operating 
rather than capital budgets and supplied 
across a range of specialised industry 
segments. By supplying essential 
solutions, not just products, we build 
strong long term relationships with our 
customers and suppliers, which support 
sustainable and attractive margins. 
Finally, we encourage an entrepreneurial 
culture in our businesses through our 
decentralised management structure. 
These essential values ensure that 
decisions are made close to the customer 
and that the businesses are agile and 
responsive to changes in the market 
and the competitive environment.
The key performance indicators (“KPIs”) 
we use to measure the success of the 
business model relate to recurring 
income and stable underlying revenue 
growth, sustainable and attractive 
margins and organisational health. 
This year, underlying revenue growth, 
after adjusting for currency movements 
and acquisitions, has been a robust 7% 
with the growth rate strengthening in 
the second half of the year. Over five 
years, the average underlying revenue 
growth has been 5% p.a. which meets 
the Group’s target of “GDP plus” growth.
Adjusted operating margins improved 
this year by 10bps to 17.3% of revenue, 
as transactional currency pressures 
eased during the year in the Healthcare 
businesses and improved operating 
leverage with tight control of operating 
costs has offset other pressures on 
gross margins. Over five years the 
average adjusted operating margin 
has been ca. 18% against the Group’s 
medium term target of 18–19%.
The agility and responsiveness of the 
organisation is more difficult to measure 
directly, but non-financial KPIs can 
give an indication of the organisational 
health. The number of working days 
lost to sickness has consistently been 
only ca. 1% a year and over the last five 
years, the average length of service for all 
employees has been ca. 6.5 years (ca. 11 
years for the senior management cadre).
Building larger , 
broader-based 
businesses
The Group’s strategy , 
consistently applied, delivers 
strong growth in earnings 
and shareholder value.
Bruce Thompson, Chief Executive Officer
Chief Executive’s Review 07 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Financial performance
In 2017, the Group delivered strong 
double-digit growth in revenue and 
earnings with robust underlying 
growth, a modest net contribution 
from acquisitions and further 
benefiting from the strong tailwind 
from the depreciation in UK sterling.
The Group’s reported revenues 
increased by 18%, with currency 
movements increasing revenues by 
9% and acquisitions contributing a 
further 2% to the revenue growth, 
net of a small prior year disposal. 
On an underlying basis, after 
adjusting for acquisitions and for 
currency effects on translation, 
Group revenues increased by 7%. 
Group adjusted operating margins 
improved by 10bps to 17.3%, 
compared with 17.2% in the prior full 
year and the first half of the current 
year. Management gross margins have 
reduced overall by 60bps with margin 
pressures in several businesses from a 
combination of the impact on product 
costs from currency movements and 
increases in other margin support 
costs. These pressures have been 
partly mitigated by the stronger 
gross margins in recent acquisitions 
and transactional currency pressures 
in the Healthcare businesses have 
eased during the year. Operating 
costs as a percentage of revenue 
have reduced by 70bps with improved 
operating leverage from the 
increase in revenues and generally 
tight control of operating costs. 
Working capital as a percentage of 
revenue was managed down through 
the year to 15.0%, although the 
Group’s free cash flow reduced by 
6% to £55.7m, reflecting the absence 
of prior year proceeds from one-off 
property sales and the divestment 
of the Medivators business. 
Sector performance
In Life Sciences, underlying revenues 
increased by 4% after adjusting 
for currency movements, the 
acquisition of Abacus and the prior 
year disposal of the Medivators 
business. The Healthcare businesses 
benefited from stronger capital 
revenues as new technology was 
introduced and delayed projects 
were reactivated in the laboratory 
diagnostic sector. The Environmental 
businesses delivered steady growth in 
instrumentation sales and increasing 
service contract revenues. 
In Seals, underlying revenues 
increased by 4% after adjusting 
for currency movements and the 
acquisitions of PSP and Edco. In 
North America, the improving trend in 
industrial activity seen in the second 
quarter, following the US election, 
strengthened further as the year 
progressed. In the International Seals 
businesses, strong growth in the UK 
and Scandinavia was offset by more 
challenging market conditions in 
Switzerland, Russia and Australia. 
In Controls, underlying revenues 
increased by 14% after adjusting for 
currency movements and the prior 
year acquisitions of Cablecraft and 
Ascome. The Specialty Fasteners 
business increased revenues strongly, 
driven principally by a ramp-up in 
demand from customers in the Civil 
Aerospace sector. The Interconnect 
and Fluid Controls businesses also 
delivered good growth benefiting from 
increased project work and targeted 
investment in sales resources.
Acquisitions and disposals
Over the last three years, a total 
of ca. £90m has been invested in 
acquisitions which contributed ca. 
16% of 2017 Group revenues. 
During 2017, total acquisition spend 
was ca. £20m, of which ca. £15m 
was invested in the acquisition of 
Abacus, a long established supplier 
of diagnostics instrumentation and 
consumables to the Pathology and 
Life Sciences sectors in Australia and 
New Zealand. Abacus adds critical 
mass to our existing Healthcare 
businesses in the region and opens 
up new growth opportunities. 
In addition, two smaller bolt-on 
acquisitions were completed in the 
Seals Sector during the year – PSP 
in the US and Edco in the UK. After 
the year end, a small acquisition was 
completed in the Controls Sector 
of Coast Fabrication Inc. (“Coast”), 
a US specialty fastener distributor.
Our Year in Review
Growth strategy and KPIs
Overall growth is accelerated from 
underlying “GDP plus” levels to the 
corporate target of double-digit growth, 
through carefully selected, value 
enhancing acquisitions which fit the 
business model and offer entry into 
new but related strategic markets. 
Acquisitions are not made just to add 
revenue and profit, but rather to bring 
into the Group successful businesses 
which have growth potential, capable 
management and a good track record of 
profitable growth and cash generation. 
As part of our Acquire, Build, Grow 
strategy, we invest in the businesses 
post-acquisition to build a firm foundation 
to allow them to move to a new level of 
growth and improve operating margins. 
These acquisitions form a critical part 
of our Sector growth strategies and are 
designed to generate a pre-tax return 
on investment of at least 20% and 
hence support our Group objectives 
for return on total investment. 
Again we measure the success of the 
growth strategy with KPIs, the first of 
which is acquisition spend. To achieve the 
Group’s objective of strong double-digit 
growth, acquisition spend of at least £30m 
p.a. is targeted, though year on year spend 
will vary with the acquisition environment. 
This year, the Group invested ca. £20m 
in acquisitions, bringing the total over 
three years to ca. £90m. The acquisitions 
completed over the last three years have 
contributed ca. 16% of 2017 revenues. 
Strong cash flow funds our growth 
strategy (and supports healthy, growing 
dividends) and tight management of 
working capital maximises the conversion 
of profit to cash flow. This year, working 
capital has been managed down to 
a record low of 15.0% of revenue, 
generating free cash flow of £55.7m 
and representing a conversion rate of 
99% of adjusted post tax earnings. Over 
five years, the average working capital 
to revenue ratio has been 16–17% and 
average free cash flow has been £45m p.a. 
with an average conversion ratio of 98%.
The Group’s return on total investment 
measure is the pre-tax return on adjusted 
trading capital employed, excluding 
net cash, but including all goodwill and 
acquired intangible assets (“ROATCE”). 
This is used to measure the overall 
performance of the Group and very 
importantly, our success in creating value 
for shareholders through our acquisition 
programme. Over the last five years, 
ROATCE has comfortably exceeded the 
20% target and this year was 24.0%. 08 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT
STATEMENTS
Chief Executive’s Review  
continued
Building management 
strength
Essential values and culture
We encourage an entrepreneurial 
culture across our businesses, through 
a decentralised management structure. 
In specialised distribution businesses 
it is essential that decisions are made 
close to the customer and that the 
businesses are agile and responsive to 
changes in the market and competitive 
environment. The success of the 
Group is therefore built upon strong, 
self-standing management teams 
in the operating businesses who are 
committed to and rewarded according 
to the success of their businesses.
This culture is very attractive to 
managers who join the Group in 
acquired businesses and who are 
used to a similar culture in their 
privately owned businesses. 
Managing business clusters
We also recognise that there are 
significant synergy benefits which 
can be achieved through managing 
clusters of similar businesses. Typically 
these synergies come in the form 
of cross-selling and joint purchasing 
between the businesses and shared 
back office functions. There are 
also best practices which can be 
shared within the clusters in areas 
such as IT and digital capabilities.
We have therefore introduced small 
senior teams to manage the business 
clusters in each Sector, while being 
careful not to allow the build-up of 
heavy divisional structures with their 
associated costs and bureaucracy. 
This ensures that we gain the 
benefits of scale while retaining 
agility in the operating businesses.
These senior management teams 
are responsible for maximising the 
potential of their business clusters and 
also for identifying and progressing 
acquisition opportunities.
Executive Management Group
As the Group grows larger and 
becomes more broadly spread both 
geographically and operationally, it 
is important that we have in place a 
strong and broad based executive 
management team to drive the next 
stage of the Group’s growth strategy.
The Executive Management Group 
(“EMG”) was established in 2016, 
comprising the Executive Directors 
along with the executive managers who 
are responsible for the major business 
clusters and key Group functions. The 
EMG members are a combination of 
internally developed managers and 
experienced senior managers who 
have been recruited externally. 
The EMG provides the opportunity for its 
members to broaden their perspective 
of the Group’s activities in order to 
reinforce the key elements of the Group’s 
culture and to identify best practices 
which are transferable across the Group. 
The EMG meets quarterly through a 
combination of full group meetings 
in London and sub-group meetings 
held in the major business locations. 
The EMG provides the senior 
management bench strength to 
manage a growing and broadly spread 
Group while laying the groundwork for 
succession in key executive positions. 09 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Capital Markets Day
In February 2017, the Group hosted a 
Capital Markets Day (“CMD”) in London, 
exactly five years to the day after the 
previous CMD held in February 2012.
There were four key objectives for 
the day:
1. Five-year track record – to show the 
Group’s progress over the last five 
years in executing its strategy and 
delivering strong growth in earnings 
and shareholder value.
2. Resilience and sustainable margins 
– to demonstrate the resilience of the 
Group’s businesses and the high 
barriers to entry which protect the 
Group’s stable and attractive margins.
3. Runway for growth – to give 
confidence in the substantial further 
“runway for growth” over the next five 
years, through a combination of stable 
underlying growth and value 
enhancing acquisitions.
4. Senior management bench strength 
– to introduce the strong and 
experienced senior management team 
which is in place to drive the next 
phase of the Group’s development.
The first objective was achieved in 
an introductory presentation and 
animation video which summarised the 
development of the Group over the five 
years, with strong double-digit growth 
in adjusted EPS, TSR and dividends and 
an increase in market capitalisation 
from ca. £400m to ca. £1.2bn.
The other three objectives were 
achieved in break-out sessions for each

Essential Solutions
Essential Values
Essential Products
What we put in What we get out How we have made progress
Essential Products
Our businesses focus on supplying essential products 
and services funded by customers’ operating rather 
than capital budgets and supplied across a range of 
specialised industry segments.
The majority of the Group’s revenues are generated 
from consumable products. In many cases, the 
products will be used in repair and maintenance 
applications and refurbishment and upgrade 
programmes, rather than supplied to original 
equipment manufacturers.
Recurring income and stable revenue growth
Our focus on essential products and services 
contributes to the Group’s record of stable revenue 
growth over the business cycle.
Our businesses target GDP plus levels of underlying 
revenue growth, over the economic cycle, with higher 
growth rates achieved at the Group level through 
carefully selected value enhancing acquisitions.
Performance is measured by the underlying growth in 
revenue, after adjusting for currency and acquisitions:
• This year, the underlying growth has been +7%.
• Over five years, the average has been +5% p.a..
For more information
See page 15
Essential Solutions
Our businesses design their individual business 
models to provide solutions which closely meet 
the requirements of their customers:
• Highly responsive customer service, such as the 
next day delivery from stock of essential, but low 
value items.
• Deep technical support, where we work closely with 
our customers in designing our products into their 
specific applications.
• Added value services which, if we did not provide 
these services, customers would have to pay others 
to provide them or would require them to invest in 
additional resources of their own.
Sustainable and attractive margins
By supplying solutions, not just products, we build 
strong long term relationships with our customers and 
suppliers, supporting sustainable and attractive margins.
Our businesses achieve sustainable and attractive 
gross margins by offering strongly differentiated 
products and customer focused solutions within 
specialised market segments. By running efficient 
operations, these gross margins are converted into 
healthy operating margins.
Performance is measured by the level and stability over 
time of gross and operating margins:
• Gross margins have remained broadly stable over many 
years, excluding shorter term currency effects. 
• This year, adjusted operating margin improved 10bps 
to 17.3%.
• Over five years, the average adjusted operating margin 
has been 18%.
For more information
See page 15
Essential Values
We encourage an entrepreneurial culture  
across our businesses, through a decentralised 
management structure. 
We want the managers to feel that they have the 
freedom to run their own businesses, while being 
able to draw upon the support and resources of 
a larger group where this is beneficial.
Within our businesses we have strong, self-standing 
management teams who are committed to and 
rewarded according to the success of their businesses.
Agility and responsiveness
Our decentralised organisational model ensures that 
decisions are made close to the customer and that the 
businesses are agile and responsive to changes in the 
market and the competitive environment.
Agility and responsiveness in the businesses ensure 
close management of operating costs and working 
capital and deliver strong free cash flow.
Performance is more difficult to measure directly, but 
non-financial KPIs can give an indication of organisational 
stability and health. Over the last five years:
• Average length of service for all employees has been  
ca. 6.5 years (ca. 11 years for the senior management cadre).
• Number of working days lost to sickness has consistently 
been only ca. 1% a year.

What we put in What we get out How we have made progress
Acquire
Clear business criteria have been established to guide 
the Group’s acquisition programme:
• fit with the Group’s business model;
• marketing led with strong customer relationships;
• secure supply of high quality, differentiated 
products; and
• capable management.
The principal financial criteria are:
• Track record of stable, profitable growth and  
cash generation.
• Exceed post-tax IRR threshold of 13% to ensure 
20%+ pre-tax return on investment.
Acquisitions give entry into new but related markets and thereby 
extend the reach of the existing businesses and bring new 
growth opportunities.
The Group applies a consistent level of effort and resources to 
identifying and developing acquisition opportunities. However, 
the output in terms of acquisitions completed, ebbs and flows 
depending on the acquisition environment. 
To achieve the Group’s objective of strong double-digit growth, 
acquisition spend of at least £30m p.a. is targeted. 
Abacus
In April 2017, the DHG group acquired Abacus, 
a long established supplier of specialised diagnostic 
instrumentation and consumables in Australia and 
New Zealand. Abacus has a good fit with our existing  
DS business, adds attractive product lines, critical  
mass and economies of scale in Clinical Diagnostics  
and gives entry to new segments within the broader 
Healthcare and Life Sciences sectors.
For more information
See pages 18–19
Build
The acquisitions we make are of businesses which  
are already successful and with a good track record. 
However, these businesses have typically reached the 
point where additional resources are needed to take 
them to the next level of growth.
Working with the management, we provide the 
investment required to build a solid foundation to  
allow the business to move to a new level of growth. 
The investment we make in new acquisitions will 
normally be in new facilities and IT systems, increased 
but better managed working capital and additional 
management resource.
Except in the case of smaller bolt-on acquisitions, the acquired 
companies maintain their distinct sales and marketing identity 
and strong independent management teams. 
Where there are opportunities for synergies with other Group 
businesses, these are managed in larger business clusters. 
Synergies typically include:
 Cross-selling between the businesses
 Joint purchasing between the businesses
  Shared operational infrastructure and shared back-office 
functions 
US Industrial OEM Seals
In the second half of this year, a senior leadership team 
was established to manage the cluster of Industrial OEM 
Seals businesses in the US. While maintaining the distinct 
identities of the businesses and close local contact with 
the customers, key functions including Sales, Supply 
chain, Technical and Finance will be managed centrally by 
this team. Investment will also be made in implementing 
a new ERP system to replace the disparate legacy 
IT systems. 
For more information
See pages 22–23
Grow
Once the acquisition is integrated into the Group, with 
a solid platform established, the focus is on delivering 
stable, profitable growth.
The results of the Acquire, Build, Grow strategy can be 
seen in the improving revenue growth and operating 
margins post acquisition.
By the third year post-acquisition, underlying revenue growth  
for the acquired businesses is typically higher than the Group 
average and operating margins have improved by 200–300bps 
on average.
These improvements in financial performance ensure that the 
Group creates value through its acquisition programme and 
maintains ROATCE above the 20% threshold. 
Cablecraft
Cablecraft, in only its second year as part of the Group, 
is already showing the benefits of investments made 
post-acquisition in increasing management and sales 
resources, expanding e-commerce capabilities and 
refurbishing facilities. 
Under the continued strong leadership of one of the former 
owners, Cablecraft has increased revenues in 2017 by 7% 
on a like-for-like basis and has improved operating margins 
by ca. 300bps.

SECTOR REVIEW
Life Sciences
The Life Sciences Sector 
businesses supply a 
range of consumables, 
instrumentation and 
related services to the 
Healthcare and 
Environmental industries.
Healthcare 
The Diploma Healthcare Group (“DHG”) 
operates in three principal geographies 
– Canada, Australasia and Europe. In 
Canada, DHG supplies to the ca. 600 
public hospitals across the country as 
well as to private clinics and pathology 
laboratories. Somagen Diagnostics 
(“Somagen”) supplies a range of 
consumables and instruments used in 
the diagnostic testing of blood, tissue 
and other samples. It is also a leading 
supplier to the growing cancer screening 
and the assisted reproductive technology 
(“ART”) markets. AMT surgical (“AMT”) 
supplies specialised electrosurgery 
equipment and consumables for use 
in hospital operating rooms and is 
also building a portfolio of specialised 
surgical instruments and devices used 
in minimally invasive (“MI”) surgery. 
Vantage Endoscopy (“Vantage”), now 
managed as a separate division within 
AMT, supplies endoscopes and related 
consumables, therapeutic devices 
and services to GI Endoscopy suites in 
hospitals and private clinics. Vantage 
is also expanding its portfolio into the 
Urology and Gynaecology surgical 
segments with rigid and flexible scopes 
and specialised instrument sets. 
In Australia and New Zealand, DHG 
expanded its operations with the 
acquisition in April 2017 of Abacus 
ALS, a long established supplier of 
instrumentation and consumables 
to the Pathology and Life Sciences 
sectors. Abacus ALS is in the process 
of being combined with Diagnostic 
Solutions (“DS”) to form abacus dx, a 
larger, broader based clinical diagnostics 
business supplying to both public 
and private laboratories. Big Green 
Surgical (“BGS”) supplies a range of 
products to the Surgical Products 
sector and shares several common 
suppliers with AMT in Canada. 
In Europe, DHG operates through 
Technopath Distribution (“TPD”), an 
established supplier of products to the 
Biotechnology, Clinical Laboratory and 
Medical Device markets in Ireland and the 
UK. Similar to the other DHG businesses, 
TPD focuses on specialised laboratory 
diagnostics and specialty medical 
device segments, again leveraging 
a number of common suppliers.
Environmental 
The a1-group is a supplier to 
Environmental testing laboratories 
and to Health & Safety engineers. The 
a1-envirosciences business, based in 
Germany, supplies a range of specialised 
environmental analysers and a range 
of containment enclosures for potent 
powder handling. The a1-CBISS business, 
based in the UK, supplies equipment and 
services for the monitoring and control 
of environmental emissions, as well 
as a range of gas detection devices.
Market drivers 
The DHG businesses in Canada supply 
into areas of Healthcare which are 
predominantly public sector funded. 
Private sector funding, representing 
ca. 30% of Healthcare expenditure in 
Canada, is largely focused on areas where 
DHG do not participate, specifically 
dental, cosmetic and eye surgery and 
pharmaceuticals. The principal demand 
driver for DHG in Canada is therefore the 
sustainable level of Healthcare spending 
funded by the Canadian Government.
The Canadian Health Act (“the Act”) 
ensures universal coverage for all 
insured persons for all medically 
necessary services provided by hospitals, 
physicians and other Healthcare 
providers. A growing, ageing and well 
educated population demands high 
standards of service delivery, helping 
to ensure ongoing growing demand. 
The Provinces are responsible for the 
delivery of the Healthcare services, 
but the Federal Government partially 
controls delivery through Federal 
Provincial transfer payments, which 
represent the largest source of revenues 
for the Provinces. The relative stability 
and consistency in funding by each of 
the Provinces, guaranteed through the 
Act, ensures that the market remains 
well funded through the economic 
cycle and current expenditure of

10.3% of GDP (11.1% including capital 
expenditure) places Canada in the 
top 20% of OECD countries. 
Over many years, Healthcare expenditure 
has grown steadily with annual variations 
mostly dependent on the periodic 
additional tranches of funding provided 
by individual Provinces. In periods 
when the economy has been slower, 
Healthcare funding has still shown 
positive growth, albeit at reduced levels. 
In 2016, public Healthcare spending 
in Canada was ca. C$160bn, with 
the largest category of expenditure 
(C$65bn) being in the hospital sector. 
The Healthcare market in Australia 
shares with Canada many of the same 
attractive characteristics for specialised 
distribution. While privately funded 
Healthcare is more prevalent in areas 
such as surgery and laboratory testing, 
public sector Healthcare funding is 
still large and supported by a stable, 
resource based economy. As with 
Canada, Australia has a large geography 
to be covered, low population density 
and purchasing processes that vary by 
State. These characteristics necessarily 
demand a significant investment by 
manufacturers in technical sales and 
service resource which makes the 
specialised local distribution model 
a very attractive mechanism for 
manufacturers to serve the local markets. 
Since 2013, the Canadian and Australian 
economies have come under significant 
pressure from the falling oil price and 
reduced demand for the countries’ 
natural resources. This tougher economic 
environment has resulted in greater 
pressure on budgets throughout the 
Healthcare systems in both countries. 
In such periods, Healthcare funding is 
tightly constrained through targeted 
controls imposed on the number 
of laboratory tests and operating 
procedures as well as more rigorous 
tendering and Group procurement 
processes for expenditure on capital 
equipment. Even with such pressures, 
however, Healthcare funding has shown 
positive growth in total Healthcare 
expenditure of 2–3% and 4–5% 
respectively in Canada and Australia.
The principal market driver for the 
TPD business is Healthcare funding 
in the UK and Ireland, which totals 
ca. £200bn, representing ca. 10% of 
combined GDP. The UK accounts for 
ca. 90% of the total funding and ca. 
80% is provided by public funding and 
20% by private funding. Following the 
2009 recession, annual growth in UK 
Healthcare expenditure has slowed to 
low single-digit levels, compared with 
average growth of 8% p.a. over the 
previous decade. In Ireland, Healthcare 
expenditure saw reductions year-on-year 
in 2010 and 2011, since when growth has 
resumed again at low single digit levels.
The a1-group supplies to customers 
in the Environmental industry in 
the UK, Germany and France. The 
market demand is largely driven by 
Environmental and Health & Safety 
regulations and growth in recent years 
has been driven by the need to be 
compliant with a range of EU regulations. 
Since market demand is driven by 
regulation, this ensures reasonably 
steady demand for essential consumable 
products and services, though customers 
may defer capital expenditure during 
significant downturns in the economy.

SECTOR REVIEW
Life Sciences
Sector performance
Reported revenues of the Life Sciences 
businesses increased by 15% to £125.9m 
(2016: £109.9m). The acquisition of 
Abacus ALS (“Abacus”), acquired in 
April 2017, added £7.6m or 7% to Sector 
revenues, but this was offset by the 
prior year disposal of the Medivators 
business. Currency movements, 
on translation of the results from 
overseas businesses to UK sterling, 
contributed a further 11% to Sector 
revenues. After adjusting for currency, 
the acquisition and the disposal, 
underlying revenues increased by 4%.
Sector adjusted operating margins 
improved by 70bps benefiting from a 
combination of stronger gross margins 
in Abacus and from reduced operating 
costs following the consolidation of the 
AMT and Vantage business operations 
into one facility at the beginning of the 
year. Transactional currency pressures 
on the Healthcare businesses also eased 
towards the end of the year, following 
a number of years when gross margins 
were significantly impacted by the 
progressive depreciation of the Canadian 
and Australian dollars relative to the 
US dollar and Euro. Operating margins 
also strengthened in the Environmental 
businesses, with an increase in gross 
margins and with improved leverage 
from the increased revenues. Sector 
adjusted operating profits increased 
by 19% to £23.3m (2016: £19.6m).
The Life Sciences businesses invested 
£2.0m in new capital during the year 
(2016: £1.9m) of which £1.6m (2016: 
£0.9m) was spent on acquiring field 
equipment for both new placements in 
hospitals and laboratories and for loan 
equipment and demonstration models 
to support existing placements. The 
increase in spend on field equipment 
was largely driven by the launch of 
a new series of flexible endoscopes, 
together with the addition of a range 
of rigid endoscopes under a new 
supplier agreement. A further £0.3m 
was invested, in part on the AMT/
Vantage facility consolidation and in 
part on the general IT infrastructure of 
the Life Sciences businesses. Free cash 
flow reduced to £17.0m (2016: £19.0m), 
reflecting the slightly higher working 
capital in the Healthcare businesses; 
although last year’s free cash flow 
also included £2.2m received on the 
disposal of the Medivators business.
Healthcare
The DHG group of Healthcare businesses, 
which account for 84% of Life Sciences 
revenues, increased underlying revenues 
by 4% after adjusting for currency, 
the acquisition of Abacus and the 
disposal of the Medivators business.
In Canada, underlying revenues increased 
by 6% against the background of 
continuing budget pressures throughout 
the Provincial healthcare systems, 
but with strong capital revenues as 
new technology was introduced and 
delayed projects were reactivated in 
the diagnostic laboratory sector.
Somagen’s core Clinical Diagnostics 
business in Canada delivered an increase 
of 10% in revenues, with steady growth 
in consumable and service revenues 
boosted by strong growth in capital 
revenues. Demand for diagnostic 
testing remained robust, particularly 
with the growth of cancer screening 
tests and related diagnostics and capital 
revenues increased strongly with new 
technology introduced in the areas of 
Allergy, Autoimmunity and Histology. 
Capital revenues also benefited from 
some relaxation in the policy of regional 
consolidation of diagnostic laboratories 
in Quebec despite the continued drive 
for cost savings and efficiencies within 
many public medical laboratories.
AMT and Vantage were combined into 
a single, more efficient Surgical and GI 
specialty medical device business in 
Canada following the disposal of the 
Medivators business in September 
last year. Warehousing, logistics 
and back office functions have been 
integrated within AMT’s facility in 
Kitchener, which has provided good 
opportunities for operational leverage

Potential for growth
Increase share of specialised 
segments of Healthcare 
markets in Canada, 
Australia and UK/Ireland
Leverage product portfolio 
across existing businesses 
and extend into other 
medical disciplines
Pursue further acquisition 
opportunities in Europe 
and Asia-Pacific
Continue to develop product 
and geographic spread of 
Environmental businesses
from the increased scale of the combined 
business. In its core electrosurgery 
business, AMT continued to face 
pricing pressures from the tender 
and evaluation processes introduced 
by shared service organisations and 
national group purchasing organisations 
(“GPOs”). These pricing pressures will 
continue to be a factor as the GPOs 
continue to consolidate in Canada. 
However, AMT was able to maintain 
revenues by increasing sales of 
specialised surgical instruments and 
devices used in laparoscopic and 
other MI surgical procedures.
Vantage, operating now as a division 
of AMT, increased revenues in its 
core GI/endoscopy product lines and 
successfully launched a new series of 
flexible endoscopes with significantly 
improved light imaging performance 
and higher reliability. Vantage also 
secured the exclusive distribution 
rights for a premium range of rigid 
and flexible endoscopes and surgical 
instrument sets, which give entry into 
the Urology and Gynaecology segments 
and provide further opportunities for 
growth in the Surgical products sector.
In Australia, the Healthcare sector in 
recent years has experienced similar 
healthcare budget pressures to Canada, 
but has the added capacity of private 
Healthcare spending to offset some 
of the economic constraints. Against 
this background, the BGS and DS 
businesses have increased revenues 
by 4% in local currency terms. BGS 
increased revenues by 8%, with smoke 
evacuation programmes in existing 
and new accounts continuing to be 
the principal driver to growth. DS also 
delivered modest revenue growth, with 
strong sales of Protein Electrophoresis 
consumables following a number of 
capital placements during the prior year.
In April 2017, DHG completed the 
acquisition of Abacus, a long established 
supplier of diagnostics instrumentation 
and consumables to the Pathology and 
Life Sciences sectors in Australia and 
New Zealand. Abacus supplies to the 
large private laboratories that dominate 
the Clinical Diagnostic services industry 
in the region as well as supplying 
direct to certain hospitals and to the 
regional laboratory service groups that 
support hospital testing in the various 
States. Abacus has particular strengths 
in Immunology and Biochemistry 
testing and also is developing a 
niche specialty Patient Simulation 
business in the Australian market.
Abacus has very complementary 
clinical diagnostics products to the DS 
business and these two businesses 
are now in the process of being 
integrated to form abacus dx, a larger 
broader-based Clinical Diagnostics, 
Life Science and Patient Simulation 
business, supplying to both the public 
and private pathology laboratories, 
and to research and educational 
institutions across Australasia.
The TPD business in Ireland and the UK 
reported revenues broadly flat in Euro 
terms, with business transacted in UK 
sterling (ca. 40% of revenues) impacted 
by the weaker currency. TPD continued 
to achieve steady growth in supplying 
clinical chemistry and serology products 
used to control quality in Clinical 
Diagnostics laboratories. TPD also 
delivered revenue growth in specialty 
medical devices used in digestive health 
and rapid microbial testing products 
used in industrial laboratories. However, 
revenues reduced in the water testing 
and interventional cardiology segments 
as certain suppliers moved from 
specialised distribution to a direct supply 
model. TPD is introducing a number of 
new suppliers and products to replace 
these revenues and it is broadening its 
service capability beyond diagnostic 
instrumentation to extend into the blood 
services sector. TPD has also established 
a new Surgical Products division to bring 
to market the electrosurgical and smoke 
evacuation products similarly supplied by 
AMT and BGS in Canada and Australia.
Environmental
The a1-group of Environmental 
businesses in Europe, which account 
for 16% of Life Sciences revenues, 
saw revenues increase by 9% in 
UK sterling terms and 3% growth 
in constant currency terms.
The a1-envirosciences business based 
in Germany increased revenues by 3% 
in Euro terms against a strong prior year 
comparative, which had benefited from 
a large mercury detector order. Revenue 
from high-end trace and elemental 
analysers used in the Environmental 
and Petrochemical industries delivered 
good growth, with the second half 
of the year being particularly strong 
in the UK and the Benelux region. 
Service revenue continued to grow 
with the larger installed base and 
with increasing demand from the 
larger customers for faster response 
times. Demand for containment 
enclosures for the safe weighing of 
hazardous materials remains robust.
The a1-CBISS business based in the UK 
increased revenues by 2% with continued 
growth in the installation of continuous 
emissions monitoring systems (“CEMS”) 
and increased service contract revenues 
from CEMS projects delivered in the last 
18 months. The sector remains buoyant 
with new Energy from Waste (“EFW”) 
plants playing an important role in 
reducing landfill waste. The gas detection 
sector has started to see increased 
demand from Oil & Gas customers for 
single-use gas detection tubes after a 
number of years of lower activity levels. 20 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017

SECTOR REVIEW
Seals
The Seals Sector 
businesses supply a range 
of seals, gaskets, filters, 
cylinders, components and 
kits used in heavy mobile 
machinery and specialised 
industrial equipment.
North America 
The Aftermarket businesses in North 
America supply sealing and associated 
products to support a broad range of 
mobile machinery in applications which 
include Heavy Construction, Mining, 
Logging, Agriculture, Material Handling 
(lift trucks, fork lifts and dump trucks) 
and Refuse Collection. The products 
are generally supplied on a next day 
delivery basis and are used in the repair 
and maintenance of equipment after it 
has completed its initial warranty period 
or lease term, or has been sold on the 
pre-used market. The main customers 
are machinery and cylinder repair shops, 
engine and transmission rebuilders and 
other heavy equipment parts distributors.
The Industrial OEM businesses in 
North America supply seals, gaskets, 
O-rings and custom moulded and 
machined parts to a range of Industrial 
OEM customers. The businesses work 
closely with customers to select the 
most appropriate seal design, material 
and manufacturer for the application, 
provide technical support and guidance 
during the product development process 
and deliver the logistics capabilities to 
supply from inventory to support small 
to medium sized production runs.
International 
The International Seals businesses 
outside North America supply a range 
of seals, gaskets, filters, custom 
moulded and machined parts and 
hydraulic cylinder components to 
both Aftermarket and Industrial OEM 
customers. The businesses also supply 
products to end users operating process 
plants within the Mining, Oil & Gas, 
Pharmaceutical, Chemical, Food and 
Energy sectors, where products are 
required to support Maintenance, Repair 
and Overhaul (“MRO”) operations.
Market drivers – North America
In the Aftermarket businesses in North 
America, the principal drivers are the 
general GDP growth and in particular, 
activity and spending levels in the 
Heavy Construction and Infrastructure 
sectors. In 2017, the US economy is 
forecast to show annual GDP growth 
of 2.2% (2016: 1.6%) driven primarily 
by strong consumer spending and 
growth in business investments. 
Total US Construction spend (including 
non-residential and infrastructure spend, 
as well as residential housing activity) 
has continued to rise through 2017. 
Unit sales in the US of Construction 
Equipment (defined as heavy mobile 
equipment including excavators 
above 14 tonnes, crawler dozers and 
wheeled loaders) is important as a 
medium term indicator for Hercules’ 
replacement hydraulic seals activities, 
as the new equipment will move out 
of the dealer warranty period in the 
following years. It is also a good short 
term indicator for the HKX attachment 
kit business. During 2016 and the 
first half of 2017, the demand for new 
equipment declined as the general 
mobile machinery population is relatively 
new and contractors continue to opt 
for the rental model for their equipment 
needs; rental fleet utilisation rates have 
increased by ca. 10% year over year. 
In Canada, 2017 GDP growth is forecast 
to increase to 3% (2016: 1.5%) as a 
stronger economy and stable oil prices 
are expected to lead to expanding 
exports and stable domestic demand. 
In general, the economic conditions 
in the South and Central American 
economies served by the North 
American Aftermarket businesses 
continue to be challenging.

For the Industrial OEM Seals businesses 
in North America, the principal market 
driver is the growth rate in the general 
industrial economy. US industrial 
production reached a peak at the 
end of calendar year 2014 and then 
declined through 2015 and 2016. In 
2017, the industrial economy returned 
to steady growth as a general rise 
in manufacturing was supported 
by stabilised activity within the 
Mining and Oil & Gas segments.
Market drivers – International
The International Seals businesses 
operate in a range of countries and 
diverse market sectors and each has 
its own specific market drivers. The 
most relevant market drivers and 
indicators are therefore the general 
GDP growth and Industrial sector 
performance for the major geographies 
in which the businesses operate.
In the UK, economic growth is forecast 
to remain broadly flat in 2017 at 
ca. 1.7% (2016: 1.8%). The weakened 
UK sterling is providing short term 
benefits to exporters, but this is offset 
by uncertainty over the terms of any 
future EU trade deal, which has led to 
investment decisions being postponed 
or deferred. The UK Construction sector, 
which drives the Aftermarket business, 
has been steadily growing since mid-
2012, driven mostly by new housing 
work, but began to show signs of a 
slow-down in the second half of FY2017.
In the Nordic region, all countries are 
forecast to show positive GDP growth 
in 2017. Average growth across the 
region is forecast to be ca. 2.5% (2016: 
2.0%) with Sweden forecast to show 
the strongest growth and Finland 
showing good recovery in 2016 and 
2017 after several years of weakness. 
In Switzerland, the economy continued 
to be affected by the strength of the 
Swiss Franc following its decoupling 
from the Euro in 2015, making exports of 
Swiss Industrial products less attractive. 
However, during 2017, the Swiss Franc 
has weakened against the Euro, resulting 
in an increase in Industrial activity. 
In Russia, the impact of low oil prices 
and EU and US sanctions continues to 
hinder economic growth. However, 
the economy is benefiting from a 
stabilisation of oil prices and foreign 
exchange rates and lower levels of 
inflation and, after having contracted 
by 2.8% in 2015 and 0.2% in 2016, GDP 
is forecast to grow by 1.8% in 2017. 
In Australia, industrial activity has been 
adversely affected by the downturn 
in the Mining sector, but the broader 
economy continues to be driven 
by increased public and consumer 
spending. GDP growth is forecast 
to slow to ca. 2.2% in 2017 (2016: 
2.5%), but is forecast to increase in 
2018 supported by the recovery in 
the Mining and Oil & Gas sectors.

SECTOR REVIEW
Seals
Sector performance
Reported revenues of the Seals 
businesses increased by 17% to £195.3m 
(2016: £166.6m), with the acquisitions 
of PSP and Edco completed during 
the year contributing £2.1m or 1% to 
Sector revenues. Currency movements, 
on translation of the results from 
overseas businesses to UK sterling, 
contributed a further 12% to Sector 
revenues. After adjusting for the 
acquisitions and for currency effects, 
underlying revenues increased by 4%. 
Adjusted operating margins for the 
Sector reduced by 60bps to 16.3% 
(2016: 16.9%). Across the businesses, 
gross margins reduced with product 
margins under pressure from supplier 
cost increases, but also reflecting an 
increase in other margin support costs, 
such as freight, discounts and stock 
adjustments. This reduction in gross 
margins was significantly mitigated 
by a combination of tight control over 
operating costs and improved operating 
leverage through increased revenues. 
Adjusted operating profits increased 
by 13% to £31.9m (2016: £28.2m).
During the year, £1.1m (2016: £1.4m) 
of capital expenditure was invested in 
the Seals businesses which included 
£0.6m to fit out new and expanded 
facilities in J Royal, Hercules Canada 
and Kentek. A further £0.2m was spent 
on new warehouse equipment in the 
Industrial OEM businesses, both in the 
US and in Europe and £0.3m was spent in 
connection with a major upgrade to the 
IT facilities in the Hercules businesses. 
The free cash flow generated in this 
Sector was £24.9m, which remained 
unchanged from last year with the 
additional after tax operating cash 
flow offsetting an increase in working 
capital as trading strengthened 
in the second half of the year. 
North American Seals 
The North American Seals businesses, 
which account for 61% of Seals revenues, 
reported revenues up 21% on the prior 
year, benefiting from the weakening 
of UK sterling against the US and 
Canadian dollars and from the small 
bolt-on acquisition of PSP. After excluding 
contributions from the acquired 
businesses and currency effects, 
underlying revenues increased by 6%.
The HFPG Aftermarket businesses 
increased revenues by 5% on a 
constant currency basis, driven by a 
good performance in the core Hercules 
Aftermarket Seals business in the US 
and Canada and a strong recovery in 
the HKX attachment kit business.
In the domestic US market, Hercules 
revenues increased by 5% as utilisation 
of heavy mobile machinery increased 
substantially compared with the previous 
year and expenditure levels in the 
Construction sector showed steady 
growth. The additional investment last 
year in sales and marketing resources 
also had a positive impact on revenues 
and specific growth initiatives continued 
to gain traction, including the focus 
on national accounts and specialty 
distributors. E-commerce continues 
to deliver strong year on year growth 
of ca. 20% p.a. in terms of both 
revenues and invoices processed and 
now accounts for 23% of Hercules 
US revenues. Hercules continues to 
add new products and to expand the 
breadth of equipment supported, with 
the new focus on Bobcat cylinders and 
Aerial Lifts gaining good momentum. 
In Canada, revenues increased by 
5% in local currency terms, with the 
strengthening Construction sector 
driving growth in the repair market and 
good growth in the Manufacturing sector, 
particularly in Ontario and Quebec. 
The modest recovery in the Oil & Gas 
and Mining sectors has had a positive 
impact and sales to hydraulic component 
and attachment manufacturers have 
also seen good growth. In markets 
outside of North America, Hercules 
and Bulldog revenues were broadly 
flat with limited growth in Mexico and 
the Middle East and reduced revenues 
in South and Central America. 
The HKX attachment kit business 
returned to growth after two years of 
significant revenue reductions, which 
had reflected the severely depressed 
market for new excavators. Revenues 
increased by 11% with growth particularly 
strong in sales to Canadian customers, 
driven by recovery in the Oil & Gas sector, 
increased pipeline construction and 
strong sales of excavators ahead of new 
emissions regulations. New attachment 
kits have been developed to drive further 
growth as well as quick coupler kits 
with added safety features. The HKX 
product line has also been extended 
into higher tonnage equipment which 
has seen good momentum supporting 
large scale demolition projects.

local market conditions 23 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
The HFPG Industrial OEM businesses 
in North America (J Royal, RT Dygert 
and All Seals) increased revenues by 
9% in US dollar terms, as the improving 
trend in industrial activity seen in 
the second quarter, following the US 
election, strengthened further as the 
year progressed. All three businesses 
delivered double-digit revenue increases 
in the second half of the year with 
strong demand from key accounts 
across a range of specialised industrial 
applications in industries including 
Water, Medical, Oil & Gas, Appliances 
and Food Equipment. The businesses 
continue to provide high levels of 
customer service and technical support 
to service existing projects while looking 
for opportunities to deploy higher 
specification, regulatory-compliant 
compounds to target new projects 
with higher levels of added-value. 
In April 2017, J Royal relocated its 
operations to a newly constructed, 
purpose built facility in Winston-Salem, 
North Carolina, which was then sold and 
leased back to the business. At the same 
time, the Group acquired PSP, a small 
bolt-on acquisition to All Seals based in 
Denver, Colorado which supplies O-rings 
and custom rubber moulded products 
and has strong customer relationships 
in the semi-conductor and pneumatics 
industries. PSP adds complementary new 
products and strengthens the position 
of the Industrial OEM Seals business 
in the Mountain Region of the US. 
The Industrial OEM Seal businesses 
continue to pursue opportunities 
to create synergies through joint 
purchasing and through leveraging 
the different product, material and 
application skill-sets of the individual 
businesses. In the second half of the 
year, this was developed further by 
establishing a senior leadership team 
to manage this cluster of businesses in 
North America. While maintaining the 
distinct identity of the businesses and 
close local contact with customers, 
key functions including Sales, Supply 
Chain, Technical and Finance will be 
managed centrally by this team. The 
team has also initiated a project to 
implement a new ERP system across 
the Industrial OEM Seals businesses 
in the US, to replace the disparate 
legacy IT systems in the businesses. 
The new ERP system will be designed 
to increase operational efficiency, 
improve business intelligence and 
deliver broader marketing capabilities.
International Seals
The International Seals businesses, 
which account for 39% of Seals 
revenues, reported a 12% increase 
in UK sterling terms. After adjusting 
for currency and the acquisition of 
Edco, underlying revenues increased 
by 1%, but with performances in the 
individual businesses very dependent 
on local market conditions.
The FPE Seals and M Seals businesses, 
with their principal operations in the 
UK, Scandinavia and the Netherlands, 
together delivered underlying growth 
of 11% in revenues on a constant 
currency basis. FPE Seals experienced 
good growth in its core UK market 
for Aftermarket hydraulic seals and 
metal cylinder parts and benefited 
from a recovery in demand from the 
Oil & Gas sector for sealing products 
used in Maintenance, Repair and 
Overhaul (“MRO”) operations. FPE 
Seals also benefited from strong 
growth in several export markets. 
 
M Seals delivered good growth in 
revenues in its core markets, with 
particularly strong growth in Sweden, 
building on its strong customer 
relationships to develop a number of 
major new projects. M Seals has also 
extended its activities into the Finnish 
market for seals, by investing in a sales 
resource based in Kentek’s facility 
and making use of its operational 
infrastructure. As with FPE Seals, M Seals 
has also seen a recovery in demand 
from the Oil & Gas sector in the UK 
and is targeting specialised Industrial 
OEMs in other sectors of the market.
In June 2017, the Group completed 
the acquisition of Edco, a specialised 
distributor of O-rings, seals and gaskets 
based in Leicester and supplying to UK 
OEMs and MRO companies operating 
within the Oil & Gas and other process 
industries. Edco’s success has been 
built on deep technical knowledge, 
high levels of customer service and 
the ability to supply a wide range of 
products from stock. Edco is being 
managed as part of the M Seals group 
with good opportunities for cross-selling 
and improved purchasing power. 
The Kentek business, with principal 
operations in Finland and Russia, 
increased revenues by 4% in Euro terms. 
The revenues generated in Russia, which 
account for ca. 65% of Kentek revenues, 
slowed in the second half of the year after 
strong revenue growth in Euro terms in 
the first half. As selling prices for US and 
European sourced filters are linked to the 
Euro in this territory, the weakening of 
the Russian Rouble against the Euro as 
well as increasing competitive pressures 
in this market contributed to the slow 
down in revenue growth. However, 
Kentek significantly increased sales of its 
own-brand filters in Russia and the Baltics 
and achieved good growth in Finland, 
benefiting from a recovery in both the 
Aftermarket and Industrial OEM sectors.
Kubo and WCIS saw combined underlying 
revenues for the year reduce by 3%, 
with a return to modest revenue growth

where the strong currency has made 
Swiss industrial manufacturers less 
competitive. However, the strengthening 
of the Euro through the year has 
contributed to an increase in industrial 
activity in Switzerland. In Austria, 
Kubo’s improved sales focus has 
introduced new customer revenues 
in Pharmaceutical and Industrial 
OEMs to replace a large prior year order 
which was not repeated this year.
WCIS has core capabilities in gaskets 
and mechanical seals used in MRO 
operations in complex and arduous 
conditions and has been significantly 
impacted by cutbacks in the Mining 
sector in recent years. In New Caledonia, 
WCIS has come under substantial pricing 
pressure from cost reduction initiatives 
in the nickel mining and processing 
operations of its major customer and 
in Australia, it has also experienced 
reduced revenues from its core Mining 
customer base. WCIS has responded by 
investing in additional sales resources to 
broaden coverage across a wider range 
of market sectors and territories and 
this initiative is starting to gain some 
traction, though as yet the revenues 
are not sufficient to offset fully the 
reductions in the Mining customer base. 24 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017

Market drivers
Industrial economic background
The Controls businesses focus on 
specialised, technical applications in a 
range of industries, with over 90% of 
Sector revenues generated in the UK and 
Continental Europe (principally Germany). 
The background market drivers are 
therefore the growth of the industrial 
economies in the UK and Germany.
A good indicator of the health of 
the UK industrial economy is the UK 
Index of Production. Following the 
2009 recession, gains in 2010 were 
reversed in 2011 and 2012 and since 
then there has been slow, steady 
growth. However, the index is still some 
8% below pre-recession levels and 
economic growth is now more driven 
by the Services and Retail sectors.
In Germany, the Production Sector 
Output index tracks a strong period of 
recovery through 2010 and 2011, since 
when it has slowly increased and is now 
ca. 5% above pre-recession levels. 
Specific industry drivers –  
Interconnect and Specialty Fasteners
Although influenced by the general 
industrial economic cycles, there 
are also more specific drivers 
within the main market segments 
served by the Interconnect and 
Specialty Fasteners businesses.
The Civil Aerospace market continues 
to grow steadily with growth in world 
passenger traffic averaging over 
6% p.a. over the last five years and 
with continuing strong order books 
at Boeing and Airbus. The demand 
for new aircraft is being driven by the 
need to replace ageing fleets with 
more fuel efficient aircraft and the

demand from airlines in the Asia-Pacific 
region. There is increased activity in 
the cabin interiors market where the 
wide range of complex seating and 
entertainment systems is driving growth. 
In the Defence sector, the UK remains 
committed to maintaining the NATO 
spend target of 2% of GDP through 
to 2020. Despite this, the Ministry of 
Defence’s budget is under pressure 
from the weakness of sterling and 
rising costs for ongoing new build 
projects. In Germany, the government 
has committed to increased defence 
spending in response to the emergence 
of new perceived threats and pressure 
to meet NATO’s spending target.
In Motorsport, the major drivers of 
demand in Formula 1 are the number of 
races and teams (both of which reduced 
in the 2017 season) and the level of 
development work related to technology 
and rule changes. These changes were 
significant in the 2017 season and related 
principally to bodywork design; the 2018 
rule changes are not expected to be as 
significant. The businesses do supply 
to other motor racing series and the 
Formula E series in particular continues 
to gain momentum; however the spend 
on Interconnect products is relatively low 
in these series compared to Formula 1. 
In the UK, investment in Rail 
infrastructure continues with 
electrification projects, station 
upgrades, the Thameslink upgrade 
and the final stages of the Crossrail 
project. In addition, the first stages of 
the High Speed Two (“HS2”) project 
have received approval, with work 
expected to run through to 2033. More 
generally, UK infrastructure investment 
is expected to continue with particular 
focus on energy and utilities. In 
Germany, electricity generation and 
distribution remains a positive sector 
due to the fragmented nature of the 
local supply of electricity, where it is the 
responsibility of the towns and cities. 
Specific industry drivers – Fluid Controls
The Fluid Controls businesses generate 
over 60% of their revenues from the Food 
& Beverage sector in the UK. In Food 
Retailing, the trend away from major out-
of-town stores to convenience stores and 
home delivery continues. There is also 
a drive in the Retail industry to reduce 
energy consumption and to introduce 
low Global Warming Potential (“GWP”) 
refrigerants, in preparation for tighter 
EU regulations over the next five years. 
These trends are driving demand 
for smaller, more energy efficient 
components as supplied by Hawco.
The Coffee market sector continues to 
grow at above 10% p.a., with Abbeychart 
supplying both the coffee machine 
manufacturers and the Aftermarket 
sector, predominately in the UK but 
also in Europe. The Vending market 
sector continues to see modest growth, 
driven by the sale of premium products, 
particularly in the hot drinks segment.  26 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017

SECTOR REVIEW
Controls
Sector performance
Reported revenues of the Controls 
businesses increased by 23% to £130.7m 
(2016: £106.1m). Full year contributions 
from Cablecraft and Ascome, acquired 
in the first half of last year, added £6.4m 
or 6% to Sector revenues and currency 
movements contributed a further 3% 
to Sector revenues on translation to UK 
sterling. On an underlying basis, after 
adjusting for these acquisitions and 
currency effects, revenues increased 
by 14%, with growth moderating in the 
second half (though still double-digit) 
against stronger prior year comparatives.
Adjusted operating margins increased 
by 70bps to 17.6% (2016: 16.9%). 
Gross margins were broadly stable 
overall, with stronger margins in the 
Cablecraft business broadly offsetting 
the impact of weaker UK sterling on 
products purchased by the other 
Controls businesses. Operating costs 
remained tightly controlled across the 
businesses and improved leverage from 
the increased revenue more than offset 
increased investment in sales resources. 
Adjusted operating profits increased 
by 28% to £23.0m (2016: £17.9m).
Capital expenditure in this Sector 
remained very modest at £0.2m (2016: 
£0.4m), with £0.1m invested in the 
Clarendon business to upgrade its Totnes 
facility to improve operational efficiency. 
A further £0.1m was invested on general 
IT infrastructure across the Controls 
businesses. Free cash flow increased 
strongly to £18.6m (2016: £16.4m) 
reflecting stronger trading, including the 
additional contribution from Cablecraft 
and despite an increase in working 
capital to support the growth in trading.
Interconnect
The Interconnect businesses (IS-
Group, Filcon and Cablecraft) account 
for 59% of Controls revenues and 
reported a revenue increase of 25% 
in UK sterling terms. After adjusting 
for the Cablecraft and Ascome 
acquisitions and for currency effects, 
underlying revenues increased by 8%.
The IS-Group continued to implement 
the business development programmes 
initiated last year, designed to position 
the business as the European supplier 
of choice for the full range of specialised 
cable harnessing components. Field 
sales resources have been realigned 
to focus on sectors and customer 
accounts with the highest growth 
potential and internal sales processes 
have been refocused to more efficiently 
manage the baseline business. Further 
investment has also been made in 
broadening the product range and further 
developing E-commerce capabilities.
The IS-Group UK businesses saw 
revenues increase by 7% in UK sterling 
terms. In Defence and Aerospace, the 
IS-Group reported a small increase in 
revenues, with the stronger growth 
seen in the first half of the year offset 
by slower trading in the second half. 
The lower level of activity at UK 
electrical harness customers towards 
the end of the year is partly from a 
tightening in Defence spending and 
partly from certain key customers being 
in between projects. In Motorsport, 
IS-Group increased revenues strongly, 
benefiting from regulation changes and 
the increased level of competition in 
races this year in the Formula 1 (“F1”) 
series, development of new cars in the 
World Rally Championship (“WRC”) 
Series and upgrades to the GT500 cars 
in Japan. The IS-Group also benefited 
from good double-digit growth in 
revenues from the Industrial sector in 
the UK and more broadly in Europe, as 
the business improved its competitive 
position under new sales leadership, 
following the appointment of a sales 
director focused on the EMEA region.
In Germany, IS-Sommer and Filcon 
reported a 14% increase in revenues 
in Euro terms, with modest growth in 
IS-Sommer boosted by major project 
activity in Filcon. In the Aerospace sector, 
IS-Sommer delivered good growth with 
a particularly strong performance in the 
Space market, supplying connectors 
and backshells to the Meteosat Third 
Generation (“MTG”) and Sentinel 
satellites. Solid growth in the Industrial 
market was driven by the stronger global 
economy, which benefited German 
exporters. Revenues were held back 
in the important Energy market where 
lower utility company budgets delayed 
repair and maintenance of the electricity

Highlights from the year
 • Sector revenue increased by 23%; 
underlying increase of 14% 
after adjusting for currency 
and acquisitions
 • The Interconnect businesses 
benefited from increased project 
work and delivered strong 
underlying growth of 8%; Cablecraft 
has expanded the range of products 
supplied and markets served
 • Clarendon increased revenues by 
over 30%, with growth driven by 
increased customer demand in Civil 
Aerospace and Motorsport 
 • Fluid Controls increased revenues 
by 14% with upturn in refrigeration 
equipment sales and increased 
export sales in Europe and the US  27 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
network and Motorsport revenues 
were impacted by the withdrawal 
of VW from the WRC Rally Series 
and Audi from the World Endurance 
Championship (“WEC”) Series, which 
includes the Le Mans race. Revenues in 
the Medical sector performed strongly 
with key medical device manufacturers 
managing a solid pipeline of projects 
on the back of new regulations.
Filcon delivered a very strong 
performance, increasing revenues by 
ca. 30% in Euro terms. There was a full 
year contribution from the small Ascome 
acquisition, but the primary driver of 
growth came from major orders secured 
in the final quarter of the prior year 
from key Military Aerospace and Space 
customers. These sectors have generally 
seen increased activity, with projects 
delivered for the Tornado aircraft, the 
RAM missile programme and the Orion 
Mars capsule. In the Motorsport sector, 
the increased activity levels and demand 
in the F1 series has offset the reduced 
demand from the withdrawal by Audi 
from Le Mans. The Industrial market 
for connectors remains competitive 
and generally more challenging.
Cablecraft is a leading supplier of 
cable accessory products used to 
identify, connect, secure and protect 
electrical cables and has made a strong 
contribution to the Group since its 
acquisition in March 2016. Cablecraft 
has extended the markets served by 
the Interconnect businesses and has 
added attractive ranges of own branded 
and manufactured products. During the 
year the business continued to focus 
on its areas of specialism, including 
the development of new own branded 
identification products, the promotion 
of its upgraded Identification Solutions 
offering and the specialist sales resources 
added to support sales growth. Revenues 
have increased by 7% on a like-for-like 
basis, with good growth generated 
from the continued focus on end user 
customers, especially electrical panel 
builders and contractors upgrading the 
UK rail network. Cablecraft continues 
to benefit from the move by customers 
towards E-commerce, with online 
sales growing by ca. 30% in the year.
Specialty Fasteners
The Clarendon Specialty Fasteners 
business accounts for 18% of Controls 
revenues and increased revenues by over 
30% compared with the prior year, with 
growth driven principally by increased 
demand from customers in the Civil 
Aerospace sector. Revenues increased 
strongly with the ramp up of the major 
business class seating programme 
at a key aircraft seating customer 
which Clarendon supplies through its 
automatic inventory replenishment 
system (“Clarendon AIR”). Clarendon 
also had success in increasing sales 
to a range of other aircraft seating 
and cabin interiors manufacturers and 
their subcontractors across Europe 
and introduced Clarendon AIR to a 
number of new customer locations. 
Good growth was also achieved in 
Clarendon’s other major market of 
Motorsport, where Clarendon supplies 
aerospace-quality fasteners to the 
F1 race teams, engine builders and 
subcontractors and also supplies 
the Aerocatch own-brand range of 
aerodynamic bonnet latches for high 
performance sports cars and offshore 
powerboat racing. More modest growth 
has been achieved in the supply of pre-
assembled and captive fasteners and 
bespoke engineered solutions to the 
Defence and general Industrial sectors. 
After the year end, in October 2017, 
Clarendon completed the acquisition 
of Coast Fabrication Inc. (“Coast”), a 
small US specialty fastener distributor 
based in Huntington Beach, California. 
Coast has a strong reputation in the 
US Motorsport industry and also 
provides a base in the US for supporting 
Clarendon’s current Aerospace 
customers as well as expanding its 
aircraft interiors business in this large 
market. A US presence is also a strategic 
purchasing priority for Clarendon, giving 
access to major fastener suppliers 
that principally sell to US entities.
Fluid Controls
The Hawco Group of Fluid Controls 
businesses (comprising Hawco and 
Abbeychart) accounts for 23% of 
Controls revenues and increased 
revenues by 14% against the prior 
year, in a market that remains highly 
competitive and price sensitive.
Hawco reported a good upturn in activity 
in the UK Refrigeration Equipment 
market, as store refurbishment activity 
in the UK increased and as the cabinet 
display manufacturers targeted 
opportunities outside the UK. Hawco 
benefited in particular from supplying 
scroll compressors into a significant 
project with a major US retailer and 
demand in the commercial Catering 
and Home Delivery market remained 
robust. In the Contractor market, strong 
growth was achieved, as Hawco targeted 
the independent trade counters and 
medium sized contractors who value 
Hawco’s stock holding, next-day delivery 
and exclusive supplier relationships. 
Revenues from the Industrial OEM market 
reduced in the second half of the year, 
as demand from UK manufacturers 
softened, but this was partly offset 
by an increase in export revenues. 
Abbeychart has continued to strengthen 
its relationship with the large vending 
machine operators in Europe and 
during the year supplied products to 
a large project to refresh a range of 
vending machines for a major customer 
in Switzerland. Abbeychart revenues 
also benefited from a full year of sales 
activity for a range of spare parts for 
Wurlitzer vending machines and from 
the introduction of a catalogue of 
essential spare parts for the specialist 
coffee market, which has offset 
reduced revenues from one of its larger 
coffee OEM customers. Abbeychart 
has continued to take market share 
in the soft drinks market by targeting 
both the major and the independent 
soft drink suppliers, with its bar gun 
and pump refurbishment offering.

the translation of the results of the 
overseas businesses, when compared 
with last year’s average exchange rates. 
The environment for completing 
acquisitions has been more challenging 
over the past 12 months and the 
contribution from acquisitions completed 
both this year and last year, net of a 
small disposal last year, was £8.5m 
(2016: £26.6m) to revenue and £2.3m 
(2016: £4.2m) to adjusted operating profit. 
The stronger growth in underlying 
revenues of 7% this year helped 
compensate for this smaller contribution 
from acquired businesses. Underlying 
revenues are after adjusting for 
the contribution from businesses 
acquired during the year (and from 
the incremental impact from those 
acquired last year) and for the impact 
on the translation of the results of 
the overseas businesses from the 
significant weakening in the UK sterling 
exchange rate, against the currencies 
of the Group’s overseas businesses.
Adjusted operating margin
The Group’s adjusted operating margin 
improved by 10bps this year to 17.3% 
(2016: 17.2%) as transactional currency 
pressures finally eased in the Group’s 
Healthcare businesses. These businesses 
represent 23% of Group revenue and 
since late in 2013, their gross margins 
have been significantly impacted on a 
transactional basis by the continuing 
depreciation of the Canadian and 
Australian dollars, against the US dollar in 
particular which is the currency in which 
most of their products are purchased. 
The Canadian and Australian exchange 
rates have remained more stable since 
the early part of this year and after a 
short period of weakness during the early 
Summer, both currencies strengthened 
sharply against the US dollar towards 
the end of the financial year.
 
The transactional impact on the Group’s 
adjusted operating margin from the 
substantial depreciation in UK sterling has 
been limited. The UK businesses (26% 
of Group revenues) have faced higher 
product costs from the depreciation

in UK sterling, but they have generally 
managed to mitigate these increases 
by a combination of selling price 
increases, support from suppliers and by 
switching some key customer accounts 
into Euro or US dollar invoicing.
The operating margins in those 
businesses acquired in recent years 
have, as anticipated, also made a slightly 
stronger contribution to the Group 
this year reflecting the benefits from 
initiatives taken shortly after acquisition. 
Adjusted profit before tax, earnings 
per share and dividends
Adjusted profit before tax increased 
by 19% to £77.5m (2016: £64.9m). The 
interest expense this year was £0.7m 
(2016: £0.8m) which included a £0.2m 
(2016: £Nil) arrangement fee paid on 
renewal of the bank facility during 
the year. However interest costs on 
borrowings decreased by £0.3m to 
£0.1m this year reflecting a lower 
level of acquisition activity in 2017, 
compared with last year. The notional 
interest expense on the Group’s 
defined pension liabilities increased 
to £0.3m (2016: £0.2m) reflecting the 
larger deficit in the fund this year, 
following the actuarial valuation 
completed as at 30 September 2016. 
Statutory profit before tax was £66.8m 
(2016: £54.0m), after acquisition related 
charges of £9.7m (2016: £10.3m), which 
largely comprises the amortisation of 
acquisition related intangible assets 
and fair value remeasurements. These 
remeasurements of £1.0m (2016: 
£1.3m) relate to the put options held 
over minority interests and the charge 
this year reflects a small increase in 
the liability to acquire these minority 
interests and an unwinding of the 
discount on the liability. Last year’s 
statutory profit also included a one-off 
gain of £0.7m from the disposal of the 
Medivators business in Canada and 
three small legacy properties in the UK.
The Group’s effective tax charge in 
2017 was 80bps above the previous 
year at 26.5% (2016: 25.7%) of adjusted 
profit before tax. The increase this year 
is despite a further reduction in the 
effective UK corporation tax rate to 19.5% 
(2016: 20.0%) which was insufficient to 
offset the impact from higher tax rates 
applied to the businesses acquired 
in Australia and the US this year.
Adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”) 
increased by 19% to 49.8p, compared 
with 41.9p last year and statutory basic 
EPS increased to 42.0p (2016: 33.9p).
The Board continues to pursue a 
progressive dividend policy which 
aims to increase the dividend each 
year broadly in line with the growth in 
adjusted EPS. In determining the dividend 
in any one year in accordance with this 
policy, the Board also considers a number 
of factors which include the strength 
of the free cash flow generated by the 
Group, the future cash commitments 
and investment needed to sustain the 
Group’s long term growth strategy 
and the target level of dividend cover. 
The Board continues to target towards 
two times dividend cover (defined 
as the ratio of adjusted EPS to total 
dividends paid and proposed for the year) 
which provides a prudent buffer. 
The ability of the Board to maintain  
future dividend policy will be influenced 
by the principal risks identified on 
pages 33 to 35 that could adversely 
impact the performance of the Group. 30 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017

STATEMENTS
Finance Review continued
For 2017, the Board has recommended 
a final dividend of 16.0p per share 
(2016: 13.8p) making the proposed 
full year dividend 23.0p (2016: 20.0p). 
This represents a 15% increase in 
the proposed full year dividend with 
dividend cover increasing slightly 
to 2.2 times (2016: 2.1 times).
Free cash flow
The Group again generated strong 
free cash flow this year of £55.7m 
(2016: £59.0m). Last year’s free cash flow 
included exceptional proceeds of £4.6m 
from the sale of the Medivators business 
in Canada and legacy properties and from 
an unusually large cash inflow of £6.3m 
from reduced working capital. Free cash 
flow represents cash available to invest 
in acquisitions or return to shareholders. 
Free cash flow conversion was 99% 
(2016: 124%) of adjusted earnings.
The Group’s operating cash flow 
increased by £2.7m to £79.3m 
(2016: £76.6m) this year, despite a 
£4.0m outflow of cash into working 
capital. The generally stronger trading 
environment this year, together with 
some earlier seasonal stock builds in 
the Healthcare businesses contributed 
to a £5.1m increase in stock levels at 
the year end (2016: £1.3m) while the 
inflow from net payables reduced 
to £1.1m from £7.6m last year. 
The Group’s KPI metric of working 
capital to revenue at 30 September 
2017 reduced to a record low of 15.0% 
(2016: 16.6%) reflecting much stronger 
revenues in the previous rolling 12 
months, compared with last year. 
Group tax payments increased by 
£1.7m to £19.3m (2016: £17.6m). On an 
underlying basis cash tax payments 
represented ca. 24% (2016: 23%) of 
adjusted profit before tax which was 
broadly unchanged from last year. 
Underlying tax payments are before 
currency effects of translation and 
exclude payments for pre-acquisition 
tax liabilities in acquired businesses.
The Group’s tax strategy is to comply 
with tax laws in all of the countries in 
which it operates and to balance its 
responsibilities for controlling the tax 
costs with its responsibilities to pay tax 
where it does business. The Group’s 
tax strategy has been approved by 
the Board and tax risks are regularly 
reviewed by the Audit Committee.
 
The Group’s capital expenditure 
this year was £3.3m, compared with 
£3.7m last year. This expenditure 
excludes £1.9m (2016: £0.5m) which 
the Group paid for the construction 
of a new expanded facility for J Royal, 
a Seals business based in the US. On 
completion in April 2017, the facility 
was immediately sold and leased back 
to the business. A similar transaction 
was undertaken in 2015 in connection 
with the new FPE Seals facility.
The Life Sciences businesses invested 
£2.0m in new capital this year (2016: 
£2.2m) most of which was invested 
in field equipment in the Healthcare 
businesses to support placements in 
hospitals and diagnostic laboratories. 
This investment was £1.6m (2016: £0.9m) 
and included demonstration and loan 
equipment in connection with new 
capital equipment released in 2017 and 
a new supply agreement for a range of 
rigid endoscopes in Vantage. A further 
£0.3m was spent on upgrading the IT 
infrastructure in both the Healthcare 
businesses and the a1-group and 
£0.1m was spent on refurbishing a new 
facility in Markham, Canada which is 
used to service flexible endoscopes.
The Seals businesses invested £1.1m 
during the year in its operations 
with £0.5m being spent in the North 
American Seals businesses and £0.6m 
in the International Seals businesses. 
Across these businesses, £0.6m was 
invested to fit out new and expanded 
facilities in J Royal, Hercules Canada and 
Kentek. A further £0.2m was invested in 
new warehouse equipment in M Seals 
and Kubo and £0.3m was spent on 
upgrading the IT infrastructure across 
the Seals Sector. Capital expenditure 
in the Controls businesses remained 
modest at £0.2m (2016: £0.4m). 
The Company paid the PAYE 
income tax liability of £0.7m (2016: 
£0.3m) on the exercise of LTIP share 
awards, in exchange for reduced 
share awards to participants.
The Group spent £20.1m of the free 
cash flow on acquisitions, including 
payment of deferred consideration, 
as described below and £23.7m (2016: 
£21.4m) on paying dividends to both 
Company and minority shareholders.
Acquisitions completed during the year
The Group invested £19.5m in acquiring 
new businesses this year and paid a 
further £0.6m of deferred consideration 
on a business acquired in the prior year. 
This compares with an aggregate of 
£32.7m invested last year in acquisitions, 
minority shareholdings and deferred 
consideration. The stronger economies 
in the US and Continental Europe 
contributed to a tougher environment 
to make acquisitions as business 
owners generally remained confident of 
increasing profitability in the year ahead. 
In April 2017, the Group was successful in 
completing the acquisition of Abacus for 
cash consideration of £15.0m, including 
debt acquired and expenses. Abacus is 
a long-established supplier of clinical 
diagnostics instrumentation to the 
Pathology and Life Sciences sectors in 
Australia and New Zealand and provides 
critical mass to the Group’s existing 
Healthcare businesses in this region. A 
further £4.5m in aggregate was invested 
in June 2017 to acquire Edco, a small 
hydraulic seal distributor in the UK and in 
April 2017 to acquire PSP, a small supplier 
of specialist seals based in the US.
These acquisitions added £10.1m to 
the Group’s acquired intangible assets, 
which represents the valuation of 
customer and supplier relationships 
which will be amortised over periods 
ranging from five to ten years. At 
30 September 2017, the carrying value of 
the Group’s acquired intangible assets 
was £54.0m. Goodwill at 30 September 
2017 was £122.7m and included £7.5m 
relating to those businesses acquired 
during the year (including fair value  31 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
adjustments to the assets acquired). 
Goodwill is not amortised but is assessed 
each year at a Sector level to determine 
whether there has been any impairment 
in the carrying value of goodwill acquired. 
The exercise to assess whether goodwill 
has been impaired is described in note 10 
to the consolidated financial statements 
and concluded that there was significant 
headroom on the valuation of this 
goodwill, compared with the carrying 
value of goodwill at the year end. 
 
Liabilities to minority shareholders
The Group’s liability to purchase 
outstanding minority shareholdings 
at 30 September 2017 increased to 
£6.1m (2016: £5.1m) which comprise 
put options the Group holds over 
the outstanding minority interests 
held in M Seals, Kentek and TPD.
The liabilities for these put options are 
valued based on the Directors’ latest 
estimate of the earnings before interest 
and tax (“EBIT”) of these businesses 
when these options crystallise. The 
increase in this liability of £1.0m 
reflects in part a slightly higher value 
attributed to these businesses and in 
part an unwinding of the discount on 
the liability. Shortly after the year end 
the Group agreed to pay cash of £1.0m 
to acquire a further 5% shareholding in 
TPD from the minority shareholder. 
In addition to the liability to minority 
shareholders, the Group also has a 
small liability at 30 September 2017 for 
deferred consideration of up to £0.5m 
(2016: £1.7m) which comprises the 
amount likely to be paid to the vendors 
of businesses purchased during the year, 
based on the Group’s best estimate of 
the performance of these businesses 
next year. During the year, £0.6m was 
paid as deferred consideration relating 
to the acquisition of WCIS completed 
early in 2016 and a provision of £1.0m 
relating to the acquisition of Cablecraft 
was not required and was released to 
the Consolidated Income Statement 
as part of acquisition related charges.
Return on adjusted trading capital 
employed and capital management
A key metric that the Group uses to 
measure the overall profitability of 
the Group and its success in creating 
value for shareholders is the return 
on adjusted trading capital employed 
(“ROATCE”). At a Group level, this is 
a pre-tax measure which is applied 
against the fixed and working capital 
of the Group, together with all gross 
intangible assets and goodwill, including 
goodwill previously written off against 
retained earnings. At 30 September 
2017, the Group ROATCE improved to 
24.0% (2016: 21.1%) which reflects the 
strong increase in adjusted operating 
profits this year. Adjusted trading capital 
employed is defined in note 3 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
The Group continues to maintain a 
strong balance sheet with cash funds of 
£22.3m at 30 September 2017, compared 
with net cash funds of £10.6m last 
year. Surplus cash funds are generally 
repatriated to the UK, unless they 
are required locally to meet certain 
commitments, including acquisitions.
On 1 June 2017 the Group renewed its 
bank facility with a similar revolving 
multi-currency credit facility for a further 
three years and with an option to extend 
the facility from three years up to five 
years. The facility initially comprises 
a £30m committed facility, but with 
an accordion option which allows the 
Group to increase the commitment up 
to a maximum of £60m of borrowings. 
These new facilities were provided 
at a cost of 50bps and with a ratchet 
margin ranging from 70bps to 115bps 
over LIBOR depending on the ratio 
of EBITDA to net debt. These bank 
facilities are primarily used to meet any 
shortfall in cash to fund acquisitions. 
Employee pension obligations
Pension benefits to existing employees, 
both in the UK and overseas, are 
provided through defined contribution 
schemes at an aggregate cost in 
2017 of £2.8m (2016: £2.5m). 
The Group maintains a legacy small 
closed defined benefit pension scheme 
in the UK. During the year a formal 
triennial funding valuation of this 
scheme as at 30 September 2016 was 
completed. This valuation reported an 
increase in the funding deficit of £6.5m 
to £9.2m with a 75% funding level which 
reflected the impact of bond yields 
falling to a record low of 1.5% at the 
valuation date from 3.6% in the previous 
funding valuation. However, bond 
yields have increased slightly since the 
valuation date and investment returns 
have been strong again this year.
This recent improvement in market 
conditions, together with the strength 
of the employer covenant, helped 
limit the increase in cash contributions 
paid by the Company to £0.5m 
from 1 October 2017, from £0.4m 
of cash contributions paid this year. 
This contribution rate will increase 
annually by 2% with the objective of 
eliminating the deficit within ten years. 
In Switzerland, local law requires 
Kubo to provide a contribution based 
pension for all employees, which are 
funded by employer and employee 
contributions. This pension plan is 
managed for Kubo through a separate 
multi-employer plan of non-associated 
Swiss companies which pools the 
funding risk between participating 
companies. In Switzerland, Kubo’s 
annual cash contribution to the pension 
scheme was £0.2m (2016: £0.3m).
Both the UK defined benefit scheme 
and the Kubo contribution scheme 
are accounted for in accordance with 
IAS19 (Revised). At 30 September 2017 
the aggregate accounting pension 
deficit in these two schemes decreased 
by £7.3m to £9.9m reflecting a small 
increase in bond yields in both schemes, 
combined with a strong increase in 
the growth assets of the UK scheme 
compared with last year. The gross 
aggregate pension liability in respect of 
these two schemes at 30 September 
2017 decreased by £6.6m to £49.5m 
which is funded by £39.6m of assets.
Potential impact of Brexit 
The impact at an operational level on 
the Group’s businesses from the current 
uncertainty regarding the process and 
timing of the UK’s exit from the European 
Union is likely to be limited as only 
26% of the Group’s overall revenues 
are based in the UK. In addition, these 
businesses, as well as those based in 
Continental Europe, are substantially 
“in country” industrial suppliers of 
goods with limited sales activity being 
carried out across country borders.
At a macroeconomic level however, 
the Group’s financial results have been 
impacted this year by the substantial 
depreciation in UK sterling that followed 
the Brexit vote. This has resulted in 
an increase to the Group’s reported 
revenues, operating profits and net 
assets from translating the results 
of the Group’s overseas businesses 
into UK sterling. It has also led to 
stronger inflation in supplier costs 
for the Group’s UK based businesses 
which they have had to manage 
robustly to maintain gross margins.
The Group’s UK businesses closely 
monitor developments in the Brexit 
plans of HM Government and their 
future investment plans include 
contingencies to mitigate the impact 
on their activities from a significant 
disruption in cross border trade between 
the UK and Continental Europe.  32 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT
RISKS
Internal Control and Risk Management
The Board is committed to protecting and enhancing Diploma’s 
reputation and assets, while safeguarding the interests of 
shareholders. It has overall responsibility for the Group’s system 
of risk management and internal control. 
Diploma’s businesses are affected by a number of risks and 
uncertainties. These may be impacted by internal and external 
factors, some of which we cannot control. Many of the risks are 
similar to those found by comparable companies in terms of 
scale and operations. 
Our approach
Risk management and maintenance of appropriate systems of 
control to manage risk is the responsibility of the Board and is 
integral to the ability of the Group to deliver on its strategic 
priorities. The Board has developed a framework of risk 
management which is used to establish the culture of effective 
risk management throughout the businesses by identifying and 
monitoring the material risks, setting risk appetite and 
determining the overall risk tolerance of the Group. This 
framework of risk management has been further enhanced this 
year and additional processes have been developed which will 
assist the Board to monitor and assess the principal risks 
throughout the year. 
The Group’s risk management systems are monitored by 
the Audit Committee, under delegation from the Board. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the 
effectiveness of the internal control environment of the Group. 
An internal audit function has been established for many 
years to provide independent assurance that the Group’s risk 
management, governance and internal control processes are 
operating effectively.
Identifying and monitoring material risks
Material risks are identified through a detailed analysis of 
individual processes and procedures (bottom up approach) 
and a consideration of the strategy and operating environment 
of the Group (top down approach). 
The detailed risk evaluation process begins in the operating 
businesses with an annual exercise undertaken by management 
to identify and document the significant strategic, operational, 
financial and accounting risks facing the businesses. This 
process is both robust and challenging and ensures risks are 
identified and monitored and management controls are 
embedded in the business’ operations.
The Group uses a quantitative method to determine a Risk Score 
for each risk which is based on both the likelihood of each 
identified risk occurring and the consequence of an adverse 
outcome and its impact on the business. Each business will then 
identify processes established to control each risk and minimise 
its potential impact.
 
The risk assessments from each of the operating businesses  
are then considered by the Board who evaluate the principal 
risks of the Group with reference to the Group’s strategy and 
operating environment. 
Our principal risks and uncertainties
Set out in this section of the Strategic Report are the principal 
risks and uncertainties affecting the Group which have been 
determined by the Board, based on a robust risk evaluation 
process described above, to have the potential to have the 
greatest impact on the Group’s future viability. These risks 
are similar to those reported last year, although with some 
movement on the relative ranking of these risks. In addition, 
following the risk evaluation process carried out this year as 
described above, a new principal risk has been added that relates 
to ‘Cybersecurity/Information Technology/Business Interruption.’
The risks are each classified as either strategic, operational, 
financial or accounting. The Group’s decentralised operations 
with different Sectors and geographical spread reduces the 
impact of these principal risks. 
The Board has also considered the risks associated with the UK’s 
Brexit vote to leave the European Union and this is explained 
further on page 31 in the Finance Review.
The Directors confirm that they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will continue to operate and meet 
its liabilities, as they fall due, for the next three years to 
September 2020. The Directors’ assessment has been made 
with reference to the resilience of the Group and its strong 
financial position, the Group’s current strategy, the Board’s 
risk appetite and the Group’s principal risks and how these 
are managed, as described in the Strategic Report. 
The Group has a broad spread of customers and suppliers 
across different geographic areas and independent market 
sectors, often secured with longer term agreements. The 
Group is supported by a robust balance sheet and strong 
operational cash flows. 
The assessment period of three years has been chosen as it 
is consistent with the Board’s triennial review of the Group’s 
strategy at which the prospects of each business are 
discussed; assumptions are made regarding entering into 
new markets and geographies, about future growth rates of 
the existing businesses and about the acceptable 
performance of existing businesses. A robust financial model 
of the Group is built on a business-by-business basis and the 
metrics for the Group’s KPIs are reviewed for the assessment 
period. These metrics are also subject to sensitivity analysis 
which includes flexing a number of the main assumptions, 
namely, future revenue growth, gross margins, operating 
costs and working capital management. The results of flexing 
these assumptions, both individually and in aggregate, are 
used to determine whether additional bank facilities will be 
required during this period. 
The Directors confirm that this robust assessment also 
considers the principal risks facing the Group, as described 
on pages 33 to 35 and the potential impacts these risks 
would have on the Group’s business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity over the assessment 
period. The Board considers that the diverse nature of the 
Sectors and geographies in which the Group operates acts 
significantly to mitigate the impact any of these risks might 
have on the Group. 
Viability Statement – Diploma PLC 33 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Strategic risk – Downturn/instability in major markets
Risk description and assessment Mitigation Change
Adverse changes in the major markets in which the businesses 
operate can have a significant impact on performance. The 
effects of these changes can be seen in terms of slowing 
revenue growth, due to reduced or delayed demand for 
products and services, or margin pressures due to increased 
competition.
A number of characteristics of the Group’s businesses moderate 
the impact of economic and business cycles on the Group as a 
whole:
• The Group’s businesses operate in three differing Sectors 
with different cyclical characteristics and across a number of 
geographic markets.
• The businesses offer specialised products and services, 
which are often specific to their application; this offers a 
degree of protection against customers quickly switching 
business to achieve a better price.
• A high proportion of the Group’s revenues comprises 
consumable products which are purchased as part of the 
customer’s operating expenditure, rather than through 
capital budgets.
• In many cases the products are used in repair, maintenance 
and refurbishment applications, rather than original 
equipment manufacturer.
The businesses identify key market drivers and 
monitor the trends and forecasts, as well as 
maintaining close relationships with key customers 
who may give an early warning of slowing demand.
Changes to cost levels and inventories can then be 
made in a measured way to mitigate the effects.
Significant global events are closely monitored to 
determine any potential impact on key markets.
Strategic risk – Supplier concentration/loss of key suppliers
Risk description and assessment Mitigation Change
For manufacturer-branded products, there are risks to the 
business if a major supplier decides to cancel a distribution 
agreement or if the supplier is acquired by a company which has 
its own distribution channels in the relevant market. There is 
also the risk of a supplier taking away exclusivity and either 
setting up direct operations or appointing another distributor.
Currently no single supplier represents more than 10% of Group 
revenue and only six single suppliers represent more than 2% 
each of Group revenue.
Relationships with suppliers have normally been built up over 
many years and a strong degree of interdependence has been 
established. The average length of the principal supplier 
relationships in each of the Sectors is over ten years.
The strength of the relationship with each supplier and the 
volume of activity generally ensures continuity of supply, when 
there is shortage of product.
The success of the businesses depends significantly on 
representing suppliers whose products are recognised in the 
marketplace as the leading competitive brand. If suppliers fail to 
support these products with new development and 
technologies, then our businesses will suffer from reduced 
demand for their products and services. 
Long term, multi-year exclusive contracts signed 
with suppliers with change of control clauses, 
where possible, included in contracts for protection 
or compensation in the event of acquisition.
Collaborative projects and relationships maintained 
with individuals at many levels of the supplier 
organisation, together with regular review meetings 
and adherence to contractual terms.
Regular review of inventory levels.
Bundling and kitting of products and provision of 
added value services.
Periodic research of alternative suppliers as part of 
contingency planning.
The businesses work very closely with each of their 
suppliers and regularly attend industry exhibitions 
to keep abreast of the latest technology and market 
requirements/trends. The businesses also meet 
with key customers on a regular basis to gain 
insight into their product requirements and 
market developments. 34 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT
RISKS
Internal Control and Risk Management  
continued 
Strategic risk – Customer concentration/loss of key customer(s)
Risk description and assessment Mitigation Change
The loss of one or more major customers can be a material risk.
The nature of the Group’s businesses is such that there is not  
a high level of dependence on any individual customer and no 
single customer represents more than 4% of Sector revenue  
or more than 2% of Group revenue.
Specific large customers are important to 
individual operating businesses and a high level of 
effort is invested in ensuring that these customers 
are retained and encouraged not to switch to 
another supplier. 
In addition to providing high levels of customer 
service and value added activities, close 
integration is established where possible with 
customers’ systems and processes.
Operational risk – Cybersecurity/information technology/business interruption
Risk description and assessment Mitigation Change
Group and operating business management depend critically on 
timely and reliable information from their IT systems to run their 
businesses. The Group seeks to ensure continuous availability, 
security and operation of those information systems. 
Cyber threats to the businesses information systems have 
continued to show an increasing trend this year. 
Any disruption or denial of service may delay or impact  
decision making through lack of availability of reliable data.  
Poor information handling or interruption of business may also 
lead to reduced service to customers. Unintended actions of 
employees caused by a cyber-attack may also lead to disruption, 
including fraud.
In North American Seals, HFPG’s Aftermarket business is 
operated from a single warehouse based in Tampa, Florida 
which continues to be exposed to hurricanes during the season 
from August to November.
There is good redundancy and back-up built into 
local IT systems and the spread of businesses with 
their own stand alone IT systems also offers good 
protection from individual events. 
A member of the Executive Management Group 
maintains responsibility for ensuring each business 
in the Group has a robust cybersecurity programme 
and reports twice a year to the main Board on the 
status of cybersecurity across the Group. In 
addition, education/awareness of cyber threats 
continues to ensure Group employees protect 
themselves and Group assets.
Business continuity plans exist for each business 
with ongoing testing. During September 2017, HFPG 
successfully deployed their business continuity 
plans to mitigate the impact of Hurricane Irma.
Operational risk – Loss of key personnel
Risk description and assessment Mitigation Change
The success of the Group is built upon strong, self-standing 
management teams in the operating businesses, committed to 
the success of their respective businesses. As a result, the loss 
of key personnel can have an impact on performance, for a 
limited time period. 
The average length of service of the ca. 90 senior managers  
in the Group is 11 years and for all personnel in the Group 
is consistently ca. seven years.
Contractual terms such as notice periods and 
non-compete clauses can mitigate the risk in the 
short term. However, more successful initiatives 
focus on ensuring a challenging work environment 
with appropriate reward systems. The Group places 
very high importance on planning the development, 
motivation and reward for key managers in the 
operating businesses including:
• Ensuring a challenging working environment 
where managers feel they have control over,  
and responsibility for, their businesses. 
• Establishing management development 
programmes to ensure a broad base of  
talented managers.
• Offering a balanced and competitive 
compensation package with a combination  
of salary, annual bonus and long term cash 
incentive plans targeted at the individual 
business level.
• Giving the freedom, encouragement, financial 
resources and strategic support for managers  
to pursue ambitious growth plans. 35 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Operational risk – Product liability
Risk description and assessment Mitigation Change
There is a risk that products supplied by a Group business may 
fail in service, which could lead to a claim under product liability. 
The businesses, in their terms and conditions of sale with 
customers, will typically mirror the terms and conditions of 
purchase from the suppliers. In this way the liability can be 
limited and subrogated to the supplier.
If a legal claim is made it will typically draw in our business as  
a party to the claim and the business may be exposed to legal 
costs and potential damages if the claim succeeds and the 
supplier fails to meet its liabilities for whatever reason. Product 
liability insurance can be limited in terms of its scope of 
insurable events, such as product recall.
Technically qualified personnel and control  
systems are in place to ensure products meet 
quality requirements. The Group’s businesses are 
required to undertake Product Risk assessments 
and comprehensive Supplier Quality Assurance 
assessments. The Group has also established 
Group-wide product liability insurance which 
provides worldwide umbrella insurance cover of 
£30m across all Sectors. 
The Group’s businesses have undergone product 
liability training and are continually reviewed to 
demonstrate compliance with Group policies and 
procedures relating to product liability.
Financial risk – Foreign currency 
Risk description and assessment Mitigation Change
Foreign currency risk is the risk that currency rates will affect  
the Group’s results. The Group is exposed to two types of 
financial risk caused by currency volatility: translational 
exposure, being the effect that currency movements have on  
the Group’s financial statements on translating the results of 
overseas subsidiaries into UK sterling; and transactional 
exposure, being the effect that currency movements have on  
the results of operating businesses because their revenues or 
product costs are denominated in a currency other than their 
local currency. 
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to 
translational foreign exchange risk arising from various currency 
exposures, primarily with respect to the US dollar, the Canadian 
dollar, the Australian dollar and the Euro. The results and net 
assets of the Group’s operations outside the UK are also exposed 
to foreign currency translation risk.
A strengthening of UK sterling by 10% against all the currencies 
in which the Group does business, would reduce adjusted 
operating profit before tax by approximately £6.2m (8%), due to 
currency translation. Similarly, a strengthening of UK sterling by 
10% against all the non-UK sterling capital employed would 
reduce shareholders’ funds by £19.1m.
The Group’s UK businesses are exposed to transactional foreign 
exchange risk on those purchases that are denominated in a 
currency other than their local currency, principally US dollars 
and Euros. The Group’s Canadian and Australian businesses are 
also exposed to a similar risk as the majority of their purchases 
are denominated in US dollars and Euros. The Group’s US 
businesses do not have any material foreign currency 
transactional risk.
The Group operates across a number of diverse 
geographies but does not hedge translational 
exposure of operating profit and net assets.
The Group’s businesses may hedge up to 80% of 
forecast (being a maximum of 18 months) foreign 
currency transactional exposures using forward 
foreign exchange contracts.
The Group finance department monitors rolling 
monthly forecasts of currency exposures.
Details of average exchange rates used in the 
translation of overseas earnings and of year-end 
exchange rates used in the translation of overseas 
balance sheets, for the principal currencies used by 
the Group, are shown in note 28 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
Accounting risk – Inventory obsolescence
Risk description and assessment Mitigation Change
Working capital management is critical to success in specialised 
industrial businesses as this has a major impact on cash flow. 
The principal risk to working capital is in inventory obsolescence 
and write-off.
The charge against operating profit in respect of old or surplus 
inventory in the year was £1.3m but inventories are generally not 
subject to technological obsolescence.
Inventory write-offs are controlled and minimised 
by active management of inventory levels based  
on sales forecasts and regular cycle counts.
Where necessary, a provision is made to cover both 
excess inventory and potential obsolescence. 36 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT
Corporate Responsibility
Employees
Building and developing the skills, competencies, motivation 
and teamwork of employees is recognised by the Board as being 
essential to achieving the Group’s business objectives. The loss 
of key personnel is also identified by the Board as a Principal Risk 
as set out on page 34. The stability and commitment of the 
employees is demonstrated by the average length of service 
which is consistently high at ca. seven years. In addition, the 
number of working days lost to sickness is ca. 1% a year. These 
measures remain consistent across each of the Group’s Sectors.
Key employee statistics
2017 2016 2015
Average number of employees 
in year 1,658 1,602 1,449
Females as percentage of total 35% 36% 34%
Length of service (years) 6.7 6.7 6.6
Average staff turnover 20.6% 24.9% 23.0%
Sick days lost per person 3.3 3.1 3.0
The Group encourages healthy lifestyles and the level of sick 
days lost per person is heavily influenced by a small number of 
employees who are on long term sick leave.
Set out below is an analysis of the number of employees by 
gender at the year end:
2017 2016
Male Female Total Male Female Total
Directors 5 1 6 5 1 6
Senior 
managers 73 19 92 72 21 93
Employees 1,044 586 1,630 950 549 1,499
Total 1,122 606 1,728 1,027 571 1,598
The Board recognises the importance of gender diversity in the 
Group and 35% of the Group’s employees are female. Some of 
the Group’s operating companies have structured apprenticeship 
schemes and of the five UK based apprenticeships started in 2017, 
three of these were for females.
The Group values the commitment of its employees and 
recognises the importance of communication to good working 
relationships. The Group keeps employees informed on matters 
relating to their employment, on business developments and  
on the financial and economic factors affecting the Group.  
This is achieved through management briefings, internal 
announcements, the Group’s website and by the distribution  
of Preliminary and Interim Announcements and press releases.
Copies of the Annual Review and Annual Report & Accounts are 
also made available in the operating businesses. This 
communication programme enables employees to gain a better 
understanding of the Group’s business objectives and their roles 
in achieving them. Both employment policy and practice in the 
Group are based on non-discrimination and equal opportunities. 
Ability and aptitude are the determining factors in the selection, 
training, career development and promotion of all employees.
The Group remains supportive of the employment and 
advancement of disabled persons. Applications for employment 
by disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in  
mind the respective aptitudes and abilities of the applicants 
concerned. If an employee is, or becomes disabled during  
their period of employment, the Group will, if necessary and  
to the extent possible, adapt the work environment to enable 
the employee to continue in their current position or retrain  
the employee for duties suited to their abilities following 
disablement. At 30 September 2017, the Group employed  
seven disabled employees.
Employment policies throughout the Group have been 
established to comply with relevant local legislation and codes 
of practice relating to employment, Health & Safety and equal 
opportunities. The Group provides good quality working 
environments and facilities for employees and training and 
development appropriate to each of their roles.
The Group provides sponsorship for high potential employees 
for higher education courses where appropriate. Vocational 
training is also provided and some staff are enrolled on National 
Vocational Qualification (“NVQ”) or similar level courses. 
Employees are actively encouraged to undertake Continuing 
Professional Development (“CPD”) to maintain any relevant 
professional accreditations.
In accordance with the Market Abuse Regulation of the Financial 
Conduct Authority, employees are required to seek approval of 
the Group Company Secretary before dealing in its shares.
Health & Safety
The Group is fully committed to ensuring clean, safe and healthy 
working conditions. The Group actively promotes a strong 
safety culture and ensures a collective responsibility for 
ensuring Health & Safety standards are continually improved.
The Chief Executive Officer has overall responsibility for Health 
& Safety policies and procedures across the Group. However,  
in line with the Group’s decentralised management approach, 
accountability for Health & Safety is with local management  
to ensure compliance with local regulatory requirements, 
culture and specific business needs. The Group requires  
that each operating business conducts Health & Safety  
reviews against its specific operational risk profile and local 
regulatory requirements.
Health & Safety forms part of the induction process for new 
employees and where relevant, more specialist training is 
provided for specific functions. The Group has good coverage of 
employees who have formal Health & Safety training and/or 
qualifications and this has continued to increase during 2017.
Following the implementation of near miss reporting in 2016, 
the Group has now used its first full year of the system to  
assist in ensuring that Health & Safety hazards are proactively 
identified and appropriate mitigation put in place to ensure that 
they do not result in Health & Safety incidents.

RESPONSIBILITY 37 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
The absolute level of minor injuries has significantly reduced 
this year and also reduced when normalised to a rate per 1,000 
employees. The near miss reporting system has placed new 
emphasis on the need to identify and implement corrective 
actions prior to incidents occurring and this methodology 
indirectly assists with reducing health and safety risk. The vast 
majority of the minor injuries resulted in no lost time and were 
considered low level. The number of reportable lost time 
incidents has also reduced significantly.
All incidents are fully investigated and corrective actions and 
preventative measures put in place to ensure that the incident 
does not reoccur and future risks are mitigated.
Human rights
The Group’s activities are substantially carried out in developed 
countries that have strong legislation governing human rights. 
The Group complies fully with appropriate legislation in the 
countries in which it operates to ensure the rights of every 
employee are respected and to treat all stakeholders with 
dignity and respect. The Group promotes employment practices 
to ensure fair regard to diversity and equal opportunities. Staff 
are provided with a safe, secure and healthy environment in 
which to work. Employees have access to an independent 
hotline to report any issues relating to Human Rights violations.
Modern slavery
The Group adopted a zero tolerance approach to slavery in all  
its forms, including human trafficking, forced labour and child 
labour. In 2017, each business assessed the risk of slavery taking 
place either within the business itself or among its principal 
suppliers. Group businesses carry out due diligence of suppliers 
through questionnaires, audits and visits. Based on these 
assessments and the initiatives implemented by the businesses 
to counter slavery, the Board was assured that slavery is not 
taking place within the Group and has published a Modern 
Slavery statement on the steps taken to prevent slavery, which 
is available on the Company’s website.
Environmental
The Group comprises sales and marketing focused businesses 
which essentially receive products from suppliers and despatch 
them to customers. The Group’s businesses do not operate 
delivery fleets; they use third-party carriers to deliver their 
products to customers and to provide much of their packaging 
requirements. The Group’s ability to control the environmental 
impact of its logistics partners is therefore limited. The primary 
impact on the environment, which is entirely in the Group’s 
control, is consumption of the normal business energy sources 
such as heating and power, which the Group aims to minimise 
through compliance with relevant environmental legislation. 
The Group is committed to identifying and assessing 
environmental risks, such as packaging waste, arising from  
its operations. Waste management initiatives are encouraged 
and supported by the Group and materials are recycled where 
practical. The Group’s usage of water is minimal and relates 
to cleaning, bathrooms and staff refreshments.
Local management are committed to good environmental 
management practices throughout our operations. The 
Managing Directors have responsibility for environmental 
performance of their operating businesses and each subsidiary 
is required to implement initiatives to meet their responsibilities. 
Each facility participates in recycling paper, plastic, cardboard 
and wood from pallets and continues to focus on minimising 
energy consumption through the efficient use of heating and 
lighting. In addition, a number of the businesses now use fully 
recycled and biodegradable filler materials for packaging.
Greenhouse gas emissions
UK listed companies are required to report their global levels of 
Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emissions in their Annual Report & 
Accounts. This requirement is for disclosure of Scope 1 and 2 only 
(direct emissions e.g. heating, cooling, transport fuel; and indirect 
emissions, e.g. from purchased electricity) and only to the extent 
that such emissions are the responsibility of the Company.
The Group has considered the six main GHGs and report 
emissions in tonnes of CO
2
 equivalent (“CO
2
e”) for Scope 1 (direct) 
and Scope 2 (indirect) emissions. These emissions are calculated 
following the GHG Protocol and UK Government Environmental 
Reporting Guidelines. The Group has used Defra UK GHG 
Conversion Factors, US Environmental Protection Agency 
Emission Factors and International Energy Agency Factors.
As a distributor with no owned logistics or freight, the Group’s 
primary direct energy usage and related CO
2
 emissions arise 
from the Group’s facilities. Where possible the Group has 
reported billed data which represents ca. 80% of the Group’s 
global emissions. For the remaining entities the Group has used 
an estimation using sales data and local conversion factors.
An intensity ratio of CO
2
e per £1m revenue has been selected, 
which will allow a comparison of performance over time and 
with other similar types of business.

Business ethics
The Group recognises its obligations towards the parties with 
whom the Group has business dealings including customers, 
shareholders, employers, suppliers and advisors.
In general, the interactions with these parties are managed at a 
local level by senior management and the Group expects a high 
standard of expertise and business principles to be maintained 
in such dealings.
The Group’s policy towards suppliers is that each operating 
business is responsible for negotiating the terms and conditions 
under which they trade with their suppliers. The Group does not 
operate a formal code that it follows with regard to payments to 
suppliers. Group companies agree payment terms with their 
suppliers when they enter into binding purchasing contracts for 
the supply of goods or services. Suppliers are, in that way, made 
aware of these terms. Group companies seek to abide by these 
payment terms when they are satisfied that the supplier has 
provided the goods or services in accordance with the agreed 
terms and conditions.
Community
The Group believes that good community relations are  
important to the long term development and sustainability  
of the operating businesses. 
The Group’s businesses participate within their local 
communities on a number of charitable and fundraising 
activities primarily in support of health and children’s charities.
The Group also contributes to local worthwhile causes and 
charities and in 2017 the Group made donations to charitable 
organisations of £54,418 (2016: £44,958). No political donations 
were made. 38 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017

Dear Shareholder
The Board and its Committees have enjoyed a productive year in 
2017 guiding the Company through some important Governance 
tasks set out in the Code, namely a formal review of the 
Company’s Remuneration Policy and undertaking a tender for 
the Company’s audit engagement. As these two exercises drew 
to a close in September, the Board also embarked on a process 
to recruit a new CEO, after Bruce Thompson had notified the 
Board of his decision to retire from his role by 30 September 
2018. Bruce has been an outstanding leader of the Group for 
over 20 years and has been instrumental in developing and 
executing the existing strategy that has underpinned the 
tremendous success of the Group. 
The Board, led by the Nomination Committee, has commenced 
a formal process with a search agency to recruit a new CEO. I 
look forward to updating shareholders on this process as soon 
as we have identified a successor.
The Board recognises that the period of transition to the new 
CEO is likely to be challenging, but it is confident that with a 
proven strategy and the support of an experienced group of 
managers on the EMG, it remains in a strong position to meet 
the likely challenges during this transition year.
Corporate Governance
The Audit Committee completed a formal competitive tender 
for the external audit engagement during this year. This 
process is described in more detail in the Audit Committee 
Report. After a thorough process, the Board has resolved, 
on the recommendation of the Committee, to propose to 
shareholders that PricewaterhouseCoopers be appointed 
as auditor to the Company from 1 October 2017. On behalf 
of the Board, I wish to thank Deloitte, the retiring auditor, 
for their excellent service over the past ten years.
The Remuneration Committee completed its review of the 
Remuneration Policy for Directors during the year. Their review 
was supported by Aon Hewitt and included consultation with 
the Company’s largest shareholders who in aggregate represent 
over 50% of the Company’s ordinary shares. The review resulted 
in a tightening of some elements of the Policy to ensure the 
Company remains up to date with current best practice, 
as described further in the Remuneration Report. However the 
Board was pleased that this review also confirmed that the core 
principles of the existing Policy continued to provide a strong 
basis for linking Diploma’s strategy to Director remuneration.
The Company’s Capital Markets Day held in February this 
year provided an opportunity for shareholders and potential 
investors to meet with senior management in the Group who 
comprise the EMG. I thought it was an excellent morning which 
demonstrated very well the breadth and depth of the Group’s 
businesses and the growth opportunities that remain available 
to each of the Group’s Sectors. I would recommend that 
shareholders have a look at the videos and presentations that 
were used at this event and which are available on the 
Company’s website. 
I hope that as shareholders in the Company you will be able to 
find time to attend our AGM on Wednesday, 17 January 2018. 
It provides an excellent opportunity to meet the Board of 
Directors and challenge them on any matters you feel are 
important to the development of the Company.

Audit Committee
Chaired by Anne Thorburn
Number of meetings in the year: Eight
Role of the Committee
The Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing and 
monitoring the Company’s financial statements, accounting

and risk management procedures and also monitors issues 
relating to fraud, anti-bribery and corruption, sanctions and 
whistleblowing.
Nomination Committee
Chaired by John Nicholas
Number of meetings in the year: Three
Role of the Committee
The Nomination Committee regularly reviews the structure, size 
and composition of the Board and its Committees. It identifies 
and nominates suitable candidates to be appointed to the Board 
(subject to Board approval) and considers succession generally.
Remuneration Committee
Chaired by Andy Smith
Number of meetings in the year: Seven
Role of the Committee
The Committee reviews and recommends to the Board, the 
framework and policy for the remuneration of the Chairman and 
the Executive Directors. The remuneration of the non-Executive 
Directors is determined by the Chairman and the Executive 
Directors. The Committee takes into account the business 
strategy of the Group and how remuneration policy should 
reflect and support that strategy.
Leadership
Board composition 
The Board currently comprises a Chairman, two Executive 
Directors and three independent non-Executive Directors. The 
non-Executive Directors are appointed for specified terms and 
the details of their respective appointments are set out in the 
Remuneration Committee Report on page 57. The biographical 
details of the Board members are set out on pages 38 and 39.
John Nicholas is Chairman of the Board and the Nomination 
Committee. Each of the three independent non-Executive 
Directors performs additional roles: Charles Packshaw serves as 
Senior Independent Director, Andy Smith is Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee and Anne Thorburn is Chairman of 
the Audit Committee.
Activities of the Board
The Company’s governance framework is set out above 
together with a summary of the formal terms of reference. The 
core activities of the Board and its Committees are planned on 
an annual basis and this framework forms the basic structure 
within which the Board operates.
The Board’s terms of reference also set out the separate and 
distinct roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer.
Compliance with the Code
Diploma PLC is required to state whether it has complied with 
the Main Principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(“the Code”), issued by the Financial Reporting Council in April 
2016. Set out on pages 41 to 63 is an explanation of how the 
Company has complied with the Main Principles of the 2016 
Code. 
The Board confirms that throughout the financial year, the 
Company applied all of the Principles set out in sections A to E 
of the Code for the period under review. The Board also 
confirms that it complies with all of the Provisions of the Code 
as at the date of this Report. 
The Company’s auditor Deloitte LLP, is required to review 
whether the statement reflects the Company’s compliance 
with the Provisions of the Code specified for their review by 
the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and to report if it 
does not reflect such compliance.  42 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
GOVERNANCE
Corporate Governance  
continued
The Chairman is responsible for the overall leadership and 
governance of the Board and ensures that the Directors 
have an understanding of the views of the Company’s major 
shareholders. The Chairman sets the Board’s agenda and 
ensures that there is a healthy culture of challenge and debate 
at Board and Committee meetings.
The Board appoints the Chief Executive Officer and monitors 
his performance in leading the Company and providing 
operational and performance management in delivering the 
agreed strategy. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for 
developing, for the Board’s approval, appropriate values, culture 
and standards to guide all activities undertaken by the Company 
and for maintaining good relationships and communications 
with investors.
The approval of acquisitions, for the most part, is a matter 
reserved for the Board, save that it delegates to the Chief 
Executive Officer the responsibility for such activities to a 
specified level of authority. Similarly, there are authority levels 
covering capital expenditure which can be exercised by the Chief 
Executive Officer. Beyond these levels of authority, projects are 
referred to the Board for approval.
Other matters reserved to the Board include treasury policies, 
internal control and risk management.
To ensure that non-Executive Directors can constructively 
challenge and support proposals on strategy, the Board has 
adopted a process of reviewing and approving the agreed 
strategy for the Company on a three-yearly basis. The Board 
met for a formal review of the Company’s strategy at the end of 
June 2015 in Zurich, Switzerland. The Board received a number 
of presentations and had thorough and challenging reviews with 
Executive management. In 2017 (as in 2016), the Board reviewed 
progress against the objectives set at the Group strategy 
session in June 2015. 
In normal circumstances, the Board would expect to hold the 
next formal review of the Company’s strategy in 2018. However 
in light of the impending retirement of the Chief Executive 
Officer, this review is likely to be postponed until a new Chief 
Executive Officer has been appointed.
Meetings of the Board
The Board has seven scheduled meetings during the financial 
year but will meet more frequently if required. 
Each Director is expected to attend all meetings of the Board or 
Committees of which they are a member. In addition, senior 
management from across the Group and advisors attend certain 
meetings for the discussion of specific items in greater depth.
The Board ensures that at least one of the scheduled meetings 
is held on site at one of the Group’s facilities, where the Board 
has an opportunity to both receive presentations from local 
management and meet employees of that business. In March 
2017, the Board’s scheduled meeting was held at Kentek’s new 
facility in Helsinki. At this meeting the Board received 
presentations from senior management in Kentek and had an 
opportunity to view the new facility and meet with employees 
to gain a better understanding of the products and operation 
managed from this facility. 
In September 2017 the Board’s scheduled meeting reviewed the 
Group’s strategic objectives identified at the strategy session 
held in 2015 and the Chief Executive Officer provided an update 
on the progress achieved in implementing these objectives. 
This exposure to the members of senior management from 
across the businesses helps enhance the Board’s understanding 
of the businesses, the implementation of strategy and the 
changing dynamics of the markets in which the businesses 
operate. 
Effectiveness
Independent non-Executive Directors
The non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board to  
be independent in character and judgement and there are no 
relationships or circumstances which could affect, or appear to 
affect, a Director’s judgement. The Chairman, John Nicholas 
was considered independent by the Board both at the time of 
his appointment as Director on 1 June 2013 and as Chairman on 
21 January 2015. In accordance with the Code, the ongoing test 
of independence for the Chairman is not relevant. 
All non-Executive Directors are advised of the likely time 
commitments at appointment. The ability of individual  
Directors to allocate sufficient time to the discharge of their 
responsibilities is considered as part of the Directors’ annual 
evaluation process, overseen by the Chairman. Any issues 
concerning the Chairman’s time commitment are dealt with by 
the Nomination Committee, chaired for this purpose by the 
Senior Independent Director.
Each non-Executive Director is required to inform the Board 
of any changes to their other appointments.
During the year, the Chairman has also held meetings with  
the non-Executive Directors, without the Executive Directors 
present.
The appointments of non-Executive Directors are subject 
to formal, rigorous and transparent procedures which are 
described more fully in the Nomination Committee Report 
which is set out on page 50.
Diversity
The Board is committed to a culture of equal opportunity 
and diversity to attract and retain talented people to deliver 
outstanding performance and further enhance the success 
of the Group.
In that culture, diversity across a wide range of criteria is valued, 
including skills, knowledge and experience as well as gender, 
ethnicity, religion and sexual orientation. People are appointed 
on merit, in an equal opportunities environment and without 
any form of positive or negative discrimination. External 
consultants, when used, are made aware of this policy.
The Nomination Committee reviews the structure, size, 
diversity, balance and composition of the Board and makes 
recommendations to the Board concerning the reappointment 
of any non-Executive Director at the conclusion of their specified 
term of office and in the identification and nomination of new 
Directors. The principal objective of the Nomination Committee 
is to ensure that all candidates have appropriate knowledge, 
ability and experience for the role. 
The Board supports the recommendations of the Davies review 
on gender diversity but believes that other types of diversity are 
equally important. The Board is currently diverse across a range 
of criteria but it is committed to strengthen that diversity, 
including gender and ethnic diversity, when appropriate 
opportunities arise. The Board will also take account of its 
objective to meet the Davies review targets before the end 
of the next Board rotation of non-Executive Directors.  43 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Information and professional development
An induction programme is agreed for all new Directors aimed 
at ensuring that they are able to develop an understanding 
and awareness of the Group’s core processes, its people and 
businesses. The non-Executive Directors’ awareness of the 
businesses is further developed through periodic visits to the 
principal business locations and presentations to the Board 
by senior management of the businesses. In 2017, the Board 
received presentations from senior management of the 
Kentek business.
Following the new appointments to the Board in 2015, a 
managed induction programme was set up which included a 
visit by each of the new non-Executive Directors to the major 
business units in each of the Group’s Sectors where they have 
an opportunity to meet with senior management in these 
businesses. Meetings were also held individually between each 
of the non-Executive Directors and the Executive Directors and 
with some of the principal advisors to the Company.
The Chairman, with the assistance of the Chief Executive Officer 
and the Group Company Secretary, is responsible for ensuring 
that Directors are supplied with information in a timely manner 
that is in a form and of a quality appropriate to enable them to 
discharge their duties. In the normal course of business, the 
Chief Executive Officer gives an oral report to the Board at each 
meeting and information is provided and reported through 
formal Board reports that include information on operational 
matters and strategic developments. There are also reports 
on the performance of the Group’s businesses, financial 
performance relative to the budget, risk management, business 
development and investor relations.
The training needs of the Directors are periodically discussed at 
Board meetings and where appropriate, briefings as necessary 
are provided on various elements of corporate governance and 
other regulatory issues.
The Chairman has reviewed and agreed the training and 
development needs of individuals Directors and encourages 
them to continually update their skills, together with knowledge 
and familiarity with the Company to fulfil their role on the Board 
and Board Committees.
The Group Company Secretary acts as an advisor to the Board 
on matters concerning governance and regulatory issues and 
ensures compliance with Board procedures. All Directors have 
access to his advice. The appointment and removal of the Group 
Company Secretary and his remuneration are matters for the 
Board as a whole.
Board evaluation
The Board undertakes an externally led evaluation of the 
effectiveness of the Board every three years, in accordance with 
the Code. This exercise encompasses an evaluation of the Board 
as a whole, the Board Committee and of individual Directors. 
The last externally led evaluation was carried out in July 2015 
and the external facilitator concluded that the Board’s 
effectiveness at that time was very strong. A similar external 
evaluation exercise is scheduled to be carried out again in 2018. 
In those years when an external evaluation is not performed,  
the Board undertakes an internal evaluation of the Board’s 
effectiveness using specially designed evaluation forms and 
under the direction of the Chairman. This exercise encompasses 
an evaluation of the performance of the Board as a whole, as 
well as of each of the Committees and individuals. Feedback on 
Board performances is presented by the Chairman to the Board 
and actions and objectives are agreed for the following year. 
The internal Board evaluation was carried out in August 2017 
and results of this review were again satisfactory. 
The issues identified in this evaluation were more broadly 
focused on matters that the Board believed should be further 
developed for later discussion at meetings of the Board or in 
the next review of Company strategy. There were no significant 
issues identified that required immediate attention. There were 
also no negative performance issues identified from the 
evaluation that related to individual Directors or the 
performance of the Board Committees.
The Board also received an update on progress made with 
implementing those recommendations arising from the internal 
evaluations carried out in 2016. These primarily related to the 
non-Executive Directors wishing to receive more information on 
the competitive factors facing the principal businesses in each 
Sector, on a review of the potential impact of innovative and/or 
disruptive technologies on the Group’s businesses and further 
discussions on strategies to manage the Group in a post Brexit 
and particularly lower growth environment. 
The Board agenda during 2017 has included discussions to 
address these recommendations more generally. However a 
comprehensive review of each of these topics will be included 
in the next Board meeting on Company strategy. 
The Senior Independent Director, together with the non-
Executive Directors also carries out each year and has done so 
in 2017, a performance evaluation of the Chairman, having taken 
account of the views of all of the Directors. 
Re-election
All Directors of the Board are subject to election by the 
shareholders at the first AGM following their appointment by the 
Board and in accordance with the Code, all Directors will also 
stand for re-election annually at the AGM.
Liability insurance
In line with market practice, each Director is covered by 
appropriate directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (“D&O”), 
at the Company’s expense. The D&O insurance covers 
the Directors and Officers against the costs of defending 
themselves in legal proceedings taken against them in that 
capacity and in respect of any damages resulting from those 
proceedings. The Company also indemnifies its Directors and 
Officers to the extent permitted by law. Neither the insurance 
nor the indemnity provides cover where the Director or Officer 
has acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Professional advice
A policy is in place pursuant to which each Director may obtain 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense. 
In furtherance of their duties as a Director of Diploma PLC. 
No formal requests were made during the year, but post-year 
end, advice was sought in relation to Board succession. In 
addition, each of the Committees are authorised, through their 
Terms of Reference, to seek advice at the Company’s expense. 
During the year, advice was sought by the Remuneration 
Committee in relation to the development of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy.
Conflicts of interest
Directors are subject to a statutory duty under the Companies 
Act 2006 (“the Act”) to avoid a situation where they have, or 
could have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly 
could conflict, with the Company’s interests. The Act allows 
directors of public companies to authorise conflicts and 
potential conflicts where appropriate, where the Articles of 
Association (“the Articles”) contain a provision to this effect.  
The Act also allows the Articles to contain other provisions for 
dealing with Directors’ conflicts of interest to avoid a breach  
of duty.  44 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
GOVERNANCE
Corporate Governance  
continued
Procedures adopted to deal with conflicts of interest continue 
to operate effectively and the Board’s authorisation powers are 
being exercised properly in accordance with the Company’s 
Articles.
Accountability
The Board is responsible for ensuring that the Annual Report 
& Accounts taken as a whole present a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Group and provides the 
information necessary to shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy. This is 
achieved through this Annual Report & Accounts, the Annual 
Review and through other periodic financial statements 
and announcements.
The Board is responsible for determining the nature and extent 
of the principal risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategic 
objectives and for maintaining sound risk management and 
internal control systems. The Board is also responsible for 
monitoring the Group’s risk management and internal control 
systems and it reviews the effectiveness of these systems 
through the work of the Audit Committee. 
The principal risks which the Board has identified this year are 
set out in the section on Internal Control and Risk Management 
on pages 32 to 35 of the Strategic Report. 
Relations with shareholders
The Company has a well-developed investor relations 
programme managed by the Chief Executive Officer and Group 
Finance Director. Through this programme, the Company 
maintains regular contact with major shareholders to 
communicate clearly the Group’s objectives and monitors 
movements in significant shareholdings.
During the past several years, these communications have been 
enhanced by the introduction of Investor Days, both in the UK 
and in Canada which were well attended. In addition, Investor 
Roadshows are now held each year in the US and Canada as well 
as in the UK and formal investor presentations are made twice a 
year to groups of private client fund managers. 
The Company also engages with existing and potential new 
investors through a formal Capital Markets Day at which 
attendees have an opportunity to meet with senior 
management in the Group to gain a better understanding  
of the businesses’ product portfolios. 
In February 2017, a Capital Markets Day was held in London 
which was attended by over 50 members of the investment 
community. This proved to be a very successful event for the 
Company and further details are set out on page 9 in the Chief 
Executive’s Review.
Most shareholder contact is with the Chief Executive Officer and 
Group Finance Director through presentations made twice a 
year on the operating and financial performance of the Group 
and its longer term strategy. The Chief Executive Officer and 
Group Finance Director generally deal with questions from 
individual shareholders. 
The Group’s website contains up-to-date information for 
shareholders which includes the Annual Report & Accounts  
of the past eight years, current and historic share price 
information, news releases and presentations to analysts and 
key shareholders. The website also contains factual data on the 
Group’s businesses, products and services.
The non-Executive Directors are given regular updates as to the 
views of institutional shareholders and an independent insight is 
sought through research carried out twice a year by the 
Company’s advisors, focused on both investors and analysts.
Through these processes, the Board is kept abreast of key 
issues and the opportunity is available on request for 
shareholders to meet the Chairman or Senior Independent 
Director, separately from the Executive Directors.
Electronic communications to shareholders include the Notice 
of the AGM which is sent at least 20 working days prior to the 
meeting. The Company proposes a separate resolution on each 
separate issue and for each resolution, proxy appointment 
forms provide shareholders with the option to vote in advance 
of the AGM.
All shareholders have the opportunity to put questions at the 
Company’s AGM, when the Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer give a statement on the Group’s performance during the 
year, together with a statement on current trading conditions. 
The Chairman of the Board and of the Remuneration and Audit 
Committees are available to answer questions at the meeting.
The Board has resolved, in line with best practice, to conduct a 
poll on each resolution proposed at the AGM. The results of the 
AGM resolutions, including details of votes cast, are published 
on the Company’s website.
With regard to shareholder meetings, other than AGMs, the 
Board will continue, in ordinary circumstances, to provide as 
much notice as possible and certainly no less than 14 working 
days. However, the Board considers that it should still retain the 
flexibility to reduce the timescale to 14 clear days in the case of 
non-routine business and where it is merited by the business of 
the meeting. For this reason, the Board has again proposed a 
resolution at the AGM to reduce the notice period for General 
Meetings from 21 to no less than 14 clear days. 45 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017

Dear Shareholder
The Committee’s work this year has been largely focused on 
carrying out a tender process for the Company and Group audit 
engagement, as Deloitte will have completed ten years as 
auditor at the end of the 2017 financial year. 
The process was very thorough, beginning in January this year 
and concluding in early September and is explained further on 
page 47. The Committee was pleased with the strong quality of 
presentations received from each of the participating audit 
firms, but unfortunately there could only be one successful firm. 
After a close contest, the Committee unanimously agreed to 
recommend that the Board appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers as 
auditor with effect from 2018. This appointment remains subject 
to the approval of shareholders at the AGM in January 2018.
On behalf of the Committee, I wish to thank Ed Hanson and his 
team at Deloitte, the retiring audit firm, for their excellent 
service and wise counsel to the Committee over many years. 
Audit Committee Report
Anne Thorburn, Chairman of the Audit Committee
“I wish to thank Deloitte, the 
retiring audit firm, for their 
excellent service and wise 
counsel to the Committee 
over many years. ”
The breadth of the Group’s operations has expanded 
substantially through acquisition in recent years. The 
Committee was therefore pleased that the Group’s Internal 
Audit function was strengthened during the year with the 
recruitment of an experienced and multi-lingual auditor from 
one of the “Big 4” firms. The Committee places strong reliance 
on Internal Audit’s ability to visit each of the Group’s operating 
businesses during the course of a year, particularly given the 
Group’s decentralised operating model. As Chairman of the 
Committee, I find it very helpful to meet regularly with members 
of the team to discuss their reports. This provides me with 
greater insight of the overall culture of the internal control 
environment in the Group. 
I am pleased to report that there were no significant control 
deficiencies or accounting irregularities reported to the 
Committee during the year. The Group continues to maintain  
a strong culture of robust and effective systems of internal 
control, overseen by strong and experienced finance 
departments. 
I look forward to meeting shareholders at the AGM on 17 January 
2018 and will be happy to respond to any questions relating to 
the activities of the Audit Committee.

its responsibilities.
Audit Committee
The Committee is chaired by Anne Thorburn and comprises 
three independent non-Executive Directors. The Chair of the 
Committee is a qualified accountant, who has recent and 
relevant financial experience. 
The Audit Committee is satisfied that as a whole, the 
Committee has sufficient knowledge and competence in the 
business sectors in which the Group operates in order to provide 
appropriate challenge to management.
The Group Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the 
Committee. The Executive Directors also attend Committee 
meetings and the Internal Audit Manager also attended two 
Committee meetings. The Committee met with the external 
auditor during the year, without the Executive Directors  
being present. 
Engagement of the external auditor
The external auditor is engaged to express an opinion on the 
financial statements of the Group and of the Company. The 
audit includes the review and testing of the systems of internal 
financial control and the data contained in the financial 
statements, to the extent necessary for expressing an audit 
opinion on the truth and fairness of the financial statements.
Deloitte LLP has been the Company’s auditor since its 
appointment in 2008. Deloitte LLP provides the Committee with 
relevant reports, reviews and advice throughout the year, as set 
out in their terms of engagement. 
In accordance with UK regulations, the Company’s auditor 
adheres to a rotation policy based on best practice and a new 
Group lead engagement partner was appointed in 2013 in place 
of the previous lead engagement partner who had completed  
a term of five years in that role. 
During the year, the Committee carried out an assessment of 
the effectiveness of the external audit process. The assessment 
was led by the Chair of the Committee, assisted by the Group 
Finance Director and focused on certain criteria which the 
Committee considered to be important factors in demonstrating 
an effective audit process. These factors included the quality 
of audit staff, the planning and execution of the audit and 
the role of management in the audit process. Following this 
assessment, the Committee concluded that the external audit 
process remained effective and that it provides an appropriate 
independent challenge of the Group’s senior management.
The Committee was satisfied that Deloitte provided a robust 
and effective audit and supports the work of the Committee 
through clear and objective communication on developments  
in financial reporting and governance.  47 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Audit tender
During the year, with Deloitte approaching the end of their 
ten-year term as the Group’s auditor at 30 September 2017, 
the Company carried out a formal competitive tender for the 
external audit engagement. The tender process began early in 
2017 and was overseen by the Chair of the Committee, together 
with the assistance of the Group Financial Controller. The tender 
process was carried out in accordance with best practice 
guidelines provided by the FRC and the Investment Association. 
The Committee reviewed a potential list of audit firms to be 
invited to tender for the audit and concluded that, in light of 
the size and geographic spread of the Group’s businesses, an 
audit firm from the “Big 4” would be most appropriate for the 
Group audit engagement. In March 2017, formal invitations 
to tender were sent to each of the audit firms, including the 
incumbent firm, Deloitte. These letters set out a schedule 
of matters to be addressed in the tender presentations, the 
proposed timetable and a set of confidential documents relating 
to the Group’s reporting processes and the key criteria that the 
Committee would use to evaluate the tender process. Each 
audit firm was also invited to visit the senior management 
teams in the principal businesses, as part of the tender process.
The Committee received written proposals from each of  
the four audit firms in May, which was followed in June  
by a formal presentation by each firm to a meeting of the 
Committee, which included the Chairman, the Executive 
Directors and the Group Financial Controller. The Committee 
scored each audit firm against criteria of capability, cultural fit, 
audit quality, resource and proposed fees. These scores 
were used to reduce the tender process to a shortlist of  
two audit firms. 
At the end of August, following further soundings and the 
taking up of references, the Audit Committee recommended 
to the Board the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP (“PwC”) as auditors for the year ending 30 September 
2018 for a period of up to ten years. The final decision was 
judged against the principal selection criteria of capability, 
audit quality and cultural fit. The Board accepted and endorsed 
this recommendation, which is now subject to shareholder 
approval at the AGM to be held on 17 January 2018. 
Following the announcement to shareholders on 5 September 
2017 of the Board’s proposal to appoint PwC, a transition 
plan was agreed with PwC which highlights key milestones, 
beginning with PwC shadowing Deloitte at the 2017 Group 
audit close meeting with management and attendance 
at the Audit Committee meeting held on 14 November 
2017. PwC do not provide any non-audit services to the 
Company or its subsidiaries and have confirmed their 
independence as at 1 October to the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee confirms that the Company has complied 
with the provisions of the Competition & Markets Authority 
Order throughout its financial year ended 30 September 2017 
and up to the date of this report.

GOVERNANCE
Financial reporting and significant judgements
As part of its monitoring of the integrity of the financial 
statements, the Committee reviews whether suitable 
accounting policies have been adopted and whether 
management has made appropriate estimates and judgements 
and seeks support from the external auditor to assess them. 
The main areas of focus reviewed in the year ended 
30 September 2017 are set out below: 
Impairment of goodwill
The Committee considered the carrying value of goodwill and 
the assumptions underlying the impairment review. The 
judgements in relation to goodwill impairment largely relate to 
the assumptions underlying the calculations of the value in use 
of the Sector being tested for impairment. These judgements 
are primarily the calculation of the discount rate, the 
achievability of strategic business plans and macroeconomic 
assumptions underlying the valuation process. This area is a 
prime source of audit focus and accordingly the external auditor 
provided detailed reporting to the Committee.
Accounting for acquisitions
The Committee reviewed the accounting for acquisitions 
completed during the year and the assumptions underlying the 
valuation of intangible assets. They discussed the nature of the 
intangible assets with the Group Finance Director and the period 
over which these assets are to be amortised. The Committee also 
discussed the fair value adjustments and the value attributed to 
deferred consideration. The Committee also discussed with  
the external auditor the work they had carried out to satisfy 
themselves that the valuation assumptions were appropriate. 
Valuation of inventory
The Committee reviewed the Report of the Group Finance 
Director that set out the gross balances by business, together 
with any related provision against the carrying value. The 
Committee reviewed the bases used to value and confirm 
existence of inventory held across the Group; they also 
considered the appropriateness of provisions held against  
the carrying value of inventory, having regard to the age and 
volumes of inventory, relative to expected usage. This matter 
was also discussed with the external auditor. 
The Committee was satisfied that each of the matters set out 
above had been fully and adequately addressed by the Executive 
Directors, appropriately tested and reviewed by the external 
auditor and that the disclosures made in the Annual Report & 
Accounts were appropriate. 
In addition to the main areas reviewed above, the Committee 
also seeks confirmation from the auditor that the Group’s 
businesses follow appropriate policies to recognise material 
streams of revenue and that the audit work carried out more 
generally has assessed any instances where management may 
be able to override key internal controls designed to guard 
against fraud or material misstatement. The auditor also reports 
to the Committee on other less material matters in relation to 
accounting for the Group’s two pension scheme arrangements, 
(accounted for in accordance with IAS19 (Revised)) and the 
Group’s taxation position.
Non-audit services 
The Committee has reviewed its internal guidelines covering  
the type of non-audit work that can be carried out by the 
external auditor of the Company, in light of the new regulation 
set out in the EU Audit Directive and Audit Regulation 2014  
(“the Regulations”). These Regulations came into force on 
17 June 2016 and applied to the Company from 1 October 2017. 
The Regulations substantially curtail those non-audit services 
which can be provided by the auditor to the Company and in 
particular, prohibits all tax related services, including compliance 
services as well as general advice and all consultancy and 
advisory services. The Regulations require that Board approval is 
required if eligible non-audit services, such as due diligence and 
similar assurance services exceed 30% of the prior year Group 
audit fee and the Company may not allow eligible non-audit 
services to exceed 70% of the Group audit fee, calculated on  
a rolling three-year basis. 
In Diploma PLC, taxation services are not provided by the 
Group’s current or proposed audit firm; a separate firm is 
retained to provide tax advice and any assistance with tax 
compliance matters generally. In addition, due diligence 
exercises on acquisitions and similar transactions are not 
provided by the auditor, but are placed with other firms.
The Group auditor is retained to carry out assurance services  
to the Committee in connection with carrying out “agreed  
upon procedures” on the Group’s Half Year consolidated 
financial statements.
The Group Finance Director does not have delegated authority 
to engage the auditor to carry out any non-audit work, but must 
seek approval from the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
The Committee assures itself of the auditor’s independence by 
receiving regular reports from the external auditor which provide 
details of any assignments and related fees carried out by the 
auditor in addition to their normal audit work and these are 
reviewed against the above guidelines.
Details of the external auditor’s total fees, including non-audit 
fees of £13,000 paid to Deloitte LLP during the year are set out 
in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements.
Risk management and internal control
The principal risks and uncertainties which are currently judged 
to have the most significant impact on the Group’s long term 
performance are set out in a separate section of the Strategic 
Report on Internal Control and Risk Management on pages 32  
to 35. 
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of 
the Group’s system of internal control. The system of internal 
control is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Board has established a clear organisational structure  
with defined authority levels. The day-to-day running of the 
Group’s business is delegated to the Executive Directors of the 
Company. The Executive Directors visit each operating unit on  
a regular basis and meet with both operational and finance 
management and staff.
Key financial and operational measures relating to revenues, 
cash and receivables are reported on a weekly basis. Detailed 
management accounts and KPIs are prepared monthly using a 
robust proprietary reporting system to collect and analyse 
financial data in a consistent format. Monthly results are 
measured against both budget and half year reforecasts which 
have been approved and reviewed by the Board. All capital 
expenditure above predefined amounts must be supported by a 
paper prepared by business management. 
Audit Committee Report  
continued 49 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
All financial data is taken directly from the trial balances of each 
business held in their local ERP systems and reanalysed and 
formatted in a separate Group management reporting system, 
operated by the Group finance department. There is no rekeying 
of financial data and very limited use is made of spreadsheets  
by the Group businesses to report monthly financial results.  
The Group finance department continues to develop the 
functionality of this management reporting system to provide 
greater insights into the activities of the Group’s businesses, 
both financial and operational. The Group’s internal auditor 
regularly audits the base data at each business to ensure  
it is properly reported through to the Group management 
reporting system. 
As part of the year end close process each business is required 
to complete a self-assessment which evaluates their financial 
control environment in the business designed to identify 
weaknesses in controls. These assessments are critically 
reviewed by the Group’s Internal Audit manager and a summary 
for each business is prepared for the Audit Committee. In 
addition, senior management of each business are required  
to confirm their adherence with Group accounting policies, 
processes and systems of internal control by means of a 
representation letter addressed to the Audit Committee. 
The Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s 
risk management and internal control systems for the period 
from 1 October 2016 to the date of this Report. Taking into 
account the matters set out on pages 32 to 35 relating to 
principal risks and uncertainties and the reports from the 
Internal Audit manager, the Board, with the advice of the 
Committee, is satisfied that the Group has in place effective  
risk management and internal control systems.
Internal Audit
The Group maintains a small Internal Audit department which 
reports directly to both the Group Finance Director and Chair of 
the Audit Committee. The department comprises an Internal 
Audit manager, based in one of the Group’s businesses in 
Minneapolis, US and an experienced Senior Internal auditor 
based in the Group’s offices in London. 
A full programme of Internal Audit visits has been completed 
during the year. The scope of work carried out by Internal Audit 
generally focuses on the internal financial controls and risk 
management procedures operating within each business. In 
January the Internal Audit manager presents his Audit Plan for 
the year to the Committee for their approval. Formal written 
reports are prepared on the results of each Internal Audit visit 
which set out weaknesses identified during their work, together 
with recommendations to improve the control environment. 
These reports are discussed with management of the business 
visited and are reviewed by the appropriate member of the 
Executive Management Group. 
At the end of the financial year, the Internal Audit manager 
formally reports to the Committee on the results of the Internal 
Audit work carried out by his department during the year. The 
Committee reviews management’s responses to matters raised, 
including the time taken to resolve such matters. The Audit 
Chair also meets separately with the Internal Audit manager at 
least twice a year to review some of the department’s reports 
and discuss their findings. 
There were no significant or high risk matters identified in the 
internal audits undertaken during the current financial year. 
Several recommendations were made to the businesses with 
regard to formalising and improving their inventory cycle count 
procedures and improving the regularity and depth of credit 
control assessments of customers with large credit balances. 
The Internal Audit manager also reported that good progress 
have been made with addressing those recommendations made 
in 2016 in connection with inadequate inventory reconciliations 
and more detailed employee expense reporting. It was also 
identified that further work is still required in some businesses 
to tighten up access controls in their ERP systems.
The work of the Internal Audit department was also extended 
this year to review and report on progress made by Group 
businesses in ensuring that their control environment was 
sufficiently robust to resist cyber-attacks. This work identified  
a number of instances where systems need to be upgraded and 
strengthened and these results were reported to the member  
of the EMG who has been given responsibility for managing and 
reporting to the Board on the Group’s cybersecurity status.
The Internal Audit department also continues to monitor the 
businesses compliance with Group policies on anti-bribery/
corruption and sanctions.
The Committee is satisfied that the Internal Audit department  
is sufficiently independent of Executive management and has 
sufficient resources and scope that is appropriate for the size 
and nature of Diploma PLC.
Sanctions
The Audit Committee continued to work with senior 
management of the Company, in conjunction with local 
management of Kentek’s Russian operations, to ensure ongoing 
compliance with EU and US led sanctions. The Committee has 
received reports on compliance with these sanctions and will 
continue to monitor developments until the sanctions are 
suspended or revoked. 
Anti-bribery and whistleblowing
Diploma maintains a Group-wide policy on anti-bribery/
corruption which addresses the requirements of the Bribery Act 
2010. The Committee periodically reviews this policy and the 
procedures to ensure continued and effective compliance in its 
businesses around the world. During the year, the Group rolled 
out a refresher using an e-learning training programme to all its 
business. This training has been undertaken by all senior 
management and employees in customer or supplier facing 
roles and in particular by management and employees from 
companies that have recently joined the Diploma Group. The 
e-learning training programme is being extended to encompass 
other regulatory and compliance based topics, including a Code  
of Conduct. 
The Committee also monitors the Group’s Whistleblowing 
policy, which provides the framework to encourage and give 
employees confidence to “blow the whistle” and report 
irregularities. The policy, together with Hotline posters are 
placed on site noticeboards across the Group. Employees are 
encouraged to raise concerns via the confidential Hotline which 
is managed by an independent external company. Reports to 
the hotline are investigated and reported to the Committee, 
together with details of corrective action taken. The Group 
received three Whistleblowing reports during the year. On 
further review and investigation, the Committee concluded that 
all three reports essentially related to grievance issues in the 
workplace and the concerns reported to the Committee were 
satisfactorily resolved under the business grievance policy  
and procedures.  50 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017

The Nomination Committee is chaired by John Nicholas, the 
Chairman of the Company. The Committee is chaired by the 
Senior Independent Director on any matter concerning the 
chairmanship of the Company. The Committee comprises the 
non-Executive Directors and meets as necessary to discharge 
its responsibilities. 
The Group Company Secretary acts as Secretary to  
the Committee. 
Appointment of Directors
The Committee will always appoint an external search 
consultancy, which does not have any connection with the 
Company, to assess potential candidates to be considered as 
prospective non-Executive Directors and where appropriate, 
Executive Directors. As part of any appointment process, the 
Committee determines the selection criteria for each Director 
which takes account of diversity, including gender and sets out a 
detailed description of the requirements for the role. The 
Committee works closely with the external search consultancy 
who draw up a long list of candidates from a range of industries 
and backgrounds for initial appraisal by the Committee. From 
this, a shortlist is prepared of suitable candidates that most 
closely meet the selection criteria and these candidates are 
interviewed by members of the Committee and Executive 
Directors. Following these interviews, the Committee 
recommends to the Board the appointment of a Director. 
Retirement of the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”)
On 26 September 2017, Bruce Thompson informed the Board of 
his intention to retire as CEO of Diploma PLC before the end of 
September 2018 and to terminate his employment with the 
Company with effect from 30 September 2018. In compliance 
with the Committee’s procedures on appointment of Directors, 
the Committee, after appropriate consideration and review, 
retained Ridgeway Partners (“Ridgeway”) a search consultancy 
to lead a process to recruit a new CEO. Ridgeway does not 
provide any other services to, or have any connection with  
the Company. 
The Committee is keen to find a successful senior business 
executive with broad management experience of an international 
industrial focused business. The Committee has considered the 
challenges and opportunities facing the Group currently and in 
the future. With this background, the Committee prepared and 
agreed a detailed specification for the role with Ridgeway, which 
identified the background, skills, knowledge and experience that 
will be required of the Company’s CEO in the future. A list of 
potential candidates has been prepared and provided to the 
Committee and the search for a new CEO is progressing well. 
Further details of the process will be set out in the 2018 Annual 
Report & Accounts. 
Succession planning
The Committee reviews succession planning, taking into 
account the challenges and opportunities facing the Group and 
the background skills and expertise that will be required by the 
Board in the future. As part of this exercise development plans 
are agreed to target potential successor senior management in 
the Group over the next five years. 
In January each year the Committee also reviews management 
succession planning processes in relation to the Company’s 
senior executives, which comprise a cadre of ca. 90 senior 
managers across the Group’s businesses. 
The Committee has reviewed succession planning for the 
non-Executive Directors. While the Board has been recently 
refreshed, the Chairman’s intention is to stagger retirement 
among the non-Executive Directors in order to maintain 
continuity and to preserve Board balance. 
As part of the review of the composition of the Board and the 
succession planning process set out above, both the Board and 
the Committee recognise the importance of both gender and 
ethnic diversity throughout the Group. 
Committee evaluation
During the year, an evaluation of the performance of the 
Committee and its members was undertaken in line with  
the Committee’s Terms of Reference. The evaluation of the 
performance of the Committee concluded that the Committee 
operates effectively.

Dear Shareholder
The work of the Committee this year has been focused 
on the review of the Remuneration Policy for Directors, 
which is required by law to be resubmitted to shareholders 
for approval at the Company’s AGM every three years. 
The Committee’s view is that the existing Policy has served the 
Company well and the fundamental design continues to provide 
a strong basis for linking Diploma’s strategy and performance to 
Executive remuneration. This was confirmed in a detailed 
consultation exercise carried out by Aon Hewitt, who were 
re-appointed by the Committee this year (see page 52) to advise 
on the latest developments in best practice for Executive 
remuneration. There were however, some areas identified 
where changes could be made to adopt present best practice 
and improve the Policy. The principal proposed changes are 
as follows: 
• Annual performance bonus deferral – to ensure shareholder 
alignment, a requirement has been introduced to defer 50%  
of any bonus awarded (net of tax) into shares until minimum 
shareholding guideline levels have been achieved.
• Long term incentive awards – to reflect developments in best 
practice and the Board’s continued focus on long term 
shareholder alignment, a post-vesting holding period of two 
years will now apply to new awards granted after the adoption 
of the new Policy.
• Shareholder guidelines – an increase has been made to the 
current guidelines so that all Executive Directors will be 
required to hold 200% of base salary in shares (currently 200% 
for the CEO and 100% for other Executive Directors). 
• Clarification of the treatment of long term incentive awards 
in a good leaver situation – the policy around vesting 
“Our new Remuneration Policy 
aligns with best practice  
and provides a strong  
basis for linking Diploma’s 
strategy and performance 
to Executive remuneration. ”
timeframes has been clarified to ensure alignment with best 
practice for new awards granted after the adoption of the  
new Policy.
No other significant changes to the Policy are proposed and 
the maximum incentive opportunity remains unchanged as 
described on page 54. I wrote to the 12 largest shareholders in 
October and to three proxy advisors to explain the proposed 
changes and to ask for their feedback. The feedback I have 
received has been supportive of the proposed changes. Subject 
to shareholder approval at the AGM on 17 January 2018, it is 
intended that the new Policy will apply until the next triennial 
review due at the AGM in 2021. 
This year’s Annual Report on Remuneration is set out on pages 58 
to 63 of the Annual Report & Accounts. The current Remuneration 
Policy, approved by shareholders in 2015, has been applied and no 
discretion has been applied by the Committee.
Base salaries for Executive Directors for the new financial year 
(that is, from 1 October 2017) will increase by 3.0% (2016: 2.5%) 
taking into account the salary increases applying across the 
senior management cadre and generally across the Group. 
The financial element of the annual performance bonus paid 
to the Executive Directors this year was at the maximum (2016: 
ca. 95%) as determined by the targets set for the increase in 
adjusted earnings per share. The Group delivered an increase of 
19% in adjusted earning per share (“EPS”) which the Committee 
considers to be an exceptional performance in the current 
environment and which has helped underpin the strength 
of the Company’s share price this year. In the year ending 
30 September 2018, adjusted operating profit on a constant 
currency basis will replace adjusted EPS as the primary measure 
of financial performance in the annual performance bonus.
The LTIP awards for the three years ended 30 September 2017 
vested at 89% of the maximum (2016: 45%), supported by an 
upper quartile FTSE 250 performance in terms of total return to 
shareholders (average 20% p.a. each year over three years) and 
average compound growth of 11% p.a. in adjusted EPS. As much 
of this period was during a global environment of sluggish 
growth, the Committee considers the level of LTIP awards to 
be appropriate. 
I look forward to meeting shareholders at this year’s AGM on 
17 January 2018 and will be pleased to answer any questions or 
concerns they have on the Company’s remuneration policies.

Remuneration Committee Report  
continued
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) is chaired by 
Andy Smith and comprises independent non-Executive Directors.
Bruce Thompson, Chief Executive Officer, attends meetings at the 
invitation of the Committee to provide advice to the Committee 
to help it make informed decisions. The Group Company Secretary 
attends meetings as Secretary to the Committee.
The Remuneration Committee Report
The Report has again been presented this year in two sections. 
The first section sets out the Director’s Remuneration Policy 
(“the Policy”), which will be subject to a binding triennial vote  
by shareholders at the AGM on 17 January 2018.
In preparation for the triennial approval by shareholders of the 
Policy at the AGM on 17 January 2018, the Committee undertook 
a review of its Policy for Directors to ensure that it remained 
appropriate with the Company strategy and reflected the latest 
developments in remuneration best practice. 
Work began in January 2017 when meetings were held with four 
remuneration consultancy firms to discuss their assessment  
of the Group’s present Policy and to hear their proposals for 
becoming remuneration advisors to the Committee. Aon Hewitt 
was judged to offer the best service and value and consequently 
was reappointed.
Following a detailed consultation exercise with Aon Hewitt,  
the Committee concluded that the existing Policy continues  
to provide a strong basis for linking Diploma’s strategy and 
performance to Executive Remuneration. However, the 
Committee also identified some areas where changes should  
be made to apply current best practice and improve the Policy. 
These changes are summarised in the letter from the Chairman 
of the Committee on page 51 and are reflected in the new 
revised Remuneration Policy Table set out on pages 53 and 54.
This revised new Policy, will, subject to shareholder approval 
at the AGM on 17 January 2018, continue for a period of three 
years until 16 January 2021, unless replaced or amended by a 
new Policy.
The second section of this Report sets out the annual 
remuneration paid to the Directors in the year ended 30 September 
2017 in accordance with the existing Remuneration Policy approved 
on 21 January 2015. This section of the Report will continue to 
be subject to an advisory vote by shareholders at the AGM.
Remuneration principles and structure
The Committee has adopted remuneration principles which  
are designed to ensure that senior executive remuneration:
• is aligned to the business strategy and promotes the  
long term success of the Company;
• supports the creation of sustainable long-term  
shareholder value;
• provides an appropriate balance between remuneration 
elements and includes performance related elements which 
are transparent, stretching and rigorously applied; 
• provides an appropriate balance between immediate and 
deferred remuneration; and
• encourages a high-performance culture by ensuring 
performance-related remuneration constitutes a substantial 
proportion of the remuneration package and by linking 
maximum payout opportunity to outstanding results.

Executive Directors
Base salary
In determining the annual base salary increases which apply 
from 1 October, the Committee considers comparative salaries 
in companies of a similar size and complexity and the range of 
remuneration increases applying across the Group.
The Committee also takes into account the salary increases 
applying across the senior management cadre. This comparator 
group comprises ca. 90 senior managers across the Group’s 
businesses. This senior management cadre has been chosen as  
a representative group, as it provides a meaningful comparison 
considering the global and diverse nature of the Group’s business.
Annual performance bonus
The Diploma PLC Annual Performance Bonus Plan is substantially 
a cash based scheme designed to reward Executive Directors for 
meeting stretching annual performance targets. 
Under the new Policy proposed for adoption by shareholders at 
the AGM on 17 January 2018, the financial performance target  
of “adjusted EPS” will be replaced by “Group adjusted operating 
profit” and this will be calculated on a basis that excludes the 
impact of currency effects on the translation of Group adjusted 
operating profit. If approved by shareholders, this amendment 
will apply to the financial year ending 30 September 2018.
At the start of the financial year (1 October), the Board sets a 
financial performance target principally focused on achievement 
of a target Group adjusted operating profit (or for financial  
year ending 30 September 2017 only, adjusted EPS). Adjusted 
operating profit will be calculated on a constant currency basis 
and full disclosure of the targets will continue to be published  
on a retrospective basis. The level of bonus payable for achieving 
the minimum target is 5% of base salary. No bonus is payable  
if performance does not meet the minimum target.
The definition of adjusted operating profit (or for 2017 only, 
adjusted EPS) is consistent with the Group’s financial 
statements. However, the Committee has discretion to modify 
the definition in the event of changes in accounting policy and/
or material operational, market, exchange rate or environmental 
factors in order to more appropriately reflect management 
performance. The Committee has discretion to reduce awards  
if minimum thresholds are not achieved for adjusted operating 
margins, free cash flow and return on adjusted trading capital 
employed (“ROATCE”). Where used, the rationale for the 
exercise of this discretion will be disclosed in the next 
Remuneration Committee Report.
Different performance measures may be used for future cycles of 
the Annual Performance Bonus Plan to those set out in the Policy 
Table to take into account changes in the business strategy.
Individual objectives have also been set for the Group Finance 
Director in the financial year ended 30 September 2017 relating  
to factors including operating performance, business and 
management development activities. While retaining that 
flexibility under the new Policy, the bonus payable to the Group 
Finance Director for the financial year ending 30 September 2018 
will be based solely on adjusted operating profits. 
At the end of the financial year, the Committee meets to assess 
the performance of each Executive Director against the financial 
and individual objectives. Bonuses are normally paid in cash  
in December.
There will be a new requirement after the adoption of the new 
Policy proposed at the AGM on 17 January 2018, to defer 50% of 
any bonus awarded for the financial year ending 30 September 
2018 or thereafter, on a net of tax basis into shares until minimum 
shareholding guideline levels, set at 200% of base salary for 
Executive Directors under this new Policy, have been met.
Long term incentive award
The Company operates a long term incentive award plan for 
Executive Directors, being the Diploma PLC 2011 Performance 
Share Plan (“PSP”). The PSP is designed to promote the long term 
success of the Company, while also aligning the Directors’ 
interests with those of Diploma PLC shareholders. 
The PSP provides for a grant of conditional awards of a specified 
number of ordinary shares in the Company, or an option to 
acquire a specified number of shares at an exercise price 
determined by the Committee (which may be nil or a nominal 
amount). No payment is required for the grant of an award.
Awards, which are normally granted annually, must generally be 
made within 42 days after the announcement of the Company’s 
annual results. When making the decision on the level of award, 
the Committee takes into consideration a number of factors, 
including the face value of the award and plan dilution limits.
The face value of an award is equal to the number of shares,  
or shares under option, multiplied by the relevant share price.  
The relevant share price will be the mid-market closing share  
price on the dealing day before the award. A face value limit  
of 175% of base salary applies to each PSP award to Executive 
Directors, although the Committee, at its discretion, may 
increase the face value of an award to a maximum of 250%  
in exceptional circumstances. 
All awards will normally vest on the date on which the 
performance conditions are determined and confirmed by  
the Committee, following the end of the performance period.  
The vesting of awards is conditional on:
• continued employment;
• the Company’s growth in adjusted EPS over a three-year 
performance period; and
• the Company’s TSR performance over a three-year 
performance period.
The latter two performance conditions apply to each award so 
that the vesting of 50% of the award is based on growth in 
adjusted EPS and 50% of the award is based on the relative TSR 
performance. These measures align with our long-term goal of 
value creation for shareholders through underlying financial 
growth and above-market shareholder returns. 
Each performance condition is measured over a three-year period 
commencing on the first day of the financial year in which the 
award is made. There is no retesting of the performance metrics. 
At the minimum performance threshold, 25% of the PSP awards 
will vest.
The Committee will regularly monitor the continuing suitability  
of the performance conditions and may impose different 
performance conditions or targets for awards granted in 
subsequent years, to align with the Company’s strategic 
objectives and having regard to prevailing market practice.
The Committee may decide, on or before the grant of a share 
incentive award, that on exercise of the award, the participants 
may receive, in addition to the shares in which they then 
become entitled, a dividend equivalent in respect of the 
dividends (excluding any tax credit) which would have been paid 
to the participant in respect of shares vesting between the date 
of the award and the time of vesting. These dividend equivalent 
payments may be made in cash or in an equivalent number 
of shares.
For awards granted after the adoption of this new Policy 
proposed at the AGM on 17 January 2018, Executive Directors will 
be required to retain shares vesting under the LTIP (net of tax) 
until the fifth anniversary of grant (“the Holding Period”), to reflect 
developments in best practice and the Committee’s continued  56 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
GOVERNANCE
focus on long term shareholder alignment. The Holding Period 
shall expire on the earliest of:
• the fifth anniversary of the date of grant of an award;
• the date of a change of control event;
• the death of the participant; or
• such other date as determined by the Committee in  
its discretion.
Service contracts
The Executive Directors’ service contracts, including 
arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by 
the Committee and are designed to recruit, retain and motivate 
directors of the calibre required to manage the Company and 
successfully deliver its strategic objectives. 
The Committee considers that a rolling contract with a notice 
period of one year is appropriate for existing and newly  
appointed Directors. 
The Executive Directors’ service contracts, copies of which  
are held at the Company’s registered office, were updated in 
March 2014 to recognise developments in law and best practice 
relating to such contracts. These service contracts contain 
provisions for compensation in the event of early termination or 
change of control, equal to the value of salary and contractual 
benefits for the Director’s notice period. The Company may 
make a payment in lieu of notice in the event of early termination 
and the Company may make any such payment in instalments 
with the Director being obliged in appropriate circumstances 
to mitigate loss (for example by gaining new employment).
The Committee considers that these provisions assist with 
recruitment and retention and that their inclusion is therefore in 
the best interests of shareholders.
Details of the service contracts of the Executive Directors who 
served during the year are set out below:

Other remuneration policies
Payment for loss of office
The Committee has considered the Company’s policy on 
remuneration for Executive Directors leaving the Company  
and is committed to applying a consistent approach to ensure 
that the Company pays no more than is fair and reasonable  
in the circumstances. 
The loss of office payment policy is in line with market practice 
and will depend on whether the departing Executive Director is, 
or is deemed to be treated as, a “good leaver” or a “bad leaver”.  
In the case of a good leaver the Policy includes:
• Notice period of 12 months’ base salary, pension and 
contractual benefits or payment in lieu of notice.
• Bonus payable for the period worked, subject to achievement 
of the relevant performance condition. Different performance 
measures (to the other Executive Directors) may be set for  
a departing Director as appropriate, to reflect any change  
in responsibility. 
• Vesting of award shares under the Company’s long term 
incentive plan is not automatic and the Committee would 
retain discretion to allow partial vesting depending on the 
extent to which performance conditions had been met and the 
length of time the awards have been held. Time prorating may 
be disapplied if the Committee considers it appropriate, given 
the circumstances. For awards granted under the current 
Policy (i.e. prior to the adoption of the new Policy on 17 January 
2018) performance will be measured to the date of cessation 
of employment and, to the extent applicable, vest shortly 
thereafter. For awards granted after the adoption of the new 
Policy on 17 January 2018, performance will be measured to 
the end of the normal performance period and, to the extent 
applicable, vest on the normal vesting date, save in exceptional 
circumstances when the Committee may determine that early 
vesting should still apply.
• The Committee will provide for the leaver to be reimbursed 
for a reasonable level of legal fees in connection with  
a settlement agreement.
When calculating termination payments, the Committee will  
take into account a variety of factors, including individual and 
Company performance, the obligation for the Executive Director 
in appropriate circumstances to mitigate loss (for example, by 
gaining new employment) and the Executive Director’s length  
of service. 
The Committee reserves the right to make additional exit 
payments where such payments are made in good faith in 
discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages  
for breach of such an obligation) or by way of settlement  
or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the 
termination of a Director’s office or employment.
Change of control
Change of control provisions provide for compensation equal to 
the value of salary and contractual benefits for the notice period. 
In the event of a change in control, vesting of an award of shares 
under the Company’s PSP depends on the extent to which 
performance conditions had been met at that time. Time 
prorating may be disapplied if the Committee considers it 
appropriate, given the circumstances of the change of control. 
Malus and clawback
Malus provisions apply to awards made under the Company’s 
long term incentive and annual bonus plans which give the 
Committee the right to cancel or reduce unvested share awards 
(or in the case of the Annual Performance Bonus Plan, cash 
payments) in the event of material misstatement of the 
Company’s financial results, miscalculation of a participant’s 
entitlement or individual gross misconduct.
Clawback provisions apply to PSP and Annual Bonus Performance 
Plan awards granted to Executive Directors after 1 October 2015. 
The clawback arrangements permit the Committee to recover 
amounts paid to Executive Directors in specified circumstances 
and further safeguard shareholders’ interests. 
Remuneration for new appointments
The Committee has determined that new Executive Directors will 
receive a compensation package in accordance with the terms of 
the Group’s approved Policy in force at the time of appointment. 
The Committee has agreed the following principles that will apply 
when arranging a remuneration package to recruit new Executive 
Directors:
• The remuneration structure will be kept simple where 
practicable, hence the use of base salary, benefits, pension  
(or cash allowance in lieu), annual performance bonus and long 
term incentives.
• The emphasis on linking pay with performance shall continue; 
hence the use of variable pay in the form of an annual 
performance bonus and a long term incentive award, which 
will continue to be a significant component of the Executive 
Directors’ total remuneration package.
• Initial base salary will take into account the experience and 
calibre of the individual and their existing remuneration 
package. Where it is appropriate to offer a lower salary initially, 
a series of increases to the desired salary positioning may be 
given over subsequent years subject to individual performance.
• The structure of variable pay will be in accordance with 
Diploma’s approved Policy detailed above with an exceptional 
maximum aggregate variable pay opportunity of 375% of 
salary. Different performance measures may be set in the first 
Remuneration Committee Report  
continued
Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued 57 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
year for the annual bonus, taking account of the responsibilities 
of the individual and the point in the financial year that the 
executive joined the Company.
• Benefits will generally be provided in accordance with the 
approved Policy, with relocation expenses/an expatriate 
allowance paid if appropriate.
• In the case of an external recruitment, the Committee may 
also offer additional cash and/or share-based elements when 
it considers these to be in the best interests of Diploma and 
shareholders, to replace variable remuneration awards or 
arrangements that an individual has foregone in order to join 
the Group. This includes the use of awards made under 
section 9.4.2 of the UK Listing Rules. Any such payments 
would take account of the details of the remuneration 
foregone including the nature, vesting dates and any 
performance requirements attached to that remuneration  
and any payments would not exceed the expected value  
being forfeited. 
• In the case of an internal appointment, any outstanding 
variable pay awarded in relation to the previous role will  
be allowed to pay out according to the terms of grant.
• For all new Executive Director appointments, the mandated 
shareholding guidelines, deferral of annual performance bonus 
and the Holding Period for LTIP awards will apply in accordance 
with the Policy and the relevant Plan rules.
• Fees for a new Chairman or non-Executive Director will be set 
in line with the approved Policy.
Committee discretion
The Committee operates the Annual Performance Bonus Plan 
and the LTIP in accordance with the relevant plan rules and 
where appropriate, the Listing Rules and HMRC legislation. The 
Committee also retains discretion over a number of areas relating 
to the operation and administration of the plans. These include, 
the timing of awards and of setting performance criteria each 
year, dealing with leavers, discretion to waive or shorten the 
Holding Period for shares acquired under the LTIP , the discretion 
to retrospectively amend performance targets in exceptional 
circumstances and in respect of share awards, to adjust the 
number of shares subject to an award in the event of a variation 
in the share capital of the Company. The Committee will exercise 
its powers in accordance with the terms of the relevant plan 
rules. The Committee also has discretions to set components 
of remuneration within a range from time to time as set out 
in the maximum opportunity sections of the Policy Table.
Dilution
In any ten-year period, the number of shares which are or  
may be issued under option or other share awards under any 
discretionary share plan established by the Company may not 
exceed 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company 
from time to time. In any ten-year period, the aggregate number 
of shares which are or may be issued under option, or other share 
awards under all share plans established by the Company, may 
not exceed 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company, from time to time.
Consultation with shareholders and employees
The Committee will consult with its major shareholders in 
advance of any significant changes to the approved Policy  
or exercise of discretion, as appropriate, to explain their 
approach and rationale fully and to understand shareholders’ 
views. Additionally, the Committee considers shareholder 
feedback received in relation to each AGM alongside any views 
expressed during the year. The Committee also reviews the 
executive remuneration framework in the context of published 
Investor Guidelines. 
The Committee does not consult directly with employees when 
formulating the Policy for Executive Directors.
Policy in respect of external board appointments for  
Executive Directors
The Committee recognises that external non-executive 
directorships may be beneficial for both the Company and 
Executive Director. At the discretion of the Board, Executive 
Directors are permitted to retain fees received in respect of any 
such non-executive directorship.
Shareholding guidelines
The Committee has adopted guidelines for Executive Directors, 
to encourage substantial long-term share ownership. These 
specify that, over a period of five years from the date of 
appointment, each Executive Director should build up and then 
retain a holding of shares with a value equivalent to 200% of base 
salary. The guidelines also require that, in relation to long term 
incentive awards, vested shares (net of tax) must be retained  
by the individual until the required shareholding level is reached.  
As at 20 November 2017, both Executive Directors exceeded  
the applicable shareholding guidelines.
Chairman and non-Executive Directors
Recruitment and term
The Board aims to recruit non-Executive Directors of a high 
calibre, with broad and diverse commercial, international or 
other relevant experience. Non-Executive Directors are appointed 
by the Board on the recommendation of the Nomination 
Committee. Appointments of the non-Executive Directors are for 
an initial term of three years, subject to election by shareholders 
at the first AGM following their appointment and subject to 
annual re-election thereafter. The terms of engagement are set 
out in letters of appointment which can be terminated by either 
party serving three months’ notice. 
Chairman
John Nicholas was appointed Chairman on 21 January 2015, 
having previously been the Senior Independent Director. His 
appointment is subject to annual re-election by shareholders  
at the AGM.

Fees
The non-Executive Directors are paid a competitive basic annual 
fee which is approved by the Board on the recommendation of 
the Chairman and the Executive Directors. The Chairman’s fee is 
approved by the Committee, excluding the Chairman. Additional 
fees may also be payable for chairing a Committee of the Board 
or for acting as Senior Independent Director. The fees are 
reviewed each year and take account of the fees paid in other 
companies of a similar size and complexity, the responsibilities 
and the required time commitment. If there is a temporary yet 
material increase in the time commitments for non-Executive 
Directors, the Board may pay extra fees on a pro rata basis to 
recognise the additional workload.
The non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any 
of the Company’s share plans, incentive plans or pension 
schemes and there is no provision for payment in the event of 
early termination. 58 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017

Long term incentive awards
Performance conditions
Set out below is a summary of the performance conditions that apply to both the long-term incentive awards which vest in 2017 and 
the outstanding PSP awards, including those granted in December 2015 and December 2016. PSP awards since 1 October 2014 have 
been granted at 175% of base salary. The performance conditions applying to these awards made under the PSP are set out below. 
The Committee has confirmed that the same performance conditions will be applied to PSP awards made in December 2017.
The first performance condition for the PSP awards is that the average annual compound growth in the Company’s adjusted EPS, 
over the three consecutive financial years following the financial year immediately prior to the grant, must exceed the specified 
absolute figures. The performance conditions are as follows:
Adjusted EPS growth (over three years)
% of  
awards  
vesting
PSP
14% p.a. 100
5% p.a. 25
Below 5% p.a. Nil
Where the Company’s adjusted EPS performance is between these percentage bands, vesting of the award is on a straight-line basis. 
For the purposes of this condition, EPS is adjusted EPS as defined in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and this 
definition remains consistent with the definition of adjusted EPS approved by the Committee in previous years.
The second performance condition compares the growth of the Company’s TSR over a three-year period to that of the companies in 
the FTSE 250 Index (excluding Investment Trusts). The performance conditions are as follows:
% of  
awards  
vesting
PSP
Upper quartile 100
Median 25
Below median Nil 60 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
GOVERNANCE
Where the Company’s TSR performance is between these percentage bands, vesting of the award is on a straight-line basis.  
The FTSE 250 Index was chosen because this is a recognised broad equity market index of which the Company is a member.
Awards vesting in 2017
The PSP awards made to the Executive Directors on 5 February 2015, were subject to operating performance conditions as set out in 
the table above, independently assessed over a three-year period ended 30 September 2017. The outcome of each award is shown in

Dividend equivalent payments
There were no dividend equivalent payments paid in respect of outstanding nil cost options which vested in the prior year on 
30 September 2016. Dividend equivalent payments of £42,743 and £27,597 will be payable to Bruce Thompson and Nigel Lingwood 
respectively, in respect of awards which vested on 30 September 2017 and these are accounted for in this year’s Annual Report on 
Remuneration. 
Long term incentive plan – awards granted in the year
The CEO and Group Finance Director received grants of PSP awards on 22 December 2016, in the form of nil-cost options. These 
awards were based on a share price of 997.5p, being the mid-market price of an ordinary share in the Company at close of business 
on the day immediately preceding the award. 
Under normal circumstances, the options will not become exercisable until the performance conditions are determined after the end 
of the three-year measurement period which begins on the first day of the financial year in which the award is made and provided the 
Director remains in employment. The level of vesting is dependent on the achievement of specified performance criteria at the end 
of the three-year measurement period. The performance conditions for these awards are set out on page 59.
Outstanding share-based performance awards 
Set out below is a summary of the share-based awards outstanding at 30 September 2017, including both share awards which have 
vested during the year based on performance and share awards which have been granted during the year. The awards set out below 
were granted based on a face value limit of 175% of base salary at December 2016. No awards will vest unless the performance 
conditions set out on page 59 are achieved over a three-year measurement period.

Executive Directors’ interest in options over shares
In respect of nil cost options granted under the PSP, the remuneration receivable by an Executive Director is calculated on the date 
that the options first vest. The remuneration of the Executive Director is the difference between the amount the Executive Director 
is required to pay to exercise the options to acquire the shares and the total value of the shares on the vesting date.
If the Executive Director chooses not to exercise the nil cost options on the vesting date (he may exercise the options at any time up 
to the day preceding the tenth anniversary of the date of grant), any subsequent increase or decrease in the amount realised will be 
due to movements in the underlying share price between the initial vesting date and the date of exercise of the option. This increase 
or decrease in value reflects an investment decision by the Executive Director and, as such, is not recorded as remuneration.
The nil cost options outstanding at 30 September 2017 and the movements during the year are as follows:

changes to these interests in ordinary shares of the Company.
At 30 September 2017 the ordinary shares held by Bruce Thompson and Nigel Lingwood represented 1,242% and 675% of their base

£5,000 (2016: £5,000) for chairing a Committee of the Board or for acting as Senior Independent Director. The fees for non-Executive 
Directors are reviewed every year by the Board, taking into account their responsibilities and required time commitment. Following a 
review undertaken on 14 November 2017, the Board approved an increase of 3% in the Chairman’s fee to £144,600 p.a. and in the 
total annual fee paid to non-Executive Directors to £55,000, both to take effect from 1 October 2017.

Senior executives below the Board
The policies and practices with regard to the remuneration of senior executives below the Executive Directors are generally treated 
consistently with the Executive Directors. These senior executives all have a significant portion of their reward package linked to 
performance. Annual bonuses are linked to short term financial targets which use similar performance metrics to the targets for the 
Executive Directors. Members of the Executive Management Group (“EMG”) participate in the Diploma PLC 2011 Performance Share 
Plan described further on page 55. Senior management outside the EMG participate in cash based long term incentive plans which 
are focused on the operating profit growth of their businesses over rolling three-year periods. 
Set out below is a summary of the share-based awards outstanding at 30 September 2017 which have been granted to members  
of the EMG, including share awards which have vested during the year based on performance and share awards which have been 
granted both last year and during this year. The awards set out below were granted based on a face value limit that varied between 
30% and 60% of base salary. No awards will vest unless the performance conditions set out on page 59 are achieved over a three-
year measurement period.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Directors’ Report
This section contains information which the Directors are 
required by law and regulation to include within the Annual 
Report & Accounts.
Shareholders
Incorporation and principal activity
Diploma PLC is domiciled in England and registered in England 
and Wales under Company Number 3899848. At the date of this 
Report there were 113,239,555 ordinary shares of 5p each in 
issue, all of which are fully paid up and quoted on the London 
Stock Exchange.
The principal activity of the Group is the supply of specialised 
technical products and services. A description and review of the 
activities of the Group during the financial year and an indication 
of future developments is set out on pages 4 to 37; the Strategic 
Report on pages 1 to 37 incorporates the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 (“the Act”).
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) will be held at midday on 
Wednesday, 17 January 2018 in the Brewers Hall, Aldermanbury 
Square, London EC2V 7HR. The Notice of the AGM, which is a 
separate document, will be sent to all shareholders and will be 
published on the Diploma PLC website. 
Substantial shareholdings
At 17 November 2017, the Company had been notified of the 
following interests amounting to 3% or more of the voting rights 
in its ordinary share capital:
Percentage 
of ordinary 
share capital
Fidelity Management & Research Co. 9.26
Mondrian Investment Partners Limited 7.26
Mawer Investment Management Limited 6.49
Standard Life Aberdeen plc 6.41
Royal London Asset Management Limited 4.95
BlackRock, Inc. 3.30
Norges Bank Investment Management 3.03
As far as the Directors are aware,- there were no other interests 
above 3% of the issued ordinary share capital.
Share capital
The rights attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares, as well 
as the powers of the Company’s Directors, are set out in the 
Company’s Articles of Association, copies of which can be 
obtained from the Group Company Secretary and are available 
on the Company’s website.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfers of 
securities and/or voting rights. No person holds securities in the 
Company carrying special rights with regard to control of the 
Company. The Company’s Articles of Association may be 
amended by special resolution of the Company’s shareholders.
Restrictions on transfer of shares
The Directors may refuse to register a transfer of a certificated 
share that is not fully paid, provided that the refusal does not 
prevent dealings in shares in the Company from taking place on 
an open and proper basis, or where the Company has lien over 
that share. The Directors may also refuse to register a transfer 
of a certificated share, unless the instrument of transfer is: 
(i) lodged, duly stamped (if necessary), at the registered office 
of the Company or any other place as the Board may decide 
accompanied by the certificate for the share(s) to be transferred 
and/or such other evidence as the Directors may reasonably 
require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer; 
(ii) in respect of only one class of shares; (iii) in favour of a person 
who is not a minor, infant, bankrupt or a person of unsound 
mind; or (iv) in favour of not more than four persons jointly.
Transfers of uncertificated shares must be carried out using 
CREST and the Directors can refuse to register a transfer of an 
uncertified share in accordance with the regulations governing 
the operation of CREST.
Participants in the Company’s Performance Share Plan (“the 
PSP”), who have yet to meet shareholding guidelines, have 
vested PSP shares held in trust until the earlier occurrence of 
them meeting their required shareholder guideline or for a 
period of two years, during which period these shares cannot be 
transferred to them. There are no other restrictions on the 
transfer of ordinary shares in the Company except certain 
restrictions which may from time to time be imposed by laws 
and regulations (for example insider trading laws); or where a 
shareholder with at least a 0.25% interest in the Company’s 
certified shares has been served with a disclosure notice and 
has failed to provide the Company with information concerning 
interests in those shares. 
Shares held by the Diploma PLC Employee Benefit Trust
While ordinary shares are held within the Diploma PLC Employee 
Benefit Trust, the voting rights in respect of those shares are 
exercisable by the Trustees in accordance with their fiduciary 
duties. The Trustees of the Diploma PLC Employee Benefit Trust 
also waive dividends on all shares held for the purposes of the 
Company’s long term incentive arrangements.
Share allotment
A general allotment power and a limited power to allot shares in 
specific circumstances for cash, otherwise than pro rata to 
existing shareholders, were given to the Directors by resolutions 
approved at the AGM of the Company held on 18 January 2017. 
In the year ended 30 September 2017, the Company has not 
allotted any shares. These powers will expire at the conclusion 
of the 2018 AGM and resolutions to renew the Directors’ powers 
are therefore included within the Notice of the AGM in 2018.
Authority to make market purchases of own shares
An authority to make market purchases of shares was given to 
the Directors by a special resolution at the AGM of the Company 
held on 18 January 2017. In the year to 30 September 2017 the 
Company has not acquired any of its own shares. This authority 
will expire at the conclusion of the 2018 AGM and a resolution to 
renew the authority is therefore included within the Notice of 
the AGM in 2018.
Financial 
Results and dividends
The profit for the financial year attributable to shareholders 
was £47.5m (2016: £38.3m). The Directors recommend a final 
dividend of 16.0p per ordinary share (2016: 13.8p), to be paid, if 
approved, on 24 January 2018. This, together with the interim 
dividend of 7.0p (2016: 6.2p) per ordinary share paid on 14 June 
2017 amounts to 23.0p for the year (2016: 20.0p).
The results are shown more fully in the consolidated financial 
statements on pages 66 to 94 and summarised in the Finance 
Review on pages 28 to 31.
Independent auditor
The Company held a competitive tender process during 2017 for 
its statutory audit contract, which was overseen by the Audit 
Committee. On completion of this process the Board, on the 
recommendation of the Audit Committee, proposed that 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) shall be appointed  65 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
auditor. The appointment of PwC is subject to approval of 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 17 January 2018. 
Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte”), the current external auditor, have 
undertaken the audit of the Group and Company for the financial 
year ended 30 September 2017. 
Directors’ assessment of going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 37. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the Finance Review on 
pages 28 to 31. In addition, pages 79 to 81 of the Annual Report 
& Accounts include the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management 
objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging 
activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources, together  
with a broad spread of customers and suppliers across different 
geographic areas and sectors, often secured with longer term 
agreements. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the 
Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully as 
described further on pages 32 to 35.
The Group also has a committed multi-currency revolving bank 
facility of £30.0m with an accordion option to increase the 
committed facility by a further £30.0m up to a maximum of 
£60.0m. This facility expires on 31 May 2020, with an option  
to extend the facility to 31 May 2022. At 30 September 2017,  
the Group had cash funds of £22.3m and had no borrowings.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report & Accounts.
Statement of disclosure
Each of the Directors has reviewed this Annual Report & 
Accounts and confirmed that so far as he is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is 
unaware and that he has taken all the steps that he ought to 
have taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditor is aware of that information. This confirmation is given 
and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the 
financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
& Accounts, including the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements, in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
Parent Company financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law the Directors are required to prepare Group 
financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by  
the European Union (“EU”) and Article 4 of the IAS Regulations 
and have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Standards (UK Accounting Standards) 
including FRS101 (“Reduced Disclosures Framework”).
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRS as 
adopted by the EU, to present fairly the financial position and 
the performance of the Group; the Act provides in relation to 
such financial statements, that references in the relevant part of 
that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view, are 
references to their achieving a fair presentation.
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the EU;
• for the Parent Company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the Parent Company financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Parent Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Parent Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with 
the Act. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Parent Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may  
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ Responsibility Statement
The Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
• the Group’s consolidated financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and the Parent 
Company financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
UK Accounting Standards, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group 
and Parent Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; 
• the Annual Report & Accounts includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group; and
• the Annual Report & Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.

Directors on 20 November 2017 and is signed on its behalf by:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. General information
Diploma PLC is a public limited company registered and domiciled in England and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
The address of the registered office is 12 Charterhouse Square, London EC1M 6AX. The consolidated financial statements comprise 
the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as “the Group”) and were authorised by the Directors for publication on 
20 November 2017. These statements are presented in UK sterling, with all values rounded to the nearest 100,000, except where 
otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”), 
as adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, as applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS. The financial statements of the Parent Company, Diploma PLC, have been prepared in accordance with FRS101 “Reduced 
Disclosure Framework” and are set out in a separate section of the Annual Report & Accounts on pages 93 and 94.
2. Alternative performance measures
The Group uses a number of alternative (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“non-GAAP”)) performance measures which 
are not defined within IFRS. The Directors use these measures for internal management reporting in order to assess the operational 
performance of the Group on a comparable basis and, as such, these measures are important and should be considered alongside 
the IFRS measures. The following non-GAAP measures are referred to in this Annual Report & Accounts:
2.1 Adjusted operating profit
At the foot of the Consolidated Income Statement, “adjusted operating profit” is defined as operating profit before amortisation and 
impairment of acquisition intangible assets, acquisition expenses, adjustments to deferred consideration (collectively, “acquisition 
related charges”), the costs of a material restructuring or rationalisation of operations and the profit or loss relating to the sale of 
businesses or property. The Directors believe that adjusted operating profit is an important measure of the operational performance 
of the Group.
2.2 Adjusted profit before tax
At the foot of the Consolidated Income Statement, “adjusted profit before tax” is separately disclosed, being defined as adjusted 
operating profit, after finance expenses (but before fair value remeasurements under IAS39 in respect of future purchases of 
minority interests) and before tax. The Directors believe that adjusted profit before tax is an important measure of the operational 
performance of the Group.
2.3 Adjusted earnings per share
“Adjusted earnings per share” (“EPS”) is calculated as the total of adjusted profit before tax, less income tax costs, but including the 
tax impact on the items included in the calculation of adjusted profit, less profit attributable to minority interests, divided by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. The Directors believe that adjusted EPS provides an important 
measure of the earning capacity of the Group.
2.4 Free cash flow
At the foot of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, “free cash flow” is reported, being defined as net cash flow from operating 
activities, after net capital expenditure on fixed assets and including proceeds received from business disposals, but before 
expenditure on business combinations/investments and dividends paid to both minority shareholders and the Company’s 
shareholders. The Directors believe that free cash flow gives an important measure of the cash flow of the Group, available for future 
investment or distribution to shareholders.
2.5 Trading capital employed and ROATCE
In the Sector analysis in note 3, “trading capital employed” is reported, being defined as net assets less cash and cash equivalents 
and after adding back: borrowings; retirement benefit obligations; deferred tax; and acquisition liabilities in respect of future 
purchases of minority interests and deferred consideration. Adjusted trading capital employed is reported as being trading capital 
employed plus goodwill and acquisition related charges previously written off (net of deferred tax on acquisition intangible assets). 
Return on adjusted trading capital employed (“ROATCE”) at the Group and Sector level is defined as the adjusted operating profit, 
divided by adjusted trading capital employed and adjusted for the timing effect of major acquisitions and disposals. The Directors 
believe that ROATCE is an important measure of the profitability of the Group.
3. Business Sector analysis
The Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) for the purposes of IFRS8 is the Chief Executive Officer. The financial performance of 
the Sectors are reported to the CODM on a monthly basis and this information is used to allocate resources on an appropriate basis.
For management reporting purposes, the Group is organised into three main reportable business Sectors: Life Sciences, Seals and 
Controls. These Sectors form the basis of the primary reporting format disclosures below. The principal activities of each of these 
Sectors is described in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 37. Sector revenue represents revenue from external customers; there is no 
inter-Sector revenue. Sector results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a Sector, as well as those that can be 
allocated on a reasonable basis.
Sector assets exclude cash and cash equivalents, deferred tax assets and corporate assets that cannot be allocated on a reasonable 
basis to a business Sector. Sector liabilities exclude borrowings, retirement benefit obligations, deferred tax liabilities, acquisition 
liabilities and corporate liabilities that cannot be allocated on a reasonable basis to a business Sector. These items are shown 
collectively in the following analysis as “unallocated assets” and “unallocated liabilities”, respectively.

(2016: £0.8m debit).

Current tax
The tax charge is based on the profit for the year and comprises:
 UK corporation tax 3.7 2.9
 Overseas tax 17.2 13.7

Adjustments in respect of prior year:
 UK corporation tax (0.5) (0.2)
 Overseas tax 0.2 (0.2)
Total current tax 20.6 16.2
Deferred tax
The net deferred tax credit based on the origination and reversal of timing differences comprises:
 United Kingdom (1.9) (1.6)
 Overseas (0.1) 0.3
Total deferred tax (2.0) (1.3)
Total tax on profit for the year 18.6 14.9
In addition to the above credit for deferred tax included in the Consolidated Income Statement, a net deferred tax debit relating to 
the retirement benefit scheme and cash flow hedges of £1.0m was debited (2016: £1.3m credit) directly to the Consolidated 
Statement of Income and Other Comprehensive Income. A further £0.3m of current tax (2016: £0.1m) was credited to the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity which relates to share-based payments made during the year. 
Factors affecting the tax charge for the year
The difference between the total tax charge calculated by applying the effective rate of UK corporation tax of 19.5% to the profit 
before tax of £66.8m and the amount set out above is as follows:
2017 
£m
2016 
£m
Profit before tax 66.8 54.0
Tax on profit at UK effective corporation tax rate of 19.5% (2016: 20.0%) 13.0 10.8
Effects of:
– change in UK tax rates – (0.1)
– higher tax rates on overseas earnings 5.3 4.1
– adjustments to current tax charge in respect of previous years (0.3) (0.4)
– other permanent differences 0.6 0.5
Total tax on profit for the year 18.6 14.9
The Group earns its profits in the UK and overseas. The UK corporation tax rate was reduced from 20.0% to 19.0% on 1 April 2017. As 
the Group prepares its consolidated financial statements for the year to 30 September, the effective tax rate for UK corporation tax in 
respect of the year ended 30 September 2017 was 19.5% (2016: 20.0%) and this rate has been used for tax on profit in the above 
reconciliation. The Group’s net overseas tax rate is higher than that in the UK, primarily because profits earned in the US, Canada and 
Australia are taxed at significantly higher rates than the UK. 
The UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at 30 September 2017 have been calculated based on the future UK corporation tax rate of 
17.0%, substantively enacted at 30 September 2017.
At 30 September 2017, the Group had outstanding tax liabilities of £4.0m (2016: £2.7m) of which £1.6m related to UK tax liabilities and 
£2.4m related to overseas tax liabilities. These amounts are expected to be paid within the next financial years. 74 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017

the Group’s three operating Sectors. This reflects the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored by management 
and reflects the Group’s strategy of acquiring businesses to drive synergies across a Sector, rather than within an individual business. 
The impairment test requires a “value in use” valuation to be prepared for each Sector using discounted cash flow forecasts. The 
cash flow forecasts are based on a combination of annual budgets prepared by each business and the Group’s strategic plan. Beyond 
five years, cash flow projections utilise a perpetuity growth rate of 2%.
The key assumptions used to prepare the cash flow forecasts relate to gross margins, revenue growth rates and the discount rate. 
The gross margins are assumed to remain sustainable, which is supported by historical experience; revenue growth rates generally 
approximate to the average rates for the markets in which the business operates, unless there are particular factors relevant to a 
business, such as start-ups. The annual revenue growth rates used in the cash flow forecasts for the next five years represent the 
budgeted rates for 2018 and thereafter, average growth rates for each Sector; these annual growth rates then reduce to 2% over the 
longer term. 
The cash flow forecasts are discounted to determine a current valuation using a single market derived pre-tax discount rate of 
ca. 12% (2016: 11%). This single rate is based on the characteristics of lower risk, non-technically driven, distribution businesses 
operating generally in well developed markets and geographies and with robust capital structures. As these features are consistent 
between each of the Group’s Sectors, the Board considers that it is more appropriate to use a single discount rate applied to each 
Sector’s cash flow forecasts.
Based on the criteria set out above, no impairment in the value of goodwill in any of the Sectors was identified.

10. Goodwill continued
The Directors have also carried out sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions noted above to determine whether a “reasonably 
possible adverse change” in any of these assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill. The analysis indicates that a 
“reasonably possible adverse change” would not give rise to an impairment charge to goodwill in any of the three Sectors.

1 The Group spent £1.9m during the financial year on completing the construction of a new facility for J Royal in Winston-Salem, US. On completion in April 2017, the facility was 
immediately sold to a third party and leased back to J Royal on a 15 year full repairing list. No profit or loss was recorded on the sale of the facility. This expenditure has not been 
included as an addition and disposal in the above analysis. 
Land included within freehold properties above, but which is not depreciated, is £3.4m (2016: £3.4m). Capital commitments 
contracted, but not provided, were £1.1m (2016: £1.9m) relating to the planned extension of the facility at IS-Sommer.
Freehold properties includes ca. 150 acres of land at Stamford (“the Stamford land”) which comprises mostly farm land and former 
quarry land. In the Directors’ opinion the current value of this land at 30 September 2017 is £1.0m (2016: £1.0m), with a book value 
of £Nil.

19. Financial instruments
The Group’s overall management of the financial risks is carried out by a central treasury team under policies and procedures which 
are reviewed and approved by the Board. The treasury team identifies, evaluates and where appropriate, hedges financial risks in 
close cooperation with the Group’s operating businesses. The treasury team does not undertake speculative foreign exchange 
dealings for which there is no underlying exposure. 
The Group’s principal financial instruments, other than a number of forward foreign currency contracts, comprise cash and short 
term deposits, investments, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables, borrowings and other liabilities. Trade and 
other receivables and trade and other payables arise directly from the Group’s day-to-day operations. 
The financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of credit, liquidity, foreign currency, interest rate and capital 
management. An explanation of each of these risks, how the Group manages these risks and an analysis of sensitivities is set out 
below and on page 35 within Internal Control and Risk Management, all of which have been audited. 
a) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations; this arises principally from the Group’s trade and other receivables from customers and from cash balances (including 
deposits) held with financial institutions.
The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government backed agencies and large public and private wholesalers, to small 
privately owned businesses and the underlying local economic risks vary throughout the world. Trade receivable exposures are 
managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for each customer. 
The Group establishes a provision for impairment that represents its estimate of potential losses in respect of specific trade and 
other receivables where it is deemed that a receivable may not be recoverable. When the receivable is deemed irrecoverable, the 
provision is written off against the underlying receivable. During the year, the Group had no significant unrecoverable trade 
receivables; there have been no other significant trade receivables written off in the past five years other than £0.2m written off  
in 2015. 
Exposure to counterparty credit risk with financial institutions is controlled by the Group treasury team which establishes and 
monitors counterparty limits. Centrally managed funds are invested entirely with counterparties whose credit rating is “AA” or better.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk was as follows:
Carrying amount
2017 
£m
2016 
£m
Trade receivables 63.4 54.8
Other receivables 2.3 2.4
Cash and cash equivalents 22.3 20.6
88.0 77.8
There is no material difference between the book value of the financial assets and their fair value at each reporting date. An analysis 
of the ageing and currency of trade receivables and the associated provision for impairment is set out in note 16. An analysis of cash 
and cash equivalents is set out in note 18.
b) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group continually 
monitors net cash and forecasts cash flows to ensure that sufficient resources are available to meet the Group’s requirements in the 
short, medium and long term. Additionally, compliance with debt covenants are monitored regularly and during 2017 all covenants 
were complied with fully. 
The Group is highly cash generative and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements and to optimise its return 
on shorter term deposits. Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on hand to meet foreseeable operational expenses, 
but the Group also maintains a committed revolving bank facility. On 1 June 2017, the Group replaced its existing facility that was due 
to expire on 23 June 2017 with a similar committed three year facility for £30.0m with an accordion option to increase the committed 
facility by a further £30.0m up to a maximum of £60.0m and to extend the term up to five years. Interest on this facility is payable 
at between 70 and 115bps over LIBOR, depending on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA. None of the facility had been drawn down 
(2016: £10.0m) at 30 September 2017.

Less: discount (0.4) (0.8)
52.4 45.3
There is no material difference between the book value of these financial liabilities and their fair value at each reporting date. 
c) Currency risk
The Group’s principal currency risk comprises translational and transactional risk from its exposure to movements in US dollars, 
Canadian dollars and Euros. The transactional exposure arises on trade receivables, trade payables and cash and cash equivalents 
and these balances are analysed by currency in notes 16, 17 and 18, respectively. Net foreign exchange gains of £0.5m (2016: £0.8m) 
were recognised in operating profit for the year.
The Group holds forward foreign exchange contracts in certain of the Group’s businesses to hedge forecast transactional exposure 
to movements primarily in the US dollar and Euro. These forward foreign exchange contracts are classified as cash flow hedges and 
are stated at fair value. The notional value of forward contracts as at 30 September 2017 was £33.0m (2016: £25.9m). The net fair 
value of forward foreign exchange contracts used as hedges at 30 September 2017 was £0.7m liability (2016: £0.2m asset). The 
amount removed from Other Comprehensive Income and taken to the Consolidated Income Statement in cost of sales during the 
year was £0.2m (2016: £1.5m). The change in the fair value of cash flow hedges taken to Other Comprehensive Income during the 
year was £1.0m debit (2016: £0.2m credit).
Management considers that the most significant foreign exchange risk relates to the US dollar, Canadian dollar and Euro. The Group’s 
sensitivity to a 10% strengthening in UK sterling against each of these currencies (with all other variables held constant) is as follows:
2017 
£m
Decrease in adjusted operating profit (at average rates)
US dollar: UK sterling 2.1
Canadian dollar: UK sterling 1.7
Euro: UK sterling 1.1
Decrease in total equity (at spot rates)
US dollar: UK sterling 4.1
Canadian dollar: UK sterling 5.0
Euro: UK sterling 2.8
d) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will affect the Group’s results. The Group’s interest rate risk arises primarily 
from its cash funds and borrowings. The Group does not undertake any hedging of interest rates. All cash deposits, held in the UK 
and overseas, are held on a short term basis at floating rates or overnight rates, based on the relevant UK base rate, or equivalent 
rate. Surplus funds are deposited with commercial banks that meet the credit criteria approved by the Board, for periods of between 
one and six months at rates that are generally fixed by reference to the relevant UK base rate, or equivalent rate. An increase of 1% in 
interest rates would not have a significant impact on the Group’s adjusted profit before tax. An analysis of cash and cash equivalents 
at the reporting dates is set out in note 18.

e) Fair values
There are no material differences between the book value of financial assets and liabilities and their fair value. The basis for 
determining fair values are as follows:
Derivatives
Forward exchange contracts are valued at year end forward rates, adjusted for the forward points to the contract’s value date with 
gains and losses taken to equity. No contract’s value date is greater than 18 months from the year end.
Trade and other receivables/payables
As the majority of receivables/payables have a remaining life of less than one year, the book value is deemed to reflect the fair value. 
Other liabilities
The carrying amount represents a discounted value of the expected liability which is deemed to reflect the fair value. 
f) Capital management risk
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to maintain robust 
capital ratios to support the development of the business and provide strong returns to shareholders. The Group’s capital structure 
comprises cash funds and medium term bank borrowing facilities.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may change the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders, issue new shares or increase bank borrowings.

At 30 September 2017, the Group retained put options to acquire minority interests in TPD, Kentek and M Seals.
The estimate of the financial liability at 30 September 2017 to acquire the outstanding minority shareholdings was reassessed by the 
Directors, based on their current estimate of the future performance of these businesses and to reflect foreign exchange rates at 
30 September 2017. This led to a remeasurement of the fair value of these put options and the liability was increased by £0.5m 
(2016: £0.8m) reflecting a revised estimate of the future performance of the businesses and by a further £0.5m (2016: £0.5m) charge 
which arises from unwinding the discount on the liability. In aggregate £1.0m (2016: £1.3m) has been charged to the Consolidated 
Income Statement. 
The put options to acquire the remaining minority interest of 10% held in both M Seals and in Kentek are exercisable from November 
2018. Subsequent to the year end, the option to acquire an outstanding 5% minority interest in TPD has been exercised for cash

Abacus ALS Limited based in Auckland, New Zealand (together “Abacus”) for total cash consideration of £14.1m (A$23.3m). This 
comprised initial consideration of £12.4m (A$20.4m), together with £1.7m (A$2.9m) of deferred consideration based on the 
performance of the business for the year ended 30 June 2017. The initial consideration of £13.6m (A$22.5m) was before adjustments 
relating to working capital and net debt on completion of £1.2m (A$2.1m), but before acquisition expenses of £0.3m (A$0.5m).
On 19 April 2017, the Group acquired 100% of Problem Solving Products, Inc (“PSP”), based in Colorado US, for total cash

On 16 June 2017, the Group acquired 100% of Edco Seal & Supply Limited (“Edco”) based in Leicester, England, for initial cash 
consideration of £3.2m, which included £0.2m of surplus cash and was before acquisition expenses of £0.1m. Maximum deferred 
consideration of up to £0.7m is payable based on the performance of Edco for the 12 months ended 30 April 2018, of which £0.4m 
has been provided at 30 September 2017.

22. Acquisition of businesses continued
From the date of acquisition to 30 September 2017, the newly acquired Abacus business contributed £7.6m to revenue and £1.2m to 
adjusted operating profit, the newly acquired PSP business contributed £1.0m to revenue and £0.2m to adjusted operating profit and 
the newly acquired Edco business contributed £1.1m to revenue and £0.2m to adjusted operating profit. If these businesses had been 
acquired at the beginning of the financial year, they would in aggregate have contributed on a pro rata basis £21.6m to revenue and 
£3.8m to adjusted operating profit. However these amounts should not be viewed as indicative of the results of these businesses 
that would have occurred, if these acquisitions had been completed at the beginning of the year.

On 1 June 2017, the Group replaced its existing facility that was due to expire on 23 June 2017 with a similar committed three year 
facility for £30.0m with an accordion option to increase the committed facility by a further £30.0m up to a maximum of £60.0m and 
an option to extend the facility up to five years. At 30 September 2017, none of the facility had been drawn down (2016: £10.0m). 
Interest on this facility is payable at between 70 and 115bps over LIBOR, depending on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
25. Retirement benefit obligations
The Group maintains two pension arrangements which are accounted for under IAS19 (Revised) “Employee Benefits”. The principal 
arrangement is the defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, maintained by Diploma Holdings PLC and called the Diploma Holdings 
PLC UK Pension Scheme (“the Scheme”). This Scheme provides benefits based on final salary and length of service on retirement, 
leaving service or death and has been closed to further accrual since 5 April 2000. 
The second and smaller pension arrangement is operated by Kubo in Switzerland and provides benefits on retirement, leaving 
service or death for the employees of Kubo in accordance with Swiss law. Kubo was acquired by the Group on 13 March 2015. The 
Kubo pension scheme is a defined contribution based scheme, which for technical reasons, is required under IFRS to be accounted 
for in accordance with IAS19 (Revised).

arrangements is:

Diploma Holdings PLC UK Pension Scheme
The Scheme is subject to a Statutory Funding Objective under the Pensions Act 2004 which requires that a valuation of the Scheme is 
carried out at least once every three years to determine whether the Statutory Funding Objective is met. As part of the process the 
Company must agree with the Trustees of the Scheme the contributions to be paid to address any shortfall against the Statutory 
Funding Objective. The most recent triennial actuarial valuation carried out as at 30 September 2016 reported that the Scheme had a 
funding deficit of £9.2m and held assets which covered 75% of its liabilities at that date. The next triennial actuarial valuation of the 
Scheme will be carried out as at 30 September 2019. There were no Scheme amendments, curtailments or settlements during the year.
The Scheme is managed by a set of Trustees appointed in part by the Company and in part from elections by members of the 
Scheme. The Trustees have responsibility for obtaining valuations of the fund, administering benefit payments and investing the 
Scheme’s assets. The Trustees delegate some of these functions to their professional advisors where appropriate. 
The Scheme exposes the Company and therefore the Group, to a number of risks:
• Investment risk. The Scheme holds investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and while 
these assets are expected to provide real returns over the long term, volatility over the short term can cause additional funding to 
be required if a deficit emerges.
• Interest rate risk. The Scheme’s liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount the 
liabilities. As the Scheme’s assets include equities, the value of the assets and liabilities may not move in the same way.
• Inflation risk. A significant proportion of the benefits under the Scheme are linked to inflation. The Scheme’s assets are expected 
to provide a good hedge against inflation over the long term, however movements over the short term could lead to funding 
deficits emerging.
• Mortality risk. In the event that members live longer than assumed, a larger funding deficit may emerge in the Scheme.

Risk mitigation strategies
When setting the investment strategy for the Scheme, the Trustees, in conjunction with the employer, take into account the liability 
profile of the Scheme. The current strategy is designed to broadly match assets and liabilities in respect of pensioner members, but 
to invest in growth assets in respect of deferred pensioners. Annuity policies have been taken out in respect of some historic 
pensioners, but the Scheme has not purchased annuities for retirements since 2005.
Effect of the Scheme on the Group’s future cash flows
The Company is required to agree a schedule of contributions with the Trustees of the Scheme following each triennial actuarial 
valuation. Following the triennial actuarial valuation carried out as at 30 September 2016, the Company agreed to increase the annual 
cash contribution to the scheme to £0.5m (from £0.4m). The next valuation of the Scheme will be carried out as at 30 September 2019.
The Kubo Pension Scheme (“the Kubo Scheme”)
In accordance with Swiss law, Kubo’s pension benefits are contribution based with the level of benefits varying according to category 
of employment. Swiss law requires certain guarantees to be provided on such pension benefits. Kubo finances its Swiss pension 
benefits through the ASGA Pensionskasse, a multi-employer plan of non-associated companies which pools risks between 
participating companies. As at 30 September 2017 the ASGA Pensionskasse had a local coverage ratio of 110.7%.

fasteners based in California, US, for initial cash consideration of £1.0m (US$1.3m) and maximum deferred consideration of £0.3m 
(US$0.4m). A review to determine fair values of the net assets acquired will be completed during the next financial year. 88 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as endorsed by the EU and in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006, as applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. The accounting policies set out below have 
been consistently applied in 2017 and the comparative year. 
There were no new Standards, amendments or interpretations 
to existing Standards which have been published and endorsed 
by the EU and which have a significant impact on the results, 
financial position or presentation of the consolidated financial 
statements for the year ended 30 September 2017.
1.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention, except for derivative 
financial instruments which are held at fair value. The 
consolidated financial statements have been prepared  
on a going concern basis, as discussed on page 65.
1.2 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Company (its subsidiaries). Control exists when the Company 
has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of 
an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The assets, 
liabilities and results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of 
during the year are included in the Consolidated Income 
Statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the 
effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into 
line with those detailed herein to ensure that the Group financial 
statements are prepared on a consistent basis. All intra-Group 
transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in 
preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Non-controlling interests, defined as minority interests, in the 
net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately 
from the Group’s equity therein. Minority interests consist of the 
amount of those interests at the date of the original business 
combination and the minority’s share of changes in equity since 
the date of the combination.
1.3 Acquisitions
Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method as 
at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group. Goodwill at the acquisition date 
represents the cost of the business combination (excluding 
acquisition related costs, which are expensed as incurred) plus 
the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree in 
excess of the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Minority interests may be initially measured at fair value or, 
alternatively, at the minority interest’s proportionate share of 
the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
The choice of measurement basis is made for each business 
combination separately.
1.4 Divestments
The results and cash flows of major lines of businesses that have 
been divested have been classified as discontinued businesses. 
There were no discontinued operations in either 2017 or 2016.
1.5 Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable for goods and services supplied to 
customers, after deducting sales allowances and value added 
taxes; revenue receivable for services supplied to customers,  
as opposed to goods, is less than ca. 3% of Group revenue. 
Revenue is recognised when the risk and rewards of ownership 
transfers to the customer, which depending on individual 
customer terms, is at the time of despatch, delivery or upon 
formal customer acceptance. Provision is made for returns 
where appropriate. Service revenue received in advance is 
deferred and recognised on a pro rata basis over the period  
of the contract.
1.6 Employee benefits
The Group operates a number of pension plans, both of the 
defined contribution and defined benefit type. The defined 
benefit plan is operated by Diploma Holdings PLC and is closed 
to the accrual of further benefits.
a) Defined contribution pension plans: Contributions to the 
Group’s defined contribution schemes are recognised as an 
employee benefit expense when they fall due.
b) Defined benefit pension plan: The deficit recognised in the 
balance sheet for the Group’s defined benefit pension plan is 
the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the 
balance sheet date less the fair value of the scheme assets. 
The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent 
actuaries using the projected unit cost method and by 
discounting the estimated future cash flows using interest 
rates on high quality corporate bonds. The pension expense 
for the Group’s defined benefit plan is recognised as follows:
i) Within the Consolidated Income Statement:
– Gains and losses arising on settlements and 
curtailments – where the item that gave rise to the 
settlement or curtailment is recognised in operating 
profit.
– Interest cost on the net deficit in the plan – calculated 
by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit 
liability at the start of the annual reporting period.
ii) Within the Consolidated Statement of Income and Other 
Comprehensive Income (“Other Comprehensive Income”):
– Actuarial gains and losses arising on the assets and 
liabilities of the plan arising from actual experience and 
any changes in assumptions at the end of the year.
 The Group has adopted a policy of recognising all actuarial 
gains and losses for its defined benefit plan in the period in 
which they occur, outside the Consolidated Income 
Statement, but in Other Comprehensive Income.
c) Share-based payments: Equity-settled transactions  
(which are where the Executive Directors and certain senior 
employees receive a part of their remuneration in the form of 
shares in the Company, or rights over shares) are measured 
at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at 
the grant date takes account of the effect of market based 
measures, such as the Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) 
targets upon which vesting of part of the award is conditional 
and is expensed to the Consolidated Income Statement  
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with a 
corresponding credit to equity. The cumulative expense 
recognised is adjusted to take account of shares forfeited by 
Executives who leave during the performance or vesting 
period and, in the case of non-market related performance 
conditions, where it becomes unlikely that shares will vest. 
For the market-based measure, the Directors have used a 
predicted future value model to determine fair value of the 
shares at the date of grant.
Group Accounting Policies
For the year ended 30 September 2017 89 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
 The Group operates an Employee Benefit Trust for the 
granting of shares to Executives. The cost of shares in the 
Company purchased by the Employee Benefit Trust are 
shown as a deduction from equity.
1.7 Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group entity are 
prepared in their functional currency, which is the currency  
of the primary economic environment in which that entity 
operates. For the purpose of the consolidated financial 
statements, the results and financial position of each entity are 
translated into UK sterling, which is the presentational currency 
of the Group.
a) Reporting foreign currency transactions in functional currency:
 Transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency (foreign currencies) are initially recorded at the rates 
of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.  
At each subsequent balance sheet date:
i) Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at  
the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange 
differences arising on the settlement or retranslation  
of monetary items are recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement.
ii) Non-monetary items measured at historical cost in  
a foreign currency are not retranslated.
iii) Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign 
currency are retranslated using the exchange rates at the 
date the fair value was determined. Where a gain or loss 
on non-monetary items is recognised directly in equity, 
any exchange component of that gain or loss is also 
recognised directly in equity and conversely, where  
a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised  
in the Consolidated Income Statement, any exchange 
component of that gain or loss is also recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement.
b) Translation from functional currency to presentational 
currency:
 When the functional currency of a Group entity is different 
from the Group’s presentational currency, its results and 
financial position are translated into the presentational 
currency as follows:
i) Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates 
prevailing at the balance sheet date.
ii) Income and expense items are translated at average 
exchange rates for the year, except where the use of such 
an average rate does not approximate the exchange rate 
at the date of the transaction, in which case the 
transaction rate is used.
iii) All resulting exchange differences are recognised in Other 
Comprehensive Income; these cumulative exchange 
differences are recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement in the period in which the foreign operation  
is disposed of.
c) Net investment in foreign operations:
 Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that  
forms part of a reporting entity’s net investment in a  
foreign operation are recognised in the Consolidated  
Income Statement in the separate financial statements of  
the reporting entity or the foreign operation as appropriate.  
In the consolidated financial statements such exchange 
differences are initially recognised in Other Comprehensive 
Income as a separate component of equity and subsequently 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on 
disposal of the net investment.
1.8 Taxation
The tax expense relates to the sum of current tax and  
deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year, which differs 
from profit before taxation as reported in the Consolidated 
Income Statement. Taxable profit excludes items of income and 
expense that are taxable (or deductible) in other years and also 
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s 
liability for current tax, including UK corporation tax and 
overseas tax, is calculated using rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax is recognised on differences between  
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the 
computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and 
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Temporary 
differences arise primarily from the recognition of the deficit on 
the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme, the difference 
between accelerated capital allowances and depreciation and 
for short term timing differences where a provision held against 
receivables or inventory is not deductible for taxation purposes. 
However, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if 
the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax 
profit, nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are also recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where 
the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is possible that the temporary difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future. No deferred tax is 
recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, 
as the Group controls the dividend policies of its subsidiaries.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is 
settled. Deferred tax is charged or credited to the Consolidated 
Income Statement, except when the item on which the tax or 
charge is credited or charged directly to equity, in which case 
the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. The carrying amount 
of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date 
and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of 
the assets to be recovered. Tax assets and liabilities are offset 
when there is a legally enforceable right to enforce current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred 
income tax relates to the same fiscal authority.
1.9 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Cost comprises the purchase price plus costs directly incurred in 
bringing the asset into use, but excluding interest. All repairs 
and maintenance expenditure is charged to the Consolidated 
Income Statement in the period in which it is incurred. 90 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.9 Property, plant and equipment continued
Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other items of 
property, plant and equipment begins when the asset is available 
for use and is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on 
a straight-line basis to write off the cost, less residual value of the 
asset, over its estimated useful life as follows:
Freehold property – between 20 and 50 years 
Leasehold property – term of the lease
Plant and equipment – plant and machinery between 3 and 
7 years 
– IT hardware between 3 and 5 years
– fixtures and fittings between 5 and 
15 years
Hospital field equipment – 5 years
The depreciation method used, residual values and estimated 
useful lives are reviewed and changed, if appropriate, at least at 
each financial year end. Assets held under finance leases are 
depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis 
as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant 
lease. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately 
to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is 
greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses 
arising on disposals are determined by comparing sales 
proceeds with carrying amount and are recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement.
1.10 Intangible assets
All intangible assets, excluding goodwill arising on a business 
combination, are stated at their amortised cost or fair value less 
any provision for impairment.
a) Research and development costs
Research expenditure is written off as incurred. Development 
costs are written off as incurred unless forecast revenues for a 
particular project exceed attributable forecast development 
costs in which case they are capitalised and amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the asset’s estimated useful life. Costs 
are capitalised as intangible assets unless physical assets,  
such as tooling, exist when they are classified as property,  
plant and equipment.
b) Computer software costs
Where computer software is not integral to an item of property, 
plant or equipment its costs are capitalised as other intangible 
assets. Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis over its 
useful economic life of between three and seven years.
c) Acquired intangible assets – business combinations
Intangible assets that may be acquired as a result of a business 
combination, include, but are not limited to, customer lists, 
supplier lists, databases, technology and software and patents 
that can be separately measured at fair value, on a reliable basis, 
are separately recognised on acquisition at the fair value, 
together with the associated deferred tax liability. Amortisation 
is charged on a straight-line basis to the Consolidated Income 
Statement over the expected useful economic lives.
Fair values of customer and supplier relationships on larger 
acquisitions are valued using a discounted cash flow model; 
databases are valued using a replacement cost model. For 
smaller acquisitions, intangible assets are assessed using 
historical experience of similar transactions.
d) Goodwill – business combinations
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary represents the 
excess of the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration 
over the aggregate fair value of the identifiable intangible, 
tangible and current assets and net of the aggregate fair value  
of the liabilities (including contingent liabilities of businesses 
acquired at the date of acquisition). Goodwill is initially 
recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at 
cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Transaction costs 
are expensed and are not included in the cost of acquisition.
1.11 Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying 
amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (”CGU”) exceeds its 
recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of:  
(i) its fair value less costs to sell: and (ii) its value in use; its value 
in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to 
be derived from the asset or CGU, discounted using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or 
cash-generating unit. Impairment losses are recognised 
immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
a) Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to a 
CGU; CGUs for this purpose are the Group’s three Sectors which 
represent the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill 
is monitored by the Group’s Board of Directors for internal and 
management purposes. CGUs to which goodwill has been 
allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently 
when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying 
amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to 
reduce the goodwill attributable to the CGU. Impairment losses 
cannot be subsequently reversed.
b) Impairment of other tangible and intangible assets
Other tangible and intangible assets are reviewed for 
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate 
the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment losses 
and any subsequent reversals are recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement.
1.12 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (generally calculated  
on a weighted average cost basis) and net realisable value, after 
making due allowance for any obsolete or slow moving inventory. 
Cost comprises direct materials, duty and freight-in costs.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less 
all estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs 
necessary to make the sale.

For the year ended 30 September 2017 91 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
1.13 Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Group 
balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
a) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially measured at fair value, do not carry 
any interest and are reduced by a charge for impairment for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts. Such impairment charges are 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
b) Trade payables
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are initially 
measured at their nominal value.
c) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, interest 
bearing deposits, bank overdrafts and short term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less that 
are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank 
overdrafts are repayable on demand and can form an integral 
part of the Group’s cash management.
d) Put options held by minority interests
The purchase price of shares to be acquired under options held 
by minority shareholders in the Group’s subsidiaries are 
calculated by reference to the estimated profitability of the 
relevant subsidiary at the time of exercise, using a multiple 
based formula. The net present value of the estimated future 
payments under these put options is shown as a financial 
liability. The corresponding entry is recognised in equity as a 
deduction against retained earnings. At the end of each year, 
the estimate of the financial liability is reassessed and any 
change in value is recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement, as part of finance income or expense. Where the 
liability is in a foreign currency, any change in the value of the 
liability resulting from changes in exchange rates is recognised 
in the Consolidated Income Statement.
e) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group holds derivative financial instruments in the form  
of forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its foreign 
currency exposure. These derivatives are designated as cash 
flow hedges. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date  
a derivative contract is entered into and subsequent changes  
in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives which are 
designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are 
recognised in equity in the hedging reserve and in Other 
Comprehensive Income and are reclassified to profit or loss on 
maturity of the derivative. Changes in the fair value of foreign 
currency derivatives which are ineffective or do not meet the 
criteria for hedge accounting in accordance with IAS39 are 
recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Group documents, at the inception of the transaction, the 
relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, 
as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for 
undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also 
documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an 
ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in 
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes 
in cash flows of hedged items. 
No derivative contracts have been designated as fair value 
hedges or net investment hedges.
f) Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the 
consideration received. They are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost. Borrowings are classified as non-current when 
the repayment date is more than 12 months from the period-end 
date or where they are drawn on a facility with more than 12 
months to expiry.
1.14 Investments (available for sale financial assets)
The investment held by the Group comprises equity shares 
which are not held for the purposes of equity trading and in 
accordance with IAS39 is classified as available for sale. They  
are initially recognised at fair value. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein 
are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income.
1.15 Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms  
of the lease transfer substantially all the risk and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. Leases include hire purchase contracts 
which have characteristics similar to finance or operating leases. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases. Rentals 
payable under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated 
Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
relevant lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive 
to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line 
basis over the expected lease term.
1.16 Other liabilities
Other liabilities are recognised when the Group has legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is 
possible that the Group will be required to settle that obligation. 
Other liabilities are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of 
the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance 
sheet date. 
1.17 Dividends
The annual final dividend is not provided for until approved at the 
AGM; interim dividends are charged in the period they are paid.
1.18 Share capital and reserves
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs 
directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in 
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. The Group 
also maintains the following reserves:
a) Translation reserve – The translation reserve comprises all 
foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of 
the financial statements of foreign businesses.
b) Hedging reserve – The hedging reserve comprises the 
effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair 
value of cash flow hedging instruments that are determined 
to be an effective hedge. 
c) Retained earnings reserve – The retained earnings reserve 
comprises total cumulative recognised income and expense 
attributable to shareholders. Bonus issues of share capital 
and dividends to shareholders are also charged directly to 
this reserve. In addition the cost of acquiring shares in the 
Company and the liability to provide those shares to 
employees, is accounted for in this reserve.  92 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.18 Share capital and reserves continued
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity 
share capital and holds that share either directly as treasury 
shares or indirectly within an ESOP trust, the consideration paid, 
including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of 
income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the 
Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled, 
reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently 
sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly 
attributable incremental transaction costs and the related 
income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the 
Company’s equity holders. These shares are used to satisfy 
share awards granted to Directors under the Group’s share 
schemes. The Trustee purchases the Company’s shares on the 
open market using loans made by the Company or a subsidiary 
of the Company.
1.19 Related parties
There are no related party transactions (other than with the key 
management) that are required to be disclosed in accordance 
with IAS24. Details of their remuneration are given in note 5 to 
the consolidated financial statements.
1.20 Accounting Standards, interpretations and amendments 
to published standards not yet effective
The IASB has published a number of new Standards, 
amendments and interpretations to existing Standards which 
are not yet effective, but will be mandatory for the Group’s 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2017.  
Set out below are those which are considered most relevant  
to the Group:
• IFRS15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”: IFRS15 is 
effective for the Group for the year ended 30 September 
2019. The Group reviewed its revenue recognition policies 
and concluded that for substantially all of its sales to 
customers the performance obligation is the delivery of 
goods and it is therefore appropriate to recognise revenue  
at a single point of time, on delivery of goods, which is 
consistent with the current accounting policies. The review 
has identified specific contracts within Life Sciences where 
goods and services are sold together which in aggregate 
account for less than 5% of Group consolidated revenues. 
The impact of the application of IFRS15 to these contracts  
is unlikely to have a material impact on Group revenues or 
adjusted operating profit. 
• IFRS16 “Leases”: IFRS16 is effective for the Group for the  
year ended 30 September 2020 and the Group has begun an 
impact assessment on the consolidated financial statements 
in 2018.
The following new or amended standards are not expected  
to have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements:
• IAS12 “Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised 
Losses”; and
• IFRS9 “Financial Instruments”.
1.21 Accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial 
statements does not require management to make any critical 
accounting judgements, assumptions or estimates with regard 
to assets or liabilities that could potentially have a material 
adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities in 
the next 12 months. 
Management however are required to make judgements, 
assumptions and estimates relating to certain assets and 
liabilities that could potentially have a material impact over  
the longer term. These relate to:
1.21.1 Acquisition accounting and goodwill impairment
When the Group makes an acquisition it recognises the 
identifiable assets and liabilities, including intangible assets,  
at fair value with the difference between the fair value of net 
assets acquired and the fair value of consideration paid 
comprising goodwill. Acquisitions are accounted for using the 
acquisition method as described in note 1.3 and 1.10 of Group 
Accounting Policies the key assumptions and estimates used  
to determine the valuation of intangible assets acquired are the 
forecast cash flows, the discount rate and customer/supplier 
attrition. Customer and supplier relationships are valued using  
a discounted cash flow model. Acquisitions often comprise an 
element of deferred consideration and may include a minority 
interest, which are subject to put options. These put options  
are valued at fair value at the date of acquisition. Deferred 
consideration is fair valued based on the Directors’ estimate  
of future performance of the acquired entity.
The Group’s growth strategy is to grow through acquisitions. 
This results in material amounts of goodwill and intangible 
assets (principally customer and supplier relationships) being 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. 
As set out in note 1.11 of Group Accounting Policies, goodwill  
is tested annually to determine if there is any indication of 
impairment. Assumptions are then used to determine the 
recoverable amount of each CGU, principally based on the 
present value of estimated future cash flows to derive the  
“value in use” to the Group of the capitalised goodwill.  
The key estimates made and assumptions used in performing 
impairment testing this year are set out in note 10 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
1.21.2 Inventory provisions
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value as set out in note 1.12 of Group Accounting Policies.  
In the course of normal trading activities, judgement is used to 
establish the net realisable value of inventory and impairment 
charges are made for obsolete or slow-moving inventories and 
against excess inventories.
The decision to make an impairment charge is based on a 
number of factors including management’s assessment of the 
current trading environment, aged profiles and historical usage 
and other matters which are relevant at the time the 
consolidated financial statements are approved.
1.21.3 Defined benefit pension
Defined benefit pensions are accounted for as set out in note 1.6 
of Group Accounting Policies. Determining the value of the 
future defined benefit obligation requires estimates in respect of 
the assumptions used to calculate present values. These include 
discount rate, future mortality and inflation. Management 
makes these estimates in consultation with an independent 
actuary. Details of the estimates and key sensitivities made in 
calculating the defined benefit obligation at 30 September 2017 
are set out in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 September 2017
a) Accounting policies
a.1) Basis of accounting
The Parent Company financial statements (“Financial Statements”) have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 
and FRS101 “Reduced Disclosures Framework”. The Directors confirm they have a reasonable expectation that the Company has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and accordingly, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements. The Financial Statements are presented in UK sterling and all values are rounded 
to the nearest million pounds (£m) except when otherwise indicated.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no separate profit and loss account is presented for the Company. There were 
no gains or losses either in the current or preceding years recognised in other comprehensive income. 
The following disclosures have not been provided as permitted by FRS101: 
• a cash flow statement and related notes;
• a comparative period reconciliation for share capital;
• disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned 
subsidiaries;
• disclosures in respect of capital management;
• the effects of new but not yet effective IFRS;
• disclosures in respect of the compensation of key 
management personnel as required. 
The Company has also taken the exemption under FRS101 available in respect of the requirements of paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 
of IFRS2 “Share-based Payment” in respect of group settled share-based payments as the consolidated financial statements of the 
Company include the equivalent disclosures.
a.2) Total Comprehensive Income
Total Comprehensive Income comprises dividends received from subsidiaries, interest payable on inter-company balances, net of 
tax. Total Comprehensive Income is distributable to shareholders. 
a.3) Dividends
Dividend income is recognised when received. Final dividend distributions are recognised in the Company’s Financial Statements in 
the year in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
The capacity of the Company to make dividend payments is primarily determined by the availability of retained distributable reserves 
and cash resources. As at 30 September 2017 the Company had distributable reserves of £49.2m (2016: £45.8m) and the total 
external dividends declared in 2017 amounted to £26.0m. When required the Company can receive dividends from its subsidiaries to 
further increase distributable reserves.
a.4) Diploma PLC Employment Benefit Trust and employee share schemes
Shares held by the Diploma PLC Employee Benefit Trust (“the Trust”) are stated at cost and accounted for as a deduction from 
shareholders’ funds in accordance with UITF 38. Shares that are held by the Trust are not eligible for dividends until such time as the 
awards have vested and options have been exercised by the participants.
a.5) Auditor’s remuneration
Fees payable to the auditor for the audit of the Company’s accounts of £3,500 (2016: £3,500) were borne by a fellow Group undertaking.
b) Directors’ and employees’ remuneration
No remuneration is paid directly by the Company; information on the Directors’ remuneration (which is paid by an immediate holding 
company) and their interests in the share capital of the Company are set out in the Remuneration Committee Report on pages 51 to 
63. The Company had no employees (2016: none).

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of 
Diploma PLC
Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 
30 September 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union; 
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice including Financial Reporting Standard 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements of Diploma plc (“the Parent Company”) and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) which comprise:
• the Consolidated Income Statement;
• the Consolidated Statement of Income and Other Comprehensive Income;
• the Consolidated and Parent Company Statement of Financial Position;
• the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Changes In Equity;
• the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement;
• the Group Accounting Policies; and
• the related notes 1 to 29 and notes (a) to (d) to the Parent Company Financial Statements.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent 
company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS101 “Reduced Disclosure 
Framework” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit 
of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services prohibited 
by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
• recoverability of goodwill and assessment for impairment;
• accounting for acquisitions; and 
• appropriateness of inventory obsolescence provisioning.
Within this report, any new key audit matters are identified with  and any key audit matters 
which are the same as the prior year identified with 
Materiality The materiality that we used in the current year was £3.2m which was determined on the basis 
of approximately 5% of profit before tax.
Scoping We have performed full scope audits at 13 locations, with an additional nine locations subject to 
specified audit procedures which address each of the significant balances and key audit risks 
within these entities. Together, the work at these locations represents the principal business 
units of the Group and accounts for 81% of the Group’s revenues and 83% of the Group’s 
operating profit.
Significant changes  
in our approach
There have been no other significant changes in our approach in the year. 96 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement
We have reviewed the Directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness of the going concern 
basis of accounting contained within page 65 to the financial statements and the Directors’ 
statement on the longer-term viability of the Group contained within the Strategic Report on 
page 32.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in 
relation to:
• the disclosures on pages 32 to 35 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are 
being managed or mitigated;
• the Directors’ confirmation on page 32 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the Directors’ statement on page 65 to the financial statements about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them 
and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group and the Parent Company’s 
ability to continue to do so over a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of 
the financial statements;
• the Directors’ explanation on page 32 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the 
Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be 
appropriate and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions; or
• whether the Directors’ statements relating to going concern and the prospects of the 
company required in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) are materially inconsistent with 
our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have 
nothing material to add 
or draw attention to in 
respect of these matters.
We agreed with the Directors’ 
adoption of the going 
concern basis of accounting 
and we did not identify any 
such material uncertainties. 
However, because not all 
future events or conditions 
can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee 
as to the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Recoverability of goodwill and assessment for impairment 
Key audit matter description As at the year end, the Group held an aggregate of £122.8m of goodwill (2016: £115.2m) on the 
Statement of Financial Position and, as such, it is the most significant asset class. This goodwill 
has been recognised in respect of acquisitions that the Group has undertaken in the current and 
previous years.
We consider that the carrying value of goodwill is a key area due to the judgemental inputs 
involved in the assessment for impairment. There are a number of such inputs used when 
assessing for impairment, including the determination of the discount rate, the determination 
of projected cash flows which includes assumptions relating to medium and long term growth 
rates and gross margins and the sensitivities applied. 
Refer also to page 45 (Audit Committee Report), page 88 for the Group Accounting Policies and 
note 10 of the consolidated financial statements (page 74).
How the scope of our  
audit responded to the  
key audit matter 
We have obtained management’s goodwill impairment review calculations and assessed the 
mechanical accuracy of the model. Furthermore, we challenged the assumptions and inputs 
used in the impairment model including the revenue growth rates and margins, discount rates, 
long term growth rates and the sensitivities applied and disclosed. 
Our procedures included reviewing forecast cash flows with reference to historical trading 
performance and the Board-approved budgets and consulting with our valuation specialists 
who benchmarked assumptions such as the discount rate to external macroeconomic and 
market data.
The long term growth rate used in the cash flow projections was assessed to check that  
it did not materially differ to the average long term growth rate in any territories in which  
the Group operates. 
We have also performed sensitivity analysis on the impairment model to determine if a 
reasonable possible adverse change in the key assumptions, results in the carrying amount 
exceeding the recoverable amount for any cash generating unit.
Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of 
Diploma PLC continued
Report on the audit of the financial statements continued 97 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Key observations We concluded that the assumptions and judgements set out in management’s model are 
reasonable and we concur with the Directors’ assessment that there is no impairment. We also 
considered the disclosures within the consolidated financial statements to be appropriate.
Accounting for acquisitions 
Key audit matter description The Group has made one material acquisition in the year, being Abacus. The total combined 
consideration for this acquisition was £14.1m and an additional £6.1m of goodwill and £7.8m of 
intangible assets were recognised. The judgements used in determining the value of the 
goodwill and intangible assets and the allocation between these asset classes could, if 
performed inaccurately, lead to a material misstatement.
There is significant judgement and complexity involved in the allocation of excess consideration 
over net assets of the acquiree between the fair value of intangible assets and remaining 
goodwill. For the fair value of intangible assets, this includes estimates for growth rates, 
discount rates and retention rates for supplier relationships. 
Management must exercise judgement to accurately measure the fair value of the acquired 
assets and liabilities as at the acquisition date. This includes, for example, assessing the 
amounts required for any additional inventory or receivables provisions.
Refer also to page 45 (Audit Committee Report), page 88 for the Group Accounting Policies and 
note 22 of the consolidated financial statements (page 82).
How the scope of our  
audit responded to the  
key audit matter 
We have obtained management’s calculations for the accounting for the acquisition and we 
checked the mathematical accuracy of each acquisition model. We also assessed the 
adjustments to assets and liabilities in order to bring them to fair value and have held 
discussions with management in order to challenge the completeness of these adjustments. 
In order to assess the accuracy of the acquired intangible assets valuation, we have reviewed 
the methodology applied in management’s calculation and challenged the assumptions behind 
the calculation including the growth rates, discount rates and supplier retention rates. We have 
involved our own internal specialists to assist in our assessment. We have reviewed the 
disclosures included within note 11 of the consolidated financial statements (page 75).
Key observations We are satisfied that the assumptions and judgements used to determine the value of 
intangible assets acquired and the fair value adjustments made to the assets and liabilities of 
the acquired entity are reasonable. 
We have not identified any material misstatements in the accounting for acquisitions and 
consider the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements to be appropriate. 98 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Appropriateness of inventory obsolescence provisioning  
Key audit matter description The valuation of inventory as at 30 September 2017 is £76.1m (2016: £66.8m), recorded net of a 
provision of £8.3m (2016: £7.8m). High levels of inventory are held across the Group, which gives 
rise to a greater risk of there being slow moving or obsolete lines of inventory. Therefore, we 
have determined that there is a key risk that inventory is recorded below its net realisable value 
due to insufficient obsolescence provisions.
Management judgement is required in determining the completeness of inventory provisions 
and making an assessment of their adequacy, considering the age and volumes of inventory 
relative to expected usage. We have identified a risk of fraud in relation to this judgement.
Changes to these assumptions could result in a material change in the carrying value of 
inventory and the associated movement recorded in the income statement. 
Refer also to page 45 (Audit Committee Report), page 88 for the Group Accounting Policies and 
note 15 of the consolidated financial statements (page 77).
How the scope of our  
audit responded to the  
key audit matter 
We evaluated the recorded inventory obsolescence provision by obtaining management’s 
workings and independently recalculating the provision in line with their stated policy. 
We challenged the underlying assumptions and completeness of the provision by considering 
the age and volumes of inventory relative to expected usage. Any aged inventory lines which 
were excluded from management’s calculation were also challenged in order to further verify 
completeness of the provision. 
Management’s historical ability to estimate the required inventory obsolescence provision was 
assessed by comparing write-offs during the period to the prior period provision.
Furthermore, we compared the actual sales value of a sample of inventory items to their book 
value to ascertain that the carrying value of inventories does not exceed their net realisable value.
Key observations We are satisfied that the provision for inventory obsolescence is not materially misstated.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of 
our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality We determined materiality for the Group to be £3.2m (2016: £2.7m). 
Basis for determining 
materiality
Materiality is based on a calculation of approximately 5% (2016: 5%) of profit before tax (“PBT”).
Rationale for the  
benchmark applied
PBT has been chosen as the basis for materiality as this is the measure by which stakeholders 
and the market assess the wider performance of the entity and is the key metric that current 
and potential investors monitor when making their financial decisions.

Diploma PLC continued

Audit of components are performed at a materiality level not exceeding 50% (2016: 50%) of Group materiality (£1.6m, 2016: £1.35m).

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £160,000 (2016: 
£130,000), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. Having assessed 
the facts and circumstances of the Group and the prior history of misstatements, we determined that an increase in this threshold 
from prior year was appropriate. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the 
overall presentation of the financial statements.  
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and it environment, including Group-wide controls and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level and where these are most likely to occur in the business. Based on 
this assessment, we focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at 13 (2016: 12) locations, with the increase from the 
prior year due to the inclusion of DHG Australia as a full scope audit following the acquisition of Abacus by the Group during the 
period. Each of these 13 locations was subject to a full scope audit. An additional nine (2016: eight) locations were subject to specified 
audit procedures which address each of the significant balances and key audit risks within these entities. Together the work at these 
locations represents the principal business units of the Group and accounts for 81% (2016: 75%) of the Group’s revenue and 83% 
(2016: 80%) of the Group’s operating profit.
The Group audit team has designed and implemented a country visit programme so that the Senior Statutory Auditor or another 
senior member of the Group audit team visits the component locations to hold discussions with the lead partner, review their 
working papers, conclude on any findings an attend close out meetings with local management. Each year this programme of visits 
includes the three most significant territories (being the US, Canada and UK).
Where no visits are carried out the Senior Statutory Auditor or another senior member of the team has held discussions with the lead 
partner and attended close out meetings by phone.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion 
that there were no significant risks of material misstatement in the aggregated financial information of the remaining components 
not subject to audit or specified audit procedures.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditor’s 
report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the 
extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required 
to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material 
misstatements of the other information include where we conclude that:
• Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the Directors that they consider 
the Annual Report and Financial Statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit; or
• Audit Committee reporting – the section describing the work of the Audit Committee does 
not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of 
the Directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for 
review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a 
departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
We have nothing to report in 
respect of these matters.
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view and for such internal control as the Directors determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an Auditor’s Report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is  
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Auditor’s Report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an Auditor’s Report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the part of the Remuneration Committee Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent Company and their environment obtained in the course 
of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns. 
We have nothing to report in 
respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain 
disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records  
and returns.
We have nothing to report in 
respect of these matters.
Other matters
Auditor tenure
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the Board to audit the financial statements for the 
year ending 30 September 2008 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous 
renewals and reappointing of the firm is ten years, covering the years ended 2008 to 2017. Following a full tender process the Board 
intends to appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as its auditor for the financial year ending 30 September 2018, subject to 
shareholder approval at the 2018 AGM. 
Consistency of the Audit Report with the additional report to the Audit Committee
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee we are required to provide in accordance with 
ISAs (UK).
