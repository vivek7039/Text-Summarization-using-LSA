Chairman’s statement
In 2018 we celebrate 25 years since the 
launch of the company in January 1993. The 
core of the company’s success remains the 
distinctive Admiral culture which drives 
the way that our people work and serve our 
customers in the UK, Italy, Spain, France and 
the US.
2006
“ On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all the 9,600 people at Admiral for  
their continued hard work and contribution to a record-breaking set of results  
for the Group in 2017.”
I am delighted and honoured to have taken 
over the helm as the Chairman of Admiral 
at the AGM in April 2017. My predecessor, 
Alastair Lyons, who ably steered the ship for 
over 16 years, has left some large shoes to 
fill. I would like to thank him for his service 
and enabling a smooth transition.
As Chairman of the Group I will focus my 
efforts on: 
• Continuing to build on the remarkably 
special Admiral culture and in so doing 
putting our people and customers at  
the heart of what we do
• Continuing the history of growth, 
profitability and innovation
• Investing in the development and  
growth of our people
• Ensuring excellent governance 
and the highest standards.
2017 Overview
Admiral Group has delivered another record 
set of results in 2017: record turnover and 
profit, strong return on capital, strong 
solvency ratio and record customer numbers.
The Group has continued to grow strongly 
with turnover increasing by 15% to £2.96 
billion. Customer numbers increased 11% to 
over 5.7 million.
The Group’s share of pre-tax profit increased 
by 43% to £405.4 million. Earnings per share 
and return on equity both increased by 49% 
to 117.2 pence and 55% respectively. The 
Group’s solvency ratio remains very strong 
at 205%.
In UK Insurance, there was another strong 
performance from the Group’s core UK 
Motor business where the number of insured 
vehicles grew by 8% to 3.96 million. In line 
with usual trends, profitability benefited 
from significant prior year reserve releases. 
2007
Balumba.es 
launched

04 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report: Chairman’s statement Whilst we devote time and resources to 
exploring new opportunities outside of car 
insurance we also recognise that this remains 
our core focus. We continue to invest heavily 
in improving our core skills as evidenced 
by our continuing growth in premiums and 
profit. We also have a range of innovations 
including car sharing insurance, learner 
driver insurance and we remain the largest 
telematics provider in the UK.
There is still a backdrop of uncertainty in 
our largest business, UK Car, due to the 
continued deliberations over the Ogden rate 
affecting large personal injury claims. We 
expect to see some conclusions on the way 
forward in 2018. In the meantime, we have 
taken a prudent approach and reflected the 
current discount rate in our reserves.
Household Insurance continues to grow 
apace. Turnover is now £107.1 million and 
properties insured have increased by 41% 
to 0.7 million. Customers buy from us either 
using price comparison sites, directly and, 
increasingly, using our MultiCover offering, 
building on the success of MultiCar.
2017 saw the successful launch of our in-
house underwritten van insurance product 
and, most recently, the launch of our new 
travel insurance product.
Most significantly, we have launched 
personal loans, firstly unsecured, then car 
finance as part of our new Admiral Financial 
Services business. We expect this to be an 
increasingly significant part of our business 
in future.
We are continuing to invest in our overseas 
insurance businesses, bearing fruit with 
reduced losses overall (despite the impact of 
Hurricane Harvey in the US) and another year 
of profits in ConTe. Turnover and customer 
numbers are continuing to grow materially 
by some 23% and 20% respectively and we 
now have £0.5 billion of combined turnover 
and over one million customers outside 
the UK. We believe we are on the cusp of 
delivering long term profit for the Group.
As a result of Brexit, we are exploring 
establishing an insurance company and an 
insurance intermediary business in Spain to 
support our European operations.
In our Price Comparison (PC) businesses, 
Confused.com in the UK continues to face a 
competitive and challenging market, whilst 
it implements its new Drivers Win strategy; 
this is offset by encouraging growth in 
Compare.com in the US and record profits at 
Rastreator and LeLynx, with all PC businesses 
delivering an improved customer experience. 
Our joint venture Preminen PC business 
continues to explore new opportunities 
and has recently established operations in 
Mexico and is soon to be in Turkey.

Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction What makes Admiral different?
Our successful model which has been 
maintained since launch is definitely worth 
a further mention. It can be distilled into  
the following areas:
• Highly talented team – David Stevens 
leads a strong, capable and experienced 
management team which engages the 
whole business
• Focus – targeted diversification building 
on our core skills
• Pricing – data analysis lies at the heart  
of what we do
• Prudent reserving – continuing our 
conservative approach to claims reserving
• Claims management – consistent positive 
feedback from customers on the service 
they receive
• Controlled test and learn – organic growth 
with measured expansion steps
• Low-cost approach – constantly 
challenging ourselves on how we can  
do things more cost effectively 
• Shareholder returns – we believe in 
returning excess capital to shareholders.
Overall we believe that people who like what 
they do, do it better.
Dividend
The Directors have proposed a final dividend 
of 58.0 pence per share (2016: 51.5 pence) for 
the year to 31 December 2017, representing 
a distribution of 97% of our second half 
earnings. This included a normal dividend 
(65% of post-tax profits) of 39.5 pence per 
share and a further special dividend of 18.5 
pence per share comprising earnings not 
required to be held in the Group for solvency 
or buffers.
This will bring the total dividend for the year 
to 114.0 pence per share, an overall increase 
of 11% (excluding the additional return 
of surplus capital in 2016) and the 13th 
consecutive year that Admiral has paid  
an increased dividend. This represents a  
payout ratio of 97%.
The business has delivered a Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) of 382% over  
the last 9 years (as illustrated in the chart  
on page 79).
Corporate governance 
and Board changes
The Board recognises the need for a strong 
corporate governance framework and 
supporting processes across the Group and 
believes that good governance, with tone 
set from the top, is a key factor in delivering 
sustainable business performance and 
creating value for all the Group’s stakeholders.
The Board and I feel that the Board has 
a good balance of experience, skills and 
knowledge to support and challenge the 
management team and it is supported by 
effective governance and control systems. 
During the year the Board undertook a 
review of its effectiveness. Further details 
are provided in the Governance Report on 
pages 46 to 81.
Admiral’s incentive schemes remain 
distinctive, as every employee is a shareholder. 
They are designed to ensure that decisions 
are made by management to support long-
term growth, that the right behaviours are 
rewarded and that our people’s interests 
are aligned with those of shareholders. Our 
core belief is that over the long-term, share 
appreciation depends on delivering great 
outcomes for our customers. Further details 
are provided in the Remuneration Report on 
pages 62 to 81.

We have an amazing, distinctive culture 
at Admiral that values agility and

that puts customers first. We invest in our 
people and provide exciting opportunities

Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction Chief Executive's Statement
Unusually for a CEO statement, I am not 
going to talk about what a great job the 
managers have done for the shareholders, 
nor about the company’s performance over 
the last twelve months, or indeed, prospects 
for the next twelve.
Instead, at a time when the public support 
for the free market economy is fraying and 
many more people see the world of business 
as a zero sum game, where profit can only 
be earned at the expense of, rather than 
in the service of, customers, I’d like to talk 
about the value that Admiral has delivered 
for UK motorists over the last 20 years, while 
making, and not despite making, good  
profits throughout.
The first reason Admiral has been, and 
remains, good news for customers is that 
we operate at a lower cost than almost all 
our competitors. When shopping for car 
insurance, most motorists are looking for the 
best possible price, along with reassurance 
that they’ll be looked after well, when 
needed. Admiral’s lower costs mean lower 
premiums for our customers.
Over most of the last 20 years our costs 
have been lower than our competitors – by 
at least ten percentage points of premium. 
That’s the equivalent of £50 less expense 
for a typical policy, and over £200 less for a 
higher premium policy. And that’s one of the 
main reasons Admiral’s brands come top on 
the UK’s price comparison sites more often 
than any of our competitors.
In the nineties, the industry was dominated 
by large, often grossly inefficient, multi-
product, composite insurers with too many 
layers and top heavy structures. Most of 
those are long gone, under the pressure from 
upstarts like Admiral and other, lower-cost, 
Admiral-like, operators who have followed 
in our footsteps. So much the better for the 
customer and an example of the creative 
destruction which explains the success of 
competitive free markets.
“ The first reason Admiral has been, and remains, good news  
for customers is that we operate at a lower cost”
MultiCover; Telematics (200k+ customers, 
and rising); 10-month Bonus Accelerator (one 
from the nineties for real insurance anoraks) 
have all made our policies more attractive 
and more accessible to UK motorists 
and householders, and helped keep our 
acquisition costs low.
I strongly believe that a market made up  
of a large number of companies competing 
actively for customers’ attention and loyalty, 
combined with appropriate regulatory 
oversight, is a recipe for the best possible 
outcome for motorists and householders, 
and I believe that Admiral’s success over  
the last 25 years demonstrates why.
David Stevens, CBE
Chief Executive Officer  
27 February 2018
P.S. I don’t want to count chickens, but 
in a year during which our Italian insurer 
broke through 500,000 vehicles on cover, 
delivered a fourth year of profit in a row and 
reduced its expense ratio by an amazing six 
percentage points, I’m looking forward, in a 
few years time, to saving myself an hour or 
two by recycling the above CEO Statement, 
but just substituting “ConTe” for “Admiral”.
Cheap, but maybe “nasty” the cynics  
might reply.
Far from it.
With “an intention to renew after a claim” score 
of consistently well over 90% (94.5% in 2017 
to be precise) we deliver for our customers at 
the moment of truth. And you cannot build 
four million plus customers in the fiercely 
competitive UK insurance market without 
delivering a good customer experience. 
Not every time. 
We make mistakes. 
But we recognise the long-term value of the 
company depends on us making sure our 
customers, by and large, are not only glad 
to join us but also happy to stay with us.
If I’m proud of our outperformance on 
expense compared to the bulk of the car 
insurance market, I’m doubly proud of our 
expense ratio advantage in our relatively new 
and rapidly growing home insurance operation 
– doubly proud because our cost advantage 
over the market is not ten percentage points, 
but nearer twenty points. Again, this allows us 
to be the top most often on price comparison 
sites, while also making a profit. Admittedly, 
as yet, a small one, but watch this space.
How do we achieve lower costs while 
delivering a great product (5 star Defaqto 
ratings available across all Admiral’s Motor 
products) and (normally) a positive customer 
experience, and why don’t most of our 
competitors manage all three?
Well, it’s not just about the constant pursuit 
of efficiencies by a loyal and motivated team 
of employee shareholders (because all of us 
are both). It’s also about another great driver 
of growth in long-term prosperity in free 
market economies – innovation. Throughout 
our life major innovations such as

10 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Q
The International Insurance businesses 
have been part of the strategy for a 
number of years but have yet to deliver 
meaningful profits – does it make sense 
to keep them?
A
David: Our strategy has always been 
about building value over the longer term, 
by developing sustainable profitable 
businesses, rather than delivering short-
term profits. We believe that the combined 
European insurance businesses are on the 
cusp of demonstrating that value. ConTe, 
our Italian business delivered another profit 
for the year (a record) and collectively our 
European insurance businesses practically 
broke even over 2017 despite growing fast. 
We continue to invest in Admiral Seguros in 
Spain, L’olivier in France and Elephant in the 
US because we believe that there are strong 
prospects for long-term value creation in all 
three markets. The International Insurance 
businesses now insure over one million 
customers and may ultimately provide 
us with an opportunity to offer those 
customers more than just car insurance.
with David, Cristina and Geraint
Q
Admiral Household continues to  
grow and appears to be less  
affected by market conditions  
than competitors – why? 
A
Cristina: The UK household market is going 
through a period of change as more and 
more householders realise that they can 
shop online for their home insurance. We are 
taking advantage of that shift in customer 
behaviour. We recognise, however, that the 
household market is very different from 
motor insurance, so whilst our growth has 
been very strong since launch we continue 
to adopt a test and learn approach to our 
underwriting. We started with a relatively 
cautious underwriting footprint and have 
gradually expanded this as we have grown. 
During 2017 we have seen similar claims 
experience to the market but our cautious 
starting point has allowed us to absorb 
this with no significant impact on the 
Household result. 
Q
There has been a change of CEO at  
your US insurance operation, Elephant 
Auto – what does that mean for  
future strategy?
A
David: Alberto Schiavon, our new CEO 
at Elephant, working alongside Henry 
Engelhardt, took advantage of a second 
set of eyes to judge what was good about 
what we were doing and what could be done 
better. The conclusion was that we need to 
continue our drive towards lower loss ratios 
and to sharpen our focus on higher retaining 
customers throughout our product and 
process design, our pricing and underwriting 
rules and our marketing.
Q
Admiral has recently launched its 
personal lending business. Can you 
give us an update and also explain why 
you think now is a good time to enter 
the market with uncertain economic 
times ahead?
A
Geraint: It’s still early days for Admiral Loans, 
though we’re very pleased with the way 
things are going so far. We think we have a 
very strong team, a good system and the 
signs so far are really positive.
We of course recognise that an economic 
downturn could adversely affect loan credit 
losses. Our approach to loan underwriting 
is to minimise the possible adverse impact 
of such a downturn in our book by focusing 
on segments which have historically 
demonstrated better resilience in times 
of stress.
Ultimately downturns tend to be followed 
by upturns and by building and learning now, 
we hope to be in a position to benefit from 
a subsequent upturn as a competent player 
operating at an adequate scale.
10 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017 11
I have no doubt this approach will be valuable 
in helping us through to a sustainable scale 
and an ultimately profitable operation.
Q
Can you give us an update on the 
Internal Model and what this means  
for capital?
A
Geraint: Our team continues to do a great 
job building the model and putting in place 
the numerous processes and documents that 
are also needed for a successful application. 
We’re still on track to make our submission 
to the regulator by the end of 2018. At this 
point we’re not anticipating a significant 
change in the Group’s capital position under 
the model, though of course the outcome 
isn’t fully in our hands and so there is still 
some uncertainty over what that future 
position looks like.
Once the model is (hopefully) approved (and 
that shouldn’t be expected until well into 
2019), the Board will make an assessment of 
the capital position and work out what,  
if anything, that means for potential returns 
of surplus capital to shareholders.
Q
How do you see the long-term 
prospect of motor insurance given 
the continuing focus on autonomous 
technology and driverless cars?
A
David: There are widely varying views on 
when to expect autonomous technology 
but considerably less uncertainty about 
the impact; once we are in a world of 
autonomous vehicles, the requirement for 
motor insurance, as we currently know it, 
will change. What future motor insurance 
looks like is up for debate. We believe that 
the timescale for autonomous vehicles to 
become a meaningful part of the motor car 
parc is decades rather than sooner. Given 
the continued growth in developed and 
developing markets in the interim period, we 
believe there continues to be an opportunity 
for growth and for some interesting 
challenges where manual and autonomous 
vehicles are on the roads together. 
Ultimately, we recognise that as claims 
frequency falls as a result of sophisticated 
autonomous technology, average motor 
insurance premiums will reduce which could 
have a significant impact on our revenue 
and profits. We expect to see the impact 
mitigated by growth in other non-life 
insurance products and growth in personal 
lending. We will continue to explore other 
products to offset potentially lower levels 
of motor premium in the future. 
Q
What was the outcome of this year’s 
excess of loss reinsurance renewals  
and how was this influenced by Ogden? 
A
Cristina: In late December 2016, in 
anticipation of a change in the Ogden 
discount rate we increased our 2017 excess 
of loss reinsurance with no significant price 
increase. During 2017 reinsurers responded 
to the change in Ogden by significantly 
increasing their prices. For 2018, we 
reviewed the level of cover we required and 
returned closer to historic levels but at a 
higher cost. The temporary competitive 
disadvantage we experienced in 2016 has 
been reduced and we are back on a level 
playing field.
Q
The UK Motor market is increasingly 
competitive – is Admiral at risk of  
losing its competitive edge?
A
Cristina: It is a competitive market and one 
that looks significantly different from ten 
years ago (or even 25 years ago) when the 
primary players were large composite multi-
line insurers. We are now in an environment 
where around 45% of the UK motor market 
is in the hands of a small number of focused 
direct players, including Admiral. This focus, 
inevitably, leads to a superior performance 
by these players, but there is still significant 
inefficiency in the market as a whole. Whilst 
market data has become difficult to access, 
we believe our underwriting advantage 
against the market is still significant and that 
we continue to maintain largely the same 
margin on expense ratio that we did ten 
years ago. 
Are others getting better? Yes!
But Admiral is not standing still and waiting 
for them to catch up! We continue to look at 
ways in which we can improve and automate 
our internal processes to identify further 
efficiencies; to explore innovative ways 
of doing business as consumer behaviours 
change; and we continue to look for ways in 
which our detailed understanding of that 
customer behaviour can further enhance our 
underwriting strength.

RETURNS
We are committed to 
returning excess capital

We don’t starve our

EFFICIENT 
CAPITAL 
EMPLOYMENT
Sharing risk with co- and 
reinsurance partners 
is an important part of 
Admiral’s business and 
these relationships are 
underpinned by strong 
underwriting results. 
Sharing risk allows 
Admiral to only provide 
capital backing for a 
minority of its business; 
this results in a superior 
return on capital for 
Admiral shareholders 
whilst also providing 
protection for losses.
FOCUS ON 
PROFITABILITY
Admiral continues to 
focus on bottom-line 
profitability both in 
the short, medium and

Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction Ogden discount rate
Regular readers of our results will be very 
familiar with the Ogden topic and I won’t 
repeat the full detail here. A year ago we 
estimated that the change in rate which 
came into effect in March 2017 would cost 
the Group around £150 million after tax and 
reinsurance. Most of the impact has now 
been reflected in the income statement 
and we still consider the £150 million a 
valid estimate.
These accounts and our current capital 
position assume the minus 0.75% rate 
remains effective indefinitely, as we think 
that’s the prudent thing to do in the absence 
of other information. 
Sensitivities in terms of balance sheet and 
capital to different rates are set out on 
page 22.
In the 2016 Annual Report, we disclosed a 
profit number (£390 million) that the Group 
would have reported had the Ogden rate 
remained unchanged. This year’s Group 
profit of £405 million is around 4% higher 
than that ‘pre-Ogden’ number, though 2017’s 
profit is further adversely impacted by the 
Ogden change to the order of £40 million. As 
the comparatives become less helpful, we 
have not repeated the pre-Ogden number 
from 2016 in this report. 
The financial statements continue to include 
a significant and prudent margin above 
the projected ultimate claims outcomes, 
although this margin has reduced since 
the end of 2016, partly due to increased 
confidence over the impact of the change 
in Ogden rate to minus 0.75%.
“ It was pleasing to deliver a record profit with lots  
of positives from around the Group”
Results
No last minute change to the Ogden 
discount rate made for a somewhat 
smoother year-end and it was pleasing to 
deliver a record profit with lots of positives 
from around the Group. Performance of our 
various businesses is covered in detail in 
the Strategic Report and whilst it’s hard to 
choose highlights from many potentials,  
I’ll try anyway:
• A nice, continued improvement in the 
International Insurance result (£22 million 
loss in 2015, £19 million in ‘16, £14 million 
in ‘17) 
• A near break-even EU insurance result  
(plus improvements in some key metrics 
whilst growing premiums by almost a 
quarter in not exactly the easiest of 
market conditions)
• Breaking through one million customers 
outside the UK in September 2017
• Comfortably beating our targets for 
Admiral Loans in its first proper year of 
operation
• Achieving ‘marketing break-even’ in 
Compare.com ahead of target
• Very positive progress in converting our 
Gladiator van insurance broker portfolio  
to being underwritten within the Group
• And of course, a record UK Insurance  
profit of £466 million.
And for balance, a few of the less positive 
aspects: 
• Investment behind the Drivers Win 
campaign alongside new product 
development cost and a generally fierce 
market led to a fall in profits at Confused.
com (£16 million to £10 million)
• Despite continued confidence in the long-
term prospects of the business, there was 
a £25 million write down in the carrying 
value of Elephant Auto in the parent 
company balance sheet
• 2017 saw higher Group overheads and 
other items (some of which are non-
recurring) at £52.9 million v £36.8 million. 
Further detail on these latter points 
can be found on pages 30, 146  
and 31 respectively. 
Chief Financial Officer’s review
14 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report: Chief Financial Officer’s review 15 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Capital, Dividends, Internal Model 
Speaking of capital, not too much has 
changed since the end of 2016. Our 
solvency ratio remains very strong at over 
200%, though has reduced modestly since 
the end of 2016, mainly as the result of 
growth. A ratio of over 200% is still higher 
than we’d expect to report in the medium/
long-term. However (copy and paste alert), 
we continue to believe that’s the prudent 
approach as we move towards applying to 
use our own model to calculate the capital 
requirement (no change to report on the 
expected submission date which is late in 
2018). We’ll continue to provide updates as 
we make progress.
Brexit 
We have made good progress on preparing 
the Group to be able to continue trading in 
Europe should, as seems highly likely, we lose 
the ability to passport our UK regulatory 
licenses into those markets.
In terms of insurance, we have made 
applications to the regulator in Spain for 
permission to underwrite all the EU insurance 
business (Admiral Seguros, ConTe and L’olivier) 
from there and expect to have everything up 
and running in advance of any hard deadline 
that might eventually become clear.
Spain made sense for us for a number of 
reasons, not least the fact that we already 
have people and infrastructure in Madrid and 
Seville and of course an existing relationship 
with the regulator.
Things are more straightforward on the price 
comparison side where we are setting up 
new, locally regulated entities in Spain and 
France through which Rastreator and LeLynx 
will trade. Again, we expect these moves to 
be complete in good time.
The cost of the restructuring work will 
not be material to the Group and we don’t 
expect there to be material impact on the 
Group’s regulatory capital position as a result 
of the restructure.
I'm looking forward to continued growth and 
progress across the Group in 2018.

Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction Group financial review
The Group has maintained its track record of strong growth in 2017 
with turnover up 15% to £2.96 billion (2016: £2.58 billion) and net 
revenue 11% higher at £1.1 billion (2016: £1.0 billion). Customer 
numbers increased 11% to 5.73 million (2016: 5.15 million). The 
Group’s statutory profit before tax was £403.5 million (2016: £278.4 
million) whilst its share of pre-tax profit was £405.4 million (2016: 
£284.3 million). 
The Group’s 2017 results reflect higher UK Insurance profits, 
an improved Price Comparison result and a lower loss in the 
International Insurance segment, partially offset by higher other 
Group charges and business development costs. The Group’s 2016 
profit before tax was adversely impacted by the change in the UK 
discount rate (commonly referred to as the ‘Ogden’ discount rate) 
used to value personal injury claims. The distorting impact of this 
on the 2016 profit before tax means that 2016 does not provide a 
meaningful comparison for the 2017 Group and UK Insurance profit 
before tax figures (refer to page 22 for further detail on Ogden). 
During 2017, the Group’s UK Insurance business, consisting of UK 
Motor and UK Household, delivered strong growth in turnover of 14% 
to £2.35 billion (2016: £2.06 billion). Net revenue increased by 9% to 
£841.0 million (2016: £770.9 million). Customer numbers reached 4.6

16 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report: Group financial review Outside the UK, Admiral’s International Insurance businesses grew 
combined turnover by 23% to £449.8 million (2016: £365.9 million) 
whilst net revenue increased by 35% to £144.8 million (2016: £107.3 
million). Customer numbers were up 20% to 1.03 million (2016: 0.86 
million). Encouraging progress was made in combined ratio terms 
with a 4 point improvement, and in aggregate the segment recorded 
reduced losses of £14.3 million (down from £19.4 million, despite the 
impact of a significant hurricane on the US result). The Group’s Italian 
insurer ConTe recorded a profit for the fourth consecutive year.
Admiral’s Price Comparison businesses made an increased combined 
profit (excluding minority interests’ shares) of £7.1 million (2016: £2.7 
million). In the UK, the high level of competition in the price comparison 
market and investment in the new marketing campaign and product 
development by Confused.com resulted in reduced profits of £10.1 
million in 2017 (2016: £16.1 million). This lower Confused.com profit was 
offset by a significantly reduced combined loss of £3.0 million (2016: 
loss £13.4 million) from the international price comparison businesses, 
where a growing profit in the European operations of £4.1 million (2016: 
£2.8 million) was offset by a significantly smaller loss in Compare.com 
of £7.1 million (2016: loss £16.2 million).
Earnings per share
Earnings per share were 117.2 pence (2016: 78.7 pence), the near 50% 
increase being higher than the increase in pre-tax profit as a result of 
a lower effective rate of taxation in 2017.
Dividends
The Group’s dividend policy is to pay 65% of post-tax profits as a 
normal dividend and to pay a further special dividend comprising 
earnings not required to be held in the Group for solvency or buffers. 
The continued strength in the Group’s solvency ratio has allowed 
the Board to propose a final dividend of 58.0 pence per share 
(£163 million) as follows:
• 39.5 pence per share representing a normal element, based on  
the dividend policy of distributing 65% of post-tax profits; and
• A special element of 18.5 pence per share.
This final dividend reflects a 13% increase on the final 2016 dividend 
of 51.5 pence per share. The total dividend for the 2017 financial year 
is 114.0 pence per share, which is broadly in line with the 114.4 pence 
paid in 2016 and in 2015, both years including an additional return 
of surplus capital of 11.9 pence per share. Excluding this additional 
return, the total dividend for 2017 is 11% higher than 2016 and 2015.
The payment date is 1 June 2018, ex-dividend date 10 May 2018 and 
record date 11 May 2018.
Return on equity
Admiral’s capital efficient and highly profitable business model 
achieved a return on equity of 55% (2016: 37%).
A key part of Admiral’s business model is the extensive use of co- and 
reinsurance across the Group which provides both loss protection 
and capital relief and, when combined with high levels of profitability, 
leads to a superior return on equity.
As noted above, 2016’s result was materially distorted by the impact 
of the Ogden rate change.
Capital structure and financial position
The Group’s co-insurance and quota share reinsurance arrangements 
for the UK Car Insurance business are in place until at least the end of 
2019. The Group‘s net retained share of that business is 22%. Munich 
Re will underwrite 40% of the business (through co-insurance and 
quota share reinsurance arrangements) until at least the end of 2020.
Similar long-term arrangements are in place in the Group’s International 
Insurance operations and UK Household Insurance business. 
The Group continues to manage its capital to ensure that all 
entities within the Group are able to continue as going concerns 
and that regulated entities comfortably meet regulatory capital 
requirements. Surplus capital within subsidiaries is paid up to the 
Group holding company in the form of dividends. 
The Group’s regulatory capital is based on the Solvency II Standard 
Formula, with a capital add-on to reflect recognised limitations in the 
Standard Formula with respect to Admiral’s business (predominantly 
in respect of profit commission arrangements in co- and reinsurance 
agreements and risks arising from claims including Periodic Payment 
Order (PPO) claims). 
The capital add-on to the Standard Formula for 2018 is subject to 
the usual regulatory approval process. The Group plans to submit an 
application for approval to use an internal model to calculate capital 
requirements during 2018.
The majority of the Group’s capital requirement is derived from its 
European insurance operations, Admiral Insurance (Gibraltar) Limited 
(AIGL) and Admiral Insurance Company Limited (AICL). The estimated 
(and unaudited) Solvency II position for the Group at the date of this 
report was as follows:
Group capital position
Group solvency ratio (unaudited) £bn

The Group’s capital includes £200 million ten year dated subordinated 
bonds. The rate of interest is fixed at 5.5% and the bonds mature in 
July 2024. The bonds qualify as tier two capital under the Solvency II 
regulatory regime.

Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction Estimated sensitivities to the current Group solvency ratio are 
presented in the table below. These sensitivities cover the two most 
material risk types, insurance risk and market risk, and within these 
risks cover the most significant elements of the risk profile. Aside 
from the catastrophe events, estimated sensitivities have not been 
calibrated to individual return periods. 
Solvency ratio sensitivities (unaudited)

Currency – 25% movement in euro and US dollar -3%
ASHE – long term inflation assumption up 0.5% -4%
Taxation
The tax charge reported in the Consolidated income statement is 
£71.9 million (2016: £64.3 million), which equates to 17.8% (2016: 
23.1%) of profit before tax. The lower effective rate of taxation 
compared to 2016 results from lower losses in the Group’s US 
businesses leading to a lower level of unrecognised deferred tax 
asset and the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 19.0%  
(from 20.0% from 1 April 2017).
Investments and cash
Investment strategy
Admiral’s investment strategy was unchanged in 2017 and the Group 
continued to invest in the same asset classes as previous years.
The main focus of the Group’s strategy is preservation of amounts 
invested, with additional priorities including low volatility of returns and 
high levels of liquidity. The Group’s Investment Committee performs 
regular reviews of the strategy to ensure it remains appropriate.

Investment and interest income in 2017 was £41.7 million, a reduction 
of £11.4 million on 2016 (£53.1 million). There are a number of partially 
offsetting variances: 2016 benefitted from £9.2 million of income 
relating to the release of an accrual relating to quota share reinsurance 
arrangements, which wasn’t repeated in 2017. In addition, there is a 
negative variance of £8.8 million relating to unrealised gains and losses 
on forward exchange contracts, offset by a one-off gain in 2017 relating 
to the realised gains on sale of government gilt assets of £5.4 million. 
The underlying rate of return for the year (excluding accruals related 
to reinsurance contract funds withheld) on the Group’s cash and 
investments was 1.3% (2016: 1.4%).
The Group continues to generate significant amounts of cash and 
its capital-efficient business model enables the distribution of the 
majority of post-tax profits as dividends.

Strategic Report: UK Insurance review UK Insurance review
The last twelve months has been a year of big 
birthdays and a couple of births for Admiral’s 
UK Insurance segment. It’s now 25 years 
since we sold our first car insurance policy  
(2 January 1993), and 5 years since we sold 
our first household policy (18 December 
2012). Over that time, our customer focused 
approach and strategy of providing excellent 
service at an affordable price has attracted 
more than 4.5 million customers. I’m very 
excited that we’ve launched another two 
insurance businesses during 2017, with 
Admiral Van launching in May and Admiral 
Travel in late November. We hope that by 
expanding our offering we can provide a 
fuller product set to satisfy our existing 
customers, as well as attracting new 
customers to the Admiral brand.
I opened last year’s review with a brief 
reference to the Ogden discount rate, which 
had changed a few days before we announced 
our 2016 results. Whilst it’s not quite such 
a hot topic this time around, it seems like a 
fairly logical place to start this time around 
too, as it has continued to influence the UK 
Car Insurance business throughout the year.
One of the cornerstones of Admiral’s success 
is of course our strong underwriting record, 
which has enabled us to consistently grow 
profits over the last 25 years. To protect that 
underwriting result in a time of significant 
uncertainty, we put up prices considerably 
at the start of the year, which impacted our 
volumes in the first couple of months of 
2017 (having grown by more than 10% over 
the course of 2016). Our competitiveness 
gradually improved over the first half 
(despite significant further rate increases) as 
other insurers gradually adjusted their prices 
after the new Ogden rate was announced.
Confidence then returned to the market 
in the second half of the year and we and 
many others started to reduce prices, partly 
following the announcement that the Ogden 
rate would be reviewed (which may lead to a 
partial reversal of the rate increases required 
following the February announcement), 
but significantly also due to the market-
wide favourable experience on bodily injury 
(BI) frequency. The frequency of BI claims 
registered on the MOJ portal is 12.5% lower 
than in 2016, which is consistent with 
Admiral’s experience. 
Whilst some of that benefit has been offset 
by continued inflation on accidental damage 
claims, due to the increasing sophistication 
of cars and movements in exchange rates, 
the net impact of the price rises and claims 
frequency reduction means that 2017’s 
underwriting year looks like Admiral’s best 
year for a number of years, encouragingly 
achieved against a backdrop of a 5% growth 
in the customer base despite the slow start 
to the year. There’s also scope for further 
improvement should the Government’s 
review of the discount rate result in lower 
settlements than those currently reserved 
on large BI claims.
Whilst we are proud of our track record of 
pricing and claims handling, what actually 
allows us to grow and generate profits each 
year is that our customers trust us to not 
only offer competitive prices, but also to 
provide excellent service. That is regularly 
supported by a number of customer KPIs we 
track continuously, whether in the form of 
direct feedback, retention rates or complaint 
figures. As a result it was disappointing that 
we made an error in the way we disclosed 
prior year premiums on some customer 
notices during the second quarter of the 
year. However, having recognised the error, 
I was very encouraged with the dedication 
of our people, from a number of different 
departments, to pull together and correct 
the issue, and to quickly provide remediation 
to our affected customers. Whilst not in the 
ideal circumstances, it was another example 
of the great team spirit and culture that still 
exists 25 years on from our launch.
Aside from Car Insurance, our Household 
business performed very well once again, 
and continues to show significant promise. 
We benefitted from another benign year

in terms of weather to deliver a strong 
underwriting result, whilst at the same 
time growing the book by more than 40% 
to insure more than 650,000 homes by the 
end of the year. That was achieved through 
a combination of strong retention, which 
is delivering a growing renewal book, and 
also very strong new business performance 
both through the growing price comparison 
channel and, very pleasingly, through the 
direct channel which further confirms the 
strength of the Admiral brand. Cumulative 
profits of £7.8 million after only 5 years 
without the benefit of a large renewal book 
is a very good sign for the future.
Whilst the van and travel markets are 
considerably smaller than car and home, 
we’re confident that they will follow in  
their footsteps and expand Admiral’s 
footprint, customer base and profits in  
the coming years.

The key highlights for the UK Insurance 
business in 2017 were: 
• Generally favourable conditions in 
motor and household markets with 
motor rates increasing sharply in Q2, 
impacted by the change in Ogden, 
followed by some price reductions 
later in the year
• Improved competitiveness at new 
business following the market 
response to Ogden and generally 
positive customer retention
• Notable reductions in bodily injury 
claims frequency
• Significant releases from booked 
motor insurance reserves
• Another profitable year for UK 
Household Insurance, though the 
total remains small in the context of 
the overall result. 
UK Insurance review continued
20 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report: UK Insurance review UK Motor Insurance includes UK Car and 
UK van results. During May 2017, the 
Group ceased operating its commercial 
vehicle insurance broker and started 
underwriting van insurance directly through 
two brands, Gladiator and Admiral Van. 
Admiral offers van insurance and associated 
products, typically to small businesses, via 
telephone and the internet, including price 
comparison websites.
The UK Motor Insurance business continued 
to attract and retain customers in the 
competitive UK market and this, together 
with higher average premiums, contributed to 
an increase in turnover of 13% to £2.25 billion 
(2016: £1.99 billion) and vehicles insured 
increased by 8% to 3.96 million from 3.65 
million. Group’s share of UK Motor Insurance 
profit before tax was £461.4 million (2016: 
£335.1 million).
The strong performance of UK motor in  
2017 reflects: 
• Higher premium revenue and a lower 
current year loss ratio and therefore 
reduced net claims costs
• Higher reserve releases on Admiral’s 
original net share (approximately £34 
million positive impact) reflecting 
improvement in prior year claims reserves
• Higher reserve releases on the portion 
of reserves originally reinsured but since 
commuted (approximately £57 million 
positive impact), leading to higher 
aggregate net reserve releases across 
original net and commuted shares
• Higher profit commission income (£12 
million positive impact) resulting from 
higher reserve releases
• Lower investment return (£7 million 
adverse impact) mainly related to non-
recurring items in 2016 as explained in the 
Investments and cash section above
• Higher ancillary income (£16 million 
positive impact) mainly as a result of 
higher instalment income (impact £22 
million) as a result of a change in the co-
insurance arrangements with Munich Re.
The UK market saw rate increases during 2017, particularly from Q2 in response to the change 
in Ogden discount rate (below), before the market-wide favourable experience on bodily 
injury frequency led to price decreases. Admiral increased its rates in December 2016 in 
advance of the Ogden change and this impacted competitiveness in the first few months of 
2017. This improved in Q2 as the market increased prices in response to the Ogden change and 
Admiral continued to increase prices during the first six months of 2017 before responding to 
market conditions and reducing prices in the latter part of the year. 
Underwriting result and profit commission
The UK Car Insurance combined ratio is shown below:
UK Car Insurance combined ratio 2017 2016 2015 
Loss ratio excluding reserve releases from original  
net share and commuted reinsurance 85.3% 87.7% 87.7%

*1
80.0% 90.8% 81.0%
*1  Ratios calculated on original net share use the proportion of the portfolio that Admiral wrote on a net basis at the start 
of the underwriting year in question.
The reported UK Motor combined ratio decreased to 80.0% from 90.8% (both figures exclude 
the impact of reserve releases from commuted reinsurance contracts). The main reason for 
the decrease is a significantly higher reserve release in the current period, which is mainly a 
result of the impact on the 2016 figures of the change in the Ogden rate.
During 2017, projected ultimate claims costs on the most recent accident years have 
continued to develop positively. The projected ultimate loss ratios are based on the new 
Ogden discount rate of minus 0.75% and are cautiously calculated for the most recent 
accident years but which, nevertheless, have shown improvements in development. The 
projections assume no improvement or further deterioration in discount rate that might 
result from the ongoing consultation. 
Note 5d to the financial statements analyses reserve releases in the period.
The decrease in the current period loss ratio (85.3% v 87.7%) reflects sustained price 
increases more than offsetting general claims inflation. Claims trends include favourable 
small bodily injury frequency being only partially offset by higher accidental damage costs,  
as the costs of replacing vehicle parts continues to increase.
The projected ultimate Car Insurance loss ratio for Admiral for the 2017 accident year is  
76%, which is significantly lower than the projection of the 2016 year at the same point in 
its development (which was 82%). This reflects the impact of the pricing increases and 
reduced claims inflation highlighted above.
The reported Car expense ratio decreased to 16.2% from 17.5% mainly reflecting the 
change in net retained share in the current year. The written basis expense ratio also 
improved to 15.8% from 16.5% for similar reasons.

Change in UK discount rate (‘Ogden’) 
On 27 February 2017, the UK Government announced the outcome of the review of the discount 
rate (referred to as the Ogden discount rate) used for calculating the value of lump sum 
personal injury compensation. The new rate is minus 0.75% and applies to all unsettled and new 
claims from 20 March 2017. 
The estimated cost to Admiral, net of tax and reinsurance, of the change is approximately £150 
million. Most of the impact has now been reflected in the income statements of 2016 and 2017.
As noted above, the UK Motor Insurance actuarial best estimates reflect the new rate of 
minus 0.75%. Although its relative size has reduced since the end of 2016, the financial 
statements continue to include a significant and prudent margin above the projected 
ultimate claims outcomes.
The Government’s review of the discount rate and the process by which the rate is set continue 
and the Group looks forward to reviewing its conclusions when they are reported.
Ogden discount rate sensitivities
The table below shows the sensitivity of profit before tax and solvency ratio to the Ogden 
discount rate assumption. The profit impacts presented are the total impact of the change 
on the Group’s pre-tax profit on an ultimate basis. It should be noted that not all of the impact 
would be recognised immediately.

*1  The impacts on profit before tax are stated net of co-insurance and reinsurance and include the impact on net insurance 
claims along with the associated profit commission movements that result from the change in the Ogden rate.
UK Car Insurance – co-insurance and reinsurance 
Admiral makes significant use of proportional risk sharing agreements, where insurers outside 
the Group underwrite a majority of the risk generated, either through co-insurance or quota 
share reinsurance contracts. These arrangements include profit commission terms (see 
below) which allow Admiral to retain a significant portion of the profit generated.
The Munich Re Group will underwrite 40% of the UK Motor business until at least 2020. 30% of 
this total is on a co-insurance basis, with the remaining 10% under a quota share reinsurance 
agreement from 2017 onwards.
The Group also has other quota share reinsurance arrangements confirmed to the end of 2019 
covering 38% of the business written. The Group reduced its net underwriting share from 
25% previously to 22% with effect from 2017.
The nature of the co-insurance proportion underwritten by Munich Re (via Great Lakes) is 
such that 30% of all motor premium and claims for the 2017 year accrue directly to Great 
Lakes and are not reflected in the Group’s financial statements. Similarly, Great Lakes 
reimburses the Group for its proportional share of expenses incurred in acquiring and 
administering this business.
The quota share reinsurance arrangements result in all motor premiums and claims that are 
ceded to reinsurers being included in the Group’s financial statements, but these figures are 
adjusted to exclude the reinsurer share, resulting in a net result for the Group. 
The Group also purchases excess of loss 
reinsurance to provide protection against 
large claims and reviews this cover annually. 
For 2017 the Group increased its excess of loss 
cover as a result of the anticipated change 
in the Ogden discount rate and the potential 
impact on large claims. For 2018, the Group 
has reduced this level of cover to be back in 
line with more recent levels.
Profit commission
Admiral is potentially able to earn material 
amounts of profit commission revenue from 
co- and reinsurance partners, depending on 
the profitability of the insurance business 
underwritten by the partner. Revenue is 
recognised in the income statement in line 
with the booked loss ratios on Admiral’s 
retained underwriting.
In 2017 Admiral recognised UK Car Insurance 
profit commission revenue of £64.7 
million up from £52.7 million in 2016. The 
increase from 2016 arose mainly due to the 
improvements in the booked loss ratios on 
prior years, although both 2017 and 2016 
profit commission was impacted by the 
change in Ogden (as above).
Note 5c to the financial statements  
analyses profit commission income by 
underwriting year.
Commutations of quota share 
reinsurance
Admiral tends to commute its UK Car 
Insurance quota share reinsurance 
contracts for an underwriting year 24 
months from inception, assuming there is 
sufficient confidence in the profitability 
of the business covered by the reinsurance 
contract.
After the commutation is executed, 
movements in booked loss ratios result in 
reserve releases (or strengthening if the 
booked loss ratio were to increase) rather 
than reduced or increased reinsurance claims 
recoveries or profit commission.
22 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report: UK Insurance review In 2017 Admiral recognised reserve releases from commuted reinsurance contracts of 
£73.8 million (2016: £17.1 million). The increase from 2016 arose mainly due to the 
improvements in the booked loss ratios on prior years, although the comparative figure  
was adversely affected by the impact (£31 million) of the 2014 underwriting year 
commutation which was completed in 2016. 
During 2017, a number of reinsurance contracts relating to the 2015 underwriting year  
were commuted. At 31 December 2017, reinsurance contracts remain in place for the  
2015, 2016 and 2017 years.

Admiral generates other revenue from a portfolio of insurance products that complement  
the core car insurance product, and also fees generated over the life of the policy. 
Net other revenue has increased by 8% mainly due to the increase in instalment income 
which represents amounts charged to customers paying for cover in instalments. During 
2017 Admiral earned £55.5 million from instalment income, up 66% on the prior year (2016: 
£33.5 million). The main reason for this increase is a change to the co-insurance arrangements 
resulting in all instalment income from 2017 underwriting year onwards being retained  
by Admiral. Other factors affecting the increase are increases in average premium and 
customer numbers. 
Other revenue was equivalent to £64 per vehicle (gross of costs; 2016: £62). The majority of 
the increase reflects increases in instalment income (above) and optional legal cover.

UK Household Insurance was launched in December 2012 under the Admiral brand. 
The UK Household Insurance business continued to grow strongly and increased the number 
of properties insured by 41% to 659,800 (2016: 468,700). Turnover increased by 41% to £107.1 
million (2016: £76.1 million) and profit increased to £4.1 million (2016: £2.7 million). This 
reflects the continued substantial growth of the business and also a cautious approach to 
setting and releasing claims reserves and hence profit recognition.
The reported loss ratio improved in 2017 to 
73.5% from 76.5% due to relatively benign 
weather and strong underwriting. During 
2017 the business gained scale, improved 
retention and increased the proportion 
of customers buying direct, leading to 
an improving expense ratio and one that 
significantly outperforms the market.
UK Household Insurance – 
reinsurance 
The Group’s Household business is supported 
by long-term proportional reinsurance 
arrangements with Munich Re and Swiss Re 
covering 70% of the risk. In addition, the 
Group has non-proportional reinsurance to 
cover the risk of catastrophes stemming 
from weather events.
UK Insurance regulatory 
environment
The UK Insurance business operates 
predominantly under the regulation of the 
UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and 
Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA), 
and through a Gibraltar-based insurance 
company, under the Financial Services 
Commission (FSC) in that territory.
The FCA and PRA regulate the Group’s 
UK registered subsidiaries including EUI 
Limited (an insurance intermediary) and 
Admiral Insurance Company Limited (AICL; 
an insurer), whilst the FSC regulates Admiral 
Insurance (Gibraltar) Limited (AIGL; also 
an insurer).
The Group is required to maintain capital at 
a level prescribed by the lead regulator for 
Solvency II purposes, the PRA, and maintains 
a surplus above that required level at 
all times.

European insurance
US insurance
A key question for Admiral is ‘can we be a 
successful insurer outside the UK?’ My short 
answer is ‘yes’, although results and speed of 
growth vary country by country, depending on 
the maturity of the business and direct channel 
uptake in the local market.
To build a success story as a new direct insurer 
in Europe – where price comparison websites 
(PCWs) are not yet the dominant acquisition 
channel – in my opinion, you need to prove two 
essential things: first, to grow efficiently and, 
second, to have better underwriting capabilities 
than competitors.
On both these drivers, 2017 has been a truly 
great year. We continued growth, 23% in 
written premiums, while at the same time 
drastically reduced our acquisition cost per 
policy. We achieved that despite limited 
growth of PCWs and in the absence of premium 
increases in the market. This resulted in a 
decrease of four points in the expense ratio. 
In parallel, we improved our pricing, antifraud 
and underwriting skills and experienced reserve 
releases on the recent years. We are confident 
that we underwrite business with a competitive 
loss ratio in all three countries. At the same 
time, we increased our reserve buffer in France 
and Spain to mirror the same conservative 
approach already adopted in Italy and the UK.
We now have 500,000 vehicles insured in ConTe, 
which continues to report profits. L’olivier 
and Admiral Seguros are growing rapidly and 
approaching a scale that we expect will sustain 
profitability in the near future. 
All three businesses are growing, have solid 
operations and processes, recognized brands, 
experienced and talented management and a 
clearly customer-focused Admiral culture. With 
this, I’m confident we will continue to build our 
success stories in Europe and I look forward to 
another year of growth.
During 2017, Elephant Insurance made good 
progress towards becoming a growing, 
profitable, sustainable company centered 
around our customers. Our key focus was 
on attracting, servicing and retaining more 
customers with a longer policy lifetime.
Through better risk selection, higher service 
levels, and a better customer journey, Elephant 
has been able to significantly shift the mix of 
our sales distribution in favor of these higher 
retaining customers. This is an important step 
towards creating the foundation for future 
growth, as the effect of those actions will 
continue to pay off in future years. 
However, 2017 was a year with catastrophic 
losses across the US, with a number of 
hurricanes hitting the southern coasts. In 
particular, Hurricane Harvey impacted our Texas 
customers, but Elephant was able to deliver 
excellent service to our customers in need. 
While hurricane claims did impact our loss ratio, 
by approximately 5 points, Elephant was still 
able to deliver overall loss ratio improvements 
on the back of better risk selection and rate 
increases that were in line with the market.
Our customer interactions also materially 
improved throughout the year. Thanks to 
technology investments, we were able to 
deliver a more complete digital journey 
and better service levels in our claims and 
operational departments. 
New initiatives planned for 2018, revolving 
around continued improvements to  
the customer experience and product  
offering, will continue to accelerate our 
progress in attracting higher persisting  
and profitable customers.

Italy 
ConTe (Rome)
L’olivier – assurance auto had another year 
of strong growth, with a more than 40% 
increase in turnover and closing the year with 
130,000 customers. This was due to a growing 
aggregator market and some effective 
TV investments that improved our brand 
awareness. Two years ago, a new regulation 
was passed helping French customers to 
switch their motor insurance more easily. 
Though more an evolution than a revolution, 
this change is having a growing impact in 
market fluidity and L’olivier – assurance auto 
is benefiting from it.
Moderated price increases in the market were 
not strong enough to compensate for higher 
claims costs and market profitability isn’t likely 
to improve much in 2017. The market motor 
combined ratio is expected to be around 105%.
L’olivier – assurance auto managed to improve 
its technical results thanks to our unique way 
of pricing in the French market. Our pricing 
competitive advantage should become even 
more significant with a larger book of business, 
more data and more exposure.
What’s next? L’olivier needs to keep growing 
and build scale in order to provide sustainable 
profits to Admiral Group. Service quality will 
be a key lever to achieve this goal and our 
ambition is to prove to French customers that 
a direct insurer can provide service excellence. 
Our vision by 2020 is to be in the top three 
direct motor insurers in France, providing  
a high service quality and using one of the 
most sophisticated approaches to pricing  
and underwriting in the French market. 
Lots of new exciting projects are in the 
pipeline to make our vision a reality!
More growth and profit!
Despite a challenging market where the average 
premium continued to fall (around 3% year-on-
year) and price comparison growth was low, we 
have increased our customer base to 500,000 
(+20% year-on-year) and have maintained a 
strong focus on profitability, reaching a profit 
for the fourth year in a row. The main drivers of 
this are: a better customer journey sustained by 
a stronger brand; a more mature portfolio; and 
improvement in the expense ratio.
Loss ratios are developing well and show a 
consistent downtrend across 2016 and prior 
underwriting years.
The 2017 market combined ratio should be 
around 100% while for the direct part of the 
market it should already be above 100%, and as 
a consequence a timid market cycle upturn is 
now more likely than one year ago.
In this context, ConTe continues to pursue its 
‘sustainable growth’ strategy and to maintain 
a consistent level of investment in technology, 
brand and people.
In 2017 Admiral Seguros continued our path of 
sustainable growth. We increased customers by 
almost 20%, with strong technical results.
The Spanish market grew premium by about 
3%. Price competition means that insurers are 
not passing to customers the full impact of 
claims cost inflation from the new “Baremo” 
(regulating compensation for bodily injury cases).
In this highly competitive context we continued 
to grow market share due to customer journey 
improvements in the price comparison channel, 
combined with strong growth in direct-to-
site digital sales, particularly for the Qualitas 
Auto brand. Technical results developed well, 
with especially positive evolution for the 2016 
underwriting year.
In 2018 we don´t expect much change in the 
market. We will maintain focus on scaling up the 
business in a sustainable way.

Admiral operates four insurance businesses outside the UK: in Spain (Admiral Seguros), Italy 
(ConTe), the US (Elephant Auto) and France (L’olivier – assurance auto).
In 2017, Admiral's International Insurance businesses continued to grow strongly. Combined 
turnover grew by 23% to £449.8 million (2016: £365.9 million) and customer numbers also 
grew by 20% to 1.03 million (2016: 0.86 million). In aggregate the businesses reduced losses to 
£14.3 million from £19.4 million.
The key features of the International Car 
Insurance results are:
• An aggregate loss of £14.3 million  
(2016: loss of £19.4 million)
• A record profit in the Group’s Italian 
business ConTe, which also grew its 
customer base to 0.5 million customers
• A significant improvement in 
Elephant Auto’s result, despite the 
impact of Hurricane Harvey in Texas 
(approximately £2.9 million)
• An improved combined ratio of 121% 
reflecting reduced acquisition costs, 
positive back year development and 
improvements in pricing
• Continued investment in growing all  
the operations
• An increase in the claims reserves margin 
held above actuarial best estimates in 
France and Spain to mirror the same 
conservative approach already adopted  
in the UK and Italy.
The consolidated result of the European 
operations was a combined loss of £1.9 
million for the year (2016: loss £3.7 million) 
including a strong second half of the year 
which saw profits of £3.1 million. The 
combined results reflect the profit in Italy 
offset by investment in growth in Spain and 
France. The growth in Spain and France also 
impacted on the combined ratio net of other 
revenue (excluding the impact of reinsurer 
caps) which increased to 103% (2016: 101%).
Elephant’s loss for the period was £12.5 
million, down from £15.7 million in 2016. 
Elephant improved both key operating ratios 
despite the continued strong growth and 
the impact of the severe weather in Texas. 
The combined ratio net of other revenue 
improved to 119% from 130%. The impact 
of the hurricane on the 2017 result was 
approximately £2.9 million.
26 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report: International Car Insurance review  In 2017, a non-cash impairment charge of 
£25 million was recognised by the parent 
company in respect of its investment in 
Elephant Auto. This followed the regular 
review of the carrying value of subsidiary 
companies and coincided with a review of 
the long-term strategy of Elephant by its 
management team and subsequent approval 
by the Board. During 2017, additional capital 
of £16 million was provided to Elephant to 
continue to maintain a strong surplus over 
regulatory requirements. Elephant remains 
loss making at this stage in its development, 
which is in line with its long-term plan.  
Whilst the long-term plan did support the 
carrying value of the subsidiary, impairment 
was considered appropriate following the 
results of a number of stress tests applied to 
the plans.
During 2017 the management team at 
Elephant has been strengthened and 
a number of important operational 
improvements have been made. Although 
success is not certain, the Board remains 
confident in the prospects of the business 
and continues to support Elephant in the 
achievement of its goals. The impairment 
charge has no impact on the Group’s profit 
for the period or capital position. Further 
information is set out on page 146.
International Car Insurance  
co-insurance and reinsurance
In 2017 Admiral retained 35% (Italy), 
30% (France and Spain) and 33% (US) of 
the underwriting risk respectively. The 
arrangements for 2018 will remain the same.
International Car Insurance 
regulatory environment
Admiral’s European insurance operations are 
currently subject to the same regulation 
as the UK Car Insurance business, details 
of which are summarised above, but 
also comply with local requirements as 
appropriate. Further information on the 
potential impact of Brexit on the European 
insurance operations can be found on  
page 31.
The Group’s US insurer, Elephant Insurance 
Company, is regulated by the Virginia 
State Corporation Commission’s Bureau 
of Insurance. The Company is required to 
maintain capital at levels prescribed by the 
regulator and holds a surplus above these 
requirements at all times.

Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction International
France Spain
Our original market, the UK, gives us some 
guidelines for the expected development of 
PCWs around the world; first, we expect digital 
insurance comparison will grow substantially -  
it is still under-penetrated around the world; 
and second, there are a limited number of 
players that will succeed in each country.
Admiral has driven organic international 
expansion in PCW around the world: Spain 
(Rastreator.com), France (LeLynx.fr), Italy 
(Chiarreza.it), US (Compare.com), China (Duobi), 
Mexico (Rastreator.mx) and more coming. 
We believe our proven capability to organically 
set up successful PCWs for a reasonable 
investment with clean exits where needed 
(Italy and China), allows us to increase our total 
addressable market substantially and allows us 
to keep growing in the future while the UK faces 
a more competitive market.
Being based in several locations allows us to 
anticipate customer needs and to promote 
innovation. Developing our own platforms 
gives us scalability. We believe that our world 
requires some disruption to improve  
customer experience.
In all countries, brand development and 
investment is required to attract relevant 
traffic, however our core, car insurance, 
provides us sufficient margin and potential 
to create relevant brands to leverage the 
diversification.
Strategically, we hope to keep expanding and 
play relevant roles in the markets we are in. Big 
challenges and big opportunities in a business 
model with low barriers to entry but high 
barriers to lead and succeed.
Price Comparison review

Martin Coriat

Fernando Summers  
CEO, Rastreator
In 2017, the French market became more competitive for 
aggregators - strong competitors and a significant new entrant 
helped grow the market. The French economy showed signs of 
change, growth and digitalization with insurance aggregation 
seeing double digit market growth. 
As for operational results, LeLynx had a positive year in 2017, 
with both revenue and profit growing. The business has gone 
from strength to strength; the team has grown while the 
market dynamics have become more complex although more 
promising. During 2017 we also made operational changes that 
will support future growth. Finally, LeLynx ranked 11th in the 
Great Place to Work in France in its first year of participation!
Our 2018 priorities remain similar to 2017: focus on operational 
execution, build our brand equity to grow the market and 
expand our product range to make the most of media 
investment and brand equity.
2017 has been a year of challenge and growth for Rastreator. 
A major challenge was to improve price accuracy and 
conversion in our core business while maintaining growth in 
all business lines. And we can proudly say we have achieved 
both. Conversion is at its historical maximum while we keep 
on improving revenues, sales and profit. Challenges remain: 
improving customer experience, maximising profitability 
and growing revenue for other business lines.
Focus areas for 2018 are to consolidate our core business, 
as we develop our data strategy, and launch our car 
buying/selling vertical and mortgage brokerage model. 
We will do this by improving customer experience in our 
existing verticals.
I am proud of our Rastreator team; strong and committed in 
our ambition and attitude.

Strategic Report: Price Comparison review  US
UK
In 2017, Confused.com celebrated 15 years of 
establishing insurance comparison in the UK, 
creating a growing and profitable industry and 
most importantly, saving millions of customers 
time and money. Much has changed since we 
attracted our first customer back in 2002 and 
as the Group’s most mature price comparison 
business we have a lot to be proud of.
The UK price comparison market is developed 
and extremely competitive, with over 70% 
of car insurance new business originating 
from price comparison. The competitive 
environment shows no signs of diminishing as 
the top four price comparison websites spent in 
excess of £110 million on TV advertising alone, 
and we have seen increased acquisition costs 
across most of our media channels. 
2017 has continued to be a period of change 
and investment, as we focus on differentiating 
the Confused.com brand by establishing our 
Drivers Win campaign and further developing 
significant projects including our car finance 
product and car buying/selling. We believe 
these innovative products will reinforce our 
position as the go-to place for all things driver 
related. This investment in our strategy has, 
however, impacted our 2017 results, reducing 
profit to £10.1 million from £16.1 million. 
2017 has seen Confused.com focus its attention 
on what it does best: saving drivers money 
throughout their journey from buying, insuring, 
running and selling their vehicle. Looking to 
2018, we aim to turn that driving frown upside 
down by building on this strategy.
2017 was a year of challenges for US auto 
insurance. Frequency continued to be 
problematic with the blame laid at the feet of 
miles driven and distracted driving and a series 
of hurricanes added to the complications for 
the industry. Insurers looked to raise prices - 
and they did - differing amounts at different 
times in different markets. Our marketing 
followed the opportunities, going into and  
out of states and specific markets, but all the 
while growing.
Compare.com had the wonderful combination 
of increasing volumes while at record low 
acquisition costs in 2017. This allowed us to 
achieve marketing break-even early in the year 
and continue it for the rest of 2017. We added 
a variety of key carriers including nationally 
recognized Travelers and Allstate’s Encompass 
brand. Equally important, our existing panel 
members expanded through state additions, 
risk spectrum expansions, and the addition  
of the homeowners product in nearly half  
our states. 
All of the above allowed us to continue our 
national TV advertising campaign as well as 
expand digital marketing into 2/3rd of the 
states. While the competitive landscape 
remains largely unchanged, we are encouraged 
to see our pseudo-competitors raising money 
and getting new leadership. We remain in 
a mode of trying to grow comparison as a 
category in the US before we have to directly 
compete with other comparison sites. 
2017 delivered a much smaller-than-planned 
loss but, unlike 2016, it was done with overall 
volumes near planned levels. This is key as we 
remain ever aware that we are an important 
part of Admiral’s future and hope to be a 
meaningful contributor in the years to come. 
The key is to nudge the US comparison market 
ever so slightly out of its nascent state allowing 
the market size to make the reward great  
for Admiral.
2018 looks to be an exciting year for Compare.
com. We remain confident, but always 
cautiously optimistic, about our opportunity  
for success.

Admiral operates four price comparison 
businesses; in the UK (Confused.com), in 
Spain (Rastreator), France (LeLynx) and the 
US (Compare.com). Admiral Group owns 75% 
of Rastreator and 71% of Compare.com.
Admiral’s Price Comparison businesses have 
grown combined revenue by 11% to £143.6 
million (2016: £129.2 million) and made a 
combined profit (excluding minority interests’ 
shares) of £7.1 million (2016: £2.7 million).
The key features of the Price Comparison 
results are:
• A significantly reduced loss of £7.1 million 
(2016: £16.4 million) at Compare.com in 
the US (Admiral Group share). Statutory 
loss before tax decreased to £10.0 million 
from £22.8 million. The results reflect the 
continued focus on efficient marketing 
which delivered growing sales volumes
• Confused.com in the UK continued to 
invest in its new focus on motor-related 
products and services, with increased 
marketing costs leading to a reduced 
profit of £10.1 million (2016: £16.1 million)
• The European price comparison businesses 
reported a record profit of £4.1 million 
(2016: £2.7 million) reflecting ongoing, 
strong performance from Rastreator 
which continues to build on its multi-
product strategy and an improved result 
from LeLynx.
Confused.com turnover increased 
marginally to £87.1 million (2016: £85.7 
million). The high level of competition in 
the price comparison market and pursuit of 
the new strategy of Drivers Win, required 
a significant level of investment and 
contributed to significantly lower profits 
during 2017. 
The combined revenue from the European 
operations increased by 23% to £44.4 million 
(2016: £36.2 million), reflecting continued 
growth in traffic and quotes provided to 
customers and improved conversion rates. 
Both Rastreator and LeLynx continue to 
enjoy strong brand recognition in their 
respective markets. 
In the US, Compare.com exceeded its target 
of ‘marketing break-even’ (revenue minus 
marketing expenses) in selected states by 
achieving the goal nationally, and for the 
year as a whole. The business delivered 
substantial improvements in its main key 
performance indicators, including reduced 
cost per quote and sale metrics while at the 
same time growing quote and sales volumes. 
Compare.com’s plans for 2018 and beyond 
include continuing to scale marketing 
activity while further enhancing conversion 
and improving the panel of insurers and 
customer journey. The Group anticipates 
that the Group’s share of Compare.com’s 
losses for 2018 will be in the range of  
$5–$15 million.
Preminen, the Group’s price comparison 
venture with Mapfre, continues to explore 
price comparison in new markets overseas 
and has recently launched a price comparison 
operation in Mexico.

30 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report: Price Comparison review  The UK commercial vehicle result relates 
to the Gladiator broking business which is 
migrating its portfolio to being underwritten 
within the UK Insurance business of the 
Group. Future results from the business are 
expected to be insignificant. 
During the first half of 2017, the Group 
successfully rolled out the first release of 
its new technology platform for UK personal 
loans. The business currently distributes 
unsecured personal loans and car finance 
through the price comparison channel and 
also direct to consumers via the Admiral 
website. The Group expects the business to 
make small losses in its early phase mostly 
as a result of high fixed costs relative to the 
current scale of the business.
Other interest and investment income of 
£8.4 million (2016: £13.4 million) includes 
£5.4 million (2016: £Nil) of realised gains 
on investments held by the Group parent 
company and unrealised losses of £2.3 
million (2016: £6.5 million unrealised gains) 
in respect of forward foreign exchange 
contracts.
Share scheme charges relate to the Group’s 
two employee share schemes (refer to note 
8 to the financial statements). The increase 
in the charge is due to an increase in the 
number of awards reflecting the increasing 
Group headcount. The Group does not 
anticipate further significant increases in the 
volume of awards.
Business development costs include costs 
associated with potential new ventures, 
including the launch of Admiral Travel 
insurance and investment in Preminen 
Ventures, including the launch of a price 
comparison operation in Mexico. Other 
central overheads of £6.2 million are 
£2.1 million higher than 2016 (£4.1 million),  
as a result of a number of non-recurring 
costs relating to ongoing Group projects.
Finance charges of £11.4 million (2016: 
£11.4 million) mainly represent interest 
on the £200 million subordinated notes 
issued in July 2014 (refer to note 6 to the 
financial statements).
UK Exit from the European Union 
(‘Brexit’)
Although uncertainty remains as to the 
outcome of the Brexit negotiations between 
the UK and the EU, the Group has adopted a 
prudent approach that will ensure it is well 
prepared in the event of a ‘hard’ Brexit which 
includes being ready to deal with the likely 
loss of passporting rights from the UK and 
Gibraltar into the EU. 
Applications for new licenses for insurance 
and intermediary companies have been made 
to the Spanish regulator, with approvals 
expected in 2018. 
Separately, two new locally licensed 
intermediaries will be established through 
which Rastreator and LeLynx will trade in 
Spain and France. 
Brexit continues to bring risks to the Group, 
which include:
• The potential for market volatility, 
particularly in interest and exchange rates 
• The potential for the uncertainty or the 
emerging terms of exit to trigger or 
exacerbate less favourable economic 
conditions in the UK and other countries in 
which Admiral operates (though it is worth 
noting that car insurance has tended to be 
resilient to economic downturns) 
• Potential changes to the rules relating to 
the free movement of people between the 
UK and the remaining EU member states. 
At present, the Group does not foresee 
a material adverse impact on day to day 
operations (including customers or staff), 
nor does it expect the costs associated with 
any Group restructure to be material in the 
context of the Group.

32 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report: 25 years investing in our future Principal risks and uncertainties
The Board, with support from the Group Risk Committee and the Group 
Risk Department, undertakes a regular and robust assessment of the 
principal risks. These risks have been summarised as those which would 
threaten its business model, future performance, liquidity and solvency.
The table below sets out the principal risks which Admiral has identified through its Enterprise Risk Management 
Framework (‘ERMF’). The impact of those risks and actions taken to mitigate them are explained below. 
Insurance Risk
Reserving risk in the UK and International Insurance
Admiral is exposed to reserving risk through its underwriting of motor and household insurance policies. Claims reserves in the financial 
statements may prove inadequate to cover the ultimate cost of claims which are by nature uncertain.
This is a particular risk for motor insurance liabilities, where the amount payable for bodily injury claims (particularly large claims) can change 
significantly during the lifetime of the claim as a result of external risks such as changes in Ogden rates and impacts of increased levels of 
Periodic Payment Orders (PPO).
Impact 
Adverse run-off leading to 
higher claims costs in the 
financial statements. 
PPO claims are capital 
intensive owing to increased 
uncertainty of the cost of 
significant claims over a 
longer term.
Mitigating Factors
Admiral has a conservative reserving policy and continues to hold a material margin  
in its financial statement claims reserves above actuarially determined best estimates  
to cover adverse developments.
Best estimate reserves are estimated both internally and externally by independent actuaries. 
For very large claims Admiral purchases excess of loss reinsurance, which mitigates a portion of the loss.
Regular reviews of both settled and potential PPO cases are undertaken by the claims  
and actuarial teams, with independent actuarial opinions provided as part of the  
external reserving analysis.
Admiral’s investment portfolio is the result of a structured, disciplined and transparent investment 
process which considers settled and potential future PPOs.
Premium risk & Catastrophe risk
The Group is exposed to the risk that claims cost on future business is higher than allowed for in the premiums charged to customers. 
The Group is exposed to the risk of increased claims and reduced business volumes following both a UK and European recession.
Admiral is exposed to the risk of high losses due to the occurrence of man-made catastrophes or natural weather events.
Impact 
Higher claims costs and loss 
ratios, resulting in reduced 
profits or underwriting losses. 
A large flood or windstorm 
could cause extensive 
property damage (both motor 
and household) to a significant 
proportion of the portfolio, 
leading to a large total claims 
cost in relation to the event.
Mitigating Factors
There are a number of aspects which contribute to Admiral’s strong UK underwriting results, including:
• Experienced and focused senior management and teams in key business areas including pricing and 
claims management
• Highly data-driven and analytical approach to regular monitoring of claims and underwriting 
performance
• Capability to identify and resolve underperformance promptly through changes to key performance 
drivers, particularly pricing
• Continuous appraisal of and investment in staff, systems and processes.
Admiral purchases excess of loss reinsurance, designed to mitigate the impact of very large individual or 
catastrophe event claims.

Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction Group Risk
Insurance Risk continued
Erosion of competitive advantage in UK Car Insurance
Admiral typically maintains a significant combined ratio advantage over the UK market. This advantage and/or the level of underwriting  
profit (and associated profit commission) could be eroded. 
This risk could be exacerbated by irrational competitor pricing and/or new technologies used within the insurance market. It may arise  
from new or existing competitors.
Impact 
A worse UK Car Insurance result 
and lower return on capital 
employed.
A sustained and uncorrected 
erosion of competitive 
advantage could affect the 
ability of Admiral to extend 
its reinsurance arrangements, 
which might in turn require 
Admiral to hold more capital.
Mitigating Factors
Admiral’s focus remains on the wide range of factors that contribute to Admiral’s combined ratio 
outperformance of the UK market. Some are set out earlier in the Strategic Report, but in addition:
• Track record of innovation and ability to react quickly to market conditions and developments 
• Keen focus on maintaining a low-cost infrastructure and efficient acquisition costs.
Reduced availability of co-insurance and reinsurance arrangements
Admiral uses proportional co-insurance and reinsurance across its insurance businesses to reduce its own capital needs (and increase  
return on the capital it does hold) and to mitigate the cost and risk of establishing new operations.
There is a risk that support will not be available in the future if the results and/or future prospects of either the UK business or  
(more realistically) one or more of the newer operations are not satisfactory to the co- and/or reinsurers.
Impact 
A potential need to raise 
additional capital or reduce 
dividends to support an 
increased underwriting share. 
This could be in the form of 
equity or debt. 
Return on capital might reduce 
compared to current levels.
Mitigating Factors
Admiral mitigates the risk to its reinsurance arrangements by ensuring that it has a diverse range  
of financially secure partners. 
Admiral continues to enjoy a long-term relationship with some of the world’s largest reinsurers.
Admiral also has relationships with a number of other reinsurers. 
As well as UK Motor, long-term arrangements are also in place for UK Household and International 
businesses.
Potential diminution of other revenue
Admiral earns other revenue from a portfolio of products and other sources. 
The level of this revenue could diminish due to regulatory or legal changes, customer behaviour or market forces.
Impact 
Lower profits from insurance 
operations and lower return 
on capital.
Mitigating Factors
Admiral continuously assesses the value to its customers of the products it offers, and makes 
changes to ensure the products continue to meet customer needs and offer good value. 
Admiral seeks to minimise reliance on any single source by earning revenue from a range of  
products. This would mitigate the impact of a regulatory change which might affect a particular 
product or income stream. 
Principal risks and uncertainties continued
34 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report: Principle risks and uncertainties Failure of geographic and/or product expansion
Admiral continues to develop the UK Household, non-insurance operations such as Loans and expand its overseas operations. 
One or more of the operations could fail to become a sustainable, profitable long-term business. 
Product expansion into new areas could lead to unprofitable business and increased regulatory risk. 
Growth in business plans exceeds the scale of infrastructure of the operation.
Impact 
Higher than planned losses 
(and potentially closure  
costs) and distraction of  
key management. 
A collective failure of these 
businesses would threaten 
Admiral’s objective to 
diversify its earnings by 
expanding into new markets 
and products.
Mitigating Factors
Admiral’s approach to expansion and product development remains conservative, applying the ‘test  
and learn’ philosophy that has proven successful for previous operations. International Insurance 
businesses have generally executed cautious launch strategies and are all backed by proportional 
reinsurance support which provides substantial mitigation against start-up losses in the early years.
New price comparison businesses have aligned their marketing investment with the extent of 
improvement in key performance indicators such as average cost per quote and conversion ratio. 
The Group also accepts partial disposals of equity to share start-up losses with partners.
The Directors are mindful of management stretch and regularly assess the suitability of the 
infrastructure and management structure in place for Admiral’s new UK and International operations.
Reliance on UK price comparison distribution channel
Admiral is dependent on the four main UK price comparison websites as an important source of new business and growth. 
Growth in this distribution channel could slow, cease or reverse, or Admiral could lose one or more of the websites as a source of customers.
Impact 
A potentially material 
reduction in UK Car Insurance 
new business volumes. 
However, a more competitive 
market might benefit the car 
insurance business through 
lower acquisition costs.
Mitigating Factors
Admiral’s ownership of Confused.com (one of the leading UK price comparison websites which  
operates independently of the UK Car Insurance business) helps to mitigate the risk of over-reliance 
on this distribution channel. 
Admiral also contributes materially to the revenues of other price comparison businesses and  
therefore it is not considered probable that a material source of new business would be lost.
35 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction Counterparty Risk
Admiral is primarily exposed to credit risk in the form of a) default of reinsurer; b) failure of banking or investment counterparty.
One or more counterparties suffer significant losses leading to a credit default.
Impact 
Additional capital may need to 
be raised as a result of a major 
credit event, dependent on its 
nature and severity. 
Admiral would also need to 
ensure that it continues to 
have sufficient liquid assets 
to meet its claims and other 
liabilities as they fell due.
Mitigating Factors
Admiral only conducts business with reinsurers of appropriate financial strength. In addition, most 
reinsurance contracts are operated on a funds-withheld basis, which substantially reduces credit risk, 
as Admiral holds the cash received as collateral.
Concentrations of credit risk are managed by investing in liquidity funds which invest in a wide range 
of short duration, high quality securities. Cash balances and deposits are placed only with highly rated 
credit institutions. Some long-term investments are held in Government bonds to further mitigate the 
exposure to credit risk.
Admiral considers counterparty exposure frequently and in significant detail, and has in place 
appropriate triggers and limits, to mitigate exposure to individual investment counterparties. 
Market Risk
Market risk arises as a result of fluctuations in the value of market prices of investment assets, liabilities, or the income from the Group’s  
investment portfolio.
Impact 
Market volatility (notably very significant 
reductions in risk free interest rates) can 
adversely impact the Group's solvency due to 
an increased regulatory valuation of claims 
liabilities, in particular in relation to longer 
dated potential PPO claims.
Mitigating Factors
The Group’s low appetite for market risk results in an investment strategy that focuses 
on preservation of the amount invested, low volatility of returns and strong liquidity. 
The majority of the portfolio is invested in high quality fixed income and other debt 
securities, and money market funds in order to achieve these objectives. 
The Group’s mitigation for interest rate risk resulting from long duration PPO liabilities 
includes a comprehensive level of reinsurance cover and continuing focus on strategies 
to ensure that the risks relating to both assets and liabilities are appropriately matched. 
The Group has relatively low exposure to net assets currencies other than  
pounds sterling.
Principal risks and uncertainties continued
36 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report: Principle risks and uncertainties Failure to comply with legal or regulatory requirements and/or changes. 
Unexpected regulatory changes are introduced.
Impact 
Exposure to regulatory intervention, censure 
and/or enforcement action through fines and 
other sanctions.
Mitigating Factors
Mitigated by regular review of the Group’s compliance with current and proposed 
requirements (including the General Data Protection Regulation) and interaction  
with regulators by Executive management and the Board.
There is investment in resources to prepare for a Partial Internal Model application.  
The project will have regular progress updates with the Board and Regulators.
Operational Risk
Operational risk arises within all areas of the business. The principal categories of operational risk for Admiral are: 
• People • Information security  • Outsourcing 
• Processes • Business continuity • Project risk 
• IT Systems  • Customer outcomes 
Impact 
The risk of reductions in 
earnings and/or value, through 
financial or reputational 
loss, from inadequate or 
failed internal processes 
and systems, or from people 
related or external events. 
In particular:
Potential customer detriment 
and/or potential regulatory 
censure/enforcement and/
or reputational damage as a 
result of Admiral’s action.
Risk to Admiral occurs through 
the losses that could occur if 
the internal control framework 
to manage these business 
processes fails.
Availability of systems and data
Integrity of data
Confidentiality of data 
outcomes
Mitigating Factors
We aim to attract, retain and motivate quality staff to deliver quality customer service and achieve 
business objectives.
Succession planning is based on targeted recruitment, identifying potential leaders through internal 
development, talent management and retention processes.
Internal controls are in place and monitored to mitigate the risk and the control framework is  
regularly reviewed. 
The internal audit function has an agreed cycle of testing of the adequacy and effectiveness of controls. 
Regular review of the effectiveness of the Group’s IT capability by Executive management and the Board.
Enhanced project governance and oversight of new systems implementations with external specialist 
review and assurance where required.
Admiral continues to invest in its security programme in order to mitigate information security risks
Within IT there is a major incident team which is tasked with maintaining system availability, with 
business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place.
Data is backed up to allow for its recovery in the event of corruption.
Admiral monitors its outsourced and offshore activities, through ongoing supplier relationship and 
performance management, with regular due diligence reviews.
Admiral operates the three lines of defence model for overseeing its products, processes and service. 
At each stage of the customer journey customer outcomes are monitored, managed and reported in 
order to mitigate customer detriment.
Admiral purchases a range of insurance covers to mitigate the impact of a number of operational risks.

“ We are continuously looking for 
ways to improve the impact we 
have as a business”
As we continue to grow we must ensure 
that we do our utmost to continue to be a 
responsible business. At its core insurance 
serves a real social purpose, protecting people 
from the adverse impact of potentially life 
changing events. That is why we continue 
to base our business model around building 
sustainable operations for the long-term. 
In addition to providing protection for our 
customers we also aim to contribute positively 
to the wider communities in which we operate 
and minimize our impacts on the environment. 
This year Admiral celebrates its 25th Birthday 
and we aren’t resting on our laurels, we are 
continuously looking for ways to improve the 
impact we have as a business, whether that 
is the formation of the Ministry of Giving to 
facilitate giving back to the local community, 
the employee assistance programme to 
aid our employees through difficult times 
or the Admiral Green month to encourage 
people to think more about their impact on 
the environment.
David Stevens, CBE 
 Chief Executive Officer
Our approach
We take a materiality approach to our corporate social responsibility reporting, 
where we identify the areas that have the most impact on our stakeholders.  
This allows us to report effectively on the topics that matter most.
Our business is centred on four 
significant stakeholders; our customers, 
our people, our communities, and 
our environment. It is these four 
stakeholders who drive the core  
focus of our corporate social 
responsibility strategy.
If you are interested in finding out more 
about our impact as a business then our 
Corporate Social Responsibility Report 
can be found on our website.

Strategic Report: Being a responsible business Our Customers 
"We put our customers at the 
centre of everything we do”
 
 
 
Simply put, without our customers we 
wouldn't have a business, so we put our 
customers at the centre of everything 
we do.
We are so passionate about making 
the customer experience a great 
one that Cristina Nestares, our CEO 
of UK Insurance, produces a monthly 
commentary on all things 'customer'.
This looks at fantastic customer stories, 
changes to processes that have helped 
improve the customer experience and 
includes great customer comments. 
This is shared across the whole Group  
to inspire and motivate.
During the year we have restructured 
our customer quality departments 
to form a new customer assurance 
team that delivers not only effective 
complaints handling but also includes  
a prevention team who deal with 
auditing, monitoring and training 
our customer facing staff to improve 
customer experience.
Our customers share a lot of 
personal data with us and we have a 
responsibility to keep this safe. We 
do this by training all our staff on our 
Data Handling Process and Data Policy, 
and ensure that every member of staff 
receives training on cyber security.
Our Communities 
“We also encourage our staff 
to get their hands dirty and 
help local causes”
 
We play a positive role in our communities 
through charitable giving and sponsorship 
of local community partnerships. As an 
employer, we promote payroll giving and 
provide matched funding for eligible staff 
initiatives. In 2017 Admiral Group donated 
£140,000 to local and national charities. 
Donations to good causes 
£140,000  
(2016: £110,000)
This year we have established the Admiral 
Ministry of Giving in the UK with the aim 
of complementing the way that our staff 
already give back to the community. Over 
a two year period the Ministry will give 
significant donations to a small number of 
local charities across South Wales, chosen 
by our staff, totalling £400,000. 
Our involvement in our communities 
doesn’t just consist of monetary 
donations, we also encourage our staff 
to get their hands dirty and help local 
causes. This year we saw a team from UK 
customer services helping a DIY SOS big 
build, a team from UK claims volunteering 
at an animal shelter and countless 
marathons ran.
Our Environment 
“This year we held our first 
Admiral Green Month, reaching 
out to staff to make Admiral  
a greener place to work.”
Our Environmental Policy is aligned 
with our policy of sustainable growth as 
outlined in the Group business model.
We are committed to:
• Raising and maintaining employee 
awareness of, and ensuring that 
all of our people are actively 
engaged in, activities to reduce our 
environmental impact
• Measuring and monitoring key 
aspects of our environmental 
performance and regularly reviewing 
progress to reduce the amount of 
resources consumed per employee.
This year we held our first Admiral 
Green Month. This month was all about 
reaching out to staff to make Admiral 
a greener place to work, and minimise 
the impact we have on the environment. 
Highlights of the month included a  
talk from our partners Size of Wales, 
who seek to protect the rainforest 
and 1,500 employees signing our 
environmental commitment.

" I feel like a proud father when I think about all the amazing things that our staff do for each other, 
for customers and for our local community. They are an inspiration to me and I know they inspire 
each other and people in their communities." – Ceri Assiratti, Head of People Services
Our People
Going the extra mile 
We encourage our staff to use their initiative and 
go the extra mile for the customer, below is one 
of the many notable examples from 2017:
One of our policyholders was involved in an accident 
and required an urgent settlement to allow her to 
get back and forth to chemotherapy treatment. The 
customer didn’t have a hire car ancillary, however, we 
thought outside the box and hired the customer a car 
for a week to allow her time to purchase a new car.
On the day of the claim, the customer was too ill 
to get her belongings out of the car and a family 
member was going to help her. We kept the policy 
active and didn’t instruct salvage until the car was 
emptied. This took the pressure off the customer and 
allowed her time to remove her belongings in a time 
frame that suited her.
The claim was reported to us at 10:40am and was 
settled and paid by 12:30pm – less than two hours.
Safety
We pride ourselves on the relaxed, fun 
and most importantly safe atmosphere at 
Admiral and we have a number of initiatives 
in place to ensure all our staff feel safe 
coming to work. Recently we introduced 
a Company-wide Employee Assistance 
Programme (EAP) to provide proactive 
assistance to all UK employees on a range 
of issues from eldercare to face-to-face 
counselling. In addition, we have an extensive 
whistle blowing policy to prevent fraud, 
theft or ethically questionable practices. 
This is explained fully to staff via the 
company intranet. 
Communication
Communication is at the forefront of what 
we do and we strive for open and honest 
communication at all levels of the business. 
This focus has a range of scales from annual 
Staff General Meetings where the senior 
managers address all staff to talk about the 
company’s performance and business plan, 
to friendly forums where small numbers 
of individuals from different departments 
will get together to discuss a range of 
topics. In addition there are several digital 
communications channels, ranging from a 
monthly Group-wide online chats to an 'Ask 
David' website where anyone in the company 
can submit a question for CEO David Stevens.

Strategic Report: Being a responsible business Equality
We believe that all employees have the right 
to be treated equally, with dignity, integrity 
and respect. This year we have updated 
our Equal Opportunities Policy with the 
support of The Advisory, Conciliation and 
Arbitration Service (ACAS) to create a more 
comprehensive policy based on Diversity 
and Inclusion. A new Diversity and Inclusion 
training programme was also rolled out for all 
staff to reflect this new revised policy.
People Services executives make our Equal 
Opportunities and Discrimination Policy clear 
to all members of staff during induction, 
and it is also available in our Big Book, which 
outlines company policy for all staff. 
Diversity
We are very proud of our diversity at  
Admiral and anti-discrimination is  
something we take very seriously. We  
provide a supportive working environment 
for all of our employees. All of our People 
Services executives receive training in 
diversity and equal opportunities; this 
includes our confidential advice and support 
officers. Recently we have set up a diversity 
working group who focus on promoting 
diversity across genders, ethnicities and 
disabilities. Promotions and opportunities 
are made on a merit basis and are open to 
everyone in the organisation with the right 
skills regardless of age, disability, gender, 
racial or ethnic origin, religion or beliefs or 
sexual orientation.
We fully support the aims of the Modern 
Slavery Act and seek to ensure slavery and 
human trafficking does not feature in our 
business or supply chain, more information 
about our commitment to preventing 
modern slavery can be found in our Modern 
Slavery Statement on our corporate website. 
Gender pay gap
We are confident men and women are 
paid equally for performing the same 
role, but we acknowledge that there is 
a difference in proportion of men and 
women at differing levels of the Group. We 
encourage women to advance professionally 
and offer opportunities to do this from 
funding support for training to mentorship 
programmes. We endeavour to make it easier 
for both men and women to reconcile their 
work lives with their family lives. 
Further information on our gender pay gap 
can be found in our Gender Pay Gap Report 
on our website www.admiralgroup.co.uk
Rewards
We try to inspire staff to go above and 
beyond in their everyday roles, and rewards 
and recognition are a key part of that. 
One way we recognise our employees’ 
achievements is with different prestigious 
internal awards throughout the year.  
We also encourage everyday recognition, 
through departmental schemes such as 
the hi-five scheme. Our customers share a 
lot of personal data with us and we have a 
responsibility to keep this safe. We do this 
by training all our staff on our Data Handling 
Process and Data Policy, and ensure that 
every member of staff receives training on 
cyber security.
Since 2005 employees at Admiral have been 
awarded shares in the Group’s two Share 
Plans. The first is the All Employee Approved 
Share Incentive Plan (SIP). In the SIP every 
member of staff receives the same number 
of shares regardless of seniority – the Group 
awards up to £3,600 worth of shares to each 
staff member every year. 
The second scheme that the Group runs is 
the Discretionary Free Share Scheme (DFSS). 
The DFSS was also set up in 2005 when the 
Group floated to complement the SIP and to 
enable the Board of directors to reward staff 
with further shares in the Group. 
DFSS shares are awarded to managers and 
senior roles within the UK and overseas from 
the CFO to Senior Customer Representatives 
(SCR). The amount awarded depends upon 
the employees position and also upon the 
number of shares available to the scheme.
The fun we had last year 
All teams in Admiral have regular away 
days to build team spirit and inspire and 
encourage people to enjoy coming to 
work. All departments have a budget per 
head for fun money, which can be put 
towards afternoons out. Examples of 
afternoons out taken by teams in the last 
12 months include; circus skills at NoFit 
State Circus, pizza making, completing a 
muddy assault course, duck herding and 
many more.

Governance overview
Andy Crossley joined the Board as a Non-
Executive Director and member of  
the Audit Committee in February 2018.  
Andy has broad financial services and 
insurance experience having served most 
recently on the Board of Domestic and 
General. The process of succession planning 
is ongoing as the composition and balance 
of the Board is reviewed to ensure that 
continuity is maintained, and appropriate 
skills and experience are added.
As the Board undertook an externally 
facilitated evaluation last year, the process 
of evaluating the Board’s performance 
this year consisted of each Board member 
completing a questionnaire detailing specific 
areas of focus for the Board including 
succession planning and Board composition, 
the priorities for change, the impact of 
previous evaluations, and Board expertise to 
meet future challenges. The results of the 
completed questionnaires then formed the 
basis for discussion when the results of the 
evaluation and areas for development were 
discussed and considered by the Board at 
the meeting in January 2018. A summary of 
the outcomes of the Board’s discussion and 
consideration of the results of the evaluation 
are set out in more detail at page 48 of 
this report.
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board I am pleased to 
present the Corporate Governance Report 
for the financial year ended 31 December 
2017. The focus of the Board continues to be 
on maintaining high standards of corporate 
governance which it achieves by ensuring 
the appropriateness and effectiveness 
of the Group’s management and control 
framework. This Report sets out the  
Admiral framework of governance and the 
approach the Board has taken during 2017 
to promote the standards of good corporate 
governance that are rightly expected by  
our shareholders.
We believe that having a sound corporate 
governance framework enables effective 
and efficient decision making and promotes 
the right balance of skills and experience 
to assess and manage the risks in the 
markets in which the Group operates. An 
external review of the Group’s governance 
arrangements was carried out during 
the year and the completed report was 
considered by the Board at the January 2018 
Board meeting. The recommendations, 
contained in the report, to strengthen the 
Group’s existing governance arrangements 
so they remain fit for purpose in the future 
will be an area of focus for the Board in 2018 
as new entities are established and board 
constituents change.
Changes to the composition of the Board in 
2017 have meant that succession planning 
has continued to be a key area of focus.  
I succeeded Alastair Lyons as Chairman in 
April 2017 after he retired from the Board 
at the AGM in April 2017 after serving for 16 
years. Due to a change in her executive role, 
Non-Executive Director and member of the 
Audit Committee, Penny James, also stepped 
down from the Board in September 2017. 
This Corporate Governance Report is 
structured in order to demonstrate to 
shareholders how the Board has sought 
during the year to comply with each section 
of the Code - Leadership; Effectiveness; 
Accountability; and Relations with 
Shareholders. Remuneration is dealt with 
in the separate Remuneration Report.

Leadership 
The Role of the Board
The Board is the principal decision-
making forum for the Group providing 
entrepreneurial leadership, both directly 
and through its Committees, and delegating 
authority to the Executive team. The 
Board is responsible for organising and 
directing the affairs of the Group in a 
manner that is most likely to promote its 
success for the benefit of its members 
as a whole. The Board is accountable to 
shareholders for setting and achieving 
the Group’s strategic objectives; for the 
creation and delivery of strong sustainable 
financial and operational performance; for 
ensuring that in carrying out its duties the 
Group’s legal and regulatory obligations 
are being met; and for ensuring that it 
operates within appropriately established 
risk parameters. The Group’s UK regulated 
entities are responsible to the Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential 
Regulatory Authority (PRA) for ensuring 
compliance with the Group’s UK regulatory 
obligations and that dealings with the FCA 
and PRA are handled in a constructive, co-
operative and transparent manner. Similar 
provisions apply in respect of the Group’s 
international businesses with regard to the 
relevant regulatory authorities in those 
overseas jurisdictions in which the Group  
also operates.
The Board has adopted a formal schedule 
of matters reserved for the Board’s 
consideration. This is monitored by the 
Company Secretary and reviewed by the 
Board on an annual basis. Specific matters 
reserved to the Board include the approval of:
• The Group’s long-term objectives and 
corporate strategy
• Operating and capital budgets, financial 
results, and any significant changes to 
accounting practices or policies
• The Group’s capital structure
• Results and financial reporting
• The system of internal control and risk 
management
• The Group’s overall risk appetite
• Changes to the structure, size and 
composition of the Board, including new 
appointments
• Succession plans for the Board and senior 
management
• Dividend policy and proposals for dividend 
payments
• Major acquisitions, disposals, and other 
transactions outside delegated limits 
• The annual review of its own performance 
and that of its Board Committees
• Annual review of the Group’s Board policies 
• The review of the Group’s overall corporate 
governance arrangements
Board Activity During 2017
The Board met on seven occasions in 2017 
with all these meetings being held over 
two days and one of the meetings being a 
separate strategy meeting held off-site. In 
addition to the seven scheduled meetings, 
there were five additional unscheduled 
telephone meetings that were called at 
short notice. The majority of these meetings 
were called in relation to consideration 
of the change to the Ogden discount rate 
announced in February 2017 and the impact 
this would have on the Group. 
At each scheduled meeting the Board 
receives updates from the Chief Executive 
and Chief Financial Officer as to the financial 
and operational performance of the Group 
and any specific developments in the areas 
of the business for which they are directly 
responsible and of which the Board should be 
aware. Items that are considered on an annual 
basis are included in an annual schedule of 
rolling agenda items to ensure that they are 
considered at the appropriate point in the 
financial and regulatory cycle. Meetings are 
structured so as to allow for consideration and 
debate of all matters. The Head of the Group’s 
European insurance businesses and the CEO 
of UK Motor (respectively Milena Mondini and 
Cristina Nestares) together with the Chief 
Risk Officer (James Armstrong) are invited 
to attend every Board meeting and regular 
Board dinners. This has proved an effective 
means of ensuring that senior managers 
below Board level have exposure to and gain 
experience of the operation of the Board. 
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
During the year under review and up to the date of this report, the Group complied with all the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2016 (the Code) other than the exception noted below.
• Provision C.3.1 – (regarding having at least three independent Non-Executive Directors serving on the Audit Committee) Penny  
James, who served as an independent Non-Executive member of the Audit Committee, stepped down as a Non-Executive Director on 
8 September 2017 following a change in her Executive role. From this date up to the appointment of Andy Crossley as an independent 
Non-Executive member of the Board and Audit Committee on 27 February 2018 the Audit Committee only had two independent 
Non-Executive members and did not meet the Code requirements to have at least three independent Non-Executive members. The 
Group fully complied with this requirement apart from this period from 8 September 2017 to 27 February 2018 and held three meetings 
during the period, two of which Andy Crossley attended. 
46 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate Governance: Governance Report In addition to the regular consideration of financial and operating performance and risk management and compliance, the Board received 
presentations on a variety of topics including updates from the management teams of each of the Group’s businesses and regular reviews of 
Solvency II related activities such as progress of the Internal Model Application Process (IMAP).
In addition to her visits to the Group’s UK operations, the Chairman has sought to visit each of the Group’s overseas operations this year and 
Non-Executive Directors are invited to join either her or the Chief Executive on one or more of their overseas visits each year. In addition, the 
Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman met during the year without the Executive Directors being present. Non-Executive Directors also 
attended briefing sessions in Cardiff on different aspects of the Group’s UK business. In order to increase their understanding of the depth 
and breadth of management across the Group below Board level, the Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman also attended a dinner with 
members of the Group’s senior management team without the Executive Directors being present. When management teams present to the 
Board on their operations they are invited to join the Board for dinner which gives the opportunity for informal interaction between directors 
and management. 
Meetings and Attendance
Directors are expected to attend all meetings of the Board and the Committees on which they serve and to devote sufficient time to 
the Group to perform their duties. Where Directors are unable to attend meetings they receive papers for that meeting giving them the 
opportunity to raise any issues with the Chairman in advance of the meeting. The number of scheduled Board meetings and Committee 
meetings, of which they are a member, attended by each Director during 2017 is provided in the table below.

Agendas and papers are circulated to the Board electronically in a timely and secure manner in preparation for Board and Committee 
meetings. The Board agenda is structured by the Chairman in consultation with the Company Secretary and Chief Executive. Routine Board 
papers are supplemented by information specifically requested by the directors from time to time. All Board and Committee meetings during 
the year were held in an open atmosphere conducive to robust and constructive challenge and debate. All Directors have, therefore, been able 
to bring independent judgement to bear on issues such as strategy, risk management, performance, and resources. Additional meetings are 
called when required and there is contact between meetings, where necessary, to progress the Group’s business.

The Company Secretary
All the Directors have access to the advice 
and services of the Company Secretary. He 
has responsibility for ensuring that Board 
procedures are followed and for advising the 
Board, through the Chairman, on governance 
matters. The Company Secretary provides 
updates to the Board on regulatory and 
corporate governance issues, new legislation, 
and Directors’ duties and obligations. The 
appointment and removal of the Company 
Secretary is one of the matters reserved for 
the Board.
Board effectiveness
Following the external Board evaluation  
that was carried out last year, this year 
sought to focus on the recommendations 
coming out of that evaluation together 
with a review of the Board’s effectiveness 
and particular areas of focus. The Board 
evaluation, consisted of the Chairman, 
supported by the Company Secretary, 
compiling a comprehensive questionnaire 
that was circulated by the Company 
Secretary for completion by all Directors  
and Board attendees. 
 The questionnaire considered:
• Time management of Board meetings
• Board composition and dynamics
• The effectiveness of the Board in 
considering the Group’s risk management 
framework and internal controls
• The Board’s strategic and operational 
oversight
• Succession planning including the 
oversight of the Group’s processes for 
Managing, developing and retaining talent;
• Management of group subsidiaries
• Content of discussion and focus at Board 
meetings
• Priorities for change that would improve 
Board performance.
The results of the review were discussed 
by the Board in January 2018. Overall the 
review found that the Board continued to 
work effectively and that each Director 
demonstrates full commitment to his/
her duties and contributes in an open and 
transparent way, enabling a detailed level 
of debate and discussion around material 
matters affecting the Group. The review also 
identified good awareness by the Board of 
the governance and regulatory environment 
in which the Group operates and the main 
risks impacting the Group and how they 
should be managed and mitigated. 
Following last year’s feedback, the Board 
has spent more time on considering 
succession plans and senior management 
evaluation and development. A number 
of recommendations were identified in 
the review as areas for the Board to give 
particular focus in 2018 in order to enhance 
the Board’s effectiveness. These included: 
greater understanding of the views of 
customers of today and tomorrow; major 
investors and focus on the technological 
issues facing the Group, particularly 
around cyber security; consideration of the 
composition of the Board in the context of 
there being appropriate Board experience as 
the Group looks to explore opportunities in 
other product and geographical areas; Board 
dynamics and improving the content and 
quality of information provided to the Board 
so that the Board could focus more easily on 
the key areas for discussion and decision; and 
Board oversight of company processes for 
managing, developing and retaining talent 
was highlighted as an important area that 
would need continued Board focus in the 
coming year. 
The Chief Executive, to whom he reports, 
appraises annually the performance of 
the Chief Financial Officer. The Chairman, 
taking into account the views of the other 
Directors, reviews the performance of 
the Chief Executive. The performance of 
the Chairman is reviewed by the Board 
led by the Senior Independent Director 
(“SID”). Following the latest review, the SID 
considered and discussed with the Chairman 
the comments and feedback that had been 
received from the Directors as part of the 
Chairman’s evaluation questionnaire, and 
was able to confirm that the performance 
of the Chairman is effective and that she 
demonstrates appropriate commitment to 
her role. 
The roles of the Chairman  
and Chief Executive
The Board has approved a statement 
that sets out the clear division of 
responsibilities between the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive. The Chairman is 
primarily responsible for the leadership 
and workings of the Board, setting its 
agenda, and monitoring its effectiveness. 
The Chairman is not involved in the day-to-
day management of the business. Save for 
matters reserved for decision by the Board, 
the Chief Executive, with the support of 
the other Executive Director and the senior 
executives, is responsible for proposing the 
strategy to be adopted by the Group; running 
the business in accordance with the strategy 
agreed by the Board; and implementing 
specific Board decisions relating to the 
operation of the Group. The statements 
of division of responsibilities and matters 
reserved for decision by the Board are 
reviewed annually.
Board balance and independence
In the context of recent and forthcoming 
Board changes, careful consideration 
continues to be given to the composition 
and balance of the Board. As a result the 
Group continues to monitor the need to 
refresh Board and Committee membership 
in an orderly manner so as to maintain the 
continuity of Board process and the strength 
of personal interaction which underlies the 
effectiveness of the Board as a team. As a 
result of recent appointments, the Board 
remains satisfied that it has the appropriate 
balance of skills, experience, independence 
and knowledge of the Group to enable it and 
its Committees to discharge their duties and 
responsibilities effectively, as required by 
the Code.
The Board currently comprises nine 
Directors, the Chairman (who was 
independent on appointment), two Executive 
Directors, and six independent Non-
Executive Directors. As can be seen from 
the Directors’ biographies on pages 43 to 
45, the Directors have a broad range of skills 
and experience and can bring independent 
judgement to bear on issues of strategy, 
performance, risk management, resources 
and standards of conduct which are integral 
to the success of the Group.
48 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate Governance: Governance Report Appointments to the Board are the 
responsibility of the Board as a whole, acting 
on the advice and recommendations of the 
Nomination and Governance Committee. 
The Nomination and Governance Committee 
seeks to balance the retirement and 
recruitment of Non-Executive Directors 
ahead of their replacement so as to avoid 
dislocation of Board process by losing 
experience and skills. Appointments are 
made on merit and against objective 
criteria, having due regard to the benefits 
of diversity, including gender, with a view 
to ensuring the Board has the appropriate 
mix of personality, skills, and experience. 
Following a formal, rigorous and transparent 
process led by the Nomination and 
Governance Committee, the Board was 
pleased to appoint Andy Crossley as an 
independent Non-Executive Director with 
effect from 27 February 2018. Andy will be 
subject to election by shareholders at the 
forthcoming AGM.
Manning Rountree is the Chief Executive 
Officer for White Mountains Insurance 
Group Limited (White Mountains) and acts 
as Board Observer for White Mountains on 
the Board of the Group’s US price comparison 
subsidiary, in which White Mountains has a 
minority shareholding. Given the relatively 
small size of White Mountains’ shareholding 
in an overseas Group subsidiary company, 
the Board has determined that Manning 
Rountree remains independent in character 
and judgement and that his attendance at 
Inspop USA LLC Board meetings does not 
affect his ability to present an objective, 
rigorous and constructive challenge to the 
assumptions and viewpoints presented by 
management and the Board. A process for 
managing any potential conflicts has been 
agreed by the Board such that Manning 
Rountree will recuse himself from any 
Group Board discussions where a potential 
conflict of interest with his role with White 
Mountains has been identified.
The Board, having given thorough 
consideration to the matter, considers the six 
Non-Executive Directors to be independent 
and is not aware of any relationships or 
circumstances, other than the above, which 
are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, 
the judgement of any of them. It is the view 
of the Board that the independent Non-
Executive Directors are of sufficient calibre 
and number that their views carry significant 
weight in the Board’s decision making. 
Independent Non-Executive Directors 
are currently appointed for fixed periods 
of three years, subject to election by 
shareholders. The initial three-year period 
may be extended for two further three-
year periods subject to re-election by 
shareholders. Their letters of appointment 
may be inspected at the Company’s 
registered office or can be obtained on 
request from the Company Secretary.
Colin Holmes is the Senior Independent Non-
Executive Director (SID). He has the requisite 
knowledge and experience gained through 
his Board position, his Chairmanship of the 
Audit Committee, and his appointments 
to the Boards of other companies. He 
is available to shareholders if they have 
concerns that contact through the normal 
channels of Chairman, Chief Executive, or 
Chief Financial Officer have failed to resolve 
or for which such contact is inappropriate. 
He is also responsible for leading the Board’s 
discussion on the Chairman’s performance 
and the appointment of a new Chairman, as 
and when appropriate. 
In accordance with the requirement under 
the Code for annual election of Directors, 
all Directors will be submitting themselves 
for re-election by shareholders at the 
forthcoming AGM. The Board is satisfied 
that all are properly qualified for their 
reappointment by virtue of their skills and 
experience and their contribution to the 
Board and its Committees.
The Directors are given access to 
independent professional advice at the 
Group’s expense, should they deem it 
necessary to carry out their responsibilities.
Professional development
On appointment, Directors take part in 
a comprehensive induction programme 
whereby they receive financial and 
operational information about the Group; 
details concerning their responsibilities  
and duties; as well as an introduction to  
the Group’s governance, regulatory and 
control environment.
This induction is supplemented by visits to 
the Group’s head office in Cardiff and certain 
overseas offices, and meetings with members 
of the senior management team and their 
departments. Development and training of 
Directors is an ongoing process. Throughout 
their period in office the Directors are

legal matters concerning their role and duties; 
the competitive environments in which the 
Group operates; and any other significant

of which it is a part. 
The Board receives presentations from 
senior managers within the Group on a 
regular basis and Non-Executive Directors 
are encouraged to make informal visits to 
different parts of the Group to meet with 
local management.
Engagement with shareholders
The Company attaches considerable 
importance to communications with 
shareholders and engages with them 
regularly. Open and frequent dialogue with 
investors enables them to understand 
fully the Group’s strategy, objectives and 
governance. The Investor Relations team 
has day-to-day primary responsibility 
for managing communications with 
institutional shareholders through a 
combination of briefings to analysts and 
institutional shareholders, both at the 
half-year and full-year results. A number 
of analysts and investors visited the 
Group’s Cardiff office during the year to 
meet with the Executive Directors and 
senior management in order to get a 
better understanding of how the Group 
operates and how it intends to achieve 
its strategic and operational objectives. 
Senior executives from the Group’s overseas 
businesses also visit the UK in order 
to present to, and meet with, analysts 
and investors. Site visits and individual 
discussions with the Executive Directors  
are also arranged throughout the year  
with individual shareholders. 
In addition the Chairman had individual 
meetings during the year with major 
shareholders and reported to the Board  
on issues raised with her. 
This is supplemented by feedback to the 
Board on meetings between management 
and investors. In addition, the Investor 
Relations team produces a quarterly 
Investor Relations Report that is circulated 
to the Board for their consideration. 
The Report contains an analysis of share 
price performance; a summary of analyst 
reports received during the month and 
of meetings that have been held with 
investors and analysts; together with 
details of any significant changes to the 
shareholders’ register.
The Senior Independent Director has specific 
responsibility to be available to investors 
who have any issues or concerns, and in cases 
where contact with the Chairman, Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer 
has either failed to resolve their concerns, 
or where such contact is inappropriate. No 
such concerns have been raised in the year 
under review.
All shareholders are invited to attend the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting (AGM). 
The Chairs of the Audit, Remuneration, 
Nomination and Governance and Group Risk 
Committees attend the AGM along with the 
other Directors and are available to answer 
shareholders’ questions on the activities of 
the Committees they chair. Shareholders 
are also invited to ask questions during the 
meeting and have an opportunity to meet 
with Directors after the formal business of 
the meeting has been concluded. Details of 
proxy voting by shareholders, including votes 
withheld, are made available on request 
and are placed on the Company’s website 
following the meeting.
The Group maintains a corporate website 
(www.admiralgroup.co.uk) containing a 
wide range of information of interest to 
institutional and private investors. The major 
shareholders of the Company are listed on 
page 83.
Conflicts of interest
In compliance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 regarding Directors’ 
duties in relation to conflicts of interest, 
the Group’s Articles of Association allow the 
Board to authorise potential conflicts of 
interest that may arise and to impose such 
limits as it thinks fit. The Company has put 
in place a Conflicts of Interest Policy to deal 
with conflicts of interest. These procedures 
include each Board member completing, 
annually, a conflicts of interest questionnaire 
that sets out any situation in which they, 
or their connected persons have, or could 
have, a direct or indirect interest that could 
conflict with the interests of the Company. 
Any current directorships that they, or their 
connected persons hold, any advisory roles 
or trusteeships held, together with any 
companies in which they hold more than 1% 
of the issued share capital are also disclosed. 
These procedures were reviewed by the 
Board in April 2017 and it was concluded that 
they continued to operate effectively.
Board Committees
The Board has delegated authority to a 
number of permanent Committees to 
deal with matters in accordance with 
written Terms of Reference. The principal 
Committees of the Board are: Audit, 
Remuneration, Group Risk and Nomination 
and Governance. Subject to the exceptions 
listed above, all comply fully with the 
requirements of the Code. 
All Committees are chaired by an 
independent Non-Executive Director 
except, the Nomination and Governance 
Committee which is chaired by the Chairman 
of the Board, and comprise a majority of 
independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Appointments to the Committees are made 
on the recommendation of the Nomination 
and Governance Committee and are for a 
period of up to three years, which may be 
extended for two further three year periods, 
provided the Director remains independent. 
The Committees are constituted with 
written Terms of Reference that are 
reviewed annually to ensure that they remain 
appropriate and reflect any changes in good 
practice and governance. These Terms of 
Reference are available on request from the 
Company Secretary and can also be found on 
the Company’s website: www.admiralgroup.

other independent professional advice if 
they consider it necessary. The Chairman of 
each Committee attends the Annual General 
Meeting to respond to any shareholder 
questions that might be raised on the 
Committee’s activities.

Corporate Governance: Governance Report Dear Shareholder,
During the year, the key areas of focus of the 
Committee have been to provide support 
to the Board in its oversight of financial 
reporting and the control environment 
across the Group. The setting of insurance 
claims reserves continues to be a key 
accounting judgement in the Group’s 
financial statements, and the Committee 
placed considerable focus on this subject. 
The proposal from management to enhance 
the Group’s reserving methodology was 
considered by the Committee to ensure 
that it was consistent with the Group’s 
stated reserving approach and appropriate 
in the context of the Group setting claims 
reserves at a prudent level. The analysis of 
outstanding claims by management was 
reviewed alongside that of the Group’s 
independent actuaries and external auditor. 
The impact of last year’s change in the 
Ogden discount rate continued to be tracked 
by the Committee, along with the potential 
impact of legislative changes to the way in 
which the rate is set in the future.
The Audit Committee
Statement to Shareholders from the Chairman of the Audit Committee
" I’m pleased to provide an update on the main activities  
of Admiral’s Audit Committee in 2017."
Last year was Deloitte’s first as the Group’s 
auditor and therefore the Committee 
undertook an evaluation of their 
performance. The conclusion was that 
Deloitte was working effectively as external 
auditor, although a number of actions were 
agreed to help deliver all of the potential 
benefits. The audit fee for 2017 also had 
focus from the Committee with details of 
the year-on-year increase given later in 
this report.
The Internal Audit team underwent an 
external quality assessment which resulted 
in a strong endorsement of the internal 
audit function. A number of helpful 
recommendations were made which have 
been accepted by the Head of Internal Audit. 
During the year the group published its first 
Group Solvency and Financial Condition 
Report and the Committee spent time on 
this, along with other Solvency II issues, to 
ensure robust processes and controls existed 
for its production.
In addition, the Committee continued to 
monitor the appropriateness of the Group’s 
system of risk management and internal 
control. The Committee maintained a close 
focus on the UK motor business but also 
reviewed overseas subsidiaries and the newly 
established UK loans business. 
I hope you find the above summary, and  
the more detailed report, both useful  
and informative.

Membership
Membership of the Committee at the end 
of the year was: Colin Holmes (Chair), and 
Owen Clarke. As stated earlier in this report, 
Penny James stepped down from the Board 
in 8 September 2017 following a change 
in her Executive role. For the period from 
September 2017 to 27 February 2018 the 
Committee did not have three Independent 
Non-Executive members as required under 
the Code. Andy Crossley has now joined 
the Board as a Non-Executive Director and 
member of the Audit Committee. Given 
Andy’s insurance and financial services 
experience, the Board considers that 
Committee members have a broad range 
of skills, experience and knowledge of the 
insurance sector such that they are able to 
effectively analyse, challenge and debate 
the issues that fall within the Committee’s 
remit and are satisfied that the Committee 
as a whole has competence relevant to 
the sector in which the company operates. 
The Board further considers that Colin 
Holmes (Committee Chair), as a Chartered 
Management Accountant, has appropriate 
recent and relevant financial experience 
having previously been the UK Finance 
Director for Tesco plc.
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to 
the Committee. The Committee meets at 
least four times per year and has an agenda 
linked to events in the Company’s financial 
calendar and other important issues that 
arise throughout the year which fall for 
consideration by the Committee under 
its remit.
The Committee is kept up to date with 
changes to Accounting Standards and 
relevant developments in financial reporting, 
company law, and the various regulatory 
frameworks through presentations from 
the Group’s external auditor, Chief Financial 
Officer and Company Secretary. In addition, 
members attend relevant seminars 
and conferences provided by external 
bodies. The Terms of Reference of the 
Audit Committee include all the matters 
required under the Code.

Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction
Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Other individuals such as the Chairman of 
the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief 
Financial Officer, the Chief Risk Officer, 
Heads of Compliance and Internal Audit, and 
representatives of different parts of the 
Group may be invited to attend all or part 
of any meeting as and when appropriate. 
The Chair of the Audit Committee meets 
privately with the Head of Internal Audit 
on a regular basis. The external auditor was 
invited to attend all of the Committee’s 
meetings held in 2017, excepting those 
agenda items when its own performance/
appointment was to be reviewed and 
provision of non-audit services discussed.  
In addition, a number of private meetings 
were held between members of the 
Committee and the auditor.
The Audit Committee’s primary 
responsibilities are to:
• Monitor the integrity of the Group’s 
financial statements and any formal 
announcement relating to the Group’s 
financial performance, reviewing any 
significant financial reporting judgements 
which they contain
• Keep under review the effectiveness of 
the Company’s internal financial controls, 
internal control and risk management 
systems
• Review the Group’s procedures for 
handling allegations from whistleblowers 
and for detecting fraud
• Monitor and assess the role and 
effectiveness of the Group’s Internal 
Audit functions in the context of the 
Group’s overall internal control and risk 
management systems
• Consider and make recommendations to 
the Board, to be put to shareholders for 
their approval at the AGM, in relation to 
the appointment, reappointment and 
removal of the Group’s external auditor
• Review the external auditor’s 
independence and objectivity and the 
effectiveness of the audit process
• Review the policy on the engagement of 
the external auditor to provide non-
audit services, considering the relevant 
regulatory guidance regarding the 
provision of non-audit services by the 
external auditor.
Significant Issues considered  
by the Committee
After discussion with both management 
and the external auditor, the Audit 
Committee determined that the key risks 
of misstatement of the Group’s financial 
statements related to insurance liabilities 
and profit commissions. 
These issues were discussed with 
management during the year and with the 
auditor at the time the Committee reviewed 
and agreed the auditor’s Group audit plan; 
when the auditor reviewed the interim 
financial statements in August 2017 and also 
at the conclusion of the audit of these full 
year financial statements.
Valuation of Insurance  
Claims Reserves
Given the important judgements involved 
in estimating outstanding claims the 
Committee continued to spend significant 
time reviewing and challenging the approach 
and methodology adopted by management 
in setting reserves for insurance liabilities 
in the financial statements. The Committee 
noted the proposals of management to 
continue to enhance the methodology 
applied and were supportive of these 
plans. The Committee spent time with 
management during the year to understand 
the rationale behind the enhanced 
methodology that was being proposed and 
process by which it would be reflected in 
the financial statements reserves at the full 
and half year. The Committee was satisfied 
that the methodology was consistent with 
the Group’s stated reserving approach and 
appropriate in the context of the Group 
setting claims reserves at a prudent level.
The Committee held separate meetings with 
the external actuaries at which there was 
challenge and debate on the best estimates 
developed by the external actuaries. At these 
meetings management provided further 
information on the reserving levels proposed 
and were challenged by the Committee as to 
their adequacy and level of inherent prudence. 
Given the material impact of changes to the 
Ogden rate, the Committee has continued 
to monitor developments in this area to 
ensure that it was well prepared to manage 
any impact on its reserves. The Committee 
is satisfied that in accounting for reserves 
using the current discount rate, the value 
contained in the balance sheet for future 
claims remains appropriate and prudent.
Whilst acknowledging that the setting of 
reserves to cover future claims is a complex 
and judgemental area and having had the 
opportunity at the separate meetings 
referred to above to consider and question the 
recommended best estimates, the Committee 
is satisfied that an appropriate process has 
been followed and that there has been scrutiny, 
challenge and debate to give confidence that 
the reserving levels set provide an appropriate 
margin above best estimates, though note the 
continued high level of prudence that remains 
within the reserves. 
The Committee also received an update from 
the auditor regarding the procedures they 
had used to test management’s methodology 
in setting best estimates and considered the 
auditor’s assertion that they had challenged 
the reserving approach taken by management 
and were satisfied with management’s 
assumptions and that the Group’s approach 
to setting reserves was in compliance with 
current accounting standards.
Profit commission
The Committee considered the impact on 
profit commission income of future changes 
in claims reserves as the recognition of 
this income is dependent on the loss ratio 
booked in the financial statements and 
cash receivable is dependent on actuarial 
projections of ultimate loss ratios. The 
Committee remained satisfied that profit 
commission was correctly accounted for by 
the Group and was in accordance with the 
contractual arrangements that were in place.
The Audit Committee considered the auditor’s 
overall findings on this area which indicated 
that the profit commission recognised was 
considered appropriate in the context of the 
financial statements as a whole.
Misstatements
No material unadjusted audit differences 
were reported by the external auditor. The 
Committee confirms that it is satisfied that 
the auditor has fulfilled its responsibilities 
with diligence and professional scepticism.
After reviewing the presentations and 
reports from management and consulting 
where necessary with the auditor, the 
The Audit Committee continued
54 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate Governance: The Audit Committee Committee is satisfied that the financial 
statements appropriately address the 
critical judgements and key estimates (both 
in respect to the amounts reported and the 
disclosures). The Committee is also satisfied 
that the significant assumptions used for 
determining the value of assets and liabilities 
have been appropriately scrutinised, 
challenged and are sufficiently robust. 
Non-Audit fees
The Committee reviewed and approved its 
policy on non-audit services in April 2017, 
and were satisfied that it was aligned with 
current regulatory guidance. Under the 
policy, the Group’s statutory auditor would 
only be engaged to carry out non-audit work 
in exceptional circumstances or where there 
was a regulatory or tax authority request and 
where agreed by the Committee.
Unless required by law, regulatory or tax 
authority and non-audit services will: a) be 
subject to prior approval from the Committee 
and b) in aggregate, shall not cost more than 
70% of the average statutory audit fee for 
the past three financial years. In considering 
whether to approve such non-audit services, 
the Committee shall ensure that:
• There is no direct effect, or in the view 
of an objective, reasonable and informed 
third party, would have an inconsequential 
effect, on the audit services on the Group’s 
financial statements
• The estimation of the effect on the 
financial statements is comprehensively 
documented and explained in a report to 
the Committee
• The non-audit services provided comply 
with the principle of independence
• The audit firm must not place significant 
reliance on the output of the non-audit 
services for the audit work.
The Committee will continue to monitor 
regulatory developments in this area to 
ensure that its policy on non-audit fees 
adheres to current guidance.
Effectiveness of the External 
Audit Process
The Committee undertakes an annual review 
to assess the independence and objectivity of 
the external auditor and the effectiveness of 
the audit process, taking into consideration 
relevant professional and regulatory 
requirements, the progress achieved against 
the agreed audit plan, and the competence 
with which the auditor handled the key 
accounting and audit judgments. Following 
this review the Committee concluded that the 
auditor, Deloitte LLP, remained independent 
and provided a service that was robust and fit 
for purpose. 
Audit fee
During 2017, the Committee reviewed and 
approved the audit fee proposal for the 2017 
year-end Group audit. The agreed fee for the 
audit and other assurance related services 
for 2017 is £490,000, an increase on the fee 
initially agreed for 2016 of £420,000. The 
main reasons for the increase were:
• Additional costs incurred during the 
course of the 2016 audit which are 
recurring in 2017, primarily reflecting 
areas where an increased level of 
substantive audit testing was employed 
than had been initially planned;
• An increased audit scope in areas of 
the Group outside of UK Car Insurance, 
reflecting the increased growth, 
complexity and materiality of these 
businesses to the Group as a whole; and 
• The impact of changes to the regulatory 
environment, including the introduction of 
EU rules in relation to Public Interest Entities 
and the update to Auditing Standards. 
The Committee approved the fee increase 
having provided robust challenge to 
the auditor on the elimination of first 
year transition costs and any potential 
inefficiencies within the audit process. 
Internal Audit 
The Group Head of Internal Audit attends 
all Audit Committee meetings and provides 
a range of presentations and papers to the 
Committee, through which the Committee 
monitors the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal controls. The Committee reviewed 
and approved the Group Internal Audit 
Terms of Reference which set out the 
role; objectives; reporting lines and 
accountability; authority; independence; 
and objectivity of the Internal Audit 
function. The role and competence of each 
Internal Audit function across the Group 
was also assessed and considered by the 
Committee. As agreed last year, the Group 
Head of Internal Audit continues to have 
responsibility to ensure the quality of the 
Internal Audit activities in the Group’s 
overseas locations. In the year under 
review an external quality assessment of 
Internal Audit was carried out, results of 
which were considered and discussed by 
the Committee at the meeting in August 
2017. The Committee had noted that the 
review indicated that there was a strong 
endorsement of the Internal Audit function 
but noted that there were some suggested 
recommendations to further enhance the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the Internal 
Audit function that should be considered 
further. The recommendations are in the 
process of being implemented. 
Members of the Committee also receive 
all issued audit reports, enabling them to 
challenge the reports’ content and related 
recommendations. The Committee approves 
the Internal Audit programmes at the start of 
each calendar year whilst the effectiveness 
and workload of the Internal Audit functions 
and the adequacy of available resources are 
monitored throughout the year. 
In accordance with agreed parameters, the 
overseas operations in Spain, Italy and the 
US have their own locally based internal 
auditors, who report to their respective 
country heads. All reports are evaluated by 
the Group Head of Internal Audit to ensure 
the quality and effectiveness of the reported 
findings. In addition, the UK Internal 
Audit department carries out high level 
governance reviews of all foreign operations, 
assessing the internal control frameworks 
and system of risk management. The 
overseas internal auditors attend Committee 
meetings periodically. 
Committee effectiveness review
As part of the Committee’s detailed annual 
review of its performance and processes, 
each Committee member completed a 
comprehensive questionnaire designed 
to provide objective assessment of the 
Committee’s performance, including its 
effectiveness in monitoring internal and 
external audit. The Committee discussed the 
results of the review and it was concluded 
that, overall, the Committee and the audit 
process were effective; that the Committee 
had full access to all the information it 
required; that the Committee had appropriate 
Terms of Reference; and that it was 
adequately discharging its responsibilities.

Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction The Group Risk Committee
Group continues to maintain a regulatory 
capital add-on to cover risks not captured 
within the standard formula. The Committee 
has also reviewed the Group’s proposed 
dividend level, capital plan and capital 
buffer in line with the capital policy. The 
Group continues to make use of Undertaking 
Specific Parameters (USPs) and the Volatility 
Adjustment (VA) across a number of its 
entities, where appropriate. 
During the year the Committee reviewed the 
Board’s risk strategy and risk appetite across 
the Group. This included further updates in 
the UK business as well as the international 
businesses, established as a key part of 
the Group’s Enterprise Risk Management 
Framework (‘ERMF’). A further refresh to the 
suite of Key Risk Indicators with associated 
triggers and limits was completed. These 
updates have improved the effectiveness of 
the Committee by placing greater focus on 
the main risks affecting the business. 
The Committee continues to focus on key 
operational risks that affect the Group.  
The risk event process for identifying, 
reporting and remediating events has 
developed further and the Committee 
has spent time reviewing any major risk 
events reported during the year (including 
consideration of the work required to 
remediate the issues arising from the work 
on the prior year renewal notification). 
In addition, the full programme of work, 
agreed last year, to reduce cyber risk has 
been progressed. This programme will 
also support the data protection work 
as the Group seeks to comply with the 
upcoming GDPR requirements. 
The Committee challenged and 
reviewed the setting of and outputs 
from the regular stress and scenario 
testing and reverse stress testing. 
The output was incorporated into the 
Own Risk and Solvency Assessment 
(‘ORSA’) report for 2017, which the 
Committee also reviewed. 
Good progress has also been made 
on enhancing the project governance 
framework and the Committee looks forward 
to seeing the increased reporting to support 
some of the material projects ongoing across 
the Group. 
The focus on monitoring and reporting 
customer outcome risks continued during 
the year and included reports showing 
progress against the Group minimum 
compliance standards, which builds on 
the levels of compliance resources and 
monitoring that all Group firms must apply 
to their respective regulatory obligations. 
In terms of new products and businesses the 
Committee oversaw the development of 
the new Loans business and the successful 
regulatory application for the new company. 
The Committee also oversaw the launch of 
the new travel insurance product which will 
be embedded within the existing reporting 
templates to support future oversight. 
Finally, the Committee has devoted time to 
the work on Brexit to help set up appropriate 
EU based entities to enable the smooth 
transition of European business written 
within the Group. This work will no doubt 
continue throughout the next 12 months 
and regular reporting will be provided at key 
milestones on the project lifecycle. 
I look forward to continuing the good work 
this year.

Dear Shareholder,
The year began with focus on the Ogden 
rate change. The Committee spent time 
reviewing the impact on solvency ratio as 
well as the customer and pricing impacts. 
There were also a number of updates 
on the future Ogden developments and 
consideration was given to numerous 
scenarios as part of the annual stress and 
scenario testing process. 
A significant amount of time has also been 
dedicated to developing the Group’s Partial 
Internal Model for Solvency II. Whilst the 
committee considered and approved the 
recommendation of a change in scope of the 
model good progress has been made on the 
IMAP programme. In the interim period the 
Statement to Shareholders from the Chairman of the Group Risk Committee

Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction Composition of the  
Group Risk Committee 
Membership at the end of the year  
was: Annette Court, Jean Park (Chair), 
Manning Rountree and David Stevens. The 
Company Secretary acts as Secretary to 
the Committee. 
The Committee met five times during the year. 
Duties and responsibilities of  
the Group Risk Committee 
The duties and responsibilities of the 
Committee are set out in Terms of Reference 
that were reviewed during the year and 
approved by the Board in December 2017. 
The responsibilities of the Committee can  
be summarised as: 
• Oversee the development, 
implementation and maintenance of 
the Group’s overall Risk Management 
Framework and ensure that it is in line 
with emerging regulatory, corporate 
governance and best practice guidelines 
• Monitoring the Group’s prudential risk 
exposure, which includes ensuring that 
the Group’s capital resources and liquidity 
profile are appropriate to its needs 
whilst meeting minimum regulatory 
requirements, including overseeing and 
challenging the design and execution of 
the Group’s stress and scenario testing 
• Monitoring the Group’s current and  
future conduct risk exposure 
• Ensuring the adequacy and effectiveness 
of the Group’s systems and controls for 
the prevention of financial crime, data 
protection systems and controls 
• Monitoring the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the Group’s  
Compliance functions 
• Reviewing the Group’s progress towards 
achieving Solvency II compliance 
• Reviewing compliance with Group 
policies, including the established 
Reserving Policy and process 
• Considering, and recommending to 
the Board for approval, the Group’s risk 
appetite, including any changes to the 
appetite for each material type of risk 
faced by the Group 
• Approving the annual plans for the 
Group Risk and Compliance functions 
which include reviewing regulatory 
developments and regular meetings with 
the PRA and FCA 
• Review the ORSA report each year with 
recommendations being provided to the 
Group Board for approval
• Review and approve the Solvency II 
actuarial function reports on reinsurance 
and underwriting each year
• Review and approve the remuneration 
report from the Chief Risk Officer prior to 
Remuneration Committee sign off. 
The Committee Chairperson reports 
formally to the Board on its proceedings 
after each meeting on all matters within 
its duties and responsibilities, as set out in 
previously circulated minutes to the Board. 
The Committee Chairperson also reports on 
the activities of the Committee in a formal 
written report that is submitted to and 
discussed by the Board every six months. 
The work of the Committee is supported 
by more detailed work undertaken by 
executive Risk Management Committees 
in each of the Group’s operational entities. 
At each meeting, the Risk Management 
Committees consider significant movements 
in the operation’s risk profile, any risks that 
have arisen and any emerging risks. Risk 
Management Committees also assess and 
monitor any regulatory issues, ensuring 
that their resolution and the action taken 
are appropriately recorded. In the UK, the 
Risk Management Committee receives 
regular information on conduct risk, such as 
complaint handling reports and other related 
management information. The Group Risk 
Management function reviews and collates 
information from across the group for 
consideration by the Committee. 
Internal Control and Risk 
Management Statement
The Board is ultimately responsible for the 
Group’s system of risk management and 
internal control including that relating to 
financial reporting processes and, through 
the Audit Committee, has reviewed the 
effectiveness of this system. The system of 
risk management and internal control over 
insurance, operational, market, credit and 
group risks is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and breaches of risk 
appetites and can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
The Board is of the view that there is an 
ongoing process for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the Group’s risks and internal 
controls; that it has been in place for the 
year ended 31 December 2017; and that, up 
to the date of approval of the Annual Report 
and Accounts, it is regularly reviewed by the 
Board and accords with the internal control 
guidance for Directors provided in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. 
The Board confirms that it has performed a 
robust assessment of the Group’s principal 
risks. These risks, along with explanations of 
how they are being managed and mitigated, 
are included in the strategic report on 
page 33.
The Board is responsible for determining 
the nature and extent of the principal risks 
it is willing to take in achieving its strategic 
objectives. The Board meets at least seven 
times a year to discuss the direction of 
the company and provide oversight of the 
Group’s risk management and internal control 
systems. The role and responsibilities of the 
Board are documented within their Terms of 
Reference and these are reviewed annually. 
A key element of the control system is 
that the Board meets regularly with a 
formal schedule of matters reserved to 
it for decision and has put in place an 
organisational structure with clearly defined 
lines of responsibility. As described above, 
in order to ensure these responsibilities 
are properly discharged, the Board has 
delegated to the Audit Committee to 
keep under review the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
financial controls, internal control and risk 
management systems.
The Board has delegated the development, 
implementation and maintenance of the 
Group’s overall risk management framework 
to the Group Risk Committee (“GRC”). The 
GRC reports on its activities to the Board

58 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate Governance: The Group Risk Committee and the Audit Committee, supporting the 
overall assurance provided by the Audit 
Committee that the Group’s internal control, 
risk management and compliance systems 
continue to operate effectively.
The Group has a ‘three lines of defence’ 
approach to internal control, including those 
controls that relate to the financial reporting 
process. The Board recognises that the 
day-to-day responsibility for implementing 
policies lies with the senior management, 
the ‘first line of defence’, whose operational 
decisions must take into account risk and 
how this can be controlled effectively. 
The ‘second line of defence’ describes the 
Committees and functions that are in place 
to provide an oversight of the effective 
operation of the internal control framework. 
The Group Risk department and the 
compliance functions are part of the second 
line of defence. 
The Group Risk department defines and 
prescribes the insurance, operational, 
market, credit and group risk assessment 
processes for the business. It performs 
second line reviews, including of the 
reserving, capital modelling and business 
planning processes, and undertakes regular 
reviews of all risks in conjunction with 
management, with the results of these 
reviews recorded in risk registers collated 
centrally on the Group risk management 
system. Furthermore, Group Risk records any 
actual losses or near misses that occur as a 
consequence of the crystallisation of risk and 
analyses the sufficiency of the action taken 
to avoid reoccurrence. The Chief Risk Officer 
has responsibility for ensuring that managers 
are aware of their risk management 
obligations, providing them with support and 
advice, and ensuring that risk management 
strategies are properly communicated. 
Reports are produced showing the most 
significant risks identified and the controls 
in place. Internal Audit uses the risk registers 
to plan and inform their programme of audits 
around the most significant risks to the 
Group to ensure that the prescribed controls 
are in place and are operating effectively.
There is compliance resource assigned to 
each operation who review and report on 
the first line of defence’s compliance with 
designated control activities. The Group 
compliance function consolidates these 
reviews and provides reports to the Group 
Risk Committee.
The ‘third line of defence’ describes the 
independent assurance provided by the 
Audit Committee and the Group Internal 
Audit function that reports to that 
Committee. Internal Audit undertakes a 
programme of risk based audits covering all 
aspects of both the first and second lines of 
defence. The findings from these audits are 
reported to all three lines, i.e. management, 
the executive and oversight Committees, 
and the Audit Committee.
The Group and subsidiary Risk Committees, 
receive reports setting out key performance 
and risk indicators and consider possible 
control issues brought to their attention 
by early warning mechanisms that are 
embedded within the operational units. 
They, together with the Audit Committee, 
also receive regular reports from the 
Internal Audit function, which include 
recommendations for improvement of the 
control and operational environment. The 
Chair of the Group Risk Committee provides 
a comprehensive written report to the 
Board of the activities carried out by the 
Committee on an annual basis. In addition, 
the Board receives reports from the Chair 
of the Audit Committee as to its activities, 
together with copies of the minutes of the 
GRC and Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee’s ability to provide 
the appropriate assurance to the Board 
depends on the provision of periodic and 
independent confirmation, primarily 
by Internal Audit, that the controls 
established by management are operating 
effectively and where necessary provides 
a high-level challenge to the steps being 
taken by the GRC to implement the risk 
management strategy.
Viability
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
2016 UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
Directors have assessed the prospect of 
the Company over a longer period than the 
12 months required by the ‘Going Concern’ 
provision. The Board conducted this review for 
a period of three years to December 2020. This 
assessment has been made taking into account 
the current financial position of the Group, the 
Group’s business plans, the Group’s ‘Own Risk 
and Solvency Assessment’ (ORSA) process, and 
the principal risks and uncertainties faced by 
the Group, which are disclosed on pages 39 to 
44 of the strategic report. 
The ORSA is performed in line with Solvency 
II regulations and requires the Group 
to demonstrate that it has a detailed 
understanding of the risks facing the 
business over a three-year time horizon.  
In addition to this the Group Risk  
Committee and the Group Board review 
regular updates to the Group’s capital and 
solvency projections. 
Quantitative and qualitative assessments 
of risks are performed as part of the ORSA 
process. The quantitative assessment (in 
line with the Group’s capital and solvency 
projections) considers how the regulatory 
capital requirements, economic capital 
needs, own funds and the solvency position 
of the Company is projected to change over 
the three year time horizon. It also includes 
a series of stress tests, linked to the Group’s 
principal risks and reports the impact of 
these stresses alongside any mitigating 
factors that reduce the impact. 
The results of the stress tests form part 
of the process to set the Group’s capital 
risk appetite, which ensures that a buffer 
on top of the Group’s regulatory capital 
requirement is held to protect its capital 
position against shocks and stresses. Refer 
to the Strategic report for information on 
sensitivities to the reported 2017 solvency 
ratio position. 
Based on the results of this analysis, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall 
due over this three year period.

Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction The Nomination and Governance Committee
Dear Shareholder,
In October 2017, the Committee expanded 
its remit to include reviewing the 
governance arrangements for the Group 
and its principal and material regulated 
entities to ensure they remain appropriate 
by reference to best practice in corporate 
governance. In addition, the Committee 
has taken on responsibility for review and 
approval of appointments to these regulated 
entities to ensure that the overall balance of 
skills, knowledge, experience and diversity 
on the relevant Board remains appropriate. 
Statement from Annette Court, Chairman of the Nomination and Governance Committee
“ As Chairman of the Nomination and Governance 
Committee, I am pleased to report on the activities  
of the Committee during the year.”
In addition, the Committee now also has 
responsibility for addressing any conflict of 
interest issues in respect of appointments to 
these Boards and will advise the Group Board 
on whether the conflict should be authorised 
and whether any conditions should be applied 
to the authorisation. 
An external review of the Group’s governance 
arrangements was carried out during 
the year and the completed report was 
considered by the Board at the January 2018 
Board meeting. The recommendations, 
contained in the report, to strengthen the 
Group’s existing governance arrangements 
so they remain fit for purpose in the future 
will be an area of focus for the Committee 
in 2018 as new entities are established and 
Board constituents change.
Succession planning has again been a key 
area of focus for the Committee during the 
year. Non-Executive Director, Penny James 
left the Board in September 2017 due to 
change in her Executive role and the focus 
had been both on finding a replacement 
for Penny as well implementing the Group’s 
strategy of progressively refreshing the 
skills on the Board. In this context and in 
keeping with its remit to review regularly 
the composition and experience of the 
Board, the Committee led the process of 
Non-Executive Board appointments during 
the year. The Committee carried out a 
robust recruitment process resulting in the 
appointment of Andy Crossley on 27 February 
2018, further enhancing the range of skills, 
breadth of experience and diversity around 
the Board table.
The Committee continued the development 
of a structured succession plan that would 
ensure appropriate action was taken well in 
advance of dates by which Non-Executive 
Directors approach their ninth year of 
service in order to achieve their replacement, 
if appropriate, with individuals of the 
appropriate skills, experience and fit to the 
Board. External recruitment consultants have 
been engaged to lead the search for further 
Non-Executive appointments, particularly 
those with marketing and digital expertise. 
In accordance with the requirements of 
Solvency II and the Senior Insurance Manager 
Regime, the Committee also reviewed and 
approved the Group’s Fit and Proper Policy 
which sets out the process of assessment for 
every person who performs a key function to 
ensure that they meet the requirements in 
terms of qualifications, capability, honesty 
and integrity.
Annette Court 
Chairman of the Nomination and Governance 
Committee

Corporate Governance: The Nomination Committee Membership
The membership of the Committee at the 
year end was: Annette Court (Chairman), 
Colin Holmes and Owen Clarke. The 
Company Secretary acts as Secretary to 
the Committee. The Committee invites the 
Chief Executive and/or the Chief Financial 
Officer to attend meetings when it deems 
appropriate. The Committee met formally 
on seven occasions in 2017. In addition, 
members of the Committee corresponded 
and met informally on a number of occasions 
to consider and meet with individuals that 
the Committee had identified as possible 
candidates to join the Board. 
Board composition and changes
The Committee leads the process for 
making appointments to the Board or where 
the appointee is likely to become a Board 
member. The Committee ensures there is 
a formal, rigorous and transparent process 
for the appointment of new Directors to 
the Board embracing a full evaluation of the 
skills, knowledge and experience required 
of Directors. The Committee also ensures 
plans are in place for orderly succession 
for appointments to the Board and reviews 
the succession plans for other senior 
management positions. Responsibility for 
making senior management appointments 
rests with the Chief Executive. 
The Group has in place a policy of recruiting 
well ahead of impending retirements in 
order to ensure continuity of knowledge and 
Board dynamics. In 2017 the Board initiated 
a search for a new Non-Executive Director. 
The Committee developed an appropriate 
specification for the new Non-Executive 
Director and identified the required skills 
and experience. Following this process, the 
Committee identified Andy Crossley as best 
placed to fill the role identified.
Andy has 31 years’ experience within the 
financial services sector, most recently 
as Chief Financial Officer at Domestic & 
General Group from 2014 to 2017.  
He spent 14 years at Prudential Plc from 2000 
as Director, Group Finance; Group Chief Risk 
Officer; and CFO and Deputy Chief Executive 
of Prudential UK. He previously held senior 
manager roles at Legal & General Group Plc, 
where he was Group Financial Controller, 
and Lloyds Bank Plc. Andy is a Fellow of the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants.
Given Andy’s background, experience and 
competence and the external references 
that were obtained, the Committee did not 
consider it either necessary or appropriate 
to undertake a full search led by an external 
recruitment consultancy. 
Each Committee member met separately 
with Andy and agreed that he would 
bring invaluable experience to the Board. 
The Board approved the Committee’s 
recommendations and following regulatory 
approval Andy was formally appointed to the 
Board with effect from 27 February 2018.
Succession planning and talent 
management 
Talent management continues to be a key 
area of focus and the Board, at its meeting 
in June 2017, considered talent management 
within the Group and identified where 
there were individuals who, with further 
experience and guidance, might be capable 
of moving into particular senior management 
roles. The Committee remains satisfied that 
succession plans for Directors and senior 
management are in place to ensure the 
continued ability of the Group to implement 
strategy and compete effectively in the 
markets in which it operates.
Gender and diversity
Given women constitute 33% of our plc 
Board, the Group has already met the target 
set by both Lord Davies in his report. Women 
on Boards’, and the Hampton Alexander 
Review (that builds on the Davies Review) 
which encourages FTSE 350 companies to 
achieve at least 33% women on Boards by 
2020. The Group also already meets the 
Hampton Alexander Review target of 33% 
women’s representation across executive 
committees below Board level and direct 
reports to those committees, as shown by 
the gender diversity table on page 82. In 
addition, the Committee will review, during 
2018, the Parker Review’s final report on 
ethnic diversity and will focus on its “Beyond 
One by ‘21” recommendation. As part of their 
review, the Committee will focus on how the 
Group should develop a process to identify, 
develop and promote ethnic diversity such 
that a pipeline of suitable candidates is 
available for consideration for future Board 
and senior manager positions. However, the 
Group remains strongly supportive of the 
principle of boardroom diversity, of which 
gender and ethnicity are important, but 
not the only, aspects. What is important 
is diversity of thought, experience and 
approach and each new appointment must 
complement what already exists at the 
Board table. Accordingly, appointments will 
always be made on merit against objective 
criteria, including diversity, and not just to 
achieve an externally prescribed number.
The Group remains committed to 
providing equal opportunities, eliminating 
discrimination, and encouraging diversity 
amongst its workforce both in the UK and 
overseas. A breakdown of the gender of 
Company Directors and senior employees at 
the end of the financial year together with 
details of the Group’s Equality, Diversity 
and Dignity at Work Policy are set out in the 
Directors’ Report on pages 82 to 85.

Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction 62 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 
December 2017, which has been prepared 
by the Remuneration Committee (the 
Committee) and approved by the Board. 
This is the first report I have prepared since 
being proposed as new Committee Chairman, 
to replace Annette Court. I am currently 
undertaking the role of asking Chairman, 
whilst my permanent appointment remains 
subject to regulatory approval.
2017 has been another strong year for the 
Admiral Group, Earnings per Share in the 
year were 117.2 pence (2016: 78.7 pence) and 
Return on Equity was 55% (2016: 37%). Total 
dividends for the financial year (including the 
proposed final dividend of 58.0 pence per 
share) will be 114.0 pence per share. 
The Remuneration Committee
A Statement to Shareholders from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
“ This year we will be asking shareholders to approve a 
new Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors at the 
2018 Annual General Meeting.”
Proposed changes to 
Remuneration Policy
This year we will be asking shareholders 
to approve a new Remuneration Policy for 
Executive Directors at the 2018 Annual 
General Meeting. By way of background, 
Admiral has a remuneration structure, which 
we believe reinforces our culture and creates 
strong alignment with our shareholders. Base 
salaries are targeted at the lower end of our 
peer group, and executives are encouraged 
to build up significant shareholdings in the 
Group to maximise shareholder alignment. 
Our main incentive plan is the Discretionary 
Free Share Scheme (‘DFSS’), which incentivises 
Earnings per Share growth, Return on Equity 
and Total Shareholder Return vs. the FTSE 
350 (excluding investment companies) over a 
three-year period. We do not pay annual cash 
bonuses and instead have in place a simple 
bonus structure that is directly linked to 
the number of DFSS awards held and actual 
dividends paid out to shareholders. This 
structure contributes to a culture of focusing 
on collective, rather than individual, success, 
and is aligned with our philosophy around the 
efficient use of capital and distribution of 
surplus profits.
The Remuneration Policy was last reviewed 
in 2014, and approved by shareholders at 
the 2015 AGM. The 2014 review took into 
account the changes to the business in 
both size and geography since the previous 
review in 2004, and prevailing trends in FTSE 
incentive design and pay levels, particularly 
in the context of the Group maintaining base 
salary levels for most senior management 
positions at the lower end of our peer group.
It is against a similar backdrop that the 
Committee revisited the Remuneration Policy 
in 2017. The Committee continues to support 
the view that share ownership amongst 
staff is important, as it drives outstanding 
performance, promotes long-term success, 
reinforces a long-term focus on the customer, 
encourages appropriate risk management, 
and maintains shareholder alignment.  
The Committee also agreed that the current 
suite of incentives remains effective in 
incentivising key performance categories for 
the business. However, a closer review of the 
CFO’s remuneration package showed that his 
salary is significantly behind market, and his 
remuneration is out of line with other senior 
Admiral executives in terms of pay mix and 
structure. The Committee also concluded 
that a couple of areas in our previous 
Remuneration Policy should be updated 
to align with evolving best practice and 
regulatory requirements. To address these 
points, the Committee is proposing a number 
of changes to the Policy:
• CFO ‘salary’ shares: To bring the CFO’s 
salary closer to market in a way that is 
fair to the individual and aligned with 
shareholder interests, we propose 
supplementing his current cash salary 
of £245,000 with an annual award of 
‘salary’ shares. For 2018, the CFO’s cash 
salary will remain unchanged and an 
award of 5,000 salary shares (equivalent 
to circa £95,000) is proposed, bringing 
total salary to £340,000. The salary share 
award will vest after three years subject 
to continued employment. An additional 
two-year holding period will apply, during 
which time shares may not be sold, save to 
meet income tax, NI or other regulatory 
obligations. Malus and clawback provisions 
will apply during the vesting and holding 
periods. The salary share award is not 
included in base salary when calculating 
the CFO’s pension benefit, DFSS award 
opportunity or achieved against the 
shareholding guideline.
• DFSS post-vesting holding period: 
Extension of the overall DFSS time horizon 
with the introduction of a mandatory 
two-year holding period on vested awards, 
effective from awards made in 2018
• Remuneration Committee discretion 
to adjust DFSS outcome: Committee 
discretion to adjust the formulaic vesting 
outcome to ensure the final outcome is 
a fair and true reflection of underlying 
business performance
62 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate Governance: The Remuneration Committee • Risk adjustment to DFSS bonus: DFSS bonus 
to include a ±20% adjustment based on 
performance against a set of risk metrics, 
effective from awards made in 2018
• Shareholding guideline: Increase to the 
guideline from 200% to 300% of base salary.
The Committee believes that structuring 
the CFO’s salary increase as an award of 
shares, rather than cash, is better aligned 
with shareholders, is consistent with our 
philosophy of low cash awards balanced by 
the award of shares, and more effectively 
supports the CFO’s retention. The proposed 
change will bring the CFO’s package closer to 
market (though it will remain in the bottom 
quartile). It also reflects a move towards 
improving internal consistency between the 
CFO’s remuneration structure and that of the 
broader Admiral executive team below the 
Board, for whom a proportion of their share 
awards are subject to continued employment 
but not subject to the DFSS vesting criteria.
The Board undertakes a regular and 
robust assessment of the principal risks 
to the business, and is keen to ensure 
that the Group’s Remuneration Policy and 
practices promote sound and effective 
risk management and excellent customer 
outcomes. It is in this context that the 
Committee proposes making a change to 
the DFSS bonus made to Executive Directors 
and other senior staff to include a ±20% 
adjustment based on risk performance. A 
scorecard of risk performance measures 
will be set by the Committee each year for 
all significant areas of the business with 
specified targets to determine the amount of 
any DFSS bonus adjustment. It is anticipated 
that many of these measures will be directly 
related to customer outcomes to reinforce 
the Group’s focus on delivering a great 
customer experience. Whilst the bonus may 
be adjusted upwards or downwards by up to 
20% in any given year, it is not anticipated 
that the adjustment will increase the CFO’s 
remuneration on average over the long-
term. The Committee believes that this 
change will help to reinforce our focus on 
risk management and our customers, whilst 
also more clearly demonstrating alignment 
of Group remuneration practices with the 
requirements of Solvency II.
One of the two Executive Directors, the CEO 
David Stevens, is a founding Director and 
receives remuneration that comprises only 
salary and modest benefits. The Committee 
continues to hold the view that this is 
appropriate, as his significant shareholding 
provides a sufficient alignment of his 
interest with those of other shareholders. 
The Committee also reviewed the Company’s 
fixed pay arrangements during 2017. It is 
proposed that the pension provision of 6% 
of salary should remain unchanged, but that 
the internal cap on pension will increase from 
£9,000 to £15,000 p.a. and the Company will 
offer individuals a choice between pension 
contributions and cash in lieu. No other 
changes to Remuneration Policy in respect of 
fixed pay are proposed.
During the early part of 2018, we consulted 
with our largest shareholders on the 
proposed revisions to the Remuneration 
Policy. Feedback has been positive and we 
hope to receive your support for the revised 
Policy at the upcoming AGM. Subject to 
shareholder approval, the proposed Policy 
will take effect from the date of the AGM, 
being 26 April 2018. The first DFSS award 
under the revised Policy will be made in 
September 2018.
Remuneration in 2017
In addition to consideration of the proposed 
Policy changes set out above and oversight 
of the associated shareholder consultation, 
the activities of the Committee during the 
year ended 31 December 2017 included:
• Reviewing the salary arrangements and 
fee proposals for the Executive Directors, 
the former and current Chairman and 
senior management
• Reviewing the appropriateness of the 
performance conditions for the DFSS and 
Free Share Incentive Plan (SIP) awards
• Reviewing the Company’s performance 
against the performance conditions 
applicable to the DFSS and SIP awards and 
where appropriate authorising the vesting 
of awards
• Considering the appropriate performance 
conditions to attach to the DFSS awards for 
the Group’s European insurance operations
• Considering the appropriate application of 
withholding provisions
• Reviewing and authorising the grant of 
awards under both the DFSS and SIP
• Reviewing the Committee’s Terms 
of Reference and recommending 
amendments to the Board for approval
• Considering and approval of the Group’s 
Material Risk Takers in accordance  
with the requirements of Solvency II 
regime and reviewed the Solvency II 
Remuneration Policy
• Considering the Group’s regulatory 
Remuneration Policy Statement
• Reviewed the impact of the Living Wage on 
the Group’s current remuneration structure
• Considering and approval of the Group’s 
Expense Policy
• Considered the terms of engagement with 
the Group’s Remuneration Consultants;
• Reviewing the Gender Pay reporting 
requirements
• Evaluating the performance of the 
Committee.
In September 2017, Geraint Jones was 
granted an award under the DFSS of 50,000 
shares, equivalent to £905,000 or 369% of 
salary. Consistent with the approach for 
2016, the award will vest on three-year EPS 
growth vs. LIBOR, TSR vs. FTSE 350 (excluding 
investment companies), and ROE, weighted 
equally. David Stevens again declined to be 
included given his significant shareholding.
Based on performance to 31 December 2017, 
74.3% of the DFSS award made in 2015 will 
vest. The EPS condition was partially achieved, 
vesting at 41.0% of this element; and the ROE 
condition was also partially achieved, vesting 
at 81.9% of the element. The TSR condition 
vested at 100% of the element.
Resolutions to approve the proposed 
Remuneration Policy (subject to a 
binding vote) and the Annual Report on 
Remuneration (subject to an advisory vote) 
will be put to our shareholders at the AGM in 
April 2018. I am available to meet and discuss 
our Remuneration Policy with shareholders.

Compliance Statement
This Remuneration Report has been prepared 
according to the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 (the Act), Regulation 
11 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-
Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 
2013 and other relevant requirements 
of the FCA Listing Rules. In addition, the 
Board has applied the principles of good 
corporate governance set out in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the Code) and 
has considered the guidelines issued by its 
leading shareholders and bodies such as 
ISS, the Investment Association, and the 
Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association. 
Unless otherwise stated, information 
contained within this Remuneration Report 
is unaudited. 
The Remuneration Committee is seeking 
shareholder approval for an updated 
Remuneration Policy at the 2018 AGM.  
The key changes to the previous Policy are 
as follows:
• Annual award of 5,000 salary shares to the 
CFO, vesting after three years subject to 
continued employment, with additional 
two-year holding period
• Extension of the overall DFSS time horizon 
with the introduction of a mandatory 
two-year holding period on vested awards, 
effective from awards made in 2018
• Remuneration Committee discretion to 
adjust formulaic DFSS outcome to ensure

• No change to pension provision of 6% 
of salary subject to an internal cap, but 
increase to cap from £9,000 to £15,000 
p.a., and choice between pension 
contribution and cash in lieu.
Subject to shareholder approval, the new 
Remuneration Policy will formally come into 
effect from the date of the 2018 AGM.
Key principles of Admiral 
remuneration arrangements
The Group is committed to the primary 
objective of maximising shareholder value 
over time in a way that also promotes 
effective risk management and excellent 
customer outcome and ensuring that there 
is a strong link between performance and 
reward. This is reflected in the Group’s 
stated Remuneration Policy of paying 
competitive, performance-linked and 
shareholder-aligned total remuneration 
packages comprising basic salaries coupled 
with participation in performance-based 
share schemes to generate competitive total 
reward packages for superior performance. 
The Board is satisfied that the adoption of 
this Policy continues to meet the objectives 
of attracting and retaining executives of the 
highest quality across the Group.
The Committee reviews the framework and 
remuneration packages of the Executive 
Directors and the most senior managers 
and recognises the need to ensure that 
the Remuneration Policy is firmly linked 
to the Group’s strategy, including its risk 
management approach. In setting the 
Policy and making remuneration decisions, 
the Committee takes into account pay and 
conditions elsewhere in the Group. The main 
principles underlying the Remuneration 
Policy are:
• Competitive total package – the Group 
aims to deliver total remuneration 
packages that are market-competitive, 
taking into account the role, job size, 
responsibility, and the individual’s 
performance and effectiveness. Prevailing 
market and economic conditions and 
developments in governance are also 
considered, as are general salary levels 
throughout the organisation
• Significantly share-based – our base 
salaries are targeted towards the lower 
end of market, but are combined with 
meaningful annual share awards that 
vest on long-term performance to ensure 
strong alignment with shareholders and 
the long-term interests of the Group. 
Executives are also encouraged to build up 
significant shareholdings in the Group to 
maximise shareholder alignment
• Long-term perspective – a significant 
part of senior executives’ remuneration is 
based on the achievement of stretching 
performance targets that support 
the delivery of the Group’s strategy 
and shareholder value. The extended 
performance and vesting horizons 
promote a long-term perspective that is 
appropriate to the insurance sector
• Effective risk management – incentives 
are designed to ensure they do not 
encourage excessive risk-taking. They 
are aligned with the delivery of positive 
customer outcomes and reinforce the 
Group’s risk policy
• Open and honest culture – the Group has 
a strong culture of focussing on collective 
success, whilst still recognising individual 
contribution to the Group’s performance,

Remuneration Policy table
This table describes the key components of the remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors.
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity and performance metrics
Base Salary
To attract and retain talent 
by setting base salaries at 
levels appropriate for the 
business.
Salaries are reviewed annually or following a significant 
change in responsibilities.
Salary levels/increases take account of:
• Scope and responsibility of the position
• Individual performance and effectiveness, and experience 
of the individual in the role
• Average increase awarded across the Group.
The CFO receives an annual award of ‘salary’ shares in addition 
to his cash salary. The salary share award vests after three 
years subject to continued employment, and an additional 
two-year holding period applies, during which time shares 
may not be sold, save to meet income tax, NI or other 
regulatory obligations. Malus and clawback provisions apply 
during the vesting and holding periods. The salary share 
award is not included in base salary when calculating the CFO’s 
pension benefit.
Any salary increases are applied in line with the 
outcome of the review.
In respect of existing Executive Directors, it 
is anticipated that increases in cash salary or 
the number of salary shares will normally be in 
line with the increase for the general employee 
population over the term of this Policy. More 
significant increases may be awarded in certain 
circumstances including, but not limited to: 
where there has been a significant increase 
in role size or complexity, to apply salary 
progression for a newly appointed Executive 
Director, or where the Executive Director’s 
salary has fallen significantly behind market.
Where increases are awarded in excess of 
that for the general employee population, the 
Committee will provide the rationale in the 
relevant year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.
Pension
To provide retirement 
benefits.
The Group operates a Personal Pension Plan,  
a Defined Contribution Scheme.
This is available to all employees following  
completion of their probationary period.
In the UK, the Group matches employee 
contributions up to a maximum of 6% of base 
salary subject to an overall maximum employer 
contribution of £15,000, or provides the 
equivalent value in cash. Base salary is the only 
element of remuneration that is pensionable.
Other Benefits
To provide competitive 
benefits.
Includes (but not limited to):
• Death in service scheme
• Private medical cover
• Permanent health insurance
• Relocation, at the Committee’s discretion
All benefits are non-pensionable.
Benefits may vary by role. 
None of the existing Executive Directors 
received total taxable benefits exceeding 5% 
of base salary during the most recent financial 
year, and it is not anticipated that the cost of 
benefits provided will exceed this level over the 
term of this Policy.
The Committee retains the discretion 
to approve a higher cost in exceptional 
circumstances (e.g. relocation), or in 
circumstances driven by factors outside the 
Company’s control (e.g. material increases in 
healthcare insurance premiums).
66 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate Governance: Directors’ Remuneration Policy Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity and performance metrics
Discretionary Free Share Scheme (DFSS)
To motivate and reward 
longer term performance, aid 
long-term retention of key 
executive talent, use capital 
efficiently, grow profits 
sustainably and further 
strengthen the alignment of 
the interests of shareholders 
and staff.
Executive Directors may be granted awards annually at the 
discretion of the Committee. David Stevens has declined to 
participate given his significant shareholding.
Awards may be in the form of nil or nominal priced options or 
conditional shares. Awards vest after a minimum of three years 
subject to Group performance and continued employment.
For DFSS awards made in 2018 and subsequent years, a two-
year holding period applies to vested awards, during which 
time Executive Directors may not sell the vested awards 
except to cover tax liabilities.
Awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions, i.e. 
forfeiture or reduction of unvested awards and recovery of 
vested awards in exceptional circumstances (such as material 
misstatement or gross misconduct).
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to adjust the 
formulaic vesting outcome to ensure the final outcome is a 
fair and true reflection of underlying business performance.
Maximum opportunity: £2,000,000. For awards 
above £1,000,000 a maximum of 600% of base 
salary (excluding any salary shares) applies. 
Threshold performance will result in vesting of 
up to 25% of the maximum award.
Vesting of DFSS awards is subject to the Group’s 
performance over a three-year performance 
period. The performance measures may include 
EPS, ROE and relative TSR or other measures 
selected by the Committee, as appropriate. 
Measures will typically be weighted equally 
unless the Committee determines otherwise 
to reflect strategic priorities. Details of the 
measures, weightings and performance 
targets used for specific DFSS grants are 
included in the relevant year’s Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
DFSS Bonus
To further align incentive 
structures with shareholder 
interests through the 
delivery of dividend 
equivalent bonuses.
To incentivise shareholder value creation, in particular in 
the form of dividends, management participate in a bonus 
scheme which directly links their awards to dividends paid 
to shareholders. Bonus is calculated to be equivalent to 
dividends that would have been payable during the year on all 
outstanding DFSS shares awarded but not vested, including 
salary share for the CFO.
The DFSS bonus is subject to a ±20% adjustment based on 
performance against a set of risk metrics. The metrics will 
be set each year for all significant areas of the business with 
specified targets to determine the amount of any DFSS bonus 
adjustment. It is anticipated that many of these measures will 
be directly related to customer outcomes. Whilst the bonus may 
be adjusted upwards or downwards by up to 20% in any given 
year, it is not anticipated that the adjustment will increase the 
CFO’s remuneration on average over the long term.
The DFSS bonus is subject to malus and clawback provisions, 
i.e. forfeiture or reduction of unvested awards and recovery of 
vested awards in exceptional circumstances (such as material 
misstatement or gross misconduct).
Maximum opportunity: sum equal to the 
dividends payable during the year on  
awarded but unvested DFSS shares, subject 
also to a possible 20% enhancement based 
on the Committee’s assessment of the risk 
metrics scorecard.
No bonus is payable unless dividends are 
payable on Admiral shares.
Approved Free Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
To encourage share 
ownership across all 
employees using HMRC 
approved schemes.
All UK employees participate in the SIP (except David Stevens, 
who has declined to participate). Grants are made twice a year 
based on the results of each half year and vest after three 
years subject to continued employment.
The SIP is an all-employee scheme and 
Executive Directors participate on the same 
terms as other employees. The acquisition 
of shares is therefore not subject to the 
satisfaction of a performance target.
Maximum opportunity is in line with HMRC limits.
67 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity and performance metrics
Shareholding Requirement
To align interests of 
Executive Directors with 
shareholders.
Guideline to be met within five years or the later of the 
introduction of the guidelines and an Executive Director’s 
appointment.
300% of base salary (base salary excludes any 
salary shares).
The Committee is satisfied that the above Remuneration Policy is in the best interests of shareholders and does not promote excessive risk-
taking. The Committee retains discretion to make changes required to satisfy legal or regulatory requirements and other non-significant 
changes to the Remuneration Policy without reverting to shareholders.
Notes to the Remuneration Policy table
Payments from existing awards
Executive Directors are eligible to receive payment from any award made prior to the approval and implementation of the Remuneration 
Policy. This includes all outstanding awards under the previous 2015 Remuneration Policy, or any awards made prior to appointment to the 
Board. Details of any such payments will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.
Selection of performance measures
Vesting under the DFSS is currently linked to EPS vs. LIBOR, ROE, and relative TSR. EPS vs. LIBOR has been selected as a performance measure 
as the Committee feels it is a strong indicator of both long-term shareholder return and the underlying financial performance of the business. 
It is transparent and visible and provides good line-of-sight to executives. ROE has been selected as the Committee believes that a returns 
metric reinforces the focus on capital efficiency and delivery of strong returns for our shareholders, thereby further strengthening the 
alignment of incentives with Admiral’s strategy. The third DFSS measure is relative TSR vs. the FTSE 350 (excluding investment companies). 
This has been selected to reflect value creation for Admiral’s shareholders as compared with the general market. The specific performance 
measures and their respective weightings in respect of each DFSS award may vary to reflect the strategic priorities at the time of the award.
Performance targets are set to be stretching and achievable, taking into account broker forecasts, the Company’s strategic priorities and the 
economic environment in which the Company operates. The financial targets are set taking into account a range of reference points including 
the Group’s strategic plan and broker forecasts for both Admiral and its insurance peers. The Committee believes that the performance 
targets set are stretching and motivational, and that maximum outcomes are available only for outstanding performance.
Remuneration policy for other employees
The Company’s approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group, with consideration given to the role size, experience required, 
individual performance and pay levels in comparable companies.
In general, the Remuneration Policy which applies to other senior executives is consistent with that for Executive Directors. Remuneration is 
typically linked to Company and individual performance in a way that reinforces shareholder value creation.
Approximately 2,300 employees from across the Group, as well as the CFO, participate in the DFSS. The Committee recommends for approval 
by the Board DFFS awards for those Executives within its remit and on an aggregate basis for all other participants in the DFSS. For the CFO, 
all DFSS share awards are subject to performance conditions. For other senior managers and employees at lower organisational levels, a 
proportion of awards (ranging from 50% to two-thirds) is subject to performance, and the remainder has no performance conditions attached 
other than the requirement that the recipient remains an employee of the Group at the date of vesting. Award sizes vary by organisational 
level and an assessment of individual performance and non-financial business unit performance. All holders of DFSS awards receive the DFSS 
bonus. Overseas employees receive an equivalent award to the UK SIP awards under the DFSS. These awards have no performance measures 
attached. 
All employees are eligible to participate in the SIP on the same terms.
Remuneration arrangements for David Stevens (Founding Director)
David Stevens is a founding Director, and he and the Committee continue to hold the view that his significant shareholding provides 
sufficient alignment of his interest in the performance of the Group with the interests of other shareholders. In light of this, David Stevens’ 
remuneration package consists only of a cash salary, benefits such as private medical cover, permanent health insurance and death in service 
cover, and matching pension contributions from the Company under the Group’s Personal Pension Plan. David Stevens has not participated, nor 
is it intended that he participates, in any Group share schemes.

Corporate Governance: Directors’ Remuneration Policy Service contracts and leaver/change of control provisions
The Company’s Policy is to limit termination payments on termination to pre-established contractual arrangements. In the event that the 
employment of an Executive Director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined in accordance with the terms of the service 
contract between the Company and the employee, as well as the rules of any incentive plans. Under normal circumstances, Executive Directors 
are entitled to receive termination payments in lieu of notice based on base salary and compensation for loss of benefits. The Company has 
the ability to pay such sums in instalments, requiring the Executive Director to mitigate loss over the relevant period. The notice period for all 
Executive Directors is one year.
Executive Director Date of appointment
David Stevens 22 October 1999
Geraint Jones 13 August 2014
There is no provision in the Executive Directors’ contracts for compensation to be payable on early termination of their contract over and 
above the notice period element. The Executive Directors’ service contracts are available to view at the Company’s registered office.
When considering termination payments, the Committee reviews all potential incentive outcomes to ensure they are fair to both shareholders 
and participants. The table below summarises how the awards under the DFSS and DFSS bonus scheme are typically treated in specific 
circumstances, with the final treatment remaining subject to the Committee’s discretion:

For all leavers (with the exception of termination for cause). In respect of vested DFSS and vested salary share awards that are still subject to 
a holding period, awards will normally be released in full at the end of the holding period, though the Committee has discretion to determine 
otherwise, taking into account the circumstances at the time.
Non-Executive Directors
The Company has entered into letters of appointment with its Non-Executive Directors (NEDs). Summary details of terms and notice periods 
are included below.

Manning Rountree 3 years 16 June 2015 One month
The NEDs are not eligible to participate in the DFSS or DFSS bonus scheme and do not receive any pension contributions.
Details of the Policy on NED fees are set out in the table below:
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity and performance metrics
To attract and retain NEDs 
of the highest calibre with 
experience relevant to 
the Company
Fees are reviewed annually.
The Group Chairman fee is determined by the Committee 
after consultation with the Executive Directors. The NED fees 
are determined by the Group Chairman together with the 
Executive Directors.
Additional fees are payable for acting as Senior Independent 
Director or as Chair or member of a Board Committee 
as appropriate, and may be payable as appropriate in 
relation to other additional responsibilities (e.g. attending 
meetings overseas).
Fees are paid in a mix of cash and Company shares for the 
Company Chair, and in cash for other Non-Executive Directors. 
The Board retains discretion to vary the mix or determine  
that fees are paid entirely in cash or Company shares.
Fee levels are set by reference to NED fees at 
companies of a similar size and complexity. 
It is anticipated that NED fee increases will 
normally be in line with the increase for the 
general employee population over the term 
of this Policy.
In the event that there is a material 
misalignment with the market or a change 
in the complexity, responsibility or time 
commitment required to fulfil a NED role, the 
Board has discretion to make an appropriate 
adjustment to the fee level.
The maximum aggregate annual fee for NEDs 
is capped at the limit provided for in the 
Company’s Articles of Association.
Pay-for-performance: scenario analysis
The following charts provide an estimate of the potential future reward opportunities for the Executive Directors, and the potential split 
between the different elements of pay under three different performance scenarios: ‘Minimum’, ‘On-target’ and ‘Maximum’. 
As described above, Admiral’s DFSS bonus is directly aligned with dividends received by our shareholders. Whilst the final bonus outcome may 
be adjusted upwards or downwards for risk by up to 20% in any given year, it is anticipated that the average adjustment over the long term will 
be close to 0%. The figures shown in the chart below for the CFO’s DFSS bonus include the value of the actual DFSS bonus paid in 2017 as an 
illustration of the value he might receive. Under all scenarios, potential reward opportunities are based on the proposed Remuneration Policy 
and expected awards for 2018, applied to salaries as at 1 January 2018.

Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction Approach to Remuneration relating to new Executive Director appointments
External appointments
In the case of appointing a new Executive Director, the Committee may make use of any of the existing components of remuneration as 
set out in the Policy Table. The Committee’s policy is to set the remuneration package for a new Executive Director in accordance with the 
approved Remuneration Policy at the time of the appointment.
In determining the appropriate remuneration for a new Executive Director, the Committee will consider all relevant factors to ensure that 
arrangements are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Where an individual is appointed on an initial base salary that 
is below market, any shortfall may be managed with phased increases over a period of time, subject to the individual’s performance and 
development in the role. This may result in above-average salary increases during this period.
The Committee may also make an award in respect of a new Executive Director appointment to ‘buy out’ incentive arrangements forfeited 
on leaving a previous employer. In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant factors including any performance conditions attached 
to the forfeited awards and the likelihood of those conditions being met to ensure that the value of the buy-out award is no greater than 
the fair value of the awards it replaces. The Committee may also avail itself of Listing Rule 9.4.2 R if appropriate in respect of buy-out 
incentive arrangements.
Internal appointments
Remuneration for new Executive Directors appointed by way of internal promotion will similarly be determined in line with the Policy for 
external appointees, as detailed above. Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to the Board, the 
Company will continue to honour these arrangements. Incentive opportunities for below-Board employees are typically no higher than for 
Executive Directors, but measures may vary if necessary.
Other Directorships
Executive Directors are permitted to accept appointments as Non-Executive Directors of companies with prior approval of the Group 
Chairman. Approval will be given only where the appointment does not present a conflict of interest with the Group’s activities, and where 
the wider exposure gained will be beneficial to the development of the individual. 
Considerations of conditions elsewhere in the Group 
The Committee considers the pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group when determining remuneration for Executive 
Directors. Whilst the Committee does not currently consult specifically with employees on the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors, 
it consults with and receives updates on employee pay arrangements from the Head of People Services and takes this into consideration when 
reviewing executive remuneration.
Considerations of shareholder views 
When determining remuneration, the Committee takes into account best practice guidelines issued by institutional shareholder bodies. The 
Committee is open to feedback from shareholders on Remuneration Policy and will continue to monitor trends and developments in corporate 
governance and market practice to ensure the remuneration structure for our Executive Directors remains appropriate.
Considerations of regulatory requirements 
The Committee regularly reviews the Remuneration Policy and structure in the context of Solvency II remuneration guidance. The Chief Risk 
Officer periodically attends Committee meetings as part of this process and provides support to the Committee in understanding any risk-
related implications of remuneration decisions. Whilst the Remuneration Policy includes several features which help ensure compliance with 
current regulatory guidance, the Committee reserves the discretion to adjust the Remuneration Policy, and its execution, to take into account 
any developments in such regulatory guidance. 
 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued
Corporate Governance: Directors’ Remuneration Policy
72 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Annual Report on Remuneration
This section of the report provides details of how Admiral’s 2015 Remuneration Policy was implemented in 2017 and how the Remuneration 
Committee intends to implement the proposed Remuneration Policy in 2018.
Remuneration Committee membership in 2017
The Board sets the Group’s Remuneration Policy and, through the authority delegated to it by the Board, the Committee is responsible for 
making recommendations to the Board on the structure and implementation of the Remuneration Policy across the Group with consideration 
to the prevailing economic climate within the economies in which the Group operates. Its remit includes recommending the remuneration 
of the Group Board Chairman, the Executive Directors and the Company Secretary; reviewing the remuneration of senior management; and 
reviewing the composition of and awards made under the performance-related incentive schemes.
At the end of 2017 the Committee consisted of Owen Clarke, Jean Park, Justine Roberts and Annette Court. Owen Clarke joined the 
Remuneration Committee with effect from 28 April 2016 and was proposed as the Chairman of the Committee on 26 April 2017. Owen Clarke 
is currently the Acting Chairman of the Committee as his appointment remains subject to regulatory approval. Justine Roberts joined the 
Committee with effect from 26 April 2017. Annette Court was the Chair of the Committee until the date of the 2017 AGM (26 April 2017) 
when she was appointed as Non-Executive Chair of Admiral and remains a member of the Committee pending the conclusion of Owen Clarke’s 
regulatory application process. The Committee met seven times during the year.
The Group Chairman, CEO, CFO and Chief Risk Officer are invited to meetings where the Committee considers it appropriate to obtain their 
advice on Group strategy and performance and Senior Executive pay strategy. The members of the Committee do not have any personal 
financial interests (other than shareholdings), or any conflicts, that relate to the business of the Committee. The Committee members do not 
have any day-to-day involvement in the running of the Group.
Advisor to the Committee
During the year, in order to enable the Committee to reach informed decisions on Executive remuneration, advice on market data and trends 
was obtained from independent consultants, Mercer Kepler. Mercer Kepler reports directly to the Committee Chairman, and is a signatory to 
and abides by the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants (which can be found at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com). Other 
than advice on remuneration, no other services were provided by Mercer Kepler (or any other part of the MMC group of companies) to the 
Company. The fees paid to Mercer Kepler in respect of work carried out in 2017 (based on time and materials) totalled £48,430, excluding 
expenses and VAT.
The Committee undertakes due diligence periodically to ensure that Mercer Kepler remains independent of the Company and that the advice 
provided is impartial and objective. The Committee is satisfied that the advice provided by Mercer Kepler is independent.
The Company Secretary also circulates market survey results as appropriate.

DFSS awards vesting on performance to 31 December 2017
On 29 September 2015, Geraint Jones was granted an award under the DFSS of 50,000 shares with a value at the date of award of £743,500 
(based on a grant date share price of £14.87), equivalent to 372% of salary.
Vesting of the award was based 100% on the achievement of performance conditions, being EPS growth vs. LIBOR, TSR vs. FTSE 350  
(excluding investment companies), and ROE, weighted equally and all measured over the three-year period 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017. 
Over this period, the returns to our shareholders were strong, with TSR in the top quartile of FTSE350 companies and with ROE of over 47%.  
The combination of these shareholder returns and EPS growth comfortably in excess of the threshold performance set for these awards 
contributed to a vesting level of 74.3%. The table below details the Company’s performance against targets and the resulting vesting outcome.

Based on performance, the total amount that will vest to Geraint Jones in September 2018 will therefore be 74.3% of his award (i.e. 37,150 
shares), subject to his continued employment on the vesting date.
Vested DFSS awards are subject to clawback provisions in exceptional circumstances, such as material misstatement or gross misconduct.
DFSS bonus in respect of 2017 
In line with the Remuneration Policy, the Group paid a bonus to all holders of DFSS shares in 2017, which was equivalent to the dividend payable 
on all outstanding DFSS shares awarded but not yet vested. The Committee continues to believe that having a bonus equivalent to the 
dividend flow received by investors further aligns the incentive structure with shareholders.
In 2017, Geraint Jones received a DFSS bonus of £153,525 (2016: £174,209). David Stevens did not receive a DFSS bonus as he does not 
participate in the DFSS.
DFSS bonus payments are subject to clawback provisions in exceptional circumstances, such as material misstatement or gross misconduct.

DFSS
In September 2017, Geraint Jones was granted an award under the DFSS of 50,000 shares with a value at the date of award of £905,000 (based 
on share price of £18.10), equivalent to 369% of salary. The three-year period over which performance will be measured is 1 January 2017 to 
31 December 2019. The award is eligible to vest in its entirety on the third anniversary of the date of grant (i.e. September 2020), subject to 
performance and to continued employment. David Stevens again declined to be included given his significant shareholding. 
The award will vest dependent on three-year EPS growth vs. LIBOR, TSR vs. FTSE 350 (excluding investment companies), and ROE, weighted 
equally. The performance conditions are summarised in the table below.

Executive Directors
Salary, pension and benefits
Salaries for the Executive Directors in 2018 will be determined in line with the proposed Remuneration Policy, subject to shareholder approval. 
The Committee approved the following base salaries for the Executive Directors for 2018:
Director Latest salary 2017 salary % change Effective date
Geraint Jones £340,000

£245,000 38.8% 1 January 2018
David Stevens £396,000 £388,236 2% 1 September 2017
1. Comprising £245,000 in cash and circa £95,000 in shares, subject to shareholder approval.
76 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate Governance: Annual Report on Remuneration For 2018, the CFO’s cash salary will remain unchanged at £245,000 and an award of 5,000 salary shares is proposed, bringing total salary to circa 
£340,000. The salary share award will vest after three years subject to continued employment. An additional two-year holding period will apply, 
during which time shares may not be sold, save to meet income tax, NI or other regulatory obligations. Malus and clawback provisions will apply 
during the vesting and holding periods. The salary share award is not included in base salary when calculating the CFO’s pension benefit.
The Committee believes that structuring the CFO’s salary increase as an award of shares, rather than cash, is better aligned with shareholders, 
is consistent with our philosophy of low cash awards balanced by the award of shares, and more effectively supports the CFO’s retention. The 
proposed change will bring the CFO’s package closer to market (though it will remain in the bottom quartile). It also reflects a move towards 
improving internal consistency between the CFO’s remuneration structure and that of the broader Admiral executive team below Board, for 
whom a proportion of their share awards are subject to continued employment but not subject to the DFSS vesting criteria.
Geraint Jones will continue to participate in the Group Personal Pension Plan, where employee contributions are matched up to a maximum 
6% of base salary with internal cap on the maximum employer contribution. Effective from 2018 and subject to shareholder approval, whilst 
pension provision will remain 6% of base salary, the cap will be increased from £9,000 to £15,000 p.a. and the Company will offer individuals a 
choice between pension contributions and cash in lieu. David Stevens will also continue to participate in the plan, on the same basis as Geraint. 
Both Executive Directors will continue to receive benefits in line with the Policy.
DFSS
As in prior years, the Committee intends to make an award under the DFSS to Geraint Jones in September 2018. In advance of each DFSS cycle, 
the Committee reviews the appropriateness of the performance measures and corresponding targets. The Committee will determine the 
award size and performance conditions to be attached to the 2018 DFSS award closer to the award date (expected to be in September 2018), 
and will disclose them in the 2018 Annual Report on Remuneration.
DFSS bonus
As in prior years, Geraint Jones will be eligible to receive a DFSS bonus in 2018. The bonus is calculated to be equivalent to dividends that would 
have been payable during the year on all outstanding DFSS shares and any salary shares awarded but not vested. Effective from 2018, the DFSS 
bonus will include a ±20% adjustment based on performance against a set of risk metrics. The details of the risk metric and any adjustment 
applied will be provided in the 2018 Annual Report on Remuneration.

for all other employees. The analysis is based on a consistent set of employees, i.e. the same individuals appear in the 2016 and 2017 
populations. As the CEO does not participate in the DFSS bonus scheme, to provide a meaningful comparison we have also included data for 
the CFO who receives DFSS awards.

2. David Stevens was appointed as the CEO on 13 May 2016. His 2016 remuneration includes salary, pension and benefits in respect of his service as CEO.
3.  Kevin Chidwick left the Board on 13 August 2014 to focus on his new role as CEO of Elephant Auto. His 2014 remuneration includes salary, pension and benefits in respect of his service 
as CFO, his full year DFSS and his full year DFSS bonus.
4.  Geraint Jones was appointed to the Board as CFO on 13 August 2014. His 2014 remuneration includes salary, pension and benefits in respect of his service as CFO, his full year DFSS and 
his full year DFSS bonus. 
5. These figures include reimbursement of £177,104 and £165,000 in 2014 and 2013, respectively, for expenses incurred in respect of the previous CFO’s relocation. 
6. This figure has been trued up since the 2016 report for the value of the 2014 DFSS based on the actual share price on vest (£20.24).
7. 74.3% of Geraint Jones’ 2015 DFSS award will vest in September 2018 subject to his continued employment on the vesting date.
There are no annual bonus outcomes to report in the table as the Admiral DFSS bonus is not structured as a traditional annual bonus scheme 
and consequently a vesting outcome (as a percentage of max) is meaningless.

Dilution
The Company currently uses newly issued shares to fund the DFSS and SIP. The Company has controls in place to ensure that shares awarded 
under the incentive schemes operated by the Company within any rolling ten-year period do not exceed 10% of the number of ordinary shares 
in the capital of the Company in issue at the time of each award. As at the end of 2017, the ten-year rolling dilution level was 9.45% on a gross 
basis and 8.51% on a net basis, after taking account of future attrition and performance vesting in the DFSS. The Company would consider 
using a mixture of newly issued shares and market purchase shares to fund the DFSS in the future. 
Interests held by Directors (audited)
The Company has adopted Executive Director shareholding guidelines whereby all Executive Directors are required to acquire and retain a 
beneficial shareholding in the Company equal to at least 300% of base salary, excluding salary shares where applicable, which can be built up 
over a period of five years from the later of the introduction of the guidelines and the individual’s date of appointment. The guideline was 
previously set at 200% of base salary, but was increased to 300% from 2018 for additional shareholder alignment. All Executive Directors 
currently hold shares in excess of the guideline.

Going Concern
Under Provision C.1.3 of the 2016 UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Board is 
required to report on whether the business 
is a going concern. In considering this 
requirement, the Directors have taken into 
account the following:
• The Group’s projections for the next 12 
months and beyond, in particular the profit 
forecasts, regulatory capital surpluses and 
levels and sources of liquidity
• The risks included on the Group’s risk 
register that could impact on the Group’s 
financial position and performance, levels 
of liquidity and solvency over the next  
12 months.
• The risks On the Group’s risk register that 
could be a threat to the Group’s business 
model and capital adequacy.
The Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position are 
set out in the Strategic Report. The Strategic 
Report also includes the Group’s principal 
risks and uncertainties. In addition, the 
governance report includes the Directors’ 
statement on the viability of the Group over  
a three-year period. 
Following consideration of the above, the 
Directors have reasonable expectation that 
the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operation for the foreseeable future, a 
period of not less than 12 months from the 
date of this report, and that it is therefore 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the financial statements.

Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction Additional information for 
shareholders
Where not provided previously in this 
Directors’ Report, the following provides 
the additional information required 
for shareholders as a result of the 
implementation of the Takeovers Directive 
into UK law.
At 31 December 2017, the Company’s issued 
share capital comprised a single class of 
shares referred to as ordinary shares. Details 
of the share capital and shares issued during 
the year can be found in note 11d.
On a poll, every member present in person or 
by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one 
vote for every ordinary share held. The notice 
of the general meeting specifies deadlines 
for exercising voting rights either by proxy 
notice or present in person or by proxy 
in relation to resolutions to be passed at 
general meeting. All proxy votes are counted 
and the numbers for, against or withheld in 
relation to each resolution are announced at 
the Annual General Meeting and published on 
the Company’s website after the meeting.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of 
ordinary shares in the Company other than:
• Certain restrictions may from time to time 
be imposed by laws and regulations (for 
example, insider trading laws).
• Pursuant to the Listing Rules of the 
FCA whereby certain employees of 
the Company require the approval 
of the Company to deal in the 
Company’s securities.
The Company has not purchased any of its 
own shares during the period. 
There are no agreements between the 
Company and its Directors or employees 
providing for compensation for loss of office 
or employment (whether through resignation, 
purported redundancy or otherwise) that 
occurs because of a takeover bid. 
There are a number of agreements that alter 
or terminate upon a change of control of the 
Company following a takeover bid, such as 
commercial contracts. None are considered 
to be significant in terms of their impact on 
the business of the Group as a whole except 
for the long term co-insurance agreement in 
place with Great Lakes Insurance SE. Details 
relating to this agreement are contained in 
the Strategic Report.
Power to issue shares
At the last Annual General Meeting, held 
on 26 April 2017, authority was given to 
the Directors to allot unissued relevant 
securities in the Company up to a maximum 
of £93,836, equivalent to one third of the 
issued share capital as at 20 March 2017. This 
authority expires on the date of the Annual 
General Meeting to be held on 26 April 2018 
and the Directors will seek to renew this 
authority for the following year. 
A further special resolution passed at that 
meeting granted authority to the Directors 
to allot equity securities in the Company 
(up to a maximum of 5% of the issued share 
capital of the Company) for cash, without 
regard to the pre-emption provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006. This authority also 
expires on the date of the Annual General 
Meeting to be held on 26 April 2018 and the 
Directors will seek to renew this authority for 
the following year.
In line with the new principles published by 
the Pre-Emption Group in March 2015, and 
their template resolutions published in May 
2016, allowing a company the ability to seek 
authority over a further 5% of the issued 
ordinary share capital on a non-pre-emptive 
basis subject to certain conditions, it is the 
intention of the Company, at the AGM on 26 
April 2018, to seek this additional authority 
by special resolution and will confirm in the 
Notice of AGM that such additional shares 
are only issued in connection with a specified 
acquisition or capital investment. 
Appointments of Directors
The Company’s Articles of Association 
(the Articles) give the Directors power to 
appoint and replace Directors. Under the 
Terms of Reference of the Nomination and 
Governance Committee, any appointment 
must be recommended by the Nomination 
and Governance Committee for approval 
by the Board of Directors. The Articles 
also require Directors to retire and submit 
themselves for election at the first Annual 
General Meeting following appointment and 
all Directors who held office at the time of 
the two preceding Annual General Meetings 
to submit themselves for re-election. 
However, in accordance with the 
requirement under the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code) for annual 
election of Directors, all Directors will submit 
themselves for re-election at the Group’s 
Annual General Meeting on 26 April 2018. 
Articles of Association
The Articles may only be amended by special 
resolution of the shareholders.
Power of the Directors
The Directors are responsible for managing 
the business of the Company and may 
exercise all powers of the Company subject 
to the provisions of relevant statutes, to any 
directions given by special resolution and to 
the Company’s Memorandum and Articles. 
The Articles, for example, contain specific 
provisions and restrictions concerning the 
Company’s power to borrow money. Powers 
relating to the issuing of new shares are also 
included in the Articles and such authorities 
are renewed by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting each year. 
Directors’ indemnities and insurance
Directors and Officers insurance cover is 
in place for all Directors to provide cover 
against certain acts or omissions on behalf 
of the Company. A Deed Poll of Indemnity 
was executed in October 2015, indemnifying 
each of the Directors, and Company 
Secretary, in relation to certain losses and 
liabilities that they might incur in the course 
of acting as Directors of the Company. The 
Deed Poll of Indemnity is categorised as 
qualifying third party indemnity provisions 
as defined by section 234 of the Companies 
Act 2006 and remains in force for all past and 
present Directors of the Company.
The Board is of the view that it is in the 
best interests of the Group to attract 
and retain the services of the most able 
and experienced Directors by offering 
competitive terms of engagement,  
including the granting of such indemnities.

in the event that a Director is proved to  
have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
It is proposed that the next AGM be held at 
City Hall, Cardiff on Thursday 26 April 2018 
at 2.00pm, notice of which will be sent to 
shareholders with the Annual Report. 
Reporting, accountability  
and audit
UK Corporate Governance Code
Admiral is subject to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code), published by 
the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in April 
2016 and available on their website, www.
frc.org.uk. The Company’s Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, addresses the 
requirements of the 2016 Code.
During the year to 31 December 2017, the 
Company has in all respects complied with 
the provisions of the 2016 Code except 
with regard to non-compliance with the 
provisions as set out in the corporate 
governance report at page 46.
The Directors confirm that the Annual 
Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.
Directors’ responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the Group and parent 
company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare Group and parent company financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group 
financial statements in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with UK 
Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework. 
Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
Parent Company and of their profit or loss for 
that period. In preparing each of the Group 
and Parent Company financial statements, 
the directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently
• make judgements and estimates that  
are reasonable and prudent
• for the Group financial statements, 
state whether they have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU
• for the Parent Company financial 
statements, state whether applicable 
UK Accounting Standards, including FRS 
101 Reduced Disclosure Framework, have 
been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the 
parent company financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent company 
and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open 
to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, 
the directors are also responsible for 
preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ 
Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report 
and Corporate Governance Statement that 
complies with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
company’s website. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
The Directors confirm that to the best of 
their knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the applicable set of 
accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the Strategic Report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the issuer 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.
Disclosure of information to auditor
The Directors who held office at the date of 
approval of this Directors’ Report confirm 
that, so far as they are each aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of which 
the Company’s auditor is unaware; and 
each Director has taken all the steps that 
they ought to have taken as a Director to 
make themselves aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditor is aware 
of that information. 
Auditor
The Company’s auditor, Deloitte LLP, 
has indicated a willingness to continue 
in office and resolutions to reappoint it 
and to authorise the Directors to fix its 
remuneration will be proposed at the Annual 
General Meeting.

Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 
and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice including Financial Reporting Standard 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements of Admiral Group plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) which comprise:
• the Consolidated and Parent Company Income Statements;
• the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Comprehensive Income;
• the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Financial Position;
• the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement;
• the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity;
• the related notes 1 to 12 to the group financial statements; and
• the related notes 1 to 9 to the Parent Company financial statements.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company 
financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard were not provided to the group or the parent company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independent Auditor’s Report 
86 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements: Independent Auditor’s Report Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
• Valuation of gross insurance claims reserves; and
• Revenue recognition – profit commission income
The key audit matters identified are the same as the prior year.
Materiality The materiality that we used in the current year was £20m which was determined on the basis of 5% of profit before tax.
Scoping We identified seven reporting components which we determined should be subjected to audits for group reporting 
purposes this year (2016: five reporting components were subjected to full scope audits).
Further specific audit procedures were completed in respect of two further components which, although not financially 
significant, did present some specific audit risks which needed to be addressed.
The components within the scope of our audit procedures account for 93% of the group’s profits and losses before tax 
(2016: 94%), 91% of revenue (2016: 87%) and 91% of the group’s net assets (2016: 95%). 
Significant changes  
in our approach
The main change in component scoping since 2016 is to subject the group’s two underwriting divisions in Italy to full 
scope audits. Whilst these divisions are not considered significant to the group as a whole in 2017, they do represent a 
significant portion of the group’s European underwriting activity and therefore we have determined that treating them 
in this way is the most appropriate approach.
Conclusions relating to going concern, principal risks and viability statement
Going concern
We have reviewed the directors’ statement in note 2 to the financial statements about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their 
identification of any material uncertainties to the group’s and company’s ability to continue to do so over a 
period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to that 
statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have 
nothing material to report, 
add or draw attention to in 
respect of these matters.
Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering whether they were consistent with the 
knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, including the knowledge obtained in the evaluation of  
the directors’ assessment of the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, we are 
required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the disclosures on pages 33 to 37 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being  
managed or mitigated;
• the directors' confirmation on page 33 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity; or
• the directors’ explanation on page 59 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what 
period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. 
We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement relating to the prospects of the group 
required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have 
nothing material to report, 
add or draw attention to in 
respect of these matters.
87 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of 
the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. 
These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and  
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The key audit matters identified this year are in line with those identified in the  
2016 audit.
Valuation of gross insurance claims reserves 
Key audit matter 
description
The group’s gross insurance claims reserves total £2,403m (2016 year-end: £2,031m). The judgements which are made by 
management in determining the total valuation of incurred claims reserves, including those claims which are incurred 
but not reported (“IBNR”) are by far the most significant, in terms of their impact on the group’s financial position. 
Setting these claims reserves is an inherently subjective exercise and small changes in underlying assumptions such as 
average frequency or average severity may have a material impact on the overall year end result reported. We therefore 
consider that this account balance contains potential fraud risks.
Specifically, our significant areas of focus are management’s assumptions underpinning the modelled frequency and 
severity of large bodily injury claims arising in the UK Car Insurance business. These particular claims result in higher 
individual claims reserves and are more judgemental, in terms of the development of the ultimate losses, due to the 
longer-term nature of the group’s exposure (compared to property damage claims). 
In line with the group's accounting policy, management adds a margin to the actuarial best estimate to arrive at the 
booked gross claims reserves. This margin reflects the inherent uncertainty in estimating the ultimate losses on 
claims, over and above that which can be projected actuarially based on underlying claims development data. This is a 
significant area of management judgement and, therefore, a focus of our audit. Specifically, the margin in the UK Car 
Insurance reserves, related to large bodily injury claims, is our key area of focus in respect of the margins included.
Refer to page 54 in the audit committee report where this is included as a significant issue and note 5d and note 3 in  
the financial statements which refer to this matter.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to 
the key audit matter
We have assessed the design and implementation and tested the operating effectiveness of key controls relating to 
the key actuarial assumptions identified above and the setting of the reserve margin. This included testing controls 
concerning management and Audit Committee challenge of the external actuarial expert’s work and the appropriate 
governance oversight in respect of the key assumptions and margins determined.
We reviewed the reports from management’s external expert actuary and involved our own Deloitte actuarial experts 
to support our challenge of management’s key assumptions. We benchmarked assumptions relating to the severity and 
frequency of large bodily injury claims against available industry data and to peers where possible and appropriate. We 
also completed procedures to specifically assess the competence and objectivity of management’s expert in their role.
We challenged management's qualitative and quantitative justifications for the margin held over the actuarial best 
estimate through review of the accounting judgement papers produced, including involvement of Deloitte actuarial 
experts. Further, we analysed its consistency with previous reporting periods and challenged management's justification 
for the booked margin in relation to the uncertainty in the ultimate claims reserves.
Where there was a movement in the perceived level of prudence in the booked reserves, or a change in methodology, 
we assessed this against the applicable accounting standard (IFRS 4: Insurance Contracts). Where there was a change in 
methodology, we assessed this against IFRS 4 and IAS 8 (Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors).
Key observations Based on our procedures above, we consider the booked reserves remain appropriate and in line with the Group’s 
prudent accounting policy.

Financial Statements: Independent Auditor’s Report Revenue recognition – profit commission income 
Key audit matter 
description
The auditing standards prescribe that a risk of fraud in revenue recognition should be presumed for all trading groups 
and companies. We therefore performed an assessment of the group’s classes of revenue transactions to identify the 
areas where there was a potential for fraud through possible manipulation of this balance. 
In our view, the profit commission income earned by the group, which, on a consolidated basis, consists of amounts 
due from the group’s co-insurer of £64.7m (2016: £54.3m), represents a revenue class for which there is an incentive to 
fraudulently overstate the amounts recorded. Accordingly, we have determined that the accuracy of profit commission 
income due from the group’s co-insurance arrangement includes elements which constitute a significant risk of material 
misstatement for the group financial statements and therefore identified this as a key audit matter.
The risk is particularly acute where there have been changes to the terms of the profit commission arrangements or other 
one-off adjustments which therefore mean that the calculation to be performed is not uniform across all underwriting 
years – i.e. where the same underwriting result within two different periods could give rise to different levels of profit 
commissions for each because of variances in the applicable contracted terms. The accuracy of the calculation in respect 
of these changes is the specific risk area which we determined represents a significant risk of misstatement.
Refer to page 54 in the audit committee report where this is included as a significant issue, and note 5c and note 3 in  
the financial statements which refer to this matter.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to 
the key audit matter
We tested and were able to rely upon the key controls associated with changes in the calculation; which are controls 
designed to ensure that the inputs to the calculation are accurate and the review by management which is performed to 
check that the requisite changes have been reflected in the detailed calculation. 
Our substantive response constituted inspection of the applicable co-insurance contracts to evaluate the form and 
content of management’s calculation and a substantive analytical review. We developed an independent expectation of 
the commission income to recognise, based upon our understanding of the contracts and using the loss ratios audited as 
part of our insurance reserves testing, compared that to the output of management’s calculation and then investigated 
any differences.
Key observations Based on our procedures above, we considered the profit commission to be appropriately calculated.
89 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of 
a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent company financial statements
Materiality £20m (2016: £14m) £3.8m (2016: £3.1m)
Basis for determining 
materiality
5% of profit before tax (2016: 5%) 3% of net assets (2016: 3%)
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
We consider profit before tax to be the critical 
benchmark of the performance of the group and consider 
this benchmark to be suitable having compared to other 
benchmarks: our materiality equates to 1% of gross 
earned premium and 2% of equity (2016: 1% of gross 
earned premium and 2% of equity).
The parent company primarily exists as the holding 
company which carries investments in group subsidiaries 
and is the issuer of listed securities. We consider that net 
assets is the critical benchmark for the company.
to the Members of Admiral Group Plc
Independent Auditor’s Report continued
We set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in aggregate, uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceed the materiality for the financial statements as a whole. Group performance materiality was set at 70% of group 
materiality for the 2017 audit (2016: 70%).
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £1m (2016: £700k) for the 
group and £189k (2016: £155k) for the parent company, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation 
of the financial statements.

Financial Statements: Independent Auditor’s Report An overview of the scope of our audit
The financially significant components of the group which were identified in our audit planning are the UK branches of Admiral Insurance 
(Gibraltar) Limited, Admiral Insurance Company Limited, EUI Limited and Inspop.com Limited, and the Admiral Group plc parent entity itself. 
In 2016, we also identified five significant reporting components. Each of these components was subjected to a full-scope audit for group 
reporting purposes, completed to individual component materiality levels which ranged from £1.1m to £12.4m (2016: £660,000 to £11.8m), 
dependent upon the relative significance of each individual component.
The two further group components which were subject to full scope audit engagements this year were the Italian branches of Admiral 
Insurance Company Limited and Admiral Insurance (Gibraltar) Limited, each audited to a component materiality of £1.6m. Combined, they 
contribute the majority of the European insurance segment’s results and represent 7% of the group’s gross earned premium and 7% of the 
gross insurance reserves reported. The change in scope since 2016 represents the growing significance of the Italian business to the group’s 
global underwriting activities.
Additionally, we have completed specific audit procedures, designed to address specific audit risks, for Elephant Insurance Company, a 
subsidiary company incorporated in the USA, and the Spanish branch of Admiral Insurance Company Limited.
Inspop USA LLC was included in the scope of our specified audit procedures in 2016 but not for the 2017 audit, as we determined that the 
subsidiary no longer presents any specific audit risks to the group financial statements. Conversely, the Spanish branch of Admiral Insurance 
Company Limited was brought into the scope of these specified procedures for the first time in 2017, due to the specific audit risks which the 
branch presents to the underwriting subsidiary. This change in scope also reflects the growing contribution of the group’s insurance activities 
in Spain.
We engaged local component auditors, being Deloitte member firms in the USA, Italy and Spain, to perform the audit work and specified audit 
procedures in these respective territories on our behalf. We directed and supervised the work of the component auditors, including through 
visits to the components and component auditors in Rome, Seville and Richmond and remote communication and review of their work.
For the remaining components, which were not subject to audit or specified audit procedures, we performed analysis at an aggregated group 
level to re-assess our evaluation that there were no significant risks of material misstatement presented by any of these components. The 
components within the scope of our audit procedures account for 93% of the group’s profits and losses before tax, 92% of revenue and 92%  
of the group’s net assets (2016: 94% of profits and losses before tax, 87% of revenue and 95% of net assets).

Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in 
the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether 
there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, 
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we 
are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material misstatements of the 
other information include where we conclude that:
• Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the directors that they consider the annual report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the group’s position and performance, business model and strategy, is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
• Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the audit committee does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the directors’ statement 
required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly 
disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to 
report in respect of 
these matters
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary  
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors 
either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Financial Statements: Independent Auditor’s Report Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies  
Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and of the parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit 
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in 
respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration have not been made or the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited is not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in 
respect of these matters.
Other matters
Auditor tenure
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed by shareholders’ approval at the Annual General Meeting

of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments of the firm is 2 years, covering the years ending 
31 December 2016 to 31 December 2017.
Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the audit committee
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee we are required to provide in accordance with ISAs (UK).

Financial Statements: Consolidated statement of changes in equity For the year ended 31 December 2017
Notes to the financial statements
1. General information
Admiral Group plc is a company incorporated in England and Wales.  
Its registered office is at Tŷ Admiral, David Street, Cardiff, CF10 2EH 
and its shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and 
approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU). 
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101).
Adoption of new and revised standards
The Group has adopted the following IFRSs and interpretations  
during the year, which have been issued and endorsed by the EU:
• Amendments to IAS 7 (Disclosure Initiative) and IAS 12 
(Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses).
The application of these amendments has not had a material  
impact on the Group’s results, financial position and cash flows.
As at 31 December 2017, the following standards had been endorsed 
by the EU but are not yet effective: 
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective date 1 January 2018), 
along with Amendments to IFRS 4 Applying IFRS 9 Financial 
Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts;
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective  
date 1 January 2018);
• IFRS 16 Leases (effective date 1 January 2019).
IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments
In 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9. The standard 
has an effective date of 1 January 2018 although earlier application 
is permitted. The standard affects a number of areas within 
the accounts including the classification and measurement of 
financial instruments, and a requirement to use the expected loss 
impairment model.
In 2017 the Group conducted an assessment of the impact of IFRS 9 
and based on current information expects no significant impact on 
its balance sheet and equity, with the significant classes of financial 
assets being accounted for using the same measurement and 
valuation techniques as those currently used. 
There is an impact of applying the expected loss model for the first 
time, with the application of IFRS 9 resulting in earlier impairment 
charges and the potential for increased volatility. This impact has 
been assessed and is currently immaterial, at less than £0.5 million  
as at 31 December 2017.
The Group plans to adopt IFRS 9 as of 1 January 2018, in line with its 
effective date.
IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 was issued during 2014, with clarifications to the standard 
endorsed on 31 October 2017, and will be effective for Admiral 
on 1 January 2018. The standard introduces a simple, five step 
principles-based model to be applied to the accounting of all 
contracts with customers. Revenue from insurance contracts and 
financial instruments is outside the scope of IFRS 15. 
During 2017, the Group performed an assessment of the impact of the 
standard on its revenue streams, quantifying this impact on its results, 
financial position and cash-flows. The primary area of focus of this 
work was the other revenue generated by a portfolio of products that 
supplement the core car and household insurance policies and revenue 
generated by the Group’s price comparison businesses, where the new 
standard could potentially result in a delay in revenue recognition. 
Management’s assessment, based on the work performed, is that the 
implementation of the standard is not expected to have a material 
impact on the Group’s financial statements, with the majority of 
material revenue classes not being impacted. 
The Group is planning on using the modified retrospective approach 
on transition, which will result in a cumulative adjustment to retained 
earnings as at 1 January 2018. The impact on the Consolidated income 
statement in future periods is expected to be immaterial.
IFRS 16 – Leases
IFRS 16 Leases was issued in early 2016 and is effective from 1 January 
2019. The standard specifies how firms will recognise, measure, 
present and disclose leases. It presents a single lessee accounting 
model and requires that assets and liabilities to be recognised in the 
Consolidated statement of financial position, other than in the cases 
where leases are of low value or of a short-term nature of 12 months 
or less.
The Group expects to apply the modified retrospective approach 
to transition that is permitted under IFRS 16. Impact assessments 
performed to date conclude that:
–  Property leases represent the most significant class of lease held 
by the Group that will be impacted by the new standard. 
–  No significant adjustment to IFRS equity is expected at the 
transition date of 1 January 2019.
–  The presentation of the Consolidated statement of financial 
position is expected to be significantly impacted, with material 
lease liabilities and ‘Right of Use’ assets being included for the 
first time. 
The profile of lease related expense recognised in the Consolidated 
income statement is not expected to change materially.

Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction Notes to the Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2017
1. General information continued
Standards yet to be endorsed by the EU
There are a number of standards, amendments to standards and 
interpretations that were issued by 31 December 2017 but have 
either yet to be endorsed by the EU, or were endorsed shortly after 
the year end. The following IFRSs have been issued but have not been 
applied by the Group in these financial statements:
• IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts
• IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Considerations
• IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
• Annual improvements to IFRS standard 2014–2016 cycle
• Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of  
Share-based payment transactions.
IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts
IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts was issued in May 2017. The standard 
will replace IFRS 4, establishing new principles for the recognition, 
measurement, presentation and disclosure of Insurance contracts 
within the scope of the standard. The standard will apply to reporting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021. 
The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 17 on its results 
and financial position, along with any impacts of the other standards 
and amendments which have yet to be endorsed.
2. Basis of preparation
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis. In 
considering this requirement, the Directors have taken into account 
the following:
• The Group’s projections for the next 12 months and beyond, in 
particular the profit forecasts, regulatory capital surpluses and 
levels and sources of liquidity.
• The risks included on the Group’s risk register that could impact 
on the Group’s financial performance, levels of liquidity and 
solvency over the next 12 months.
• The risks on the Group’s risk register that could be a threat to  
the Group’s business model and capital adequacy.
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position are set 
out in the Strategic Report. The Strategic Report also includes the 
Group’s principal risks and uncertainties. In addition, the Governance 
report includes the Directors’ statement on the viability of the Group 
over a three year period.
Following consideration of the above, the Directors have reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operation for the foreseeable future, a period not less than 
12 months from the date of this report, and that it is therefore 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements. 
Further information regarding the Company’s business activities, 
together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position, is set out in the Strategic Report. Further 
information regarding the financial position of the Company, its cash 
flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are also described 
in the Strategic Report. In addition, notes 6 and 11 to the financial 
statements include the Company’s objectives, policies and processes 
for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; 
details of its financial instruments; and its exposures to credit risk 
and liquidity risk.
The accounting policies set out in the notes to the financial 
statements have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently 
to all periods presented in these Group financial statements. 
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, 
except for the revaluation of financial assets classified as fair value 
through profit or loss or as available for sale. The Group and Company 
financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, rounded to 
the nearest £0.1 million.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls 
an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns 
from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect 
those returns through its power over the entity. In assessing control, 
the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are 
currently exercisable. The acquisition date is the date on which 
control is transferred to the acquirer. The financial statements of 
subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements 
from the date that control commences until the date that control 
ceases. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a 
subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing 
so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted 
IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates 
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and 
various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the 
judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not 
readily apparent from other sources. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the year in which the estimate is reviewed. To the extent that a 
change in an accounting estimate gives rise to changes in assets and 
liabilities, it is recognised by adjusting the carrying amount of the 
related asset or liability in the period of the change.

Financial Statements: Notes to the Financial Statements 3. Critical accounting judgements and estimates
Judgements
In applying the Group’s accounting policies as described in the notes 
to the financial statements, management has primarily applied 
judgement in the following area:
• Classification of the Group’s contracts with reinsurers as 
reinsurance contracts:
A contract is required to transfer significant insurance risk in order to 
be classified as such. Management reviews all terms and conditions 
of each such contract, and if necessary obtains the opinion of an 
independent expert at the negotiation stage in order to be able to 
make this judgement. All reinsurance contracts (both excess of loss 
and quota share contracts) held by the Group have been assessed 
and it has been concluded that all contracts transfer significant 
insurance risk and have therefore been classified and accounted for 
as reinsurance contracts within these financial statements. 
In addition there are two further significant accounting estimates 
within the financial statements that also require management to 
apply judgement: 
• Calculation of insurance claims reserves:
The Group’s reserving methodology requires management to 
set insurance claims reserves for the purpose of the financial 
statements, above the projected best estimate outcome, to allow 
for unforeseen adverse claims development. Management applies 
judgement in determining where, above the projected best estimate 
outcome, the insurance claims reserves should sit in line with the 
Group's reserving methodology. Refer to the section on estimation 
techniques below. Above the projected best estimate outcome the 
insurance claims reserves should sit, in line with the Group’s reserving 
methodology. Refer to the section on estimation techniques below, 
and the analysis of Insurance risk in note 5 to the financial statements 
for further detail on the development of the Group’s reserving 
methodology applied during the period and the calculation of the 
projected best estimate outcome.
• Recognition of deferred tax assets relating to unused tax losses: 
Management applies judgement in determining the probability 
of future taxable profits of an entity against which to utilise 
accumulated losses in determining the recognition of deferred 
tax assets. In applying this judgement, management makes an 
assessment of the reliability of approved business plan projections 
using both qualitative and quantitative factors including the 
age and status of the business, the Group’s previous experience 
in similar markets, historic performance against business plans 
and the application of a number of stress and sensitivity tests to 
the projections. 
Estimation techniques used in calculation of claims 
provisions and profit commission
Estimation techniques are used in the calculation of the provisions 
for claims outstanding, which represent a projection of the ultimate 
cost of settling claims that have occurred prior to the balance sheet 
date and remain unsettled at the balance sheet date.
The key area where these techniques are used relates to the ultimate 
cost of reported claims. A secondary area relates to the emergence 
of claims that occurred prior to the balance sheet date, but had not 
been reported at that date.
The estimates of the ultimate cost of reported claims are based on 
the setting of claim provisions on a case-by-case basis, for all but the 
simplest of claims.
The sum of these provisions is compared with projected ultimate 
costs using a variety of different projection techniques (including 
incurred and paid chain ladder and an average cost of claim approach) 
to allow an actuarial assessment of their potential outcome. They 
include allowance for unreported claims.
The most significant sensitivity in the use of the projection 
techniques arises from any future step change in claims costs, 
which would cause future claim cost inflation to deviate from 
historic trends. This is most likely to arise from a change in the 
regulatory or judicial regime that leads to an increase in awards 
or legal costs for bodily injury claims that is significantly above or 
below the historical trend.
The Group’s independent actuarial advisors project best estimate 
claims reserves using a variety of recognised actuarial techniques. 
The Group’s reserving policy requires management to reserve above 
the projected best estimate outcome, to allow for unforeseen 
adverse claims development. The Group’s reserving methodology 
which determines the basis for setting this reserve estimate has been 
developed and enhanced in the period in line with new information 
that has become available in relation to both the projected best 
estimate reserve and the reserve uncertainty through the Group’s 
development of its internal capital model. 
For further detail on objectives, policies and procedures for 
managing insurance risk, refer to note 5 of the financial statements.
Future changes in claims reserves also impact profit commission 
income, as the measurement of this income is dependent on the 
loss ratio booked in the financial statements, and cash receivable is 
dependent on actuarial projections of ultimate loss ratios.

For the year ended 31 December 2017
4. Group consolidation and operating segments
4a. Accounting policies
(i) Group consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the results and 
balances of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to 
as the Group) for the year ended 31 December 2017 and comparative 
figures for the year ended 31 December 2016. The financial statements 
of the Company’s subsidiaries are consolidated in the Group financial 
statements. The Company controls 100% of the voting share capital 
of all its principal subsidiaries, except Admiral Law Limited, BDE Law 
Limited, Inspop USA LLC, the indirect holding in comparenow.com 
Insurance Agency LLC, Rastreator.com Limited, the indirect holding in 
Comparaseguros Correduría de Seguros, S.L., Sociedad Unipersonal, 
Preminen Price Comparison Holdings Limited and the indirect holding 
in Preminen Dragon Price Comparison Limited. 
The Parent Company financial statements present information  
about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.  
In accordance with IAS 24, transactions or balances between  
Group companies that have been eliminated on consolidation are  
not reported as related party transactions in the consolidated 
financial statements.
(ii) Foreign currency translation
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s 
entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds 
sterling, rounded to the nearest £0.1 million, which is the Group’s 
presentation currency. 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the 
settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end 
exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary items measured at cost are translated at their historic 
rate and non-monetary items held at fair value are translated using the 
foreign exchange rate on the date that the fair value was established.
The financial statements of foreign operations whose functional 
currency is not pounds sterling are translated into the Group 
presentation currency (sterling) as follows:
• Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are 
translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet.
• Income and expenses for each income statement are translated 
at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable 
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing 
on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are 
translated at the date of the transaction).
• All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and in a separate component of equity 
except to the extent that the translation differences are 
attributable to non-controlling interests.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount 
recognised in equity relating to that particular operation is 
recognised in the income statement.
4b. Segment reporting
The Group has four reportable segments, as described below. These 
segments represent the principal split of business that is regularly 
reported to the Group’s Board of Directors, which is considered to 
be the Group’s chief operating decision maker in line with IFRS 8 
Operating Segments. 
During the period, the Group launched a UK Van Insurance product 
that is included within the UK Insurance segment. The results 
from the Group’s commercial van broker Gladiator continue to be 
presented within the ‘Other’ segment. 
UK Insurance
The segment consists of the underwriting of car insurance, van 
insurance, household insurance and other products that supplement 
these insurance policies within the UK. It also includes the generation 
of revenue from additional products and fees from underwriting 
insurance in the UK. The Directors consider the results of these 
activities to be reportable as one segment as the activities carried 
out in generating the revenue are not independent of each other and 
are performed as one business. This mirrors the approach taken in 
management reporting.
International Car Insurance
The segment consists of the underwriting of car insurance and 
the generation of revenue from additional products and fees from 
underwriting car insurance outside of the UK. It specifically covers 
the Group operations Admiral Seguros in Spain, ConTe in Italy, L’olivier 
– assurance auto in France and Elephant Auto in the US. None of 
these operations are reportable on an individual basis, based on the 
threshold requirements in IFRS 8.
Price Comparison
The segment relates to the Group’s price comparison businesses: 
Confused.com in the UK, Rastreator in Spain, LeLynx in France and 
Compare.com in the US. Each of the price comparison businesses are 
operating in individual geographical segments but are grouped into 
one reporting segment as Rastreator, LeLynx and Compare.com do 
not individually meet the threshold requirements in IFRS 8.
Other
The ‘Other’ segment is designed to be comprised of all other 
operating segments that do not meet the threshold requirements for 
individual reporting. It includes the Group’s commercial van insurance 
broker, Gladiator.
Taxes are not allocated across the segments and, as with the 
corporate activities, are included in the reconciliation to the 
Consolidated income statement and Consolidated statement of 
financial position.
An analysis of the Group’s revenue and results for the year ended 
31 December 2017, by reportable segment, is shown below. The 
accounting policies of the reportable segments are consistent 
with those presented in the notes to the financial statements for 
the Group.

Segment revenues
The UK and International Car Insurance reportable segments derive all insurance premium income from external policyholders. Revenue within 
these segments is not derived from an individual policyholder that represents 10% or more of the Group’s total revenue.
The total of Price Comparison revenues from transactions with other reportable segments is £19.8 million (2016: £20.8 million) which has 
been eliminated on consolidation. There are no other transactions between reportable segments.
Revenues from external customers for products and services are consistent with the split of reportable segment revenues as shown on 
page 103.
Information about geographical locations
All material revenues from external customers, and net assets attributed to a foreign country, are shown within the International Car 
Insurance reportable segment shown on the previous pages. The revenue and results of the three international Price Comparison businesses, 
Rastreator, LeLynx and Compare.com are not yet material enough to be presented as a separate segment.

There is an asymmetrical allocation of assets and income to the reportable segments, in that the interest earned on cash and cash equivalent 
assets deployed in the UK Insurance, Price Comparison and International Car Insurance segments is not allocated in arriving at segment 
profits. This is consistent with regular reporting to the Board of Directors. 
Eliminations represent inter-segment funding and balances included in insurance and other receivables.

5. Premium, claims and profit commissions 
5a. Accounting policies
(i) Revenue – premiums
Premiums relating to insurance contracts are recognised as revenue, net of insurance premium tax, proportionally over the period of cover. 
Premiums with an inception date after the end of the period are held in the statement of financial position as deferred revenue. Outstanding 
collections from policyholders are recognised within policyholder receivables.
(ii) Revenue – profit commission
Under some of the co-insurance and reinsurance contracts under which motor premiums are shared or ceded, profit commission may be 
earned on a particular year of account, which is usually subject to performance criteria such as loss ratios and expense ratios. The commission 
is dependent on the ultimate outcome of any year, with revenue being recognised when loss and expense ratios used in the preparation of the 
financial statements move below a contractual threshold. Profit commission receivable from reinsurance contracts is accounted for in line 
with IFRS 4, whereas profit commission receivable from co-insurance contracts is in line with IAS 18.

5. Premium, claims and profit commissions continued
5a. Accounting policies continued
(iii) Insurance contracts and reinsurance assets
Premiums
The proportion of premium receivable on in-force policies relating to unexpired risks is reported in insurance contract liabilities and 
reinsurance assets as the unearned premium provision – gross and reinsurers’ share respectively. 
Claims
Claims and claims handling expenses are charged as incurred, based on the estimated direct and indirect costs of settling all liabilities arising 
on events occurring up to the balance sheet date. 
The provision for claims outstanding comprises provisions for the estimated cost of settling all claims incurred but unpaid at the balance 
sheet date, whether reported or not. Anticipated reinsurance recoveries are disclosed separately as assets.
Whilst the Directors consider that the gross provisions for claims and the related reinsurance recoveries are fairly stated on the basis of the 
information currently available to them, the ultimate liability will vary as a result of subsequent information and events and may result in 
significant adjustments to the amounts provided. 
Adjustments to the amounts of claims provisions established in prior years are reflected in the income statement for the period in which the 
adjustments are made and disclosed separately if material. The methods used, and the estimates made, are reviewed regularly.
Provision for unexpired risks is made where necessary for the estimated amount required over and above unearned premiums (net of deferred 
acquisition costs) to meet future claims and related expenses. 
Co-insurance
The Group has entered into certain co-insurance contracts under which insurance risks are shared on a proportional basis, with the co-insurer 
taking a specific percentage of premium written and being responsible for the same proportion of each claim. The co-insurer therefore 
takes direct insurance risk from the policyholder and is subsequently directly responsible to the claimant for its proportion of the claim. 
As the contractual liability is several and not joint, neither the premiums nor claims relating to the co-insurance are included in the income 
statement. Under the terms of these agreements the co-insurers reimburse the Group for the same proportionate share of the costs of 
acquiring and administering the business.
Reinsurance assets
Contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers under which the Group is compensated for losses on the insurance contracts issued by the 
Group are classified as reinsurance contracts. A contract is only accounted for as a reinsurance contract where there is significant insurance 
risk transfer between the insured and the insurer. 
Reinsurance assets are comprised of balances due from reinsurance companies for ceded insurance liabilities. Amounts recoverable from 
reinsurers are estimated in a consistent manner with the outstanding claims provisions or settled claims associated with the reinsured policies 
and in accordance with the relevant reinsurance contract. 
The Group assesses its reinsurance assets for impairment on a regular basis, and in detail every six months. If there is objective evidence that 
the asset is impaired, then the carrying value will be written down to its recoverable amount.
On the commutation of reinsurance contracts, the reinsurer is discharged from all obligations relating to the contract. Reinsurance assets and 
liabilities relating to the commuted contracts are settled in the period in which the commutation agreement is signed.

5d. Reinsurance assets and insurance contract liabilities 
(i) Objectives, policies and procedures for the management of insurance risk
The Group’s primary business is the issuance of insurance contracts that transfer risk from policyholders to the Group and its co- 
insurance partners. 
Insurance risk involves uncertainty over the occurrence, amount or timing of claims arising on insurance contracts issued. It is primarily 
comprised of Reserve risk; the risk that the value of insurance liabilities established is insufficient to cover the ultimate cost of claims  
incurred at the balance sheet date, and Premium risk; the risk that the claims experience on business written but not earned is higher than 
allowed for in the premiums charged to policyholders. 
The Board of Directors is responsible for the management of insurance risk, although as mentioned in note 6, it has delegated the detailed 
oversight of risk management to the Group Risk Committee.
The Group also has a Reserving Committee which comprises senior managers within the finance, claims, pricing and actuarial functions. The 
Reserving Committee primarily recommends the approach for UK Car Insurance reserving but also reviews the systems and controls in place 
to support accurate reserving and material reserving issues such as Periodic Payment Order (PPO) and claims inflation, which represent the 
key uncertainties in the amount or timing of claims settlements. 
The Board implements certain policies in order to mitigate and control the level of insurance risk accepted by the Group. These 
include pricing policies and claims management and administration processes, in addition to reserving policies and co- and reinsurance 
arrangements as detailed below.

For the year ended 31 December 2017
5. Premium, claims and profit commissions continued 
5d. Reinsurance assets and insurance contract liabilities continued 
Reserve Risk
Reserving risk is mitigated through a series of processes and controls. The key processes are as follows:
• Regular management and internal actuarial review of individual and aggregate case claim reserves, including regular reporting of 
management information and exception reporting of significant movements
• Regular management and internal actuarial review of large claims, including claims settled or potentially settled by PPOs for which the 
uncertainty is increased by factors such as the lifetime of the claimant and movements in the indexation for the cost of future care of the 
claimant;
• Bi-annual external actuarial review of best estimate claims reserves using a variety of recognised actuarial techniques
• Internal actuarial analysis of reserve uncertainty through qualitative analysis, scenario testing and a range of stochastic reserving techniques
• Ad hoc external reviews of reserving related processes and assumptions
• Use of a reserving methodology which informs management’s reserving decisions for the purposes of the Group’s financial statements. 
As described in note 3, critical accounting judgements and estimates, the methodology determines that reserves should be set within a 
range above projected best estimate outcomes to allow for unforeseen adverse claims development.
As noted above, the Group shares a significant amount of the motor insurance business generated with external underwriters. As well as these 
proportional arrangements, an excess of loss reinsurance programme is also purchased to protect the Group against very large individual 
claims and catastrophe losses.
Claims reserving
As previously disclosed, Admiral’s reserving policy (both within the claims function and in the financial statements) is initially to reserve 
conservatively, above internal and independent projections of actuarial best estimates. This is designed to create a margin held in reserves 
to allow for unforeseen adverse development in open claims and typically results in Admiral making above industry average reserve releases. 
Admiral’s booked claims reserves continue to include a significant margin above projected best estimates of ultimate claims costs. 
Admiral continues to develop and enhance its methodology in setting the margin held above actuarial best estimates. A wide range of factors 
inform management’s recommendation which is subject to approval from the Group’s Reserving and Audit Committees, including:
• Reserve KPIs such as the level of margin as a percentage of the ultimate reserve 
• Results of stress testing of key assumptions underpinning key actuarial assumptions within best estimate reserves
• A review of a number of individual and aggregated reserve scenarios which may result in future adverse variance to the ultimate best 
estimate reserve
• Qualitative assessment of the level of uncertainty and volatility within the reserves and the change in that assessment compared to 
previous periods. 
In addition, the internal reserve risk distribution is used to determine the approximate confidence level of the recommended booked reserve 
position which enables comparison of the reserve strength to previous periods and demonstration of the compliance with IFRS 4. 
As at 31 December 2017, the level of reserve margin is lower than at 31 December 2016, although remains very prudent when measured 
against the internal reserve risk distribution and other market benchmarks. The reduction in the level of reserve margin since 2016 is partly 
due to the increased level of confidence over the impact of the Ogden rate change to -0.75%. 
As profit commission income is recognised in the income statement in line with loss ratios accounted for on Admiral’s own claims reserves, the 
reserving policy also results in profit commission income being deferred and recognised over time.
Premium Risk
As noted above, the Group defines Premium risk as the risk that claims cost on business written but not yet earned is higher than allowed  
for in the premiums charged to policyholders. This also includes catastrophe risk; the risk of incurring significant losses as a result of the 
occurrence of man-made catastrophe or natural weather events. 
Key processes and controls operating to mitigate premium risk are as follows:
• Experienced and focused senior management and teams in relevant business areas including pricing and claims management
• A data-driven and analytical approach to regular monitoring of claims and underwriting performance
• Capability to identify and resolve underperformance promptly through changes to key performance drivers, in particular pricing. 
108 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements: Notes to the Financial Statements In addition, as mentioned above, an excess of loss reinsurance programme is also purchased to protect the Group against very large individual 
claims and catastrophe losses. 
Other elements of insurance risk include reinsurance risk; the risk of placement of ineffective reinsurance arrangements, or the economic risk 
of reduced availability of co-insurance and reinsurance arrangements in future periods. 
The Group mitigates these risks by ensuring that it has a diverse range of financially secure reinsurance partners, including a long-term 
relationship with Munich Re and a number of other high profile reinsurers. 
Concentration of insurance risk
The Directors do not believe there are significant concentrations of insurance risk. This is because, although the Group has historically 
written only one significant line of UK insurance business, the risks are spread across a large number of people and a wide regional base. 
The introduction of the international car insurance businesses in recent years and the launch of UK household business in 2012 will further 
contribute to the diversification of the Group’s insurance risk as these businesses grow.
(ii) Sensitivity of recognised amounts to changes in assumptions
Ogden discount rate
As noted above, the gross and reinsurers share of insurance liabilities in these financial statements are prepared on the basis of an Ogden 
discount rate of minus 0.75%. On 7 September 2017, the Lord Chancellor announced draft legislation to change the way in which the Ogden 
discount rate is set, with initial indications being that the new discount rate could be set between 0% and 1%. 
The sensitivity of a change in this assumption by 75 basis points (both an increase and decrease) is shown in the table below. The impact is 
presented is the total impact of the change on the Group’s pre-tax profit on an ultimate basis. It should be noted that not all of the ultimate 
impact would necessarily be recognised immediately.
2017 
Net
£m
2016 
Net 
£m
Impact of increase in assumed Ogden discount rate of 75 basis points (to 0%) 85.6 68.7
Impact of decrease in assumed Ogden discount rate of 75 basis points (to minus 1.5%) (142.7) (102.1)
The impacts are stated net of co-insurance reinsurance and include the impact on net insurance claims along with the associated profit 
commission movements that result from the change in the Ogden rate. 
Underwriting year loss ratios – UK Car Insurance
In addition to the sensitivity above, the following table sets out the impact on equity and post-tax profit or loss at 31 December 2017 that 
would result from a 1% movement (both increase and decrease) in the UK Car Insurance loss ratios used for each underwriting year for which 
material amounts remain outstanding. 
Underwriting year

Booked loss ratio 81% 83% 84% 87%
Impact of 1% change (£m) 6.9 5.8 3.5 1.8
As above, the impact is stated net of reinsurance and includes the change in net insurance claims along with the associated profit commission 
movements that result from changes in loss ratios. The figures are stated net of tax at the current rate.

6. Investments
6a. Accounting policies
(i) Investment income and finance costs
Investment income from financial assets comprises distributions as well as net realised and unrealised gains on financial assets classified as 
‘fair value through profit or loss’ (FVTPL), interest income and net realised gains from assets classified as ‘available for sale’ (AFS), and interest 
income on holdings in deposits and gilts.
Finance costs from financial liabilities comprise interest expense on subordinated notes, calculated on the effective interest rate method.  
The effective interest rate method calculates the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability (or group of financial assets or financial 
liabilities) and allocates the interest income or expense over the expected life of the asset or liability.
(ii) Financial assets – investments and receivables
Initial recognition
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at FVTPL, AFS assets, loans and receivables or held to 
maturity investments.
At initial recognition assets are recognised at fair value and classified according to the purpose for which they were acquired. 
The Group’s investments in investment funds are designated as FVTPL at inception. 
This designation is permitted under IAS 39, as the investments in money market funds are managed as a group of assets and internal 
performance evaluation of this group is conducted on a fair value basis. 
The Group’s holdings in Fixed Income and Asset Backed Securities are classified as AFS investments, which is consistent with the intention for 
which they were purchased. 
Government gilts are also classified as AFS investments, in line with IAS 39, due to a reclassification in the period following the disposal of a 
portion of the holding. 
Deposits held with credit institutions are classified as loans and receivables, in line with the nature of these deposits, with 2016 comparatives 
restated to reflect this more appropriate classification of these assets.
Transaction costs associated with the purchase of all financial assets are expensed within the income statement as incurred.

For the year ended 31 December 2017
6. Investments continued
6a. Accounting policies continued 
Subsequent measurement
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant realised or unrealised gain or loss recognised through the income statement.
Investments classified as available for sale are stated at fair value. Unrealised changes in the fair value of these assets are recognised in Other 
Comprehensive Income (OCI). Interest income is recognised within profit or loss using the effective interest rate method. 
Loans and receivables are stated at their amortised cost less impairment using the effective interest method. Impairment losses are recognised 
through the income statement.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether any financial assets or groups of financial assets held at fair value or amortised cost 
are impaired. Financial assets are impaired where there is evidence that one or more events occurring after the initial recognition of the asset, 
may lead to a reduction in the estimated future cash flows arising from the asset. 
Objective evidence of impairment may include default on cash flows due from the asset and reported financial difficulty of the issuer or 
counterparty. 
Identified impairments of financial assets are recognised in the income statement, except in the case of assets classified as AFS where 
unrealised gains have been recognised through OCI. In this instance, impairments of the asset are first set against the unrealised gain in OCI 
with any excess being recognised in the income statement. 
De-recognition of financial assets
A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from that asset have expired, or when the Group transfers the asset and 
all the attached substantial risks and rewards relating to the asset to a third party.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term deposits with original maturities of 
three months or less. All cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortised cost. 
(iii) Financial liabilities
Initial recognition
The Group’s financial liabilities comprise subordinated notes and other financial liabilities initially recognised at fair value received, net of 
transaction costs incurred. 
Subsequent measurement
Subsequent measurement is at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Movements in the amortised cost are recognised through 
the income statement.
De-recognition of financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under that liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
(iv) Fair value measurement of assets held at amortised cost
The fair value of gilts and subordinated notes held at amortised cost is calculated with reference to quoted market valuations. See note 6d for 
a comparison of fair value and carrying value at the statement of financial position date.
The Group’s deposits are held with well rated institutions; as such the fair value approximates to the book value of the investment based on 
the interest rates of the instruments, credit risk movements and durations of the assets. The amortised cost carrying amount of receivables is 
a reasonable approximation of fair value.

*1  2016 comparatives have been restated to present deposits held with credit institutions as loans and receivables, as this is considered to be a more appropriate classification of 
these assets. 
Financial liabilities are inclusive of £200 million subordinated notes issued on 25 July 2014 at a fixed rate of 5.5% with a redemption date of 
25 July 2024. 
The notes are unsecured subordinated obligations of the Group and rank pari passu without any preference among themselves. In the event of 
a winding-up or bankruptcy, they are to be repaid only after the claims of all other creditors have been met.
There have been no defaults on any of the notes during the year. The Group has the option to defer interest payments on the notes but to date 
has not exercised this right. The aggregate fair value of subordinated dated notes at the balance sheet date is disclosed in the table below.
The Group holds two revolving credit facilities of £100 million each. As at 31 December 2017, £20 million (2016: £20 million) was drawn under 
these agreements as shown within other borrowings in the table above.

Financial Statements: Notes to the Financial Statements Fair value measurement
The measurement of investments at the end of the period, for the majority of investments held at fair value and those classified as available 
for sale, is based on active quoted market values (level one). An immaterial amount of investments held at fair value are measured at level 
three of the fair value hierarchy. No further information is provided due to the immateriality of the balance at 31 December 2017. 
Deposits are held with well rated institutions; as such the approximate fair value is the book value of the investment as impairment of the 
capital is not expected. There is no quoted market for these holdings and as such a level two valuation is used. The book value of deposits is 
£130.0 million (2016: £170.0 million).
The amortised cost carrying amount of receivables is a reasonable approximation of fair value. 
The fair value of subordinated notes (level one valuation) at 31 December 2017 is £229.2 million (2016: £212.9 million).

Objectives, policies and procedures for managing financial assets and liabilities
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to financial risks of credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign exchange risk. The Board 
of Directors has delegated the task of supervising risk management and internal control to the Group Risk Committee. There is also an 
Investment Committee that makes recommendations to the Board on the Group’s investment strategy. 
There are several key elements to the risk management environment throughout the Group. These are detailed in full in the Corporate 
Governance Statement. Specific considerations for the risks arising from financial assets and liabilities are detailed below. 
Credit risk
The Group defines credit risk as the risk of loss if another party fails to perform its obligations. The key areas of exposure to credit risk for the 
Group result through its reinsurance programme, investments, bank deposits and policyholder receivables. 
The Directors consider counterparty exposure frequently and in significant detail. The Directors consider that the policies and procedures in 
place to manage credit exposure continue to be appropriate for the Group’s risk appetite and, during 2017 and historically, no material credit 
losses have been experienced by the Group.
There are no specific concentrations of credit risk with respect to investment counterparties due to the structure of the liquidity funds and 
the parameters set for managing the Fixed Income Mandates. Both forms of investment hold a wide range of very short duration, high quality 
securities. Cash balances and deposits are placed only with highly rated credit institutions. The detailed holdings are reviewed regularly by the 
Investment Committee. 
To mitigate the risk arising from exposure to reinsurers (in the form of reinsurance recoveries and profit commissions), the Group only 
conducts business with companies of appropriate financial strength ratings. In addition, many reinsurance contracts are operated on a funds 
withheld basis, which substantially reduces credit risk, as the Group withholds the cash received as collateral.
120 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements: Notes to the Financial Statements The other principal form of credit risk is in respect of amounts due from policyholders, largely due to the potential for default by instalment 
payers. The impact of this is mitigated by the large customer base and low average level of balance recoverable. There is also mitigation by 
the operation of numerous high- and low-level controls in this area, including payment on policy acceptance as opposed to inception and 
automated cancellation procedures for policies in default.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2017 is £3,723.8 million (2016: £3,263.0 million), being the carrying value of 
financial investments and cash, and the excess of reinsurance assets over amounts owed to reinsurers under funds withheld arrangements. 
The Group does not use credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate exposure. The amount of bad debt expense relating to 
policyholder debt charged to the income statement in 2017 and 2016 is insignificant. £1.0m was charged to the income statement in respect 
of loans and advances to customers.
There were no significant financial assets that were past due at the close of either 2017 or 2016.
The Group’s credit risk exposure to assets with external ratings is as follows:
Rating
31 December 2017 
£m
31 December 2016
 £m
Financial institutions – Credit institutions AAA 210.7 269.3

UK Government gilts AA 173.8 197.4
Reinsurers AA 355.7 295.6
Reinsurers A 256.4 141.6
Interest rate risk 
The Group considers interest rate risk to be the risk that unfavourable movements in interest rates could adversely impact on the capital 
values of financial assets and liabilities. 
As noted above, the Group invests the following asset types:
• Money market liquidity funds and cash plus liquidity funds, which in turn invest in a mixture of short dated fixed and variable rate 
securities, such as cash deposits, certificates of deposits, floating rate notes and other commercial paper. 
• Deposits with well rated institutions are short in duration (one to five years). These are classified as loans and receivables and valued at 
amortised cost. Therefore neither the carrying value of the asset, nor the interest return will be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates.
• Available for sale debt securities. These securities are held within two segregated mandates. The guidelines of the investments retain 
a similar credit quality of the investment funds (all holdings are investment grade). The duration of the securities is relatively short and 
similar to the duration of the on book claims liabilities (the average duration is three years).
• UK Government gilts. These are classified as available for sale due to a sale of a portion of the assets in 2017. 
The Group also holds a financial liability in the form of £200 million of subordinated notes with a ten year maturity and fixed rate coupon 
of 5.5%. This liability is valued at amortised cost and therefore neither the carrying value of the deposits, nor the interest payable, will be 
impacted by fluctuations in interest rates.
No sensitivity analysis to interest rates has been presented on the grounds of materiality.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group does not have sufficient, available financial resources to enable it to meet its obligations as 
they fall due, or can only secure them at excessive cost. 
The Group is strongly cash-generative due to the large proportion of revenue arising from non-underwriting activity. Further, as noted above, 
a significant portion of insurance funds are invested in money market liquidity funds with same day liquidity, meaning that a large proportion 
of the Group cash and investments is immediately available. 
A breakdown of the Group’s other financial liabilities, trade payables and other payables is shown in note 10. 
The subordinated notes have a ten year maturity whereas all trade and other payables will mature within three to six months of the balance 
sheet date. (Refer to the maturity profile at the start of this note for further detail.)
In practice, the Group’s Directors expect actual cash flows to be consistent with this maturity profile except for amounts owed to co-insurers 
and reinsurers. Of the total amounts owed to co-insurers and reinsurers of £1,157.5 million (2016: £938.0 million), £938.4 million (2016: £610.1 
million) is held under funds withheld arrangements and therefore not expected to be settled within 12 months.
A maturity analysis for insurance contract liabilities is included in note 5. The maturity profile for financial assets is included at the start of 
this note. 
The Group’s Directors believe that the cash flows arising from these assets will be consistent with this profile. Liquidity risk is not, therefore, 
considered to be significant.
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk arises from unfavourable movements in foreign exchange rates that could adversely impact the valuation of overseas 
assets and liabilities. 
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its operations overseas. Although the relative size of the international operations 
means that the risks are relatively small, increasingly volatile foreign exchange rates could result in larger potential gains or losses. Assets held 
to fund insurance liabilities are held in the currency of the liabilities; however, surplus assets held as regulatory capital in foreign currencies 
remain exposed. 
The Group’s exposure to net assets and profits in currencies other than the reporting currency is immaterial other than for US dollars.  
The Group’s exposure to net assets held in dollars at the balance sheet date was £55.1million (2016: £70.5 million). 
The loss before tax derived from business carried out in the US was £23.4 million (2016: £39.1 million). If the Sterling rates with US dollars  
had strengthened/weakened by 10%, the Group’s profit before tax for the year would increase/decrease by £2.2 million (2016: £3.6 million).
Fair value
For cash at bank and cash deposits and other receivables, the fair value approximates to the book value due to their short maturity. For assets 
held at fair value through profit and loss and AFS their value equates to level one (quoted prices in active markets) of the fair value hierarchy. 
For subordinated notes, the fair value is calculated with reference to the quoted market valuation. This is compared to carrying value earlier in 
this note.

7a. Accounting policy
(i) Contribution from additional products and fees and other revenue
Contribution from additional products and fees and other revenue includes revenue earned on the sale of products supplementing the core 
motor, van and household insurance policies, administration and other charges paid by the policyholder, referral fees, revenue from policies 
paid by instalments and vehicle commission charges paid by co- and reinsurers. Revenue is credited to the income statement over the period 
matching the Group’s obligations to provide services. Where the Group has no remaining contractual obligations, the revenue is recognised 
immediately. An allowance is made for expected cancellations where the customer may be entitled to a refund of amounts charged.
Commission from price comparison activities and broking commission earned by Gladiator is credited to revenue on the sale of the underlying 
insurance policy.

8. Expenses
8a. Accounting policies
(i) Acquisition costs and operating expenses
Acquisition costs incurred in obtaining new and renewal business are charged to the income statement over the period in which those 
premiums are earned. All other operating expenses are charged to the income statement in the period that they are incurred. 
(ii) Employee benefits
Pensions
The Group contributes to defined contribution personal pension plans for its employees. The contributions payable to these schemes are 
charged in the accounting period to which they relate.
Employee share schemes
The Group operates a number of equity and cash settled compensation schemes for its employees. The fair value of the employee services 
received in exchange for the grant of free shares under the equity settled schemes is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding 
increase in equity. For cash settled schemes, the fair value of services received are also recognised as an expense, with a corresponding 
increase in liability. 
For equity settled schemes, the total charge expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the free shares 
granted as determined at the grant date (excluding the impact of non-market vesting conditions). Non-market conditions such as profitability 
targets as well as staff attrition rates are included in assumptions over the number of free shares to vest under the applicable scheme. 
For cash settled schemes, the total charge expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the closing Admiral Group share 
price at the end of the period. Prior to the vesting of each scheme, the closing share price at the end of the reporting period is used as an 
approximation for the closing share price at the end of the vesting period. As with equity settled schemes, non-market vesting conditions also 
impact on the total charge expensed over the vesting period. 
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its assumptions on the number of shares to be granted with the impact of any change in the 
assumptions recognised through income.
Refer to note 8f for further details on share schemes.

(iii) Leases 
Operating leases
Leases which do not transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased items are classified as 
operating leases. The Group has entered into a number of non-cancellable operating lease arrangements for properties and other assets. The 
leases have varying terms, escalation values and renewal rights.
Operating lease payments, including the effects of any lease incentives, are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-
line basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

reported in note 8c (2017: £54.4 million; 2016: £50.3 million) and the gross credit to reserves reported in the Consolidated statement of 
changes in equity (2017: £37.9 million; 2016: £33.2 million).
The Consolidated cash flow statement also shows the gross charge in the reconciliation between ‘profit after tax’ and ‘cash flows from 
operating activities’. The co-insurance share of the charge is included in the change in trade and other payables line. 
(i) The Approved Share Incentive Plan (the SIP)
Eligible employees qualified for awards under the SIP based upon the performance of the Group in each half-year period. The maximum award 
for each year is £3,600 per employee. The awards are made with reference to the Group’s performance against prior year profit before tax. 
Employees must remain in employment for the holding period (three years from the date of award) otherwise the shares are forfeited. 
The fair value of shares awarded is the share price at the date of award. Awards under the SIP are entitled to receive dividends, and, hence, no 
adjustment has been made to this fair value. 
(ii) The Discretionary Free Share Scheme (the DFSS)
Under the DFSS, details of which are contained in the remuneration policy section of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, individuals receive 
an award of free shares at no charge. Staff must remain in employment until the vesting date in order to receive shares. The maximum number 
of shares that can vest relating to the 2017 scheme is 3,205,433 (2016 scheme: 3,247,136). 
The amount of 2017 award that actually vests is based on the growth in the Company’s earnings per share (EPS) relative to a risk free return 
(RFR), for which LIBOR has been selected as a benchmark. This performance is measured over the three year period the award applies to. For 
the 2017 scheme, 50% of the shares awarded at the start of the three year vesting period are subject to these performance conditions. 
126 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements: Notes to the Financial Statements The range of awards is as follows:
• If the growth in EPS is less than the RFR, no awards vest.
• EPS growth is equal to RFR – 10% of maximum award vests.
• To achieve the maximum award, EPS growth has to be 36 points higher than RFR over the three year period.
Between 10% and 100% of the maximum awards, a linear relationship exists.
For awards in 2016 and onwards there are now three performance conditions which the 50% not guaranteed to vest are subject to. These are 
three-year EPS growth vs. LIBOR, TSR vs. FTSE 350 (excluding investment companies), and ROE, weighted equally. 
Performance measure

ROE 25% 55%
Awards under the DFSS are not eligible for dividends (although a discretionary bonus is currently paid equivalent to the dividend that would 
have been paid on the respective shareholding) and hence the fair value of free shares to be awarded under this scheme has been revised 
downwards to take account of these distributions.

9. Taxation
9a. Accounting policy
Income tax on the profit or loss for the periods presented comprises current and deferred tax. 
(i) Current tax
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the balance sheet date, and includes any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods. 
Current tax related to items recognised in other comprehensive income is also recognised in other comprehensive income and not in the 
income statement.
(ii) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences arising between the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. It is calculated at the tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or 
the asset is realised.
The principal temporary differences arise from carried forward losses, depreciation of property and equipment and share scheme charges. 
The resulting deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except in relation to share scheme charges where the amount of 
tax benefit credited to the income statement is limited to an equivalent credit calculated on the accounting charge. Any excess is recognised 
directly in equity.
Deferred tax assets relating to carried forward losses are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be 
available against which the assets can be utilised. The probability of the availability of future taxable profits is determined by a combination 
of the classification of the status of the businesses holding cumulative tax losses and the business plan profit projections for that business, 
subject to appropriate stress testing.

Positive amounts presented above relate to a deferred tax asset position.
The UK corporation tax rate reduced from 20% to 19% on 1 April 2017. The average effective rate of tax for 2017 is 19.25% (2016: 20.00%). A 
further reduction to the main rate of corporation tax to 17% (effective from 1 April 2020) was enacted on 15 September 2016. This will reduce 
the Group’s future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax asset at 31 December 2017 has been calculated based on the rate at which each timing difference is most likely to reverse.
The deferred tax asset relating to carried forward losses of £13.9 million relates to losses incurred in the Group’s US price comparison business 
Compare.com, and is calculated at the local US rate of tax of 21% (2016: 35%). The recognised asset has been limited to the amount supported by 
forecast cash flows over the next five years. The forecasts and underlying assumptions have been reviewed and approved by the Board. In addition, 
the forecasts have been stressed for both revenue and profit reductions and the asset remains recoverable under the stressed scenarios.
At 31 December 2017 the Group had unused tax losses amounting to £166.1 million (2016: £142.7 million), relating to the Group’s US businesses 
Elephant Auto and Compare.com, for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.

10. Other assets and other liabilities
10a. Accounting policy
(i) Property and equipment, and depreciation
All property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method to write 
off the cost less residual values of the assets over their useful economic lives. These useful economic lives are as follows:
Improvements to short leasehold buildings – four to ten years 
Computer equipment   – two to four years 
Office equipment    – four years 
Furniture and fittings   – four years 
Motor vehicles    – four years
(ii) Impairment of property and equipment
In the case of property and equipment, carrying values are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there are any 
indications of impairment. If any such indications exist, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying value. 
The carrying value is the higher of the fair value of the asset less costs to sell, and the asset’s value in use. Impairment losses are recognised 
through the income statement.
(iii) Leased assets
The rental costs relating to assets held under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the life of  
the lease. 
Leases under the terms of which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classed as finance leases. Assets 
acquired under finance leases are included in property and equipment at fair value on acquisition and are depreciated in the same manner 
as equivalent owned assets. Finance lease and hire purchase obligations are included in creditors and the finance costs are spread over the 
periods of the agreements based on the net amount outstanding.
(iv) Intangible assets
Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Goodwill has been recognised in acquisitions of subsidiaries, and 
represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. 
The classification and accounting treatment of acquisitions occurring before 1 January 2004 have not been reconsidered in preparing 
the Group’s opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004 due to the exemption available in IFRS 1 (First time adoption). In respect of 
acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included at the transition date on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the 
amount recorded under UK GAAP, which was tested for impairment at the transition date. On transition, amortisation of goodwill has 
ceased as required by IAS 38.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (CGUs) according to business 
segment and is reviewed annually for impairment. 
The goodwill held on the balance sheet at 31 December 2017 is allocated solely to the UK Car Insurance segment.
130 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements: Notes to the Financial Statements Impairment of goodwill
The annual impairment review involves comparing the carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount (by allocating the goodwill to 
CGUs) and recognising an impairment loss if the recoverable amount is lower. Impairment losses are recognised through the income statement 
and are not subsequently reversed. 
The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value of the asset less costs to sell and the value in use of the CGU.
The value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three year period. 
Cash flows beyond this period are considered, but not included in the calculation. 
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are those regarding growth rates and expected changes in pricing and expenses 
incurred during the period. Management estimates growth rates and changes in pricing based on past practices and expected future changes 
in the market. 
The headroom above the goodwill carrying value is very significant, and there is no foreseeable event that would eliminate this margin.
Deferred acquisition costs
Acquisition costs comprise all direct and indirect costs arising from the conclusion of insurance contracts. Deferred acquisition costs 
represent the proportion of acquisition costs incurred that correspond to the unearned premiums provision at the balance sheet date. This 
balance is held as an intangible asset. It is amortised over the term of the contract as premium is earned. 
Software
Purchased software is recognised as an intangible asset and amortised over its expected useful life (generally the licence term). Internally 
generated software is recognised as an intangible asset, with directly attributable costs incurred in the development stage capitalised. The 
internally generated software assets are amortised over the expected useful life of the systems and amortisation commences when the 
software is available for use.
The carrying value of software is reviewed every six months for evidence of impairment, with the value being written down if any impairment 
exists. Impairment may be reversed if conditions subsequently improve.
(iv) Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets
Provisions are recognised when a legal or constructive obligation arises as a result of an event that occurred before the balance sheet date, 
when a cash-outflow relating to this obligation is probable and when the amount can be estimated reliably. 
Where an obligation exists, but the likelihood of a cash out-flow or the amount is uncertain, or where there is a possible obligation arising from 
a past event that is contingent on a future event, a contingent liability is disclosed. 
Contingent assets are possible assets that arise from past events, whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-
occurrence of future events. Where it is probable that a cash-inflow will arise from a contingent asset, this is disclosed.

Goodwill relates to the acquisition of Group subsidiary EUI Limited (formerly Admiral Insurance Services Limited) in November 1999. It is 
allocated solely to the UK Car Insurance segment. As described in the accounting policies, the amortisation of this asset ceased on transition 
to IFRS on 1 January 2004. All annual impairment reviews since the transition date have indicated that the estimated recoverable value of 
the asset is greater than the carrying amount and therefore no impairment losses have been recognised. Refer to the accounting policy for 
goodwill for further information.

11e. Objectives, policies and procedures for managing capital
The Group manages its capital to ensure that all entities within the Group are able to continue as going concerns and also to ensure that 
regulated entities meet regulatory requirements with an appropriate margin. Excess capital above these levels within subsidiaries is paid up  
to the Group holding company in the form of dividends on a regular basis. 
The Group’s dividend policy is to make distributions after taking into account capital that is required to be held a) for regulatory purposes;  
b) to fund expansion activities; and c) as a further buffer against unforeseen events. This policy gives the Directors flexibility in managing the 
Group’s capital.
The Group’s regulatory capital requirements are discussed in the Group Financial Review within the Strategic Report.

*1  During 2012 Admiral ceased earning other revenue from the sale of non-optional legal protection policies. At the same point, the Group began charging its panel of co- and reinsurers 
a vehicle commission. The substance of these changes meant that the total premiums written increased by the amount of revenue that was previously earned from the sale of non-
optional legal protection policies. The vehicle commission included within other revenue is therefore eliminated from the turnover measure to avoid double counting.

*3 Intra-group income elimination relates to price comparison income earned in the Group from other Group companies.

Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction For the year ended 31 December 2017
1. Accounting policies
1.1 Basis of preparation
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101). 
The amendments to FRS 101 (2015/16 Cycle) issued in June 2016 and effective immediately have been applied. The financial statements are 
prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of financial assets classified as fair value through the profit or loss. 
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”), but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with 
Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.
1.2 Disclosure exemptions applied under FRS 101
The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101:
• FRS 101.8 (d): the requirement of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure to make disclosures about financial instruments
• FRS 101.8 (e): the disclosure requirements of IFRS13 Fair Value Measurement
• FRS 101.8 (f): the requirement in paragraph 38 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements to present comparative information in 
respect of:
 - paragraph 118(3) of IAS 38 Intangible Assets
• FRS 101.8 (g): the requirements of paragraphs 10(d), 10(f), 16, 38A, 38B, 38C, 38D, 40A, 40B, 40C, 40D and 111 of IAS 1 Presentation of 
Financial Statements to produce a cash flow statement, a third balance sheet and to make an explicit and unreserved statement of 
compliance with IFRSs
• FRS 101.8 (h): the requirements of IAS 7 Statements of Cash Flows to produce a cash flow statement
• FRS 101.8 (i): the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors to 
include a list of new IFRSs that have been issued but that have yet to be applied
• FRS 101.8 (k): the requirements in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two  
or more members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to transaction is wholly owned by such a member
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these 
financial statements.
1.3 Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In considering the appropriateness of this assumption, the Board have 
reviewed the Company's projections for the next twelve months and beyond, including cash flow forecasts and regulatory capital surpluses. 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual financial statements.
1.4 Critical accounting judgements and estimates
In applying the Group’s accounting policies as described below management has primarily applied judgement in the impairment testing of 
the Company’s investment in group undertakings. Management has applied judgement in determining whether the carrying value of the 
investment, or asset may be supported by the recoverable amount calculation based on the ‘value in use’ of the asset (the net present value of 
future cash-flows arising from the asset). 
In calculating the net present value of future cash-flows, management has made assumptions over the timing and amount of underlying profit 
projections of the relevant undertakings, long term growth rates in those projections and the discount rate applied to these projections that 
is appropriate to reflect the market’s view of the risk of the relevant investment. 
Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements
144 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements: Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements 1.5 Shares in Group Undertakings
Shares in Group undertakings are valued at cost less any provision for impairment in value.
The requirements of IAS 36 are applied to determine whether it is necessary to recognise any impairment loss with respect to the Company’s 
investments in subsidiaries. When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 
Impairment of Assets as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal) with its 
carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognised forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is 
recognised in accordance with IAS 36 to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.
1.6 Employee share schemes
The Company operates a number of share schemes for its employees. For equity settled schemes commencing 1 January 2004 and after, the 
fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of free shares under the schemes is recognised as an increase in equity 
in the Company.
1.7 Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between 
the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable. They are regarded as recoverable to the extent that, 
on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable profits from which the 
future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. 
1.8 Financial assets and liabilities
All material investments held at fair value at the end of the period are invested in AAA-rated money market liquidity funds. The measurement 
of these investments is based on active quoted market values (level 1).
Government gilts are classified as AFS investments, in line with IAS 39 due to a reclassification in the period following the disposal of a portion 
of the holding. 
Deposits held with credit institutions are classified as loans and receivables, in line with the nature of these deposits, with the 2016 
comparative restated to reflect this more appropriate classification of these assets.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks. All cash and cash equivalents are measured at 
amortised cost. 
The Company’s financial liabilities comprise subordinated notes which are held at amortised cost using the effective interest method and a 
credit facility held at amortised cost.
2. Administrative expenses
Included within administrative expenses are re-charges of £1.6 million (2016: £1.4 million) relating to employees within the Group who perform 
services on behalf of the Company. No staff are directly employed by the Company.

A full list of the Company’s subsidiaries is disclosed in note 11 of the consolidated financial statements.
All investments in group undertakings are considered level 3 in the fair value hierarchy of IFRS 13.
An annual impairment review is performed over the carrying value of the investments in subsidiary undertakings, which involves comparing 
the carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value of the asset less costs to 
sell, and the value in use of the subsidiary, calculated using cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management. 
In 2017 a non-cash impairment loss of £25 million has been recognised by the Parent Company in respect of its investment in the Group’s US 
insurance business Elephant Auto. The impairment charge is presented within the “Impairment losses” line of the Parent Company Income 
Statement and reduces the value of the investment to its recoverable amount, being its value in use, of £100 million. 
The impairment charge coincided with a review of the long-term strategy of Elephant by its management team and subsequent approval by 
the Board. During 2017, additional capital of £16 million was provided to Elephant to continue to maintain a strong surplus over regulatory 
requirements. Elephant remains loss making at this stage in its development, which is in line with its long-term plan. Whilst the long-term 
plan did support the carrying value of the subsidiary, impairment was considered appropriate following the results of a number of stress tests 
applied to the plans.
The cash flows supporting the value in use are based on financial forecasts prepared for a 10 year period, this being justified by the historical 
accuracy of the forecasting process along with the strategy of long-term profitable growth. Beyond the 10 year forecast period, a long-term 
growth rate of 2.5% has been used. 
The key assumptions used in the underlying forecasts are those regarding acquisition and retention rates of customers, ancillary sales, loss 
and expense ratios. The estimates are based on past practice and the experience of management, the long-term strategy as approved by the 
Board and reflect expected future changes in the market. 
A pre-tax discount rate of 11% has been used, calculated using a Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) calculation (using a risk free return plus 
an appropriate risk premium), given that an asset specific rate is not available from the market.
During 2017 the management team at Elephant has been strengthened and a number of important operational improvements have been 
made. Although success is not certain, the Board remains confident in the prospects of the business and continues to support Elephant in the 
achievement of its goals. The impairment charge has no impact on the Group’s profit for the period or capital position.

The UK corporation tax rate reduced from 20% to 19% on 1 April 2017. The average effective rate of tax for 2017 is 19.25% (2016: 20.00%).  
A further reduction to the main rate of corporation tax to 17% (effective from 1 April 2020) was enacted on 15 September 2016. This will 
reduce the Company’s future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax liability at 31 December 2017 has been calculated based on the rate at which each timing difference is most likely to reverse.

disclosure exemptions on Admiral Group plc, in writing, to its registered office (Tŷ Admiral, David Street, Cardiff CF10 2EH) no later than

Consolidated financial summary
151 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction Financial Statements Additional Information Alternative Performance Measures
Throughout this report, the Group uses a number of Alternative Performance Measures (APMs); measures that are not required or commonly 
reported under International Financial Reporting Standards, the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) under which the Group 
prepares its financial statements. 
These APMs are used by the Group, alongside GAAP measures, for both internal performance analysis and to help shareholders and other users 
of the Annual Report and financial statements to better understand the Group’s performance in the period in comparison to previous periods 
and the Group’s competitors. 
The table below defines and explains the primary APMs used in this report. Financial APMs are usually derived from financial statement items 
and are calculated using consistent accounting policies to those applied in the financial statements, unless otherwise stated. Non financial 
KPIs incorporate information that cannot be derived from the financial statements but provide further insight into the performance and 
financial position of the Group. 
APMs may not necessarily be defined in a consistent manner to similar APMs used by the Group’s competitors. They should be considered as a 
supplement rather than a substitute for GAAP measures.
Turnover Turnover is defined as total premiums written (as below) and other revenue. It is reconciled to financial statement line 
items in note 12a to the financial statements.
This measure has been presented by the Group in every Annual Report since it became a listed Group in 2004. It reflects 
the size of the revenue generated by the Group and analysis of this measure over time provides a clear indication of the 
size and growth of the Group.
The measure was developed as a result of the Group’s business model. The core UK Car insurance business has historically 
shared a significant proportion of the risks with Munich Re, a third party insurance Group, through a co-insurance 
arrangement, with the arrangement subsequently being replicated in some of the Group’s international insurance 
operations. Premiums and claims accruing to the external co-insurer are not reflected in the Group’s income statement 
and therefore presentation of this metric enables users of the Annual Report to see the scale of the Group’s insurance 
operations in a way not possible from taking the income statement in isolation.
Total Premiums 
Written
Total premiums written are the premiums written within the Group, including co-insurance. It is reconciled to financial 
statement line items in note 12a to the financial statements.
This measure has been presented by the Group in every Annual Report since it became a listed Group in 2004. It reflects 
the total premiums written by the Group’s insurance intermediaries and analysis of this measure over time provides a 
clear indication of the growth in premiums, irrespective of how co-insurance agreements have changed over time. 
The reasons for presenting this measure are consistent with that for the Turnover APM noted above.
Group’s share of 
Profit before Tax
Group’s share of profit before tax represents profit before tax, excluding the impact of Non-controlling Interests. It is 
reconciled to statutory profit before tax in note 12d to the financial statements.
This measure is useful in presenting the limit of the Group’s exposure to the expenditure incurred in starting up new 
businesses and demonstrates the ‘test-and-learn’ strategy employed by the Group to expansion into new territories.
In 2016, Group’s share of Profit before Tax is presented on a ‘Pre Ogden’ and a ‘Post Ogden basis. ‘Pre Ogden’ represents 
the Group’s share of estimated profit before tax before the impact of the reduction in the UK Ogden discount rate 
confirmed by the Lord Chancellor in February 2017.
Underwriting result 
(profit or loss)
For each insurance business an underwriting result is presented showing the segment result prior to the inclusion of 
profit commission, other income contribution and instalment income. It demonstrates the insurance result, i.e. premium 
revenue and investment income less claims incurred and insurance expenses.
Glossary
152 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Additional Information: Glossary Loss Ratio Reported loss ratios are expressed as a percentage of claims incurred divided by net earned premiums. 
There are a number of instances within the Annual Report where adjustments are made to this calculation in order 
to more clearly present the underlying performance of the Group and operating segments within the Group. The 
calculations of these are presented within note 12b to the accounts and explanation is as follows.
UK reported motor loss ratio: Within the UK insurance segment the Group separately presents motor ratios, i.e. excluding 
the underwriting of other products that supplement the car insurance policy. The motor ratio is adjusted to i) exclude the 
impact of reserve releases on commuted reinsurance contracts and ii) exclude claims handling costs that are reported 
within claims costs in the income statement. 
International insurance loss ratio: As for the UK motor loss ratio, the international insurance loss ratios presented exclude 
the underwriting of other products that supplement the car insurance policy. The motor ratio is adjusted to exclude the 
claims element of the impact of reinsurer caps as inclusion of the impact of the capping of reinsurer claims costs would 
distort the underlying performance of the business.
Group loss ratios: Group loss ratios are reported on a consistent basis as the UK and international ratios noted above. 
Adjustments are made to i) exclude the impact of reserve releases on commuted reinsurance contracts, ii) exclude claims 
handling costs that are reported within claims costs in the income statement and iii) exclude the claims element of the 
impact of international reinsurer caps.
Expense Ratio Reported expense ratios are expressed as a percentage of net operating expenses divided by net earned premiums. 
There are a number of instances within the Annual Report where adjustments are made to this calculation in order 
to more clearly present the underlying performance of the Group and operating segments within the Group. The 
calculations of these are presented within note 12c to the accounts and explanation is as follows.
UK reported motor expense ratio: Within the UK insurance segment the Group separately presents motor ratios, i.e. 
excluding the underwriting of other products that supplement the car insurance policy. The motor ratio is adjusted to i) 
include claims handling costs that are reported within claims costs in the income statement and ii) include intra-group 
aggregator fees charged by the UK price comparison business to the UK insurance business.
International insurance expense ratio: As for the UK motor loss ratio, the international insurance expense ratios 
presented exclude the underwriting of other products that supplement the car insurance policy. The motor ratio is 
adjusted to i) exclude the expense element of the impact of reinsurer caps as inclusion of the impact of the capping of 
reinsurer expenses would distort the underlying performance of the business and ii) include intra-group aggregator fees 
charged by the overseas price comparison businesses to the international insurance businesses.
Group expense ratios: Group expense ratios are reported on a consistent basis as the UK and international ratios noted 
above. Adjustments are made to i) include claims handling costs that are reported within claims costs in the income 
statement, ii) include intra-group aggregator fees charged by the Group’s price comparison businesses to the Group’s 
insurance businesses and iii) exclude the expense element of the impact of international reinsurer caps.
Combined Ratio Reported combined ratios are the sum of the loss and expense ratios as defined above. Explanation of these figures is 
noted above and reconciliation of the calculations are provided in notes 12b and 12c.
Return on Equity Return on equity is calculated as profit after tax for the period attributable to equity holders of the Group divided by the 
average total equity attributable to equity holders of the Group in the year. This average is determined by dividing the 
opening and closing positions for the year by two.
The relevant figures for this calculation can be found within the Consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Group Customers Group customer numbers are the total number of cars, households and vans on cover at the end of the year, across  
the Group.
This measure has been presented by the Group in every Annual Report since it became a listed Group in 2004. It reflects 
the size of the Group’s customer base and analysis of this measure over time provides a clear indication of the growth. 
It is also a useful indicator of the growing significance to the Group of the different lines of business and geographic 
regions. 
Effective Tax Rate Effective tax rate is defined as the approximate tax rate derived from dividing the Group’s profit before tax by the tax 
charge going through the income statement. It is a measure historically presented by the Group and enables users to see 
how the tax cost incurred by the Group compares over time and to current corporation tax rates.

other revenue (for example instalment income and commission income relating to the sale of products that are 
ancillary to the main insurance policy) relating to policies incepting in the relevant underwriting year. 
Written/Earned basis A policy can be written in one calendar year but earned over a subsequent calendar year.
