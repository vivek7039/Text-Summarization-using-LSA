Strategic report Financial statements Governance At a glance
Nexus Infrastructure currently comprises two 
separately managed and operated businesses; 
Tamdown and TriConnex.
Our businesses
Tamdown provides a range of specialised 
infrastructure and engineering services to  
the UK housebuilding sectors.
Services include earthworks, 
building highways, substructures 
and basements, creating 
drainage systems, as well as 
constructing reinforced concrete 
frames. The business has a  
well-established market position 
having been in operation for 
over 40 years and works with 
nine of the top ten largest UK 
housebuilders. Tamdown’s 
operations are focused on the 
South East of England and London.
TriConnex designs, installs and connects gas, electricity 
and water networks and, more recently, fibre, on new 
residential and commercial developments. 
TriConnex was established in 2011 
to take advantage of deregulation 
in the utilities market, with the 
goal of being recognised as the 
UK’s leading independent provider 
of utility connections to new 
developments. TriConnex’s current 
areas of operation include the 
South East, South Midlands and 
South West of England. 
Our clients
The Group has a very strong base of  
blue-chip customers which includes all  
of the top ten largest housebuilders in  
the UK. In addition, the Group’s diverse 
customer base includes affordable  
housing providers and many of the  
top 25 housebuilders.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements I am pleased to report a robust set of results  
for the year ended 30 September 2017.
Chairman’s statement
This is our maiden set of results as 
a public company, following the 
Company’s successful Initial Public 
Offering (“IPO”) on the London Stock 
Exchange’s Alternative Investment 
Market (“AIM”) in July 2017. I would 
like to take this opportunity to 
welcome all our new shareholders. 
Overview of the year
The Nexus business model, with 
Tamdown’s well-established market 
position as a leading provider of 
essential infrastructure services 
to the UK’s largest housebuilders, 
coupled with TriConnex’s growing 
utilities connection services, was 
resilient during a challenging year. 
As previously reported, the EU 
Referendum caused a slowdown 
in tendering activity and delays to 
customers awarding new contracts 
during the second half of 2016 
with a corresponding delay to work 
commencing on site. In spite of 
this market backdrop, the Group 
is reporting revenue for the year 
of £135.0m (2016: £135.7m), and 
an operating profit of £9.3m 
(2016: £10.4m). As at 30 September 
2017, the order book was at a record 
level of £202.7m up 25% from 
£161.7m in 2016, providing good 
earnings visibility for the year ahead.

4 Strategy
The Group’s mission is to be 
recognised as the leading provider 
of essential infrastructure services 
in the UK. The Group’s strategy is to 
deliver outstanding performance 
through a focus on innovation and 
customer service which will lead to 
growth, building on existing market 
positions by developing new markets 
and services whilst extending 
geography, both organically and 
through complementary earnings 
enhancing acquisitions. 
The Group’s organic growth strategy 
is focused on four key drivers: 
increasing market share within 
current geographies, expanding 
into new geographies, diversification 
into new growth sectors and 
leveraging customer relationships 
to enhance cross-selling within the 
Group. In addition to organic growth, 
further growth will come from the 
successful sourcing, execution and 
integration of chosen acquisitions. 
The Group is taking a disciplined 
approach to acquisitions, seeking 
to enhance shareholder value with 
acquisitions that are linked or closely 
associated with TriConnex, such as 
businesses within existing residential 
utility or non-residential utilities 
markets or new markets, such as 
continuing to develop our fibre and 
Electric Vehicle charging services. 
Returns to shareholders
As a listed company, one of our 
primary objectives is to deliver 
increased shareholder value over 
time. The Board has adopted a 
progressive dividend policy and has 
already paid an interim dividend of 
2.1p per share. For the year ended 
30 September 2017, the Board is 
proposing a final dividend of 4.2p 
per share, which, if approved at the 
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”), 
will take the dividend for the year 
to 6.3p per share. The total dividend 
for the year of £2.4m is based on 
a dividend cover of 3.0 times the 
Group’s profit after tax, adjusted for 
exceptional items, which is in line 
with our guidance on dividend cover 
stated at the time of the IPO. The 
dividend will be paid on 9 March 
2018 to shareholders on the register 
at close of business on 9 February 
2018. The shares will go ex-dividend 
on 8 February 2018.
Looking forward, whilst continuing 
to invest in the growth plans of the 
business, our adopted progressive 
dividend policy will enable 
shareholders to benefit as the Group 
delivers on its performance targets. 
Board and governance
The Board has been established 
now for over a year, with Richard 
Kilner appointed as Non-Executive 
Director and myself, appointed 
as Non-Executive Chairman, 
in January 2016. Alex Wiseman 
was appointed as Non-Executive 
Director in June 2016. The Board 
consists of five members in 
total, including Executive Board 
Directors Mike Morris (CEO) and 
Alan Martin (CFO).
Since the Board was expanded in 
early 2016, roles and responsibilities 
have been defined and the Board 
has spent time setting out the vital 
discipline, processes and authorities 
of governance. Changes have 
included the creation of Board 
sub-committees in 2016 for Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination, all 
of which were in place throughout 
the year under review.
People
A primary driver to the Group’s 
success is the team of highly skilled, 
driven and loyal employees across 
the businesses. Nexus places great 
importance on engaging with, 
and developing its employees and 
providing a platform for personnel 
growth and successful career 
development. On behalf of the 
Board, I would like to congratulate 
and thank them for their continued 
hard work and dedication.
Outlook
We are in a strong position to 
deliver growth. The fundamental 
market drivers for our business look 
positive in the short and medium 
terms. The order book has grown 
significantly over the past year and 
is now at a record level. Against this 
background, the Board is optimistic 
on the outlook for the business and 
is confident the Group will deliver on 
its growth strategy.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements  Our focus is to enhance our 
growth and market positions 
across both the Tamdown and 
TriConnex businesses as we 
continue to drive shareholder 
value. In order to do this our 
strategic priorities are focused 
on increasing market share 
within existing geographies, 
expansion into new regions, 
diversifying into new growth 
sectors and leveraging 
TriConnex as the UK’s leading 
provider of utility connections, 
to maximise opportunities for 
Tamdown. These goals can be 
achieved by a combination of 
organic growth and by selective 
bolt-on acquisitions, which 
meet with our strict criteria of 
being earnings enhancing and 
a cultural fit. 
 Additionally, we aim to attract, 
retain and develop the best 
people by investing in training 
and support which means we 
have a knowledgeable workforce 
with transferable skills. 
 We believe one of Nexus’ 
differentiating factors is our 
culture and commitment to 
customer service.
 What are the key 
highlights of the  
full year results?
 The key highlight for us this 
year has been the successful 
listing of the business in July on 
AIM. This is the first step on a 
journey for the Nexus Group as 
a publicly quoted company.
 The revenue being maintained 
at the prior year level, despite 
a period of uncertainty 
following the EU Referendum, 
demonstrates the robustness of 
the Nexus business model, our 
strong market positions and our 
proven track record as a trusted 
partner for our clients. 
 The order book is at a record 
level of £202.7m and with 
the continued investment in 
resources, the Group is well 
placed to deliver its growth plans. 
 What are your key 
priorities for the  
business going forward?
 Our ultimate aim is to 
build a business that is the 
leading provider of essential 
infrastructure services to the 
housebuilding and commercial 
sectors in the UK and to 
continue to create value for all 
our stakeholders. 
 In short, this means delivering 
a consistent strong financial 
performance, working in 
partnership and developing 
strategic relationships with our 
clients, whilst ensuring that 
our employees have the skills, 
experience and expertise to 
deliver time-critical quality 
services to all our customers.

Nexus Infrastructure plc | Annual report and financial statements 2017
6  In addition to the Help to 
Buy funding, the Government 
announced in the budget a 
variety of support packages 
to address the structural 
undersupply in the UK 
housebuilding market. The 
new policies are expected to 
bring the total support for 
housing to at least £44bn over 
the next five years, with the 
intention of increasing the 
number of houses completed 
to 300,000 per year by 2025. 
In addition, the Government 
have committed to improving 
the planning environment and 
making more public sector 
land available for residential 
development.
 Nexus predominantly operates 
within the more economically 
resilient areas of the South 
East of England and London, 
where we believe the housing 
shortage is even more acute 
than other parts of the UK. 
 We’re confident that both 
Tamdown and TriConnex will 
benefit from this landscape 
of structural undersupply in 
housing, Government stimulus 
for the sector and a drive 
to increase volumes from 
customers operating in the 
affordable housing market. 
 You mention that you  
will be focusing on 
enhancing value for  
all stakeholders, what 
exactly do you mean  
by that?
 Our aim is to be an investment 
for our shareholders that 
both grows in value as well as 
providing a good return. Our 
dividend policy is stated to be 
progressive, whilst maintaining 
an appropriate level of dividend 
cover. Our Board’s current target 
is to pay annual dividends 
based on a dividend cover of 
3.0 times the Group’s adjusted 
profit after tax. 
 Other key stakeholders are our 
clients and employees. Our 
clients are front of mind in 
terms of our aim to continue to 
develop partnerships with them, 
providing excellent services, 
advice and support which 
enables the housebuilders to 
deliver quality housing on time 
and on budget. 
 With its existing very strong 
base of blue-chip customers, 
including nine of the top ten 
largest housebuilders in the UK, 
Tamdown has the expertise and 
experience to continue to deliver 
services on multi-phase projects 
across a broad range of regions. 
 With the deregulation of 
the utilities market, Nexus 
through TriConnex, can 
provide innovative added value 
services for housebuilders 
and commercial real estate 
clients. TriConnex has already 
developed a reputation 
for customer focus and 
responsiveness, flexibility, 
quality of service and reliability 
in this respect. 
 We believe we have an 
exceptional workforce and we 
seek to continue to attract and 
retain the best people through 
competitive pay, a culture 
of empowerment, attractive 
training and development 
schemes and future leadership 
programmes. We offer 
apprenticeships, high levels of 
training and development, a 
graduate programme and a 
degree programme.
 In terms of your key 
markets – housebuilding 
and commercial property, 
what is your view of these 
markets?
 As you are probably aware, the 
Government announced in 
October that the Help to Buy 
equity scheme will receive an 
additional £10bn of funding to 
support the purchase of homes. 
The new funding is nearly 50% 
higher than that used in the 
first four years of the scheme’s 
life and adds to the £5.4bn of 
previous funding, which to date 
has assisted in the sale of more 
than 134,000 homes.

Executive review
Group operating results
As anticipated and as highlighted 
earlier in the year, the outcome 
for the Group’s full year revenues 
of £135.0m (2016: £135.7m) were 
relatively flat reflecting the impact 
of the EU Referendum. Revenues 
for Tamdown were £105.6m 
(2016: £112.4m) and were broadly 
offset by the 26.3% increase in 
TriConnex’s revenues to £29.5m 
(2016: £23.3m). 
Gross profit for the year increased 
to £27.2m (2016: £26.3m), with the 
overall gross margin improving 
by 78 basis points to 20.2% 
(2016: 19.4%).
Administrative expenses for the 
Group increased by £2.0m to 
£17.9m (2016: £15.9m). The 12.4% 
increase was primarily due to 
investment for growth within 
TriConnex, where the planned 
office headcount has increased 
by 27, along with salary increases. 
Group operating profit, which 
has been recorded before the 
deduction of exceptional costs, 
for the year was £9.3m (2016: 
£10.4m). Group operating margin 
decreased to 6.9% (2016: 7.6%), 
with the gross margin improvement 
offset by the significant investment 
in administrative expenses to 
support future growth.
Exceptional items totalling £1.7m 
(2016: nil) were recorded in the year 
to reflect the costs related to the IPO. 
Profit for the year attributable 
to equity holders of the parent 
company was £5.8m (2016: £8.4m). 
Basic earnings per share were 15.4p, 
after the impact of the exceptional 
items (2016: 22.3p). The underlying 
basic earnings per share, adjusting 
for the exceptional items, were 19.1p 
(2016: 22.3p). 
The Group’s balance sheet remains 
strong, with net assets growing 
by 27.2% to £17.0m (2016: £13.4m). 
The Group’s net cash remains high 
at £18.7m (2016: £23.6m) with cash 
and cash equivalents at £27.1m 
(2016: £34.0m) and bank borrowings 
of £8.4m (2016: £10.4m). The Group 
holds a high net cash position in 
order to support growth and the 
Group’s acquisition strategy.

Tamdown
Financial and operating 
performance
The revenue for Tamdown 
decreased by 6.1% to £105.6m, 
(2016: £112.4m). This was anticipated 
earlier in the year and highlighted at 
the time of the IPO, as the business 
saw the impact of the June 2016 EU 
Referendum on the housebuilding 
market and customers in general. 
From the end of 2016 onwards, 
orders for new phases and new sites 
returned to normal levels. This is 
reflected in the 24.9% improvement 
in the order book from £86.7m at 
30 September 2016 to £108.3m at 
30 September 2017. 
The gross margin for the year at 
16.4% (2016: 16.5%) maintained the 
significant improvement in margin 
of recent years. 
Our investment for growth 
with increased headcount, staff 
and salary costs resulted in a 
10.9% increase in administrative 
expenses to £10.1m (2016: £9.1m). 
The operating profit for the year 
at £7.2m (2016: £9.5m), achieved 
an operating margin of 6.8% 
(2016: 8.4%). The Board believes 
that this investment can support 
Tamdown’s growth over a number 
of years.
Our markets
The customers of Tamdown are UK 
housebuilders or affordable housing 
developers, including housing 
associations and, as such, the UK 
housebuilding market is key to 
the Company. The housing market 
has been in a long-term position 
of structural undersupply as the 
number of new houses built has 
failed to keep pace with the rate 
of household formation. Current 
estimates from the Department for 
Communities and Local Government 
(“DCLG”) are for annual household 
formation in excess of 250,000 over 
the short to medium term, which 
compares to the Construction 
Products Association (“CPA”) 
estimates of UK housing starts in 
2016 of approximately 148,000 
(178,000 including public and 
private homes) and is projected to 
increase to 158,000 in 2019 (192,000 
including public and private homes). 
As a result, there is the expectation 
that the housing deficit will remain 
over the long term. The prevalence 
of this deficit has attracted a 
significant amount of Government 
stimulus to the sector. 
Tamdown operates within the 
more economically resilient areas 
of the South East of England and 
London where the undersupply of 
housing appears to be more acute 
compared to the rest of the UK. 
Tamdown works with the majority 
of the quoted housebuilders, who 
account for approximately 50% of 
total private new build volumes 
(compared to approximately 32% 
in 2005) with this dominance 
expected to continue as they work 
through their land bank and develop 
larger schemes.
The Housing white paper released 
in February 2017 announced new 
plans by the UK Government to 
tackle the undersupply of houses 
by reducing the obstacles to 
housebuilding and help local 
authorities, developers and small 
to medium-sized housebuilders 
meet housing needs. This 
included greater support for small 
housebuilders, through the Home 
Building Fund, to build up to 
225,000 homes in the long term. 
This is alongside a commitment 
to build more affordable homes, 
including Rent to Buy and 
shared ownership, with an extra 
£1.4bn for the Affordable Homes 
Programme, to build around 
225,000 affordable homes.
The Government announced in the 
November 2017 budget a further 
package of investments, loans and 
guarantees, which when added to 
previous initiatives totalled £44bn, to 
increase the annual number of new 
homes from 217,000 in 2016/17 to 
300,000 by 2025.
Outlook
Tamdown has an established market 
position, providing quality services to 
nine of the top ten UK housebuilders. 
The backdrop of Government 
stimulus to counter the housing 
supply deficit provides us with 
confidence that our customers will 
continue to demand our services. 
Our strategic objectives are to grow 
the business organically, expand 
into new geographic markets and 
develop diversification opportunities 
into sectors such as affordable 
residential and build to rent. These 
plans, alongside working with 
TriConnex to ensure that the early 
customer intelligence that TriConnex 
becomes aware of is utilised in 
the most effective manner, give 
us confidence that we have an 
established route to continue to 
grow the Tamdown business.

TriConnex
Financial and operating 
performance
Revenue for TriConnex increased 
by 26.3% to £29.5m (2016: £23.3m). 
This strong growth is due to a 
combination of an expansion of our 
customer base, increased market 
share from current customers 
and the take up by customers of 
TriConnex’s self-lay water and fibre 
services. The EU Referendum had a 
limited negative impact on the order 
book of TriConnex mainly due to the 
longer lead times in designing and 
implementing utility networks. The 
order book grew by 25.9% over the 
year to £94.4m (2016: £75.0m).
TriConnex is a high gross margin 
business, principally due to the 
more technical, office based, 
added value nature of the services 
it provides, resulting in a higher 
proportion of overhead cost. The 
high gross margin was maintained 
during the year, with the margin 
improving by 40 basis points to 
33.8% (2016: 33.4%).
As TriConnex provides a turnkey 
service from concept to connection 
with a significant amount of 
desktop planning and research, 
the majority of TriConnex’s staff 
are office based and in order for 
TriConnex to continue to grow 
it has needed to invest in an 
increased number of staff within 
business development, technical 
and operations departments, with 
the total headcount increasing by 
57 (44%) over the year. Accordingly, 
overheads have increased in the year 
to £6.5m (2016: £5.0m), broadly in 
proportion to turnover growth.
Operating profit increased by 
23.8% to £3.5m (2016: £2.8m) 
with an operating margin of 11.8% 
(2016: 12.1%).
Our markets 
The utility connections market 
consists of three regulated utilities; 
electricity, gas and water, and one 
unregulated utility, fibre. TriConnex 
initially offered electricity and gas 
connections, expanding to offer 
water connections in 2014 and fibre 
connections in 2016. The market has 
arisen from the deregulation of the 
utility sector and TriConnex entered 
the market in 2011 as a result of this 
deregulation.
Since 2000 the regulator of 
electricity and gas utilities, Ofgem, 
has been focused on improving 
competition within the distribution 
side of the industry. In 2010, 
licence obligations were imposed 
on electricity and gas distribution 
companies to promote competition 
and tighten up performance 
standards when working with 
independents. Today approximately 
60% of gas and approximately 30% 
of electricity connections in the UK 
are undertaken by independent 
connection providers and these 
percentages are expected to 
continue to grow.
The priority for the regulator for 
water, Ofwat, has, until recently, 
been to encourage the investment 
in an inadequate infrastructure rather 
than the promotion of competition 
meaning that the selling, distribution 
and the connection of water to 
new developments had remained 
with the regional monopoly water 
companies. However, the concept of 
self-lay was introduced in 2013 which 
permitted developers to arrange for 
the installation of the water mains 
and services by an independent third 
party, so called self-lay organisations 
such as TriConnex. 
The fibre connections market 
is not a regulated activity and 
independents have always been able 
to provide them. Thus, there has 
been less opportunity for TriConnex 
to benefit from deregulation but 
in 2016, Ofcom mandated more 
open access to Openreach’s 
fibre network throughout the 
UK and the dynamics remain 
similar to the electricity, gas and 
water connections market as the 
availability of high speed fibre is 
an increasingly important factor 
for home buyers, and therefore 
for housebuilders and developers. 
There has been significant 
Government support to roll out 
super-fast fibre across the country, 
including new residential and 
commercial developments.
TriConnex has approximately 
20% share of the independent 
utilities connection market in 
the South East of England. This 
has been built through having 
a deep understanding of its 
customers’ needs, drawing on the 
Group’s expertise in residential 
developments, being more service 
focused and user-friendly than 
competitors, as well as by providing 
fast and reliable delivery. The market 
share for the South West of England 
is approximately 3% but TriConnex 
has only been operating in the 
region since 2015 and has identified 
significant growth opportunities. 
Outlook
The proportion of regulated 
utility connections to be made 
by independents is expected to 
continue to increase. TriConnex has 
already built a reputation of a high 
level of customer services alongside 
cost effective, efficient connections.
Our strategic objectives are to 
exploit the opportunities to increase 
the customer base in a sector 
which is predicted to grow due to 
undersupply. In addition, as the 
utilities services sector is highly 
fragmented, the TriConnex team will 
explore acquisition opportunities, 
with the aim of increasing 
geographic penetration and service 
offering, as well as being earnings 
enhancing for the Group.

Exceptional items
In 2017, the Group incurred a 
number of exceptional costs 
in relation to the IPO totalling 
£1.7m and comprised £0.6m 
in relation to transaction costs 
and £1.1m in relation to settling 
share-based management incentive 
arrangements (non-cash) that were 
triggered on completion of the IPO.
Net finance costs
The net finance charge for the 
year totalled £0.2m (2016: £0.2m). 
Interest received on bank deposits 
totalled £0.1m (2016: £0.1m), with 
interest payable on bank borrowing 
of £0.26m (2016: £0.30m) and 
interest on finance lease and hire 
purchase facilities totalling £0.04m 
(2016: £0.06m).
Tax
The tax charge for the year was 
£1.6m, representing an effective tax 
rate of 21.0%. This is higher than the 
statutory rate of corporation tax due 
to some exceptional costs related to 
the IPO not being deductible for tax. 
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share were 
15.4p, after the impact of the 
exceptional items (2016: 22.3p). 
The underlying basic earnings per 
share, which has been adjusted 
for the impact of the exceptional 
items were 19.1p (2016: 22.3p). 
The diluted earnings per share 
were 15.0p (2016: 22.2p) and 
the adjusted diluted earnings 
per share, excluding the impact 
of the exceptional items were 
18.6p (2016: 22.2p).
Dividends
As discussed in the Chairman’s 
statement, the Board has 
recommended a final dividend 
of 4.2p per share, giving a total 
dividend for the year of 6.3p 
per share. This is in line with our 
guidance at the time of the IPO. 
The total cost of the dividend, 
including the interim dividend, 
will be £2.4m.
Statement of financial position
During the year to 30 September 2017, 
shareholders’ funds increased by 
£3.6m to £17.0m (2016: £13.4m), the 
movement included the payment 
of dividends totalling £3.5m, which 
was mitigated by the strong trading 
performance of the Group companies.
Non-current assets increased 
over the year by £3.0m to £10.2m 
(2016: £7.2m), with the increase 
including the acquisition of land 
in Braintree where the Group’s 
new head office buildings will be 
built once the design and planning 
processes have completed, which 
is anticipated to be midway through 
2018. Current assets decreased by 
£2.0m to £65.8m (2016: £67.8m) 
with inventories increasing by 
£0.5m, trade and other receivables 
increasing by £4.4m and cash 
balances decreasing by £6.9m 
to £27.1m.
Total liabilities decreased by £2.6m 
to £59.0m (2016: £61.6m), with 
borrowings decreasing by £2.0m 
with the repayment of the term loan.
Cash flow
The Group utilised £6.9m 
(2016: generated £6.3m) of cash in 
the year, resulting in a cash and cash 
equivalent balance at 30 September 
2017 of £27.1m (2016: £34.0m).
Operating cash flows before working 
capital movements, generated 
£10.3m (2016: £11.7m). Investment 
in working capital totalled £5.0m 
(2016: £0.2m), with the main 
increase in debtors, resulting in cash 
generated from operating activities 
of £5.3m (2016: £11.5m). Tax and 
interest payments amounted to 
£2.7m (2016: £2.4m). Cash utilised 
in investing activities totalled £3.4m 
(2016: £0.2m), with £4.0m used to 
acquire fixed assets of which £3.0m 
was for land for the Group’s new 
head office. Net cash out-flows from 
financing activities totalled £6.2m 
(2016: £2.5m), including £3.5m 
(2016: £11.0m) on dividend payments.
Treasury risk management
The Group’s cash balances are 
centrally pooled and invested, 
ensuring the best available returns 
are achieved consistent with 
retaining liquidity for the Group’s 
operations. The Group deposits 
funds only with financial institutions 
which have a minimum credit 
rating of A. As the Group operates 
wholly within the UK, there is 
no requirement for currency risk 
management.
Current trading and outlook
Trading in the first few months of 
the new financial year has been in 
line with the Board’s expectations. 
Demand from customers is robust, 
and the Group’s order book 
continues to increase with the 
balance as at 31 December 2017 
of £213m, which provides the Board 
with confidence for the year ahead.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Nexus’ mission is to be recognised as the leading provider of 
essential infrastructure services in the UK, by delivering outstanding 
performance through a focus on innovation and customer service.
Strategy
Strategic priority Progress during the year
Increase market share within existing geographies
The Group aims to drive customer penetration by leveraging 
existing customer relationships. Within the geography in which 
the Group operates a number of existing customers have 
regional businesses to which the Group does not currently 
provide services. Accordingly, there is an opportunity for the 
Group to increase its market share by winning contracts with the 
regional businesses of existing customers for which it currently 
does not work. This is likely to be done through customer 
recommendations and specific customer targeting.
The Group’s current customer penetration is estimated 
to be 40% for Tamdown and 35% for TriConnex. Over the 
past year, through strong relationships with customers, 
the customer penetration has improved from 32% and 
34% respectively.
Expansion into new geographic markets
There are a number of regions outside the South East of England 
and London into which Tamdown can expand in order to 
increase its market reach. This is likely to be achieved through 
recommendations and referrals from existing customers who also 
operate in these neighbouring regions, as well as new customers. 
The ultimate goal for TriConnex is national coverage and to be 
recognised as the UK’s leading independent provider of utility 
connections to new developments. TriConnex is able to expand 
geographically more rapidly than Tamdown as the nature of its 
work is fundamentally asset-light.
In recent months Tamdown’s geography has been 
expanded with a number of contracts being secured in 
Peterborough, which previously had been beyond its 
standard market reach.
TriConnex continues to expand its geographic reach 
within the South West region, managed from the Bristol 
office which accounts for 17% of TriConnex’s revenue. 
The Midlands are the next area of focus for TriConnex, 
with the first contract being secured in October 2017.
Diversification into new growth sectors
In 2016 the Group generated 96% of its revenue from the private 
development residential sector through its housebuilding 
customers. The Group’s strategy is to diversify its end markets 
into affordable residential and non-residential sectors, which will 
enable it to grow sustainably through the economic cycle.
TriConnex has also diversified its business by offering water 
connections in 2014 and fibre connections in 2016. This enables 
TriConnex to offer all four utility connections to customers. 
During the 2017 financial year the percentage of revenue 
derived from affordable residential and commercial 
schemes increased from 4% to 11%.
The Directors believe that the benefits of UK utilities 
deregulation will continue, specifically for water 
connections via self-lay and for the broadband market, 
which is very attractive given that it is regarded as an 
“essential service” with the Government supporting the 
roll-out of fibre across the UK.
Leverage TriConnex to optimise cross‑ selling 
opportunities for Tamdown
TriConnex is typically engaged early in the development process 
to advise customers on the utility network considerations for 
their site. As such, TriConnex gets a unique opportunity to see 
future developments months in advance of the usual sales cycle 
experienced by Tamdown.
As Nexus operates an integrated business development 
strategy, the Group is able to share customer intelligence 
with Tamdown, which can then benefit by targeting 
customers more selectively and in advance of typical 
tender windows.
Accretive acquisitions
The Group’s acquisition strategy will primarily focus on bolt-on 
acquisitions within areas linked or closely associated to TriConnex 
to enhance its geographic reach and service offering.
Current areas that the Group is exploring include 
businesses within existing residential utility markets 
(such as regulated energy utilities) and new markets 
such as fibre services and non-residential utilities (for 
example utility connections and services for commercial 
or industrial operations). Any acquisition will be subject 
to detailed due diligence and is anticipated to be 
required to have a clear strategic rationale and to 
be earnings enhancing.

The Group wishes to operate as a safe and sustainable business  
with a clear purpose and core values.
Approach
The Board recognises its 
responsibility for establishing high 
ethical standards of behaviour and 
corporate governance and the Group 
has policies in place, including, but 
not limited to: health and safety; 
anti-bribery; environmental protection; 
equal opportunities; equality and 
diversity; training and development; 
whistleblowing and modern 
slavery, to support our approach of 
conducting business in an open and 
transparent manner and which are 
in line with the core values.
The Company expects its employees 
to conduct themselves in a manner 
which reflects the highest ethical 
standards, and comply with all 
applicable laws and regulations. 
The Company has a zero-tolerance 
policy towards any form of bribery 
or corruption and has training and 
an appropriate procedure in place 
whereby any concerns in relation 
to malpractice can be raised in an 
appropriate forum.
Health and safety
The health, safety and well-being 
of our staff is paramount, and every 
precaution is taken to protect 
them and fellow contractors on 
site, as well as the general public. 
It is our duty and priority to ensure 
the safety of our employees whilst 
at work. Our dedicated safety 
team undertakes regular internal 
audits of our procedures to ensure 
they are as comprehensive as 
possible, highlighting any areas for 
improvement. In addition, our systems 
are under constant review by external 
bodies promoting best practice. Our 
policies, procedures and practices 
are accredited with ISO 9001 Quality 
Standard, ISO 14001 Environment 
Standard, OHSAS 18001 Health and 
Safety Standard.
We have adopted and encourage 
a very proactive approach to hazard 
and near miss reporting. This 
approach has improved awareness 
and helped prevent accidents on 
our sites and for other contractors 
working alongside us. 
The year-on-year importance of 
health and safety within the Group 
is illustrated by Tamdown winning 
its eighth consecutive Gold Medal 
from RoSPA (“The Royal Society for 
the Prevention of Accidents”). Gold 
Medal Awards are only awarded 
to those companies who have 
achieved Gold Awards for over five 
consecutive years or more. TriConnex

Funds are raised by employees, 
their families and friends, client 
and business contacts through 
sponsorship and support for social 
and sporting events such as charity 
balls, summer BBQs, triathlons and 
mud races. Since inception the Trust 
has raised over £320,000.
Recently supported charities have 
included Farleigh Hospice, Juvenile 
Diabetes Research, Children of 
St Mary’s Hospital and Broomfield 
Hospital’s Neonatal Ward. The funds 
donated to charities are spent on 
items that they need, for example 
for Broomfield Hospital we were 
able to buy a baby incubator.
In 2017 we are helping 
communities in Braintree and  
Bristol with hampers for the elderly 
and homeless and providing meals 
for those alone at Christmas.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements The Group has established and operates a system  
of internal control and risk management procedures,  
in order to identify, manage and mitigate risks.
Principal risks and uncertainties
In common with other organisations, 
the Group faces risks that may affect 
its performance. Identification, 
management and mitigation of 
such risks and uncertainties across 
the Group is an essential part of the 
ability to deliver the Group strategy.
The Board has identified those risks 
which are deemed principal to its 
business due to their potential 
severity and link to the Group’s 
strategy, markets and operations.
The Group has established and 
operates a system of internal control 
and risk management procedures, 
in order to identify, manage and 
mitigate the risks at various levels 
within the organisation. 
The principal risks and uncertainties 
identified by management and how 
they are being managed are set out 
below. These risks are not intended 
to be an exhaustive analysis of all 
risks that may arise in the ordinary 
course of business.
Market downturn
Risk Description Mitigation
• The Group’s success is dependent on 
the general economic climate and 
fluctuations in the UK  
property market
• The Group’s success is dependent, to 
a large extent, upon the state of the 
economy and in particular the UK’s 
property market
• Economic weakness may result 
in decreased revenue, margins 
and earnings
• Adverse economic conditions may 
decrease customer confidence 
levels leading to a decrease 
in housebuilding or rates of 
development
• Mortgage availability may decrease 
and the cost associated with 
mortgage funding may increase, 
which would result in fewer house 
purchases and in turn the number 
of houses built
• Diversification of the Group’s markets, 
both geographically and services 
provided
• Regular review of tenders
• Regular contact with customers
• A cautious approach to debt finance
UK exit from the EU
Risk Description Mitigation
• The UK’s exit from the EU (“Brexit”) 
could have a significant impact on 
the Group’s success
• The formal process to leave the EU 
commenced in March 2017. It is 
currently unclear the extent to which 
Brexit will impact the UK, on matters 
such as the extent to which the UK 
will continue to apply EU laws and 
the macroeconomic effect on the 
UK economy. The impact on the 
Group’s customers and thus the 
Group’s businesses, financial position  
and operations
• Regular evaluation of future market 
performance, together with the 
strategy to address those markets
• Diversification of the Group’s markets, 
both geographically and services 
provided
• Focus on recruitment, 
development and retention  
of a skilled labour force
Nexus Infrastructure plc | Annual report and financial statements 2017
22 Failure to procure contracts
Risk Description Mitigation
• The Group’s success is dependent 
upon winning contracts on 
satisfactory terms in its existing 
and target markets
• The majority of the Group business, 
and so revenue, is generated by work 
won through tender submissions
• The Group’s profitability depends 
upon its ability to submit tenders at 
satisfactory margins. Should market 
conditions change on variables such 
as increased competition, increased 
costs, or reduced availability of skilled 
workforce, then the cost of carrying 
out works may increase, which may 
either reduce the profitability of the 
contracts or result in the contracts 
not being won
• If the Group’s ability to exceed 
customer expectations is reduced 
due to poor quality or service, it may 
reduce the level of repeat work from 
customers
• Continually review the Group’s 
current and target markets to 
ensure the opportunities they 
offer are understood
• Structured bid review process is in 
operation with specific customer and 
contract criteria that are designed 
to ensure the Group only takes on 
customers and contracts that are 
acceptable and understood
• Ensuring we have high-quality people 
delivering and managing contracts
Regulatory requirements
Risk Description Mitigation
• Parts of the Group’s business are 
subject to regulatory requirements 
with which it may be found to be 
non-compliant
• TriConnex operates in a regulated 
environment. Regulators may 
conduct investigations on companies 
or industry-wide. Non-compliance 
with laws, regulations or rules 
may result in adverse publicity, 
prosecution, disciplinary action, 
fines or revocation of licences, and 
would impact profitability and 
relationships with current and 
potential customers
• Regular internal review of processes 
and procedures to ensure 
compliance with obligations
• Regular external audit to confirm 
processes and procedures are 
compliant with obligations
Availability of materials and subcontractors
Risk Description Mitigation
• The Group could be adversely 
affected by the availability of 
materials and subcontractors
• The Group requires materials to 
be available at the time they are 
needed, at a reasonable price. 
Increased prices and delays could 
increase the costs of the project and 
so impact the Group’s profitability
• The Group is dependent on the 
availability, competence and 
consistency of subcontractors. 
Should subcontractors not be 
available at the time required, delays 
may occur, increasing costs and so 
reducing profitability. Incompetent 
or inconsistent workmanship may 
require remediation works which 
may impact profitability and  
short-term cash flows
• Multiple suppliers and subcontractors 
for materials and relevant trades 
in order to maintain continuity of 
supply and competitive pricing
• Supply contracts negotiated on 
specific contracts for certainty of 
price and quantity
Nexus Infrastructure plc | Annual report and financial statements 2017

Strategic report Governance Financial statements People
Risk Description Mitigation
• The Group could be adversely 
affected by the loss of, or an inability 
to recruit and retain, key personnel
• The Group’s success is dependent on 
its ability to recruit, retain and motivate 
high-quality senior management 
and other personnel with extensive 
experience and knowledge of the 
construction industry. The availability 
of such personnel is sparse and 
competition to recruit them is intense. 
Failure to recruit, retain and motivate 
could adversely affect the Group’s 
operations, financial conditions 
and prospects
• Focus on learning and development, 
including annual performance 
management, to encourage and 
support all employees to achieve 
their full potential
• Attractive performance based 
remuneration policy
• Recruitment and development plans 
to attract site based, school leavers 
and graduate employees
Contract execution
Risk Description Mitigation
• Contracts may not perform 
as expected which may 
lead to contracts not being 
executed profitably
• The Group’s profitability is dependent 
upon its ability to manage contracts 
to ensure that they are delivered 
on time, to budget and exceeding 
the customers’ expectations. Failure 
to achieve these objectives could 
lead to contract losses, delays, 
reputational damage and reduced 
repeat work
• Detailed bid appraisal process to 
ensure all risks and requirements 
are understood
• Applying rigorous policies and 
procedures to manage and monitor 
contract performance
• Ensuring high-quality people are 
delivering the contracts
Health and safety
Risk Description Mitigation
• The Group operates in a sector 
that carries significant health and 
safety risks
• The construction sector carries 
significant health and safety risks, 
including serious injury and death to 
employees, third party contractors 
and members of the public. 
Successful claims may result in fines, 
damages and costs in excess of the 
Group’s insurance cover, which may 
have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s business, financial condition 
and prospects
• A board led commitment to achieve 
zero accidents
• Management commitment to 
safety tours, safety audits and safety 
action groups
• Comprehensive employee training 
programmes
 
The financial risk management of the Group, including the Group’s exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk is set 
out in note 26: financial risk management, of the financial statements.

Nexus Infrastructure plc | Annual report and financial statements 2017
24 Strong corporate governance has a 
key role in promoting the Group’s 
success. The way the business is run 
therefore plays a significant part in 
meeting the Group’s commitments 
to our customers. The Group has a 
long history of successful delivery 
and good corporate governance and 
the Board will ensure this continues. 
As Chairman, I am responsible 
for the leadership of the Board 
and for ensuring that it fulfils its 
responsibilities to all of the Group’s 
stakeholders. My role includes 
ensuring that the Board has open 
and transparent discussions, 
allowing each member to contribute 
effectively. I ensure that the Board 
is commercial and collaborative, 
but also appropriately challenging. 
This requires us to have a good 
understanding of the business and 
its markets. The Board also operates 
in a way that sets an example, 
in terms of our commitment to 
the principles of governance, risk, 
leadership and diversity.
The Group has appropriate 
governance structures in place and 
we will continue to develop them 
as the business evolves as a public 
company. As an AIM-listed company, 
we do not have to comply with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, 
however we have sought to apply 
the principles that are appropriate 
for a company of this size and 
nature. Importantly, the majority 
of the Non-Executive Directors 
are independent and the Board 
Committees comprise only the 
Non-Executive Directors.

Corporate governance
Leadership and responsibilities
It is important that we as the Board provide strong and effective leadership, constructive challenge and accept 
collective accountability for the long-term sustainable success of the Group.
Board and sub-committee structure
The Board 
The Board comprises three 
Non-Executive Directors, 
including the Chairman and two 
Executive Directors. All Directors 
served throughout the year to 
30 September 2017. Biographies 
of the Directors can be found on 
page 26. 
The Board believes it has an 
appropriate balance of Executive 
and independent Non-Executive 
Directors given the size and nature 
of the business. In addition, the 
Board considers that it has an 
appropriate balance of skills, 
experience and knowledge in 
order for it to discharge its duties 
and responsibilities effectively. This 
includes a combination of diverse 
backgrounds and experiences which 
enable it to function effectively 
and have dialogue that is both 
constructive and challenging.
On joining the Board, arrangements 
are made for all new Directors to 
meet their colleagues and other 
senior management and to visit 
Company offices and sites, to ensure 
an adequate induction to the Group.
The Board meets regularly to 
consider strategy, performance and 
the framework of internal controls. 
To enable the Board to discharge 
its duties, all Directors receive 
appropriate and timely information, 
including briefing papers distributed 
in advance of Board meetings.  
There is a schedule of matters 
reserved to the Board for its 
decision. This includes: 
• approving the Group’s strategic 
aims and objectives;
• reviewing performance against 
the Group’s strategic aims, 
objectives and business plans;
• providing oversight of the Group’s 
operations;
• approving changes to the Group’s 
capital, corporate, management 
or control structures; 
• approving results announcements 
and the annual report and 
financial statements;
• approving the dividend policy; 
• declaration of the interim 
dividend and recommendation of 
the final dividend and any special 
dividend;
• approving any significant changes 
in accounting policies and 
approval of the treasury policy;
• approval of the Group’s risk 
appetite and principal risk 
statements;
• reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk and control processes;

Board effectiveness
The Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer have separate, clearly defined 
roles. The Chairman is responsible 
for leadership of the Board and 
ensuring its effectiveness. The 
role includes ensuring that the 
Directors receive accurate, timely 
and clear information; facilitating the 
contribution of the Non-Executive 
Directors; and ensuring constructive 
relations between the Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors. The Chief 
Executive Officer is responsible for 
implementing the Group’s strategy 
and its operational performance.
The Chairman is in regular contact 
with the Chief Executive Officer to 
discuss current matters and has 
visited Group operations outside the 
Board meeting calendar to meet 
divisional directors and managers.
Internal controls 
The Board is ultimately responsible 
for the Group’s system of internal 
control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. Any system of internal 
control can only provide reasonable, 
but not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. The 
Board considers that the internal 
controls in place are appropriate 
for the Group’s size, complexity 
and risk profile. The key features of 
the Group’s internal control system 
include: 
• the preparation of monthly 
management accounts and 
comparison to budget; 
• clearly defined roles and 
responsibilities, with appropriate 
segregation of duties; 
• clear authorisation and approval 
processes; 
• regular preparation and review of 
cash forecasts; 
• maintenance of a risk register, 
reviewed at each Audit 
Committee; and
• senior management review 
of material contracts and 
agreements.
Relations with shareholders 
The Board recognises the 
importance of maintaining an 
open dialogue with shareholders, 
keeping them informed of the 
Group’s strategy, progress and 
prospects. As part of this, the Board 
is committed to a high standard of 
corporate reporting. The Executive 
Directors conducted a wide ranging 
investor roadshow ahead of the IPO, 
meeting key institutions in London 
and Edinburgh. They plan to meet 
leading shareholders after the 
release of future interim and full year 
results.
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) 
The Company’s AGM will be held on 
6 March 2018 at Radisson Blu Hotel, 
Waltham Close, London Stansted 
Airport, Essex CM24 1PP. The 
Notice of Meeting, setting out the 
resolutions proposed, is contained

28 On behalf of the Audit Committee, 
I am pleased to present the first 
Audit Committee report for Nexus 
Infrastructure plc since flotation in 
July 2017.
The Audit Committee is responsible 
for ensuring that the financial 
performance of the Group is 
properly reported and monitored, 
through the internal control systems 
and the external auditor.
During the year the Committee 
focused on the identification and 
management of the risks of the 
Group and the internal audit process 
to give assurance over the Group’s 
internal controls and processes.
Committee meetings
The Audit Committee comprises 
of the Non-Executive Directors of 
the Company. The Audit Committee 
is chaired by Alex Wiseman. Alex is 
a member of the Chartered Institute 
of Management Accountants. 
The Committee is required to meet 
at least three times a year and the

External auditor
The Group’s external auditor is 
currently Grant Thornton UK LLP. 
Grant Thornton has been the 
Group’s auditor since October 2012. 
The independence of the external 
auditor is essential to ensure the 
integrity of the Group’s published 
financial information. During the 
year the Committee reviewed 
and approved the audit plan. The 
auditor’s assessment of materiality 
and financial reporting risk areas were 
discussed and challenged.
Following the completion of 
the audit for the year ended 
30 September 2017, the current 
audit partner is due to rotate off 
the audit as he has been responsible 
for the Group audit for in excess 
of five years. The Committee is 
in the process of tendering the 
Group’s external audit services 
and has asked three firms to 
submit proposals. The Committee 
intends to conclude the process 
during January 2018 and will 
invite shareholders to vote on the 
appointment of the successful firm 
at the AGM in March 2018.
Non-audit services
The award of non-audit services 
to the external auditor is subject 
to controls agreed by the Audit 
Committee. The Audit Committee 
recognises that the auditor may be 
best placed to provide some  
non-audit services and these are 
subject to formal approval by the 
Audit Committee.
Details of the audit and non-audit 
fees incurred are disclosed in note 6 
to the financial statements.
Alex Wiseman
Chairman of the Audit Committee
8 January 2018
Internal audit
Internal audit plays an important 
part in monitoring the effectiveness 
of internal controls. The internal 
audit function is carried out 
by Executive Directors of the 
subsidiaries who report to the 
Audit Committee. The Audit 
Committee request follow up 
reviews where control deficiencies 
are noted. During the year the Audit 
Committee approved the internal 
audit plan for the year.
Significant accounting matters
The significant issues considered by 
the Committee during the year were:
• revenue recognition, specifically 
the timing of recognising revenue, 
given both the length of the 
contracts and future contractual 
obligations;
• gross profit recognition, 
specifically the timing of 
recognising profit and any 
movement during the 
contract term; and
• contract order receipt, specifically 
when a contract becomes a legal 
contract with the Company.
Activities of the Committee
During the year the Committee 
undertook the following:
• reviewed and discussed with 
the external auditor the Group’s 
results for the financial year end 
30 September 2016;
• reviewed the Group’s financial 
policies and procedures in 
anticipation of the IPO;
• reviewed reports from 
management covering various 
aspects of the Company’s 
operations, controls and 
procedures and agreed actions 
for management to take from 
findings in the reports;
• reviewed the Group’s risk 
management framework and 
internal controls; and
• reviewed and agreed the external 
auditor’s plan in advance of their 
audit for the financial year ended 
30 September 2017.
Risk management  
and internal controls
The Board has delegated 
responsibility for monitoring the 
financial reporting process and 
reviewing the effectiveness of 
the Group’s internal controls to 
the Audit Committee. The system 
of internal controls is designed 
to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve the 
business objectives and the Board 
can only provide reasonable, and 
not absolute, assurance against 
material loss, errors or fraud. 
The Audit Committee reviews the 
risk register at each meeting and 
reports its findings to the Board. 
When analysing risk we consider the 
likelihood and impact on the Group 
after taking into account appropriate 
mitigating controls. The risk registers 
for each business are used to update 
the Group risk register. The Executive 
Directors of each subsidiary review the 
risk register at each Board meeting.

Disclosure of information to auditor
The Directors confirm that:
• so far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; 
and
• the Directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make themselves 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
Auditor
The Committee is in the process of tendering the Group’s external audit services and has invited three firms to 
submit proposals. The Committee intends to conclude the process during January 2018 and shareholders will be 
invited to vote on the appointment of the auditor selected by the Committee following the conclusion of the tender 
process at the AGM to be held in March 2018.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Approval
This Directors’ report was approved on behalf of the Board on 8 January 2018.

Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Group and 
parent company and of their profit 
or loss for that period. In preparing 
each of the Group and parent 
company financial statements, 
the Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the Group financial 
statements, state whether 
they have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the EU;
• for the parent company financial 
statements, state whether 
they have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the EU; and
• prepare the financial statements 
on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that 
the Group and the parent company 
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the annual report and the 
Group and parent company financial 
statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors 
to prepare Group and parent 
company financial statements for 
each financial year. As required by 
the AIM Rules of the London Stock 
Exchange they are required to 
prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with IFRS 
as adopted by the EU and applicable 
law and have elected to prepare the 
parent company financial statements 
in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the EU and applicable law.

Conclusions relating  
to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect 
of the following matters in relation 
to which the ISAs (UK) require us to 
report to you where:
• the Directors’ use of the going 
concern basis of accounting in 
the preparation of the financial 
statements is not appropriate; or
• the Directors have not disclosed 
in the financial statements any 
identified material uncertainties 
that may cast significant doubt 
about the Group’s or the parent 
company’s ability to continue to 
adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting for a period of at least 
12 months from the date when 
the financial statements 
are authorised for issue.
Overview of our audit approach
• overall Group materiality: we 
determined materiality for the 
Group financial statements as 
a whole to be £454,850, which 
represents 5% of the Group’s 
profit before taxation and 
exceptional items;
• the Group is made up of seven 
entities, with the principal 
components being Tamdown 
Group Limited and TriConnex 
Limited that account for 100% 
of external revenue; and
• key audit matters were identified 
as improper revenue recognition 
and impact of Alternative 
Investment Market (“AIM”) listing 
including disclosures, recognition 
of expenditure and share split.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in 
accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs” 
(UK)) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under those 
standards are further described in 
the auditor’s responsibilities for the 
audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. We are 
independent of the Group and the 
parent company in accordance with 
the ethical requirements that are 
relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, including the 
FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to 
listed entities, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these 
requirements. We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our opinion.
Who we are reporting to
This report is made solely to the 
Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept 
or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Opinion
Our opinion on the financial 
statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial 
statements of Nexus Infrastructure plc 
(the “parent company”) and its 
subsidiaries (the “Group”) for the year 
ended 30 September 2017 which 
comprise the consolidated statement 
of total comprehensive income, the 
consolidated and Company 
statement of financial position, the 
consolidated and Company 
statement of changes in equity, the 
consolidated and Company 
statement of cash flows and notes to 
the financial statements, including a 
summary of significant accounting 
policies. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in 
the preparation of the Group financial 
statements is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the 
European Union and, as regards the 
parent company financial statements, 
as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a 
true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the parent 
company’s affairs as at 
30 September 2017 and of 
the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended;
• the Group financial statements 
have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the European Union;
• the parent company financial 
statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006; and 
• the financial statements have 
been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Nexus Infrastructure plc | Annual report and financial statements 2017
38 Key audit matter – Group How the matter was addressed in the audit – 
Group
Improper revenue recognition
The Group’s principal revenue stream relates to the provision 
of infrastructure services to the UK housebuilding and 
commercial sectors. Revenue is recognised based on 
valuations determined by the value of work executed during 
the year on the individual construction contracts. The majority 
of revenue is based on contract accounting which exposes the 
Group to the risk due to the judgements which are made.
Revenue is a material figure in the financial statements 
(2017: £135,034,000; 2016: £135,720,000) and we therefore 
identified improper revenue recognition that is non-compliant 
with International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 18 ‘Revenue’, 
as a significant risk, which was one of the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
• testing a sample of contracts to confirm management’s 
application of the contractual terms and conditions, 
recalculating revenue recognised under the percentage 
of completion method based on valuation reports outlining 
the costs incurred to date, and testing a sample of project 
costs to source documents to confirm the nature of costs 
incurred;
• challenging management’s assertions relating to expected 
costs to complete; and
• for a sample of contracts ongoing at the previous year end, 
comparing the margin forecast to the eventual margin 
outcome to assess management’s forecasting accuracy. 
The Group’s accounting policy on revenue is shown in  
note 1 to the financial statements and related disclosures  
are included in note 4.
Key observations
Our audit work did not identify any material errors in the 
revenue recognised in relation to the contracts or any material 
instances of revenue not being recognised in accordance with 
stated accounting policies.
Key audit matter – Group How the matter was addressed in the audit – 
Group
Impact of Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”) 
listing including disclosures, recognition of 
expenditure and share split 
During the year, the Group completed its listing on AIM. 
This creates new disclosure and reporting requirements and 
there is the risk that these new disclosure and reporting 
requirements are not adhered to. 
In addition, significant costs have been incurred as a result of 
the listing and there is the risk that these are not accounted 
for correctly. 
The Group also performed a share split as part of the listing 
resulting in the redenomination of its share capital. There is 
a risk that this split is not accounted for correctly.
We therefore identified this as a significant risk, which 
was one of the most significant assessed risks of material 
misstatement.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
• comparing the financial statements against the latest 
disclosure requirements and best practice and testing the 
validity of disclosures to source supporting documentation;
• completing testing over a sample of the listing costs back 
to third party support and confirming they are valid and 
correctly classified; and
• obtaining supporting documentation in relation to the 
share split and recalculated the accounting entries to 
confirm appropriate application of accounting standards. 
Key observations
Our audit work did not identify any material errors in relation 
to the Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”) listing disclosures, 
or any material instances of costs not being recognised in 
accordance with stated accounting policies, or the share split 
not being accounted for correctly. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit 
of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material 
misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those that had the 
greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts 
of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements 
as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the 
economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality in 
determining the nature, timing and extent of our audit work and in evaluating the results of that work. 
Materiality was determined as follows:
Materiality measure Group Parent
Financial statements as a whole We determined materiality of the Group 
financial statements as whole to be 
£454,850 which is 5% of the Group’s 
profit before taxation and exceptional 
items. This benchmark is considered the 
most appropriate because this is a key 
performance measure used by the Board 
of Directors to report to investors on the 
financial performance of the Group.
Materiality for the current year is lower 
than the level that we determined for 
the year ended 30 September 2016, 
being £503,000, which is a result of the 
decrease in profit before taxation and 
exceptional items over the year. 
£240,000 which is 1% of total assets. 
This benchmark is considered the most 
appropriate because the parent entity is 
a holding company. 
Materiality for the current year is higher 
than the level that we determined for 
the year ended 30 September 2016, 
being £208,000, which is a result of 
an increase in total assets held by the 
parent entity. 
Performance materiality used to drive 
the extent of our testing
70% of financial statement materiality. 70% of financial statement materiality.
Communication of misstatements to 
the Audit Committee
£21,200 and misstatements below that 
threshold that, in our view, warrant 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
£12,000 and misstatements below that 
threshold that, in our view, warrant 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
In connection with our audit of 
the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or 
our knowledge obtained in the 
audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. If we identify 
such material inconsistencies or 
apparent material misstatements, 
we are required to determine 
whether there is a material 
misstatement in the financial 
statements or a material 
misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work 
we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement 
of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact. 
We have nothing to report in 
this regard.
• our audit approach was fully

The Directors are responsible for the 
other information. The other 
information comprises the 
information included in the annual 
report set out on pages 1 to 36, 
other than the financial statements 
and our auditor’s report thereon. Our 
opinion on the financial statements 
does not cover the other information 
and, except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in our report, we do 
not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
An overview of the  
scope of our audit
Our audit approach was based on 
our understanding of the Group’s 
business and is risk-based. We take 
into account the size and risk profile 
of each entity, any changes in the 
business and other factors when 
determining the level of work to be 
performed at each entity: 
• the finance team for all 
subsidiaries is based in the same 
UK location and Group 
management are responsible for 
all judgemental processes 
including significant risk areas; 
• we performed full scope audits 
on the financial information of the 
parent company Nexus 
Infrastructure plc, the principal 
trading entities Tamdown Group 
Limited and TriConnex Limited 
and the remaining trading 
subsidiaries Tamdown Plant Hire 
Limited and Tamdown Services 
Limited. On all other entities in 
the Group, we have completed 
analytical procedures to support 
the Group audit opinion;
Nexus Infrastructure plc | Annual report and financial statements 2017
40 Our opinion on other matters 
prescribed by the Companies  
Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion, based on the 
work undertaken in the course 
of the audit:
• the information given in the 
strategic report and the Directors’ 
report for the financial year for 
which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with 
the financial statements; and
• the strategic report and the 
Directors’ report have been 
prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are  
required to report under the 
Companies Act 2006
In the light of the knowledge and 
understanding of the Group and 
the parent company and its 
environment obtained in the 
course of the audit, we have not 
identified material misstatements 
in the strategic report or the 
Directors’ report. 
Matters on which we are  
required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect 
of the following matters in relation 
to which the Companies Act 2006 
requires us to report to you if, in our 
opinion:
• adequate accounting records 
have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for 
our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial 
statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and 
returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ 
remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
• we have not received all the 
information and explanations 
we require for our audit. 
Responsibilities of Directors for  
the financial statements
As explained more fully in the 
Directors’ responsibilities statement 
set out on page 37, the Directors are 
responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for 
being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view, and for such internal 
control as the Directors determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial 
statements, the Directors are 
responsible for assessing the 
Group’s and the parent company’s 
ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern 
and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless the Directors 
either intend to liquidate the Group 
or the parent company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the 
audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will 
always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud 
or error and are considered material 
if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions 
of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
A further description of our 
responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on 
the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This 
description forms part of our 
auditor’s report.

46 Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 30 September 2017
1. Accounting policies
General information
The principal activity of Nexus 
Infrastructure plc (the “Company”) 
and its subsidiaries (together 
the “Group”) is the provision of 
essential infrastructure services 
to the UK housebuilding and 
commercial sectors.
Those services comprise:
• specialised infrastructure services; 
and
• design, installation and 
connection of utility networks.
The principal trading subsidiaries are 
Tamdown Group Limited, TriConnex 
Limited, Tamdown Services Limited, 
Tamdown Plant Hire Limited and 
Tamdown Regeneration Limited.
The Company is a public limited 
company and is incorporated and 
domiciled in the UK. The address of 
the registered office is 1 Tamdown 
Way, Braintree, Essex CM7 2QL.
The registered number of the 
Company is 05635505.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated and Company 
financial statements are for the 
year ended 30 September 2017. 
They have been prepared in 
compliance with international 
financial reporting standards 
(“IFRSs”) and IFRS interpretations 
committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations 
as adopted by the European Union 
as at 30 September 2017. The 
consolidated and Company financial 
statements have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention 
and are presented in sterling 
rounded to the nearest thousand 
except where indicated otherwise.
Company results
The Company has taken advantage 
of the exemption allowed under 
section 408 of the Companies Act 
and has not presented its own 
statement of comprehensive 
income. The Group profit for the year 
includes a profit for the Company of 
£6,659,000 (2016: £8,815,000).
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities over 
which the Group has the power to 
govern the financial and operating 
policies generally accompanying a 
shareholding of over one half of the 
voting rights.
The consolidated financial 
statements present the results of 
the Company and its subsidiaries 
as if they form a single entity. 
Intercompany transactions and 
balances are therefore eliminated 
in full. The results of acquired 
operations are included in the 
consolidated statement of total 
comprehensive income from the 
date on which control is obtained. 
They are deconsolidated from the 
date on which control ceases.
Going concern
The Directors have undertaken 
a future cash flow analysis and 
as a result have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to meet its 
liabilities as they arise for at least 
12 months from the approval 
of these financial statements and, 
consequently, the Directors have 
adopted the going concern basis 
of accounting in the preparation 
of these financial statements.
Standards in issue  
but not yet effective
There are a number of standards 
issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”)
that are effective for financial 
statements after this reporting 
period. The following have not yet 
been adopted by the Group in 
preparing accounts for the year 
ended 30 September 2017.
 IASB 
Standard effective date
IFRS 9: Financial  
Instruments 1 January 2018
IFRS 15: Revenue  
from Contracts  
with Customers 1 January 2018
IFRS 16: Leases 1 January 2019
The Directors are in the process of 
assessing the potential impacts of 
these standards.
Revenue recognition
Revenue, which excludes 
Intra-group revenue and value 
added tax, comprises:
• value of work executed during the 
year on construction contracts 
based on monthly valuations; and
• contract revenue from the design, 
installation and connection of 
utility networks.
Construction contracts
Contract revenue includes the initial 
amount agreed in the fixed-price 
contract plus any variations in 
contract work, claims and incentive 
payments to the extent that it is 
probable that they will result in a 
flow of future economic benefit to 
the Group and can be measured 
reliably. Contract revenue and 
expenses are recognised in 
accordance with the stage of 
completion of the contract. The 
stage of completion is determined 
by surveys of work performed. 
Contract costs incurred that relate 
to future activities are deferred and 
recognised as work in progress. 
When it is probable that the total 
contract costs will exceed contract 
revenue, the expected loss is 
recognised as an expense 
immediately. To the extent that 
progress billings exceed costs 
incurred plus recognised profits 
(less recognised losses) they are 
recognised as trade receivables.
Contract revenue is recognised in 
accordance with the stage of 
completion of the contract. The 
stage of completion is determined 
by surveys of work performed. 
Margin on construction contracts 
is recognised by reference to the 
stage of completion and the final 
estimated margin, provided that the 
final outcome can be assessed with 
reasonable certainty. Contract costs 
are recognised as expenses in the 
period in which they are incurred, 
subject to the margin adjustments 
discussed below. 
Financial statements Strategic report Governance
Nexus Infrastructure plc | Annual report and financial statements 2017
47 Notes to the financial statements continued
for the year ended 30 September 2017
Retirement benefits: defined 
contribution schemes
The Group operates a defined 
contribution pension scheme. 
Contributions to the defined 
contribution scheme are charged to 
the consolidated statement of total 
comprehensive income in the year 
to which they relate.
Exceptional items
Items that are material in size and 
unusual or infrequent in nature are 
presented in the statement of total 
comprehensive income as 
exceptional items.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and 
equipment are initially recognised 
at cost. As well as the purchase 
price, cost includes directly 
attributable costs.
Depreciation is provided on all items 
of property, plant and equipment so 
as to write off their carrying value over 
the expected useful economic lives. 
It is provided at the following rates:
Land 0% depreciation
Freehold  2.5% 
property straight line
Plant and  25% 
machinery reducing balance
Motor  25% 
vehicles reducing balance
Fixtures and  15-25% 
fittings reducing balance
Leasehold  over the 
improvements life of the lease
Revenue is recognised over the 
period of the contract by reference to 
the stage of completion. The stage of 
completion is measured by reference 
to the contract costs incurred up to 
the end of the reporting period as a 
percentage of total estimated costs 
for each contract.
Contract costs are recognised as 
expenses by reference to the stage of 
completion of the contract activity at 
the end of the reporting period. 
When it is probable that total costs 
will exceed total contract revenue, 
the expected loss is recognised as 
an expense immediately.
Payments on account are shown as a 
liability and are recognised where the 
client has been billed in advance of 
services being supplied. The gross 
amounts due from customers for 
contract work is shown as a 
receivable for all contracts in progress 
for which costs incurred plus 
recognised profits less recognised 
losses and progress billings. The gross 
amounts due to customers for 
contract work is shown as a liability 
for all contracts in progress for which 
the project billings exceed costs 
incurred plus recognised profits. 
Progress billings are amounts billed 
for work performed on a contract 
whether or not they have been paid 
by the customer.
Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of 
costs incurred in bringing each 
product to its present location and 
condition compared to net realisable 
value. Cost of inventory is 
determined as follows:
Work in  Costs of direct 
progress  materials and labour 
 plus attributable 
 overheads based on  
 normal level of  
 activity
Net realisable value is based on an 
estimated selling price less any 
further costs expected to be incurred 
for completion and disposal.
1. Accounting policies continued
Construction contracts continued
Where the actual profit margin to 
date is lower than the final forecast 
profit margin, this variance is classified 
as a work in progress asset on the 
statement of financial position. Where 
the actual to date profit margin is 
higher than the final forecast profit 
margin, this variance is classified as 
an accrual within liabilities. When it is 
probable that the total contract costs 
will exceed contract revenue, the 
expected loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately.
The gross amounts due from 
customers for contract work are 
shown as a receivable for all contracts 
in progress for which costs incurred 
plus recognised profits less 
recognised losses exceed progress 
billings. The gross amounts due to 
customers for contract work is shown 
as a liability for all contracts in 
progress for which the project billings 
exceed costs incurred plus recognised 
profits. Progress billings are amounts 
billed for work performed on a 
contract whether or not they have 
been paid by the customer. 
Retentions are amounts of progress 
billings which are not paid until the 
satisfaction of conditions specified in 
the contract for the payment of such 
amounts. Retentions are received 
upon acceptance by the customer 
of the work performed and included 
as an asset.
Design, installation and connection 
of utility networks
Contract revenue generated 
from the design, installation and 
connection of utility networks is 
recognised when the outcome of a 
construction contract can be reliably 
measured and when it is probable 
that the contract will be profitable.
Nexus Infrastructure plc | Annual report and financial statements 2017
48 Impairment provisions are recognised 
when there is objective evidence 
(such as significant financial difficulties 
on the part of the counterparty or 
default or significant delay in 
payment) that the Group will be 
unable to collect all of the amounts 
due under the terms receivable, the 
amount of such a provision being the 
difference between the net carrying 
amount and the present value of the 
future expected cash flows 
associated with the impaired 
receivable. For the trade receivables, 
which are reported net, such 
provisions are recorded in a separate 
allowance account with the loss being 
recognised within administrative 
expenses in the consolidated 
statement of total comprehensive 
income. On confirmation that the 
trade receivables will not be 
collectable the gross carrying value 
of the asset is written off against the 
associated provision.
Financial liabilities
The Group classifies its financial 
liabilities as financial liabilities at 
amortised cost which include 
the following:
• bank loans which are initially 
recognised at fair value net of any 
transaction costs directly 
attributable to the issue of the 
instrument. Such interest bearing 
liabilities are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost 
ensuring the interest element of 
the borrowing is expensed over 
the repayment period at a 
constant rate.
• trade payables, other 
borrowings and other short-term 
monetary liabilities, which are 
initially recognised at fair value 
and subsequently carried at 
amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial 
assets into the categories, discussed 
below, based upon the purpose for 
which the asset was acquired. The 
Group has not classified any of its 
financial assets as held to maturity.
Loans and receivables
These assets are non-derivative 
financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are 
no quoted in an active market. 
They arise principally through the 
provision of goods and services to 
customers (e.g trade receivables), 
but also incorporate other types 
of contractual monetary asset. 
They are initially recognised at fair 
value plus transaction costs that 
are directly attributable to their 
acquisition or issue, and are 
subsequently carried at amortised 
cost using the effective interest 
method, less provision for impairment.
Loans and receivables comprise trade 
and other receivables included within 
the statement of financial position.
Cash and cash equivalents include 
cash held at bank and short-term 
investments within three months of 
maturity and with insignificant 
likelihood of fluctuations in value.
Bank overdrafts are shown within 
loans and borrowings in current 
liabilities in the consolidated 
statement of financial position. 
For the purposes of the cash flow 
statement they are included in cash.
Intangible assets – goodwill
Goodwill is the excess of the cost 
of an acquired entity over the net 
of the amounts assigned to assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed. 
It is capitalised as an intangible 
asset and allocated to cash 
generating units (with separately 
identifiable cash flows) and is 
subject to impairment testing on 
an annual basis or more frequently 
if circumstances indicate that the 
asset may have been impaired.
Intangible assets – impairment
Intangible assets with indefinite lives 
are subject to impairment tests 
annually at the financial year end. 
The carrying values of non-financial 
assets with finite lives are reviewed 
for impairment when there is an 
indication that assets might be 
impaired. When the carrying value 
of an asset exceeds its recoverable 
amount, the asset is written 
down accordingly. 
When it is not possible to estimate 
the recoverable amount of an 
individual asset, the impairment 
test is carried out on the asset’s 
cash generating unit (i.e the smallest 
group of assets in which the asset 
belongs for which there are 
separately identifiable cash flows).
Impairment charges are included 
in the consolidated statement of 
total comprehensive income, 
except to the extent they reverse 
previous gains recognised in the 
consolidated statement of total 
comprehensive income. An 
impairment loss recognised 
for goodwill is not reversed.

Nexus Infrastructure plc | Annual report and financial statements 2017
49 1. Accounting policies continued
Investments
Subsidiaries
The Group has investments in 
subsidiaries which are carried 
at deemed cost.
Securities
The Group’s investment in listed 
shares is ‘available for sale’ and 
carried at fair value being the 
published price of the individual 
share holdings at the reporting date. 
Movements in fair value are taken to 
the other comprehensive income 
until the investment is sold when it is 
reclassified to profit or loss. These are 
measured fair value level 1, as they 
are derived from quoted prices in an 
active market for identical assets.
Equity
• Share capital – the nominal value 
of equity shares.
• Retained earnings – profits 
which have been retained within 
the business.
Share capital
Financial instruments issued by the 
Group are treated as equity only to 
the extent that they do not meet 
the definition of a financial liability 
which is a contractual obligation 
to deliver cash or similar to another 
entity or a potentially unfavourable 
exchange of financial assets or 
liabilities with another entity. 
Dividends
Final equity dividends to the 
shareholders of Nexus Infrastructure 
plc are recognised in the period that 
they are approved by shareholders. 
Interim equity dividends are 
recognised in the period that they 
are paid.
Dividends receivable are recognised 
when the Company’s right to receive 
payment is established.
Leased assets
Where the risks and rewards of 
ownership of an asset are transferred 
to the Group as lessee, the lease is 
treated as a finance lease. Other 
leases are treated as operating leases. 
Future minimum lease payments 
payable under finance leases net of 
finance charges are included in 
creditors with the corresponding asset 
values recorded in property, plant 
and equipment and depreciated over 
the shorter of their estimated useful 
lives or their lease terms. Lease 
payments are apportioned between 
the finance element, which is 
charged to the statement of total 
comprehensive income as interest, 
and the capital element, which 
reduces the outstanding obligation 
for future instalments.
Payments under operating leases are 
charged to profit or loss on a straight 
line basis over the lease term.
Tax
Tax on the profit or loss for the year 
comprises current and deferred 
tax. Tax is recognised in the 
consolidated statement of total 
comprehensive income. 
Current tax is the expected tax 
payable on the taxable income for 
the year, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the date of 
the statement of financial position , 
and any adjustment to tax payable 
in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are recognised where the carrying 
amount of an asset or liability in the 
consolidated statement of financial 
position differs from its tax base, 
except for differences arising on:
• the initial recognition of goodwill;
• the initial recognition of an asset 
or liability in a transaction which 
is not a business combination and 
at the time of the transaction 
affects neither accounting nor 
taxable profit; and
• investments in subsidiaries are 
jointly controlled entities where 
the Group is able to control the 
timing of the reversal of the 
difference and it is probable that 
the difference will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is 
restricted to those instances where it 
is probable that taxable profit will be 
available against which the 
difference can be utilised.
The amount of the asset or liability is 
determined using tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the reporting date and 
are expected to apply when the 
deferred tax liabilities or assets are 
settled or recovered. Deferred tax 
balances are not discounted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are

50 Share-based payments
The share option scheme allows 
employees to acquire shares in the 
capital of the Company. The fair 
value of these share options is 
determined using the Binomial 
model. The share-based payment is 
recognised as an expense in the 
statement of total comprehensive 
income, together with a 
corresponding credit to retained 
earnings in equity. This expense is 
recognised on a straight line basis 
based on the Group’s estimate of the 
number of shares that will vest. 
The admission to AIM triggered 
settlement of certain incentive 
arrangements with members of 
management. Share options vested 
on the admission of the parent 
company to the London Stock 
Exchange. The fair value of the 
share options is measured at the 
grant date using the Binomial 
model and is recognised as an 
expense in the statement of total 
comprehensive income, together 
with a corresponding credit to 
retained earnings in equity. This 
expense has been recognised in full.
Group reorganisation
On 1 October 2016, the Group 
completed an internal reorganisation 
with TriConnex Limited being 
transferred by dividend in specie 
to Nexus Infrastructure plc. 
TriConnex Limited is considered 
to be under common control and 
predecessor accounting has been 
judged to be the most appropriate 
accounting policy. No gain or loss 
arose on this transaction.
2. Critical accounting estimates 
and judgements
The Group makes certain estimates 
and judgements regarding the 
future. Estimates and judgements 
are continually evaluated based on 
historical experience and other 
factors, including the expectations of 
future events that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances. 
In the future, actual experience may 
differ from these estimates and 
judgements:
• recoverability of debt – as part of 
the process of gaining new 
business it is necessary to carry 
out checks on the organisations 
for which the Group will carry out 
work. The value of individual 
contracts is substantial and the 
risk of default is always present 
so the estimate of the 
non-recoverability of the debt 
made by the Directors is critical. 
See note 15 for further details; 
and
• profitability of contracts – 
individual contracts are 
negotiated so as to provide a 
reasonable return to the Group. 
The calculation of the margin to 
be achieved and the pricing set 
by the Directors is of paramount 
importance to the success of the 
Group. The Directors make an 
accounting judgement which is 
an assessment on the profitability 
and margin of contracts.
3. Capital management
The Group’s capital is made up 
of share capital and retained 
earnings totalling £17,013,000 
(2016: £13,376,000).
The Group’s objectives when 
maintaining capital are:
• to safeguard the entity’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, so 
that it can continue to provide 
returns for shareholders and 
benefits for other stakeholders; 
and
• to provide an adequate return 
to shareholders by pricing services 
commensurately with the level 
of risk.
The capital structure of the Group 
consists of shareholders equity as set 
out in the consolidated statement of 
changes in equity. All working 
capital requirements are financed 
from existing cash resources.
4. Revenue
All revenues are generated from the 
supply of construction services.

     £’000 £’000

Impairment testing
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment. During the year, impairment tests were undertaken over the 
goodwill of Tamdown Group Limited (£2,361,000). There are considered to be the two cash generating units (“CGUs”) in 
the Group which will provide the future economic benefit to the Group comprising Tamdown Group Limited and 
TriConnex Limited. No goodwill is attached to TriConnex Limited.
The recoverable amount was determined using a value-in-use calculation based upon management forecasts for 
the trading results for the three years ending 30 September 2020 extended to 30 June 2022 with long-term average 
growth of 2.5%, which was based upon the historical long-term growth rate of the UK economy.
A discount rate of 10% has been used in this calculation, which is based upon the capital structure of the Group. 
Changes to the capital structure may impact upon the Group’s discount rate in future periods. The key assumptions 
utilised within the forecast model relates to the level of future sales, which have been estimated based upon the 
Directors’ expectations, current trading and recent actual trading performance. The value-in-use calculation 
indicates that Tamdown Group Limited has a recoverable amount which is £16.5m greater than the carrying amount 
of assets allocated to them. The Directors have undertaken sensitivity analysis and do not feel that a reasonable 
change in assumption will give rise to an impairment.

26. Financial risk management
The Group and Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: credit risk and liquidity risk. The overall 
risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential 
adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. Risk management is carried out by the Board and their 
policies are outlined below.
a) Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss. 
In order to minimise this risk the Group endeavours only to deal with companies which are demonstrably 
creditworthy and this, together with the aggregate financial exposure, is continuously monitored.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is the value of the outstanding amount of cash balances and trade and 
other receivables:
     2017 2016 
     £’000 £’000
Group     64,907 67,404
Company     412 116
Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is considered to be small as the counterparties are all substantial banks 
with high credit ratings. The maximum exposure is the amount of the deposit.
Provision of services by members of the Group results in trade receivables which the management consider to be 
of low risk. The management do not consider that there is any concentration of risk within either trade or other 
receivables.
b) Liquidity risk
Group
The Group currently holds cash balances in sterling to provide funding for normal trading activity. The Group also 
has access to additional equity funding and, for short-term flexibility, overdraft facilities would be arranged with the 
Group’s bankers. Trade and other payables are monitored as part of normal management routine. The Group’s 
financial liabilities have contractual maturities as summarised below:
    Within one year Two to five years Over five years 
2017    £’000 £’000 £’000
Borrowings    2,191 6,821 —
Net obligations under finance leases/hire purchase agreements  656 619 —
Trade payables    28,214 — —
Accruals and payments on account   19,070 — —
Other payables    1,967 — —

Trade payables    23,586 — —
Accruals and payments on account   24,166 — —
Other payables    1,564 — —
The bank loans and overdrafts are secured by cross guarantees from other Group undertakings.

c) Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
• to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders; and
• to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group will also seek to minimise the cost of capital and attempt to optimise the capital structure, which 
currently means maintaining equity funding and managing fixed term loan and finance lease agreements. 
Share capital amounts to £762,000 (2016: £755,000).
Capital for further development of the Groups activities will, where possible, be achieved by share issues and not 
by increasing debt levels.

A summary of the arrangements is shown below:
Arrangement Contractual life Vesting conditions
Share incentive plan Rolling scheme  All employees who were employed by the Group on 11 July 2017 were 
awarded 100 free shares that are subject to a three-year holding period. 
These will be forfeited if the employee leaves before the end of the holding 
period. Employees can also purchase partnership shares that are immediately 
exercisable. The Group matches partnership shares on a one for three basis.  
The Group matching shares are only exercisable after three years.
Share options (2016) Three years  For the Executive Directors the award will vest on the third anniversary of 
the grant date of 16 August 2019 if performance conditions have been met. 
The performance conditions include an EPS growth target for the three 
financial years from 1 October 2015 to 30 September 2018.
Share options (2017) Three years  For the Executive Directors the award will vest on the third anniversary of 
the grant date of 15 June 2020 if performance conditions have been met.

shares of £0.02 each.
