Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
Spire Healthcare serves a market 
subject to major long-term trends. 
The UK’s population is growing. 
People are living longer, often with 
multiple co-morbidities. The NHS  
is the UK’s most valued institution, 
but it is struggling under the 
longest budget squeeze in its 
history. Private provision can play  
a key role in helping to meet the 
UK’s increasing healthcare needs.

Spire opportunity
Spire Healthcare has traditionally 
provided outstanding care and outcomes 
for orthopaedic patients, particularly 
those receiving hip and knee replacements 
later in life. Additionally, Spire Healthcare 
has invested heavily over recent years 
in higher acuity services, including 
cancer and cardiac, ideally positioning 
the Company to care for the growing 
number of mature patients with 
multiple and challenging co-morbidities.
Market context
Trend
In 2016 the population of the UK was 
66m
its largest ever. It is projected to reach over
74m
by 2039
And it is ageing. Those over 65 are forecast 
to grow from
18%
of the population (2016) to nearly
25%
by 2046

Serving an ageing population
Commentary
People with long-term conditions 
account for about 50% of all GP 
appointments, 64% of all out-patient 
appointments and over 70% of all 
in-patient bed days. The number of 
people with three or more long-term 
conditions is predicted to reach 2.9 million 
in 2018 (up from 1.9 million in 2008).
Treatment and care for people with 
long-term conditions takes an estimated 
70% of total health and social care 
expenditure. The ageing population  
and increased prevalence of long-term 
conditions will inevitably create rising 
demand for healthcare services and  
have a significant impact on resources.

Trend
The NHS delivers comprehensive 
healthcare to the nation. It is a 
treasured national institution and is 
widely considered to be both efficient 
and unique in offering care to all, free at 
the point of care. Spire is proud to be a 
partner to the NHS. However, it is under 
the most intense strain it has ever faced – 
hit by underfunding, staff shortages, 
ever rising demand, a fragmented 
structure and the systemic division 
between health and social care. 
Historically, spending on the NHS has 
grown by an average 3.7% per year. 
From 2010–2011 to 2020–2021, average 
growth is expected to be 0.9%. The NHS 
is suffering the longest budget squeeze 
in its history.
In the last 30 years the number of 
NHS beds has halved, admissions have 
doubled and bed stays have halved. 
The UK now has 2.6 beds per 1,000 
people. In Germany it’s over eight and 
it is 6.1 in France. The NHS is estimated 
to be running at about 95% occupancy.
As at December 2017, the NHS was short 
of an estimated 42,000 nurses, 11,000 
hospital doctors and 12,000 nurse 
support workers.
2
In the same month, the percentage 
of A&E patients being treated within 
the politically important 95% four-hour 
target reached its lowest ever level at 
77.3%, and the Government instructed 
the postponement of selected non-
urgent surgery.

Commentary
A national debate is starting to 
emerge on whether the NHS is correctly 
structured and adequately funded  
for the 21st century. 
There is increasing acceptance that 
the country needs to spend more on 
healthcare as a percentage of gross 
domestic product (‘GDP’). 
The private sector, while likely to remain 
relatively small, can help the NHS deliver 
outstanding healthcare and provide 
choice to consumers. 
In the UK, healthcare spending as a share 
of GDP is projected to fall to 
6.6% 
by 2021, according to The Economist. 
This compares with the EU average of 
9.9% 
or the G7 average of 
11.3% 
(2015) 
The UK spends less per head of population 
than nine other EU countries and ranks 
sixth in the G7
Spire opportunity
Lengthening waiting times and 
rationing of treatment within the 
NHS is increasingly reflected in demand 
for private healthcare – particularly  
on a Self-pay basis. The private sector 
also provides capacity for the NHS, 
optimising usage of facilities and helping 
to maintain provision in periods of 
highest demand.
Spire Healthcare’s nationwide presence, 
modern facilities and capacity is well 
placed to provide services to both local 
NHS commissioners and providers,  
and to self-paying patients. 
Spire Healthcare’s strategy puts 
the patient first and centre. We are 
re-engineering every aspect of our service  
to enable patients to access our services 
quickly, efficiently and on a cost  
assured basis.

Financial strength
We benefit from financial 
strength and stability, 
supported by a cash-generative 
operating model and 
properties in commercially 
attractive locations across 
the UK.
Well invested hospitals
Our portfolio of hospitals 
is equipped with up-to-date 
technology and comfortable  
treatment facilities.
Highly skilled employees
Our 8,380 employees are highly 
skilled and our nursing and 
medical support staff have  
the expertise to provide  
an excellent standard  
of patient care.
Clinical Governance
During the year under review 
the Care Quality Commission 
(‘CQC’) completed their first 
round of comprehensive 
inspections across all of our 
hospitals and results have been 
published for all sites. We are 
pleased to report that our 
overall performance is in line 
with the rest of the private 
sector and continues to far 
exceed the NHS average.
Our relationships
Referrers
We work with GPs to facilitate 
speedy, convenient and fully 
informed referrals. We are

Consultants
Consultants are integral 
to providing high levels of 
medical care to our patients 
and we offer them the facilities 
and support they need to 
deliver outstanding healthcare. 
All our consultants are on the 
General Medical Council’s

Patients 
We offer treatments for 
patients who have private 
health insurance or wish to 
pay for their own treatment. 
We offer them choice of 
when and where to be treated, 
in hospitals that combine 
excellent clinical outcomes and 
levels of infection control with 
‘hotel style’ levels of service.
Payors 
Treatment is funded by a PMI, 
the NHS or patients who 
Self-pay.
The patient pathway
We receive patients through multiple routes. 
The patient’s journey typically begins with a 
visit to their GP, who will either treat the patient 
directly or provide a referral to a consultant. 
The procedure or treatment provided by the 
consultant can be funded by the NHS, a PMI 
provider or by the patient self-paying.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
Chairman’s statement
In a year of considerable change and challenge, 
I am proud to report that Spire Healthcare’s 
8,380 staff, and the leading consultants we  
work with, provided over 775,000 private  
and NHS patients with outstanding clinical 
care and outcomes. Exceptional patient care 
is our business.”
Performance
The Company’s performance over the year 
showed further growth in our key private 
patient income and reasonable progress 
on our three new major capital investment 
projects that became operational during 
the year. Group revenue was £931.7 million, 
£5.3 million ahead of 2016. On an underlying 
basis, the Group delivered consistent gross 
margins of over 48%. Operating profit, 
however, fell significantly to £42.9 million. 
This was the result of both our new 
hospital openings; of exceptional and 
other material items totalling £49.2 million 
in the year arising from the patient 
compensation costs in respect to Ian 
Paterson’s historical practises; the write 
down of our Specialist Cancer Care Centre 
in Essex; and the decision to cease work on 
the development of a central London site. 
Additional information on exceptional 
and other items is shown on pages 124 
and 125. Our cash flow, however, remained 
robust and our total dividend has been 
maintained at 3.8p. 
Revenue grew by 0.6% despite in-patient 
and daycase admissions decreasing 
by 1.8% to 269,300 patients (2016: 
274,100 patients). 
Garry Watts, Chairman 9 
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
Governance Strategic Report Financial statements Other information
Revenues from Private Medical Insurance 
(‘PMI’) sources declined slightly in 2017, 
while underlying revenues (see further 
information on page 35) in our Self-pay 
payor group grew strongly, increasing 
by 12.0%. Underlying revenues from 
the NHS also declined by 0.5% due to 
patient choice and eligibility for treatment 
beginning to be actively restricted by 
Clinical Commissioning Group (‘CCG’) 
policies in response to NHS cost pressures 
in the second half of 2017. 
Dividend
The Company continues to be strongly 
cash-generative, which will enable the 
payment, subject to shareholder approval, 
of a final dividend of 2.5 pence per 
ordinary share for the year. Together 
with the interim dividend of 1.3 pence 
per ordinary share, this amounts to a total 
annual dividend of 3.8 pence per ordinary 
share, continuing our stated dividend 
policy which aims to pay at least 20% 
of profit after taxation each year. 
Care quality
The quality of our patient care is of 
paramount importance. It is at the  
heart of what we do.
Three of our hospitals are rated 
‘Outstanding’ by the Care Quality 
Commission (‘CQC’), 20 hospitals and 
two clinics as ‘Good’, and 11 as requiring 
improvement in certain areas. Overall, our 
quality of care is rated at the forefront of 
the independent sector. More detail on 
our clinical performance, quality of care, 
and the unstinting efforts we are making 
to improve further, can be found in our 
Clinical review on pages 20 to 25.
Following the completion of the 
criminal proceedings against Ian 
Paterson (a consultant who previously 
had practising privileges at two Spire 
Healthcare hospitals), we were able to 
agree to settle all current and known 
claims against Spire Healthcare. A charge 
amounting to £28.7 million for the cost 
of such settlement is included in the 
results for the year, in addition to other 
costs associated with the matter. 
We deeply regret the circumstances  
but are pleased that the unfortunate 
victims of Mr Paterson’s activities have 
now received compensation. Your Board 
is determined that the lessons learnt 
from this affair will be applied throughout 
Spire Healthcare. 
Developments during the year
In the first half of 2017, we completed and 
opened two new hospitals in Manchester 
and Nottingham – we continue to develop 
their full potential. In the second half 
of the year, after major investment in 
expanded theatre capacity and additional 
staff at our 2014 acquisition, Spire 
St Anthony’s Hospital started to deliver 
improved performance.
Acquisition approach
During the year we received an approach 
from Mediclinic, our principal shareholder, 
with an offer to purchase the outstanding 
shares in the Company. The Board 
concluded that the offer did not value the 
Company sufficiently and we were unable 
to reach agreement. Mediclinic continues 
to have a seat on the Board and remains 
a valued international collaborator.
Board developments
In October, we were delighted to secure 
the services of Justin Ash as Chief 
Executive Officer (‘CEO’). Justin has 
a wealth of relevant experience. He was 
previously chief executive of Oasis Dental 
Care where he built the UK’s first national 
consumer driven dental brand. Prior to 
that he was Managing Director of Lloyds 
Pharmacy, where he grew the estate from 
1,250 to 1,750 outlets and led a refocus 
of the business towards health services.
In May, Peter Bamford joined the Board 
as the Company’s Deputy Chairman 
and Senior Independent Director. Peter 
is chairman of both Superdry Plc and B&M 
European Value Retail SA. He previously 
held a number of senior executive roles at 
Vodafone Group plc and has served on the 
boards of public companies for the last 
21 years. He brings considerable leadership 
experience and maintains a strong 
independent presence on our Board.
At the end of July, we regretfully announced 
that Andrew White, an Executive Director 
and our former Chief Operating Officer, 
had passed away following a period of 
illness. Andrew joined the Company in 
2015, he was a trusted colleague and 
made a significant contribution during 
his time with us. He is greatly missed.
Following Andrew’s death, Simon Gordon 
assumed the role of interim Chief Executive 
Officer in addition to his role as Chief 
Financial Officer. Our thanks go to  
him for his additional contribution  
over this difficult period. 
Subsequent to the year end, on 1 March 
2018, Simon Gordon, our Chief Financial 
Officer (‘CFO’), resigned from the Board 
and will leave the Group at the end of 
March 2018. Simon has been CFO since 
2012 and, whilst I was undergoing 
treatment for an illness last year, also 
assumed the role of interim CEO. 
Personally, and on behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank him for his services 
to the Group in both roles and to wish 
him every success in the future. 
Strategy
Our new CEO has brought further clarity 
and purpose to our established strategy. 
In his Review on pages 10 to 14, Justin 
gives further details on the Company’s 
renewed and absolute focus on improving 
our offering to patients and enhancing 
clinical outcomes. Before we embark on 
further major expansion we will continue 
to develop and embed the highest levels 
of clinical performance in every one of 
our hospitals across the country.
Our people
Delivering our strategy depends on our 
people, it is they who deliver outstanding 
care, personally, every day to our patients. 
Thanks go to all our staff, every one of 
who is a highly valued member of the 
Spire Healthcare family. It is by working 
together closely and making a positive 
contribution to the business that they 
drive our strong culture. 
Outlook
2017 was a year of considerable change 
and challenge but with some notable 
achievements. During 2018 we will 
concentrate on developing our people, 
on refining our systems and building the 
returns on our recent investments in new 
hospitals and additional capacity. In doing 
so, we will be able to deliver outstanding 
treatment and care to more people and 
continue to build Spire Healthcare’s 
nationwide reputation for quality and 
excellent outcomes.

We need to be the best in everything we

our consultants, recruiting and retaining  
our staff, achieving the best outcomes,  
and delivering value.
I am determined that Spire Healthcare

across Britain every day. 
My many visits to our hospitals and our 
CQC ratings show that Spire Healthcare 
staff are devoted to caring for our patients, 
well qualified and dedicated. Their work 
is underpinned by good governance 
practices. I’ve seen this in every hospital 
I’ve visited and the many staff I’ve met, 
as well as the patients I’ve spoken with.
Spire Healthcare clinical standards are 
good, with lots of examples of outstanding 
best practice and interesting improvement 
projects. There are, nonetheless, variations 
in quality. Three of our hospitals – Spire 
Cheshire, The Montefiore and Sussex 
hospitals – are rated ‘Outstanding’ by the 
CQC, and we have excellent equivalent 
results in Spire Cardiff and Edinburgh 
hospitals. Twenty more are rated 
‘Good’, while some were rated ‘Requires 
Improvement’ on their first CQC inspection. 
Overall, this puts Spire Healthcare on a par 
with private sector healthcare standards.  11

Similarly, Spire Healthcare runs effective 
operations, good local marketing 
campaigns and has seen success in 
growing its private patient base. The estate 
is well invested and often innovative, 
for example, developing a da Vinci robot 
in Spire Southampton Hospital and knee 
robots in Spire Edinburgh and Bushey 
hospitals. It has strong central teams, 
and good local hospital leadership under 
its hospital directors. As with clinical 
standards, there is also lots of opportunity 
to be more consistent as a unified group.
My overall impression is of a good, well-run 
healthcare provider, with lots of exciting 
opportunity to improve operational 
performance, patient recruitment and 
deliver more consistently outstanding 
quality for the benefit of our patients.
What was performance like in 2017?
I joined in late October 2017, after  
a period of some volatility in operating 
performance.
Where our work matters most, with 
patients, Spire Healthcare cared for 
269,300 in-patient and daycase patients 
during the year. Clinical quality remained 
high, with good outcomes and only one 
incident of MRSA or MSSA, and c.difficile 
infection rates reducing further to 0.13 
per 10,000 bed days. You can read details 
on this in our Group Medical Director’s 
review on pages 20 to 25. 
Headline financial performance figures 
can be found in the Chairman’s statement, 
and the CFO reviews them in detail on 
pages 32 to 43. The results were mixed 
overall. Spire Healthcare experienced a 
reduction in NHS-funded care, especially 
contracts with NHS Trusts, and NHS-
funded care actually declined in the 
second half of the year. This was driven 
by cost saving measures by the NHS. 
Income from Private Medical Insurance 
(‘PMI’) funded care declined slightly, 
while treatment and care for patients 
who chose to Self-pay increased strongly 
by 12.0%, an encouraging trend, which 
we expect to continue.
A major variance to expectations was 
the slower-than-planned build-up of 
the three new sites: Spire Manchester, 
Spire Nottingham and Spire St Anthony’s 
hospitals. These are all outstanding 
facilities that I’m delighted to have in the 
Group. Improving their performance will 
be a key feature of our forward strategy. 
How do you see trends in Spire 
Healthcare’s markets?
The trends in our three main payor 
groups are connected to a certain degree. 
PMI is currently about half of our business, 
but it remains largely a benefit provided 
by companies for their employees. 
As such, overall growth in PMI is linked 
closely to the health of the economy 
and has remained flat. Forward growth 
in this sector, in the short term, will 
come from growing market share.
The independent sector provides valuable 
capacity for the NHS as it seeks to deliver 
care in the face of well publicised cost, 
capacity and staffing pressures. Our 
NHS business is important to us and 
we will continue to build close working 
partnerships with our local commissioners 
and GPs. Major contracts with NHS trusts 
are unlikely to grow in the future, while 
e-Referral is still not fully adopted. 
This provides choice for NHS patients, 
underpinned in the NHS constitution, 
and Spire Healthcare’s wide participation 
in this is an asset. Overall, we seek to hold 
share in the NHS market.
Our major growth opportunity lies in 
those patients who elect to Self-pay. 
Their reasons for choosing to pay for 
private treatment vary. They may wish 
to be seen faster as waiting times on the 
NHS continue to rise, or seek treatments 
that are unavailable within the NHS. They 
may feel that they can self-insure more 
competitively and flexibly than through 
PMI products. They may just value the 
convenience of having their treatment 
when and where they want, in hotel-level 
surroundings, with well-invested facilities. 
Whatever their motivation, the macro 
market drivers suggest that Self-pay 
will be our key growth sector. We intend 
to grow our market share aggressively  
in this area.
I want every member of  
the Spire Healthcare family 
to judge themselves on  
the quality of the care they 
deliver to our patients.”  12 
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
What are your immediate priorities?
Consistently high-quality and outstanding 
clinical care are fundamental to 
our business. 
I think patients see us as good, but  
maybe not the best everywhere – and  
in truth, while some of our hospitals are 
outstanding, others are less consistent. 
Raising standards to the highest levels  
and ensuring consistency of approach  
and delivery across the Company, in every 
hospital, is our first and last priority. 
We want all our hospitals to be ‘Good’ 
or ‘Outstanding’. All of the time. I intend 
Spire Healthcare to be famous for both 
its quality of care and its ability to 
evidence that quality.
We also need to optimise operational 
performance, particularly in our recent 
major investments. I have conducted a 
review of lessons learnt about the cultural 
and operational changes required in 
developing and moving into new facilities, 
and drawn on my extensive experience of 
buying and opening new healthcare sites. 
All three new hospitals are top of my list 
to steer to robust financial performance, 
as well as being great centres of patient 
care. I was delighted that Spire St Anthony’s 
Hospital was recently re-rated ‘Good’ by 
the CQC and see much evidence that all 
three sites will deliver strong returns. I am 
pleased to say that Spire Manchester and 
St Anthony’s hospitals are making good 
progress. Both should be profitable in 
2018. Spire Nottingham Hospital will take 
further work to achieve its full potential.
We will also rapidly be enhancing 
Spire Healthcare’s marketing capability, 
especially digitally, to make our Self-pay 
offering transparent and easy to access, 
as well as improving our call services. 
This will support our Self-pay 
growth ambitions.
With more central support, an increased 
focus on leadership, training and human 
resources, enhanced leadership, and a  
lot of hard work, I am confident Spire 
Healthcare will deliver excellent outcomes 
in the months ahead.
We will continue to invest in our current 
estate, with a view to continuing to be the 
lead investor in the sector. At the same 
time, in the short to medium term we will 
be focused on increasing the return on 
capital and cash returns of historical and 
new investments, and cautious about 
further new hospital developments until 
the case for them is proven by results.
How do you see Spire Healthcare’s  
services developing?
In a number of ways – all aimed at 
increasing patient, staff and partner 
satisfaction. 
Clinically, we will focus on specific 
elements of our care, including our 
patients’ understanding of their mobility 
after a procedure, and their comfort with 
what drugs to take and how to recover 
effectively on their return home. We want 
to empower our patients to a speedy 
recovery and active life.
We will continue to develop service 
lines in demand in the private sector, in 
particular Spire Healthcare has a growing 
paediatric and cardiology capability. 
Operationally, we will have one best way 
of working in increasing areas, aligning 
all our hospitals around simple, national 
systems and operating approach – one 
‘Spire Way’ of working – while leaving 
room for local best practice and strong 
leadership by our hospitals’ senior 
management teams.
We need to improve engagement with 
our partners, which slipped last year. 
Based on targeted understanding of 
consultants and the development of 
their private practices, we will provide 
the support and services that they need. 
We wish consultants to grow their 
practice with us, and to feel that Spire 
Healthcare is the very best place to bring 
patients, as well as further developing 
a mutual respect for the importance of 
governance on the granting and overseeing 
of practising privileges. Spire Healthcare 
works hard to ensure that GPs recommend 
patients to us based on sound knowledge 
of our capabilities and this will continue.
I am also excited by the early success of 
Spire GP . People with busy lives are turning 
to this service for flexible and bespoke care, 
and we will soon roll this out to all our sites.
In the last three months, 
the executive committee 
and I have developed our 
strategic framework to 
support a renewed focus 
on growing our business. 
We have put in place five 
clear strategic priorities to 
help us achieve the growth 
we believe we can deliver. 
This aims to drive improving 
returns on capital.”

How important is the culture of  Spire 
Healthcare on the success of the business?
Since joining Spire Healthcare I have spent 
a lot of time in our hospitals meeting 
many colleagues, and it was clear right 
from my first visits that we have a strong, 
positive culture across the business. 
Our colleagues are passionate about 
the work they do and the care they 
provide to our patients. They are 
fundamental to the success of the 
business so it is hugely important 
to me that they are highly engaged. 
The innovative ideas, feedback and 
suggestions that I have heard first hand 
from colleagues are invaluable so we have 
introduced mechanisms to further 
encourage this, along with promoting 
collaborative working across our hospitals 
and support functions. I believe our values 
help demonstrate and represent how we 
work together so we will further increase 
awareness of these and what they mean 
to our colleagues in their day-to-day roles. 
Recognising the contribution of our 
colleagues is a key element of our culture 
and I am confident that our new 
recognition scheme will reinforce the 
importance we place on this. 
How do you see Spire Healthcare’s 
strategy developing? 
The summary of our ambitions is that 
we aim to be the most recognised and 
respected healthcare provider brand 
in the UK. I call that being the ‘go to’ 
brand in UK independent healthcare.
We will become famous for our clinical 
quality and customer care.
This will underpin growth in all three 
payor sectors. We will work with the 
NHS to see us as their preferred local 
option for high-quality treatments, and 
with PMI providers to feel comfortable 
signposting Spire Healthcare as the 
benchmark provider in all our services. 
A high-quality brand will underpin our 
communication with people who are 
increasingly looking for a Self-pay route to 
fast, effective and personalised treatment.
Accelerating growth and developing the 
market-leading national brand that makes 
Spire Healthcare the first choice of all 
patients – but particularly those self-
paying – will depend on outstanding 
performance, transparency in pricing 
and clinical excellence. 
We will seek continuous improvement 
and consistency in our relationship with 
consultants, in the capability of our teams 
and in operational excellence at all levels. 
All this aims to support a steadily improving 
return on the recent substantial capital 
investment in Spire Healthcare.
Simply put, we will aim to run outstanding 
hospitals, totally focused on delivering 
outstanding quality of care, consistently 
in all our sites. That’s how Spire Healthcare 
will grow to be the UK market leader. 
Justin Ash
Chief Executive Officer
1 March 2018
In practical terms, some of the enablers 
involved include increasing investment 
in digital tools, communication, customer 
feedback and service development, 
and hospital infrastructure.
What do you see as key in helping 
your team to deliver?
Sometimes, in healthcare, people get 
very excited about technology, which 
does indeed play a vital role in Spire 
Healthcare’s well invested proposition. 
I get most excited about our people. 
Everything we do depends on them, they 
deliver our promise to patients every day. 
Healthcare is hard work, requiring 
passion and commitment, be that in 
Spire Healthcare or any other provider. 
I am committed to increasing the training 
and recognition needed to support and 
engage that commitment, and we have a 
number of initiatives underway to do this. 
It is also well recognised that in some 
areas there are shortages of qualified  
staff. This makes it even more important 
to attract, train, retain and develop our 
staff in a much more considered and 
consistent manner.
Success is also linked directly to leadership, 
particularly at the key hospital director and 
matron levels. Here we are launching an 
externally validated programme to identify, 
evaluate, train, motivate and develop 
consistently great leaders, to complement 
our many internal conferences and 
specialist skills events. I have enjoyed 
joining the first cohorts on our new 
hospital director programme.
Spire Healthcare will continue to foster 
a well-structured environment and culture 
that encourages feedback and values ideas, 
learning and constant improvement. 
Should it be needed, Spire Healthcare 
also runs a highly robust and confidential 
whistleblowing procedure to ensure 
everyone feels free to hold us to account 
for the highest standards of conduct 
and care.

Five reasons to invest  
in Spire Healthcare
01 
Spire Healthcare bridges the gap 
between rising healthcare demand 
and projected NHS budgets
With NHS funding tightening and 
healthcare demand growing, Spire 
Healthcare is well positioned to help 
bridge the gap. Spire healthcare is 
able to benefit from its inherent 
‘payor hedge’ as more people elect 
to be PMI or self-paying patients. 
Strong growth in Self-pay in particular 
is set to continue as Spire Healthcare 
rolls out its enhanced consumer 
proposition.
05
Spire Healthcare has a track record 
on innovation and learning
As well as opening new sites, 
Spire Healthcare is often first to 
develop new services, such as the 
da Vinci robot at Spire Southampton 
Hospital. Spire is actively developing 
bariatric, paediatric, cardiology and 
cancer services. Like all innovation, 
not all developments succeed at first, 
but as with the best innovative 
organisations, it learns and then 
re-invests in adapted services. This 
drive to innovate and grow existing 
and new service lines remains a key 
feature of its investment proposition.
03 
Spire Healthcare is able to invest 
in its future and target returns
Robust operating cash flows enable 
Spire Healthcare to sustain a healthy 
capital expenditure programme and  
maintain an attractive dividend  
payout ratio. 
Going forward, Spire Healthcare will 
focus on maintaining and developing its 
existing hospitals and clinics. The payback 
periods for such incremental investments 
tend to be much shorter; therefore better 
returns on the capital investment should 
be achievable. 
02 
Spire Healthcare benefits from scale 
in a market that demands excellence
The hospital environment is rightly 
subject to regulation and oversight, 
and rising patient expectation on 
service and quality. Spire Healthcare’s 
national network allows it to 
simultaneously enforce consistent 
standards, assess performance 
and raise quality of delivery by 
leveraging its central resource and 
information systems. This delivers 
a strong patient proposition and 
payor confidence. National scale also 
brings economic benefit in buying, 
distribution and increasingly 
marketing and sales effectiveness.
04 
Spire Healthcare is well structured 
to lead on private growth
Whilst continuing to focus on 
relationships with each of its three 
major payor groups, it is increasingly 
prioritising investment designed to 
accelerate Self-pay growth. Developing 
our Self-pay opportunity whilst 
driving participation in existing robust 
healthcare insurer arrangements. 
The majority of its hospitals are 
able to accommodate the flexibility 
required by the Self-pay patient, 
while continuing to support the 
local NHS demands. 16

Looking after you
Good to 
Outstanding 
We want all our hospitals to be rated 
‘Outstanding’ by the CQC (or the required 
equivalent); regulatory recognition of the  
excellent care that we deliver to patients  
across the country every day of the year. 
Our 20 hospitals and two clinics currently  
rated as ‘Good’ are on a journey to ‘Outstanding’.
Central support for  
all our hospitals
In the last year we have doubled 
the size of the central team 
dedicated to supporting our 
hospitals in their drive to be 
Outstanding across the board. 
Team members offer mentoring, 
hands-on assistance, CQC mirror 
inspections, reports and action 
plans, and specialist clinical support 
where necessary.
Alison Dickinson, Chief Nursing 
Officer, comments: “To date we 
have concentrated on ensuring that 
all our hospitals have the leadership 
and specialist resources they need –  
that clinical leads are in place in 
specialist areas like resuscitation, 
pre-op assessment, medicine 
management, cancer – that 
incidents are fully reported, 
investigated and learnt from. 
In other words, making sure that 
Spire Healthcare’s Clinical Standards 
are in place, understood and met.
“Each hospital that was rated 
Requires Improvement will undergo 
a clinical review as a priority in the 
first quarter of 2018. Over the next 
two years we will be focused on 
helping our hospitals to become 
Outstanding across all aspects 
of our care.”
Spire Bristol Hospital received its CQC 
report in April 2017, rating it Good or 
Outstanding across all domains, and 
Good overall. Led by Hospital Matron and 
Head of Clinical Services, Kate Hoffmann, 
the team in Bristol is now working on 
an action plan to be Outstanding across 
the board. 
Kate credits the support that is available  
to all our hospitals: “The central team 
has really helped us in understanding the 
CQC’s approval and the evidence they look 
for – simplifying the audits, spreadsheets 
and data we need to supply.
“And their support can directly improve  
our patient service – the legal team 
recently provided us with specialist legal 
consent forms we needed for the family 
of a patient with learning disabilities. 
Meaning that the patient, the family 
and our clinical team were all assured 
and happy, and a full and proper consent 
process was undertaken.
“We, in turn, share our expertise with  
other hospitals – matrons, heads of 
department – we all help. I’ve worked  
in centrally controlled organisations and 
it doesn’t necessarily work in complex 
hospital environments. At Spire Healthcare 
we’re a team – the centre supports us 
to deliver outstanding care in each of 
our hospitals.
“This means we’re able to develop our  
own initiatives to improve patient care.  
We were one of the first private hospital’s 
in the country to have a critical care 
outreach team – and our concierge 
service, where every patient is greeted 
and guided through their stay individually, 
has won one of Spire Healthcare’s 
Inspiring People Awards. David will even 
carry your bags and help you to your car – 
that’s outstanding!”

Supply-side constraints to nursing resource continue to exist. 
Management is focused on continuous improvement of 
recruitment and training.
Management actions alongside case mix changes 
have generated medical fee savings in the year.
Following the appointment of our Chief Executive Officer, we have updated our KPI’s to reflect the new strategy, which is focused on Self-pay growth. Therefore we have 
removed theatre utilisation, theatre numbers and patient discharges from our KPI’s as they are no longer relevant and have been have replaced with Self-pay revenue growth. 
Further information on our KPIs can be found on pages 18 and 19, and full APM definitions can be found on page 152.  20

Clinical review
In terms of clinical 
performance and safety, 
post-operative mortality 
within 31 days remained 
low whilst at the same 
time, rates of returns 
to theatre, unplanned 
transfers and readmissions 
all remained low, following 
on from last year’s strong 
performance.” 
Clinical review
As Group Medical Director, I am 
responsible for ensuring we deliver safe 
and high-quality clinical care, defining our 
clinical governance strategy, deploying 
plans to deliver on quality goals and 
ensuring adequate resources are available 
to meet those goals. The national Clinical 
Services team sets the clinical standards, 
audits compliance and reports on the 
clinical performance of our 52 facilities. 
We also provide hands-on support to our 
hospitals, working side-by-side with senior 
management teams, to drive continuous 
improvement by identifying and sharing 
best practice across England, Scotland 
and Wales. 
During 2017, I am proud to report that 
every Spire Healthcare hospital that 
underwent a rated inspection by the 
Care Quality Commission (‘CQC’) in 
England achieving a rating of at least 
‘Good’, with three hospitals achieved 
the highest rating of ‘Outstanding’. 
In addition, our two hospitals in Scotland 
both received a rating of ‘Very Good’ 
from Health Improvement Scotland and 
Spire Cardiff Hospital received a very 
favourable inspection report (Healthcare 
Inspectorate Wales do not issue ratings). 
Whilst we have, to date, prepared for 
these inspections by strengthening our 
performance management and assurance 
systems, we are now investing in growing 
our specialist support teams to enable our 
hospitals to deliver our quality goals –  
for every hospital and clinic inspected 
in 2018 to be rated at least ‘Good’; for 
every hospitals and clinic to be rated at 
least ‘Good’ in 2019; and for the majority 
of hospitals and clinics to be rated 
‘Outstanding’ in 2020.
Opportunities to improve, identified by 
the CQC, are acted upon immediately. 
As a result, Spire Healthcare’s ratings rose 
from 67% ‘Good’ or Outstanding’ in 2017 
to 69% at the time of writing, which is in 
line with the independent sector average 
and ahead of NHS partners (45%). 
Of special mention are Spire Sussex, 
Cheshire and The Montefiore hospitals , 
which were rated ‘Outstanding’, and Spire 
St Anthony’s Hospital which was re-rated 
to ‘Good’.
Nevertheless, 11 of our hospitals are 
currently rated ‘Requires Improvement’. 
Whilst the majority of these are rated 
‘Good’ in the Caring, Effective and 
Responsive domains, we are focusing on 
improving our systems and processes at 
these sites to ensure they achieve a rating 
of at least ‘Good’ overall. This will require 
improvements to be made in relation 
to the compliant management of drugs, 
refurbishing carpeted areas where 
patients are cared for, and remedying 
gaps in the perceived strength of 
local leadership.
We are committed to resolving these 
issues with the utmost urgency. Actions 
include the recruitment of a medicines 
management specialist to drive 
improvements in drugs management; 
a programme of replacement of 
carpets in patient areas and concerted 
improvements in leadership capability. 
You can read more about this in the 
Our people section on pages 44 to 47. 
Spire Healthcare aims to be ‘famous for quality and 
clinical care’. Continuous improvement drives the 
delivery of outstanding clinical quality and performance 
for our patients.

All Spire Healthcare sites rated ‘Requires 
Improvement’ have published an action 
plan response to the CQC findings on 
their websites for scrutiny by patients. 
We are prioritising our central clinical 
resources to support these hospitals, 
with all of them undergoing a clinical 
review in the first quarter of 2018. 
We performed well in patient reported 
outcome measures (‘PROMs’), of the top 
10 hospitals (NHS and Independent) 
in England for health gain following hip 
replacement (April 2016–March 2017), 
three were Spire Healthcare hospitals – 
Spire Cambridge Lea, Leeds and Sussex 
hospitals. In relation to knee replacement, 
two Spire Healthcare hospitals featured 
in the top 10 – Spire Washington (which 
ranked top) and Portsmouth hospitals.

Learning from others
Nurses value professional 
development and training, 
so we not only help our 
nurses to extend their 
professional competencies 
through formal training 
but also encourage them 
to apply for sponsorships, 
scholarships and awards.
Vincenzo Calascibetta, a nurse at Spire 
London East Hospital, has been awarded 
a prestigious Florence Nightingale 
Foundation Travel Scholarship. He will 
be travelling to Australia to study acute 
post-operative pain management.
Vincenzo became a nurse in 2011, 
moving to England in 2015 and joining 
Spire London East Hospital the 
following year.
In Sydney, he will observe pain 
management services at the Royal 
North Shore Hospital and at the Pain 
Management Research Institute. He will 
also attend a two-week multidisciplinary 
pain management workshop.
Vincenzo said: “This will give me an 
amazing chance to travel and to observe 
closely nursing practices in another 
country which I think will really help  
me. I strongly believe that these kind 
of experiences promote professional 
and personal growth.
“My ultimate goal is to work as part 
of a pain management team and this 
experience will really put me on the 
right road to achieving that.”
Spire London East Hospital Matron, 
Patricia Turner, said: “The Florence 
Nightingale Institute is close to all 
nurses’ hearts. We were ecstatic when 
Vincenzo won the scholarship. He will 
bring his learning back from Australia 
to share with us and the Company – 
and we will support him in writing 
his paper for publication. It will benefit 
so many people.” 22

Infection control continues to feature 
as one of Spire Healthcare’s strengths. 
With only a single case of MRSA 
bacteraemia in 2017 and very low rates 
of other healthcare acquired infections, 
we continually outperform NHS providers 
according to data published by NHS 
England. Indeed, surgical site infection 
following hip and knee replacement 
reduced once again to the lowest level 
on Spire Healthcare’s record.
In other clinical performance and safety 
indicators, post-operative mortality 
within 31 days rose slightly (1.27 per 
10,000 theatre episodes), whilst rates 
for returns to theatre (0.12%), unplanned 
transfers (0.05%) and readmissions within 
31 days (0.18%) all remained exceptionally 
low following on from last year’s 
strong performance.
Safety and effectiveness of care is 
a reflection of the dedication and 
engagement of clinical teams. Combined 
with our ambition to improve further and 
to challenge practice that does not meet 
our high standard, our goal is to lead the 
sector on quality. In 2017 , we reported 
16 ‘Never Events’ across our 39 hospitals 
which whilst a slight reduction on the 
number reported in 2016, is not in keeping 
with our drive to be the best. We will 
build on our programme of human factors 
training which we launched last year 
and redouble our efforts to reduce 
these further.
Over the last year, following a commissioned 
review into Spire Healthcare’s systems 
and processes for risk management, we 
have updated our approach to reporting, 
investigating and acting upon lessons from 
clinical and non-clinical incidents, in order 
to make care safer and more responsive. 
We have also introduced a programme of 
human factors training for our colleagues 
and made this available to consultants 
who practise with us.
Our peer-review system for clinical 
assurance (the ‘Clinical Review’) is now 
well established and has proven to be 
an effective assessment of regulatory 
compliance and performance. We have 
invested further to strengthen and grow 
the capacity of this team under the 
leadership of the Chief Nursing Officer 
in order to undertake more frequent 
assessments of our clinical compliance.
We continue to innovate to make care 
safer and to provide us with assurance 
in this regard. By the end of 2017 , 
we completed the roll out of two new 
platforms to support cancer care – the 
Ardeo pathway system to collect and track 
a patient through their breast cancer and 
chemotherapy treatments, and iQemo – 
a system to electronically prescribe 
validated and approved chemotherapy 
protocols in line with published best 
practice. In parallel, we also undertook 
analysis of thousands of surgeons and 
interventional physicians to assess their 
intervention rates, looking to benchmark 
every individual with their specialty 
peers – an exercise we will repeat 
on an annual basis with a view to 
understanding and acting upon outliers. 
We believe we are the only provider 
in the sector to be doing so.
At the start of 2018 we launched 
‘Project Outstanding’, our initiative 
to systematically articulate what 
‘Outstanding’ looks like – both clinical 
and non-clinical – and to deliver this 
consistently across our network with 
the aim of leading on quality as rated by 
the CQC. In the absence of every hospital 
being re-inspected by the CQC this year, 
we also plan to apply for and achieve 
a number of additional external 
independent accreditations over and 
above those we have already achieved – 
such as the Macmillan environmental 
accreditation and the Joint Advisory 
Group (‘JAG’) accreditation for endoscopy.
More and more information on quality 
is being published and we are entirely 
supportive of the Private Healthcare 
Information Network (‘PHIN’) initiative 
which seeks to collect, analyse and publish 
information on both quality and costs 
in line with the requirements of the 
Competition and Markets Authority 
(‘CMA’). We have been submitting data 
for many months and have extended 
our collection of PROMs beyond hip and 
knee replacement and cataract surgery 
to include cosmetic procedures using 
our digital platform, My Clinical 
Outcomes. 
We also plan to support patients to make 
more informed decisions by helping them 
to better understand their treatment 
options as well as their risks and benefits, 
by updating our approach to procedure 
specific consent. We believe that engaged 
patients who are aware of the treatment 
options available to them, cared for by 
talented and dedicated professionals, 
ultimately experience the best possible 
outcomes. We remain passionate and 
determined to deliver the highest quality 
care for all those who choose us to look 
after them.

Spire Healthcare aims 
to be the ‘best place  
to practice’
We work closely with consultants at every stage of 
their career – from their earliest years to retirement –  
helping them build and maintain their private practices 
with tailored clinical, operational, business and 
marketing support.
Investing in the future
Mark Rochester, a Consultant 
Urological Surgeon at Spire 
Norwich Hospital, has seen his 
relatively new private practice 
transformed over the last year by 
our investment in a Holmium laser, 
enabling HoLEP laser prostatectomy 
for benign prostate enlargement.
Mark commented: “I was having 
to fit some of my private patients 
in around the edges of my work 
at our NHS hospital, but now that 
Spire Norwich Hospital has the 
equipment, we can offer patients 
all the clinical benefits of a shorter 
hospital stay and post-operative 
catheterisation time, with excellent 
outcomes – at a time and place 
that’s best for them. 
“We had to make the investment 
case, but since then there’s been 
a significant increase in the number 
of patients I’ve been able to treat. 
It’s the gold standard, and still 
relatively rare in the private sector.” 
Monika Kaushik is a Consultant Breast 
Surgeon at Spire Leicester Hospital. 
Her experience of working with one 
of our hospitals is typical of the support 
we give to consultants as they grow 
their private practices. 
“In 2014, after my appointment as a 
Consultant at University Hospitals of 
Leicester NHS Trust, I wanted to develop 
a private practice. One call to Spire 
Healthcare resulted in a meeting the 
next day with the Hospital Director, 
the hospital team, a full hospital tour 
and a really useful conversation.
They already had a successful Tuesday 
one-stop breast clinic, but my idea 
was to open a Saturday morning clinic 
which would be easier for busy working 
women to attend. Spire Healthcare 
was immediately supportive and, after 
a few teething issues around business 
administration and bookings, the clinic 
has gone from strength to strength.
Together, we have used advertising, 
GP evening talks and word of mouth to 
promote our services. And looking ahead, 
after this year’s work review, we’re 
planning to introduce 10-minute free 
consultations for women with any 
cosmetic breast concerns, together with 
more editorial in Spire Leicester Hospital’s 
newsletter and a series of GP talks on 
aftercare for breast patients.” 
David Macdonald’s (based at Spire Leeds 
Hospital) career started in 1992 – making 
him one of our longest established 
Orthopaedic Consultants. In David’s view, 
maintaining a successful private practice 
is based on two factors – your chosen 
hospital partner having an excellent local 
reputation and word of mouth reflecting 
the quality of your work. 
“I always tell younger consultants, 
don’t spread yourself too thinly. Choose 
a hospital partner that can provide all 
the capacity and back-up you need and 
work with them. Spire Leeds Hospital has 
everything – imaging, high dependency 
unit, cardiologists – to reassure patients 
and consultants that they will receive 
a comprehensive, quality service.
“At a local level, Spire Healthcare invests 
constantly to keep equipment up-to-date –  
and at a national level, if the need is there, 
they will invest in cutting-edge technology 
to improve patient services – like the 
computer assisted surgery I provide for 
the most complex joint reconstructions.”

Operating review
In 2017, our patients continued to rate 
our care and attention highly, with 98% 
of patients overall saying that they would 
be extremely likely or likely to recommend 
Spire Healthcare to their family and friends. 
Patients at Spire Leeds, Parkway and 
Sussex hospitals reported a 100% Friends 
and Family score. 
We continued to invest in the capacity 
and services to maintain high levels 
of recommendation by our customers. 
At the end of 2017, our operating theatre 
network grew to 134, including six new 
theatres at Spire Manchester Hospital 
and five at Spire Nottingham Hospital. 
Across the network, 66 MRI and CT 
scanners support rapid diagnostics, 
while our pathology services undertook 
1.8 million tests. 
In 2018, we have ambitious plans to 
sustain that investment, and make our 
private services even easier to access, 
broader and more transparent in price 
and quality of outcome. We also aim 
to be even more operationally efficient 
in running and scaling-up existing and 
new capacity.
New builds and acquisitions 
Developments during 2017 included:
• Spire Manchester Hospital (six theatres, 
76 beds, ITU) opened in January; and
• Spire Nottingham Hospital (five theatres, 
56 Beds, ITU) opened in April. 
Spire Manchester and Spire Nottingham 
hospitals were our first entirely new build 
hospitals, Spire St Anthony’s Hospital our 
first acquisition and major expansion. 
A number of lessons have been learnt 
in relation to the scale and complexity 
of such projects. Achieving full operating 
efficiency in the new build sites is slower 
than we had expected, but additional 
central resources and targeted development 
programmes implemented in 2017 will 
ensure positive contributions in the future.
Investment in existing facilities
Investments during 2017 included: 
• Spire Methley Park Hospital –  
refurbishment of administration areas, 
bedrooms and theatres, and creation 
of a new daycase suite and theatre –  
opened in September;
• Spire Bushey Hospital – satellite 
out-patient and diagnostic centre with 
14 consulting rooms, associated 
treatment rooms, out-patient diagnostic 
clinics, state-of-the-art MRI, X-ray and 
ultrasound – opened in November;
• new MRI scanners at Spire Hull and 
East Riding and Thames Valley hospitals, 
and a replacement scanner at Spire 
South Bank Hospital; and
• new CT scanner at Spire Hull and 
East Riding Hospital.
During the year, we invested £119.2 million 
in enhancing facilities and new equipment 
across our existing estate. 
Spire Bushey Hospital, our largest 
facility in the south-east, is benefiting 
from a two-phase investment which 
will significantly increase its capacity. 
The first phase involved the building of 
a dedicated diagnostic and outpatient 
centre in Elstree, Hertfordshire. It not only 
offers state-of-the-art diagnostic facilities 
but also frees the way for the second 
phase of the development, adding

Spire Healthcare aims to deliver operational excellence  
The operations team is focused on delivering the core 
elements of our strategy – being ‘first choice for private 
patients’, delivering ‘the most recommended customer 
experience’, and ‘operational excellence’. In 2007 , many 
initiatives laid foundations for future success in these areas.  27 
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017

capacity in the main hospital. This will 
create six new consulting rooms, 10 extra 
beds and a new theatre – offering the 
potential for an additional 1,400 private 
surgical patients a year.
In September, we completed the 
£7.6 million transformation of Spire 
Methley Park Hospital. A new operating 
theatre, equipped with leading-edge 
technology, has enabled more complex 
surgery, while five extra beds, a new 
physiotherapy unit, gymnasium, daycase 
unit and discharge lounge, an on-site 
pharmacy and a total redesign of the 
out-patient department have further 
increased capacity. 
Planned 2018 investments 
In 2018, we will continue to invest in 
the latest equipment, to add capacity 
and capability in our hospitals. 
Planned investments include:
• phase 2 expansion of Spire Bushey 
Hospital (one additional theatre, 
six consulting rooms and 10 beds);
• Spire Murrayfield and Shawfair Park 
hospitals (new MRI scanner).
• Spire Cheshire Hospital (new 
MRI scanner);
• Manchester Parkway One Pathology 
Laboratory (regional and national 
Histopathology hub); and
• the ongoing large-scale refurbishment 
project at Spire Cambridge Lea Hospital, 
comprising the expansion and 
refurbishment of the daycase unit; 
a new Joint Advisory Group (‘JAG’) 
accredited endoscopy suite; and the 
upgrade of the Level 1 Critical Care 
extended recovery area.
New private services
In 2017, we launched our Children and 
Young People’s Service. Working with the 
CQC, we developed a safe, effective and 
compliant service with approved clinical 
standards. We also sought input from 
our PMI partners to ensure our service 
took into account and resolved the 
key issues they and their customers 
were experiencing. 
With our hospitals working together 
as a network, we are now able to offer 
a range of paediatric services from 
initial consultation and diagnosis through 
to treatment and surgery on a broad  
national basis.
We also launched Spire GP , our hospital 
based primary care service. Planned to 
be available at all our hospitals by the 
end of 2018, Spire GP provides quick and 
easy access to professional private GP 
services at a time and location that suits 
our customers.
The launch also marked our first online 
customer service – offering patients 
the opportunity to book and pay for GP 
appointments from their mobile, laptop 
or tablet – the first step in a full range 
of planned online services.
During the year, we 
invested £119.5 million 
in enhancing facilities and 
new equipment across 
our existing estate.  28

Improving service for our PMI partners, we 
successfully completed the pilot of a Direct 
Booking Portal and from the late summer 
rolled it out across our full network. The 
portal was developed in response to our 
insurance partners seeking to support their 
members to book more easily into our 
consultants’ clinics and avoid the need for 
lengthy telephone calls. The portal provides 
claims management teams with direct 
access to electronic diaries, booking and 
appointment confirmation. By year end 
we had scaled up from around 200 referrals 
per month in the pilot to over 600; totalling 
over 4,000 direct bookings for the year.
Building on this success we are working 
to make the portal available to more of 
our insurance partners. We are also piloting 
a Direct to Patient service, giving insured 
patients direct access to support them to 
select appointments with our consultants. 
We are increasing investment in marketing 
and services to drive further growth in 
self-paying patients. Our central team of 
sales trainers work across the network to 
support the hospital based Self-pay sales 
teams. They focus on improving sales 
conversion through the coaching and 
reinforcement of quality enquiry handling, 
enquiry management and sales process. 
They also co-ordinate the best use of 
the Self-pay CRM system standardising its 
use, training its users and recommending 
developments to improve the user 
experience and enquiry data collection.
The goal is one ‘Spire Way’ 
of working, to free up 
strong local hospital 
leadership to run great 
hospitals, support their 
consultants and patients 
and grow the local business. 29

groups, used in present prices.
Continuous operational improvement
A range of work streams aimed at 
delivering operational excellence, 
consistently, across all our hospitals, is 
being driven forward by enhanced central 
resources, working with hospital senior 
leadership teams. The goal is one ‘Spire 
Way’ of working, to free up strong local 
hospital leadership to run great hospitals, 
support their consultants and patients 
and grow the local business.
Specific programmes tested in 2017 
to be fully implemented in 2018 include:
• after a review of our telephony 
capability identified overwhelming 
customer demand, resulting in 
a frustrated customer experience, 
we piloted across six hospitals 
a workstream to identify the 
opportunities to improve our telephony 
capability. This includes improved 
call routing to ensure a positive impact 
to customer experience and the ability 
to measure performance to drive 
further improvements; 
• headline improvements across the 
six pilot hospitals include 20% increase 
in Self-pay appointment bookings 
compared to non-pilot hospitals. 
• a relaunch of our website to raise 
search optimisation and usage; and 
• an ongoing development of a workforce 
planning tool which uses best in class 
acuity assessment and on-line updates 
to create a safe and efficient staff rota 
and bookings allocation.
The NHS standard acute contract 
requires discharge summaries to be sent 
electronically – the so-called e-discharge. 
Our SAP system already links to many 
GPs’ systems across the country. In 2017, 
we trialled e-discharge notes at Spire 
Alexandra and Spire Sussex hospitals. 
In 2018, we will extend the benefits to 
other hospitals, ensuring notes are with 
GPs within 24 hours. The next step will be 
to send clinic letters to GPs electronically. 
During 2017, our coding teams 
implemented the NHS’s new tariffs and 
upgraded to HRG4+
1
. This included the 
creation of a co-morbidity tick-sheet to 
bridge the gap between terminologies 
used by clinicians and coders. The result 
ensures that all secondary conditions 
relevant to any one patient can be clearly 
documented and accurately coded. 
All our hospitals have had at least one 
coding review during the year, highlighting 
areas where improvements can be 
made to the accuracy of clinical coding. 
A summary of findings is provided for 
each site and, where necessary, action 
plans provided to support improvement. 
In addition to the on-site reviews, our 
central team analyses monthly coding 
outputs in order to identify potential 
inaccuracies. The reviews and monthly 
analysis have increased coding accuracy 
and income.
2017 saw the Private Healthcare 
Information Network (‘PHIN’) publish 
quality measures about private hospitals 
online for the first time as a result of 
the Competitions and Markets Authority 
Private Healthcare Investigation Order. 
We support PHIN’s objectives of improving 
transparency around quality and cost 
and continue to actively work with PHIN 
and the industry as new sections of the 
regulation are implemented on a phased 
basis. In addition, we continue to work 
with our consultants to ensure patients 
have the information they need to make 
informed choices. 
Further work is also underway on our 
website to raise the level of information 
available to patients. Image:

Operational 
excellence in 
everything we do 
Operational excellence helps our Consultants 
and staff deliver the best experience and 
outcomes for our patients – through the 
most efficient use of our resources.
Developing 
our leaders
The quality of our hospital 
leadership is crucial to the delivery 
of excellence. Heather Dob, Spire 
Portsmouth’s Hospital Director, 
is a former Matron who has been 
with us since 2002. She is currently 
in her second stint as Hospital 
Director at Portsmouth and typical 
of the best leaders, she knows 
every aspect of the hospital’s 
operations, but leads her team 
with delegated responsibilities. 
As she says: “I lead a team that 
is completely focused on providing 
flexible capacity for our consultants 
and patients. It’s all in the detail.”

Theatre utilisation at Spire 
Portsmouth Hospital
How we manage our theatres is central  
to effective patient flow in a hospital
Theatre utilisation is one of the key 
performance indicators of operational 
excellence. Maximising the productivity of 
our operating theatres requires efficiency 
throughout the patient pathway – 
from original booking, through smooth 
admissions processes, comprehensive 
pre-assessments, timely starts, full lists 
and appropriate post-operative care, 
to prompt discharge.
All of which requires focus, firmness 
and flexibility – from everyone involved.
Spire Portsmouth Hospital achieved 
theatre utilisation rates of 79% in January 
2017, and by October it had improved 
still further, to 84%. Hospital Director, 
Heather Dob, explains their approach.
“Our operating theatres work up to three 
sessions a day, six days a week, and we 
have more orthopaedic consultants who 
want to treat their patients here than 
we can easily accommodate. 
“So, we’re fully focused on maximising 
theatre usage. Senior managers, Matron 
and myself have weekly and daily planning 
meetings, working flexibly to ensure every 
list is full. We concentrate on starting 
on time. We make sure that the right 
equipment and consumables are in 
theatre. Very soon we will have one 
of our store staff in theatre at all times 
to improve that link still further.
“We work hard to ensure that patients are 
properly prepared and pre-assessed – this 
year we created a patient briefing video, 
featuring our staff, taking patients right 
through the pathway. 
“And we try to optimise productivity 
per hour, making sure, where appropriate, 
that patients are treated in endoscopy 
suites or as out-patients, and using the 
theatres for high-value procedures as 
much as possible.” 
We’re fully focused on 
maximising theatre usage.”

Revenue for the year ended 31 December 2017 increased by £5.3 million, or 0.6%, to £931.7 million (2016: £926.4 million).
Underlying revenue grew by £9.0 million, or 1.0%, to £881.1 million (2016: £872.1 million). Of the underlying revenue growth of 1.0%: 
• a decrease of 1.8% in the volume of in-patient and daycase admissions accounted for a 1.1% decline in revenue in the year,  
with Self-pay admissions growth compensating for volume declines in both NHS and PMI business;
• the Group reported a 1.6% increase in rate for in-patient and daycase admissions (average revenue per case) equivalent to an 
increase to total revenue of 2.2%. This was the result of modest increases in case mix complexity and PMI contractual price increases, 
which delivered growth in average revenue per case across all payor groups, most particularly in PMI and Self-pay activity in the 
year (notwithstanding reductions to applicable NHS tariffs of 3.9% from April 2017); and
• a decline in out-patient revenues, which was directly linked to in-patient and daycase surgical volumes. The impact of reduced NHS 
volumes was felt less than private activity (as it carries less out-patient revenues) and as a consequence the decline in out-patient 
revenues accounted for only a 0.1% decline in underlying revenues overall.
The reduction in non underlying revenues includes the impacts of the closure of Lifescan in 2016 and the closure of operations 
in Manchester during January 2017 whilst activity was transferred between the old and new sites. 35

• a decrease of 4.6% in the volume of in-patient and daycase admissions accounted for a 3.0% reduction in PMI revenue in the year;
• the Group reported a 3.0% increase in rate for in-patient and daycase admissions (average revenue per case), equivalent to an 
increase to PMI revenues overall of 1.6%. This rate increase was a combination of contractual increases to prices and a modest 
increase in the complexity of work undertaken in the year; and
• out-patient revenues contributed 0.2% to the overall decline in PMI revenues, performing significantly better than the volume 
led decline in in-patient and daycase admissions in the year.

NHS revenue for the year ended 31 December 2017 decreased by £5.6 million, or 1.9%, to £287.8 million (2016: £293.4 million). 
Underlying NHS revenue declined by £1.4 million, or 0.5%, to £281.2 million (2016: £282.6 million). Of the underlying decline in NHS 
revenue of 0.5%:
• a decrease of 1.8% in the volume of in-patient and daycase admissions accounted for a 1.5% decrease in NHS revenue in the year, 
skewed heavily to NHS local contract work (see below);
• against the backdrop of a weighted decrease to NHS tariff for the Group of 2.8% for the financial year, the average revenue per 
case for NHS admissions increased by 1.3% over 2016. Growth in in-patient and daycase rate (average revenue per case) contributed 
1.0% to underlying NHS revenue growth in the year. This was the result of a further concentration of case mix to higher yielding 
procedures (notably in orthopaedics) offsetting the impact of NHS tariff decline from April 2017; and
• out-patient revenue was stable during the year as a consequence of the bias in performance towards NHS e-Referrals relative 
to NHS local contract work (which often carries little or no out-patient element). 
The underlying revenue decline in NHS revenue of 0.5% is split as follows:
• NHS e-Referral (previously NHS Choose and Book) revenue grew by 5.5% in the year ended 31 December 2017; 
• NHS local revenue declined by 26.2% in the same period. Management had expected NHS local contract revenue to decline 
in 2017 due to removal of fines linked to referral to treatment time key performance indicators. This reduced the appetite of NHS 
trusts to outsource work; and
• NHS e-Referrals revenue account for 86.0% of underlying NHS revenue in the year ended 31 December 2017, up from 81.2% 
in the prior year.

Underlying revenue grew by £18.8 million, or 12.0%, to £175.4 million (2016: £156.6 million). Of the underlying growth in Self-pay 
revenue of 12.0%:
• an increase of 6.5% in the volume of in-patient and daycase admissions accounted for a 4.4% increase in Self-pay revenue in the year;
• the average revenue per case for Self-pay in-patient and daycase admissions grew by 7.9% over the prior year, contributing 5.7% 
to the increase in Self-pay revenue in the year. Price increases in 2017 were largely inflationary, with the balance of the increase 
in average rate per case arising from improved case mix complexity; and
• out-patient activities in 2017 grew 0.2% as price increases were tempered in order to drive in-patient and daycase demand. 
Overall the increase in Self-pay out-patient revenue drove 0.1% of the increase in underlying Self-pay revenue for the year. 36

Other revenue
Other revenue, which includes fees paid to the Group by consultants (e.g. for the use of Group facilities and services) and third-party 
revenue (e.g. pathology services to third-parties), decreased by £2.3 million, or 6.9%, in the year, to £31.0 million (2016: £33.3 million). 
Of the £2.3 million decrease in revenue, £1.8 million relates to pathology revenue which has reduced as a result of a refocusing of the 
Spire pathology service to support the hospital network rather than third-party external contracts. 
Cost of sales and gross profit
Cost of sales increased in the year by £6.3 million, or 1.3%, to £492.2 million (2016: £485.9 million) on revenues that increased 0.6% 
in the year. Underlying cost of sales increased in the year by £7.5 million, or 1.7%, on underlying revenues that increased by 1.0% 
in the year. Underlying gross margin for the year of 2017 was 48.2%, compared with 48.5% in 2016.
Cost of sales as a percentage of relevant revenue are as follows:
Group Underlying
Year ended 31 December Year ended 31 December
2017 2016 2017 2016
Clinical staff 19.6% 18.9% 18.8% 18.1%

Cost of sales 52.8% 52.4% 51.8% 51.5%
Gross margin 47.2% 47.6% 48.2% 48.5%
Overall, the Group has substantially mitigated the impact on gross margin arising from the effective 2.8% reduction in NHS Tariff 
effective April 2017 (3.8% reduction in tariff on an annualised basis). The flow through impact of this price reduction in the year 
is approximately 0.8%, significantly higher than the 0.3% underlying gross margin decline reported.
Management actions alongside case mix changes have generated medical fee savings in the year. Procurement initiatives have 
resulted in savings in direct costs of drugs, prostheses and consumables which have significantly mitigated the margin pressure 
arising from NHS tariff.
Supply-side constraints to nursing resource continue to exist; clinical staff costs as a percentage of revenues have increased in 2017 
compared to the prior year. Management is focused on continuous improvement of recruitment and training and development 
processes in the business as well as rostering and productivity improvements designed to limit use of agency staff.
Other operating costs
Other operating costs for the year ended 31 December 2017 increased by £49.1 million, or 14.1%, to £396.6 million (2016: £347 .5 million). 
Excluding exceptional and other items, other operating costs for the year increased by £15.1 million, or 4.5%, to £347.4 million.
Underlying other operating costs increased in the year by £45.4 million, or 13.7%, to £375.9 million (2016: £330.5 million). 
Excluding exceptional and other items, underlying other operating costs for the year increased by £11.4 million, or 3.6%, to £326.7

EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2017 decreased by £12.0 million, or 7.4%, to £150.0 million (2016: £162.0 million). 
Underlying EBITDA decreased by £7.5 million, or 4.7%, from £159.7 million to £152.2 million. 
The Group EBITDA margin of 16.1% compares to 17.5% in 2016 and was impacted by the start-up nature of new hospitals opening. 
The Group underlying EBITDA margin of 17.3% compares to 18.3% in 2016 and the movement is the result of hospital and central 
overhead and rent increases explained below.
Hospital and central overhead costs have increased as a consequence of the opening of new hospitals in Manchester and Nottingham 
and the annualised impact of the expansion of Spire St Anthony’s Hospital. In addition investments have been made in central 
overheads to support additional training and development of our people, clinical and non-clinical assurance functions and sales 
and marketing to support Self-pay growth. 37 
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
Governance Strategic Report Financial statements Other information
On an underlying basis, the increase in hospital and central overhead costs is substantially linked to those central investment 
initiatives referred to opposite.
Underlying depreciation charged in the year increased by £5.3 million, or 10.9%, to £54.0 million (2016: £48.7 million) as the Group 
continues to invest in capacity and capability across the existing network of hospitals.
Total depreciation charged in the year of £57.4 million includes that arising on the new hospital in Nottingham and higher charges 
on Spire Manchester and Spire St Anthony’s hospitals as a consequence of the investment in new and extended facilities in these 
sites respectively. 
Rent of land and buildings for the year increased by £1.2 million, or 1.9%, to £63.9 million (2016: £62.7 million). The increase is mainly 
due to inflationary uplifts in relation to annual rent indexation in line with RPI. 
Share based payments
During the year, grants were made to Executive Directors and members of the senior leadership team under the Company’s Long 
Term Incentive Plan. For the year ended 31 December 2017, the charge to the income statement was £1.0 million (2016: £0.4 million), 
or £1.1 million inclusive of National Insurance (2016: £0.6 million). Further details are contained in note 21 on pages 134 to 136 of 
the financial statements.

In 2016 the costs primarily relate to National Insurance on Directors’ Share Bonus Award granted at the time of the IPO.
Following the completion of the criminal proceedings against Ian Paterson (a consultant who previously had practicing privileges 
at Spire Healthcare) earlier in 2017, Spire Healthcare settled all current and known claims against Spire relating to his practice at 
Spire Healthcare. Accordingly, Spire Healthcare has provided £28.7 million in relation to this settlement, plus related costs, of which 
£26.1 million has been paid. Spire Healthcare is currently pursuing legal action against its insurers to seek recoveries against this 
settlement and related costs, which may give rise to future exceptional income being recognised in the income statement. 
No account has been taken of these further recoveries in the results for the year ended 31 December 2017.
In the final quarter of 2017, management undertook a strategic review of its current portfolio of sites and the future development 
options for the Group. As part of the process, the decision was taken to cease the provision of radiotherapy services at the Spire Cancer 
Care Centre in Baddow (Essex) as a consequence of poor commercial performance. The charge for the year includes £10.3 million 
for the write-off of fixed assets, net of recoverable value, and a provision for site closure costs. Additionally, certain well progressed 
capital projects, notably the development of a hospital in Central London, have been aborted and the costs associated with these 
projects have been charged as exceptional items in the year due to the fundamental change in development strategy.
Hospital set-up and closure costs include the pre-opening expenses for the two new hospitals opened during 2017 (Spire Manchester 
and Spire Nottingham hospitals), plus the decommissioning costs of the former Manchester hospital site. 
An Executive Director had a period of illness during 2017. Costs associated with his remuneration during his medical leave were 
duplicative to the business. After sadly passing away in July 2017, Spire Healthcare made a death in service payment which has also 
been included in exceptional items.
In the year ended 31 December 2016, business reorganisation mainly comprised staff restructuring costs and the closure costs 
relating to an onerous contract. In the year, the Group’s goodwill in relation to the Lifescan business was written-off following a 
strategic review and the closure of this operation. Hospital set-up costs refer to pre-opening costs for the new Spire Manchester 
and Spire Nottingham hospitals. The reversal of the impairment is the result of the reassessment of the lives of medical and other 
equipment following the relocation of the assets from the previous Spire Manchester Hospital to the new hospital facility and other 
Group hospitals following its closure. Hospital closure costs relate to the decommissioning of the assets related to the previous  38 
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017

Spire Manchester Hospital. Corporate restructuring related to an internal Group reorganisation and transaction costs relating to the 
Asset Swap Transaction as described below. Except for the corporate restructuring costs, which were capital in nature, and write-off 
of intangible assets, all other exceptional costs are expected to be tax deductible.
On 31 August 2016, as a result of the development of a new hospital facility in Manchester and the closure of the previous Spire 
Manchester Hospital (previously held under an operating lease), the freehold interest in Spire Wirral Hospital with a net book value 
of £11.7 million was disposed of, and leased back in a sale and leaseback transaction. The consideration for the sale was realised in the 
form of a non-cash asset, being the freehold of the previous Spire Manchester Hospital, which was simultaneously acquired by the 
Group (the ‘Asset Swap Transaction’). The overall loss on these transactions was £7.7 million before sale costs of £1.2 million.
For 2017, £4.0 million (2016: £3.7 million) in respect of wages, salaries and social security costs note 8 on page 123 is included in 
write-off and aborted project costs, executive medical leave and death in service, business reorganisations, hospital set-up costs, 
hospital closure, other and corporate restructuring costs.

Compliance set-up costs include amounts incurred in 2017 to meet the requirements of General Data Protection Regulations (‘GDPR’) 
regulations effective May 2018. Management expect further material costs to arise in 2018 in advance of the effective date to meet 
these new regulations and for Spire Healthcare to fulfil its extended obligations under these new regulations.
Full details of exceptional items are disclosed in note 9 on page 124.
Net finance costs
Net finance costs increased by 2.0% to £20.2 million (2016: £19.8 million) as a result of incremental increase in finance lease costs. 
Taxation
The taxation charge for the year is impacted by exceptional and other items in both 2017 and 2016. The table below provides a 
reconciliation of the total taxation charge for the year to the adjusted tax charge for the year, before exceptional and other items.
Year ended 31 December
(£ million) 2017 2016
Tax on profit 5.9 19.6
 Tax credit on exceptional and other items 8.1 0.6
 Reassessment of temporary difference on property – (8.4)
Adjusted tax charge before exceptional and other items 14.0 11.8
Profit before taxation and exceptional and other items 71.9 88.4
Adjusted effective tax rate before exceptional and other items 19.5% 13.3%
For the year ended 31 December 2017, the effective rate of 19.5% before exceptional and other items is reduced by the UK 
Government’s announcement of a further decrease in the future UK corporation tax rate from 18% to 17% from April 2020. 
This change has resulted in a deferred tax credit in 2017 of £0.5 million arising from the reduction in the balance sheet carrying 
value of deferred tax liabilities to reflect the anticipated rate of tax at which those liabilities are expected to reverse in the future. 
For the year ended 31 December 2016 the effective tax rate of 13.3% is reduced (relative to the 20.0% prevailing UK corporation 
tax rate) by prior year adjustments to deferred taxation (£2.4 million credit) and the impact on deferred tax net liabilities of previous 
changes to the future rate of UK corporation tax (£5.2 million credit).
Profit after taxation 
The profit after taxation for the year ended 31 December 2017 was £16.8 million (2016: £53.6 million).  39

Adjusted financial information
This statement was prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the Group’s actual earnings. The information 
was prepared as described in the notes set out below.
Non-GAAP financial measures
We have provided in this release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’). We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analysing our financial results and believe they 
are useful to investors, as a supplement to IFRS measures, in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. We believe that the 
use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results 
and trends in comparing our financial results with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP 
financial measures to investors.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared 
in accordance with IFRS. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation to these non-GAAP financial to their most directly 
comparable IFRS financial measures provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release.
Adjustments have been made to exclude the trading results of any new and redeveloped hospitals, closure or disposal in both current 
and prior periods. We have therefore excluded the results of Spire Manchester, Nottingham and St Anthony’s hospitals and Lifescan 
in arriving at ‘underlying’ in this annual report. The Group ceased trading the Lifescan product in H2 2016, Manchester hospital was 
transitioned to a new and larger site during January 2017 (which resulted in a period of operational closure), the new hospital in 
Nottingham was operational in late April 2017 and Spire St Anthony’s Hospital was redeveloped in the comparitive period, including 
the construction of a new six surgical theatre complex which opened in late 2016. APM definitions can be found on page 152.

equipment in the year totalled £119.2 million, which included the completion of the new Spire Manchester (opened in January 2017) 
and Spire Nottingham hospitals (opened in April 2017), and Spire Bushey Hospital medical centre (opened in November 2017). 
Additional to the development scheme-led capital investment, the Group continued to invest significant amounts within the 
existing estate in engineering, plant upgrade and replacement, diagnostic equipment upgrade and replacement, theatre 
and bedroom refurbishment and other medical equipment replacement. 
Net cash used in investing activities for the prior year ended 31 December 2016 was £149.9 million. Capital expenditure for the 
purchase of property, plant and equipment totalled £149.5 million, which included the development of the new Spire Manchester 
and Spire Nottingham hospitals and theatre development at Spire St Anthony’s Hospital.

First choice for  
self-paying patients 
We want Spire Healthcare to be the UK’s first 
choice private healthcare brand, famous for  
clinical quality and customer care. Nowhere is  
this more important than in the growing market  
for discerning, self-paying patients.
Linking to Primary Care
Louise Downie, Spire Little Aston’s 
Primary Care Manager, is part of a 
transformation in our approach to 
working with primary care providers. 
In her view: “Primary care is 
changing to meet increasing 
demand – GP practices are merging 
and patients are increasingly 
being seen by Advance Nurse and 
Musculoskeletal Extended Scope 
Practitioners rather than GPs. 
“As a result, we’ve extended our 
programme of information and 
educational events to this the 
wider primary care audience, 
explaining the benefits of new 
services and equipment, building 
relationships between them and 
our Consultants, and making the 
referral process as easy as possible.
“And Spire Healthcare is changing. 
We’re working closer with our 
sister Spire hospitals, and we’re 
getting much more support and 
databased guidance from central 
management. The result is that 
we’re more focused, more efficient – 
and our customers benefit.” 
In the past year, Spire Little Aston Hospital 
has seen 60% growth in patients self-
paying for orthopaedic procedures. Some 
of this demand is driven by lengthening 
NHS waiting lists, but growing market 
share in a highly competitive local market 
is the result of our hospital’s ability to 
develop, market and deliver a compelling 
customer value proposition.
Business Development Manager, 
Tom Ryder, explains: “We have an 
excellent clinical reputation, outstanding 
consultants and can offer great care – 
but beyond that, success in the Self-pay 
market is down to doing the basics well, 
converting enquiries, and then delivering 
throughout the patient journey. 
“You have to get your message out 
to the right people. We work with the 
central Commercial Marketing team, 
using insight data to understand our 
local demographics better, targeting 
and constantly refining our direct mail, 
advertising and digital communications. 
We’ve aligned our GP events programme 
with our marketing so that local doctors 
are better informed about our services.
“You have to build trust from the very 
first enquiry. Our sales team is motivated, 
well-trained, knowledgeable and 
committed to helping patients. We aim 
to respond to any enquiry, personally, 
on the phone, within one hour. 
“And you have to be able to guide people, 
who are often first-time buyers of private 
healthcare, through the process, offering 
them inclusive care packages with price 
certainty and alternative financing 
options through personalised medical 
loans. We’re finding that successful 
marketing is bringing in younger patients – 
they’re typically more used to financing 
packages – so we’re offering Spire’s 
financing to spread the cost.
“Every single colleague in the hospital is 
united in promoting our hospital’s services 
and Self-pay proposition options as an 
accessible and more affordable way 
to benefit from private healthcare.”
We have an excellent 
clinical reputation, 
outstanding consultants 
and can offer great care.”

Looking after you 44 
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
Our people
We have over 13,000 nurses, theatre staff, 
allied health professionals, non-clinical support 
colleagues and bank staff, working together 
to deliver outstanding care to our patients across 
the United Kingdom. We are committed to doing 
more to support them and to attract new talent 
for the future.
Our challenges
It has been widely reported that there is 
currently a shortage of nurses and doctors 
in the UK. The number of registered nurses 
is falling for the first time since training 
cuts in 2010, and 96% fewer EU nurses 
have registered since the Brexit vote. 
Given the length of training required, 
these shortages will take several years 
to make good.
With the shortage of nurses, it is 
more important than ever that we are 
successfully recruiting and retaining 
colleagues to account for natural 
turnover and to meet our patient needs 
where we have invested in new and 
expanded facilities. 
Engaging our colleagues
Our colleagues interact with thousands 
of patients every day and play a crucial 
role in delivering the highest quality 
care and outcomes. It is therefore 
more crucial than ever that we set our 
colleagues up to succeed and engage 
closely with them, particularly given 
our competitive market.
Our annual engagement survey saw an 
overall engagement score of 81% that 
exceeded external benchmark rates 
of 73%
1
, but was 7% lower than the last 
survey. The results showed colleagues 
feel positive about the type of work 
they do and value the teams they work 
in. Over 80% of colleagues who responded 
to the survey are proud to work for Spire 
Healthcare, feel they make a positive 
difference and would be happy with 
our care for a friend or relative.
Whilst the feedback from the engagement 
survey showed largely high scores, they 
were lower than in the 2015 survey and 
the results highlighted a number of areas 
to focus on. As a result, we are relaunching 
our performance management process, 
reviewing incentives and recognition, 
and introducing a number of new 
communication and engagement activities.
We are committed to acting on the 
feedback from our colleagues. To ensure we 
have clear focus on making improvements 
following the 2017 survey, we introduced 
a simple action plan process for teams 
to use across the business to make 
positive change.
Culture and values
Our colleagues are at the heart of 
our business, they are our lifeblood, 
representing who we are, our positive 
culture and live our values each day. 
Our values demonstrate how we work 
together and provide us with a common 
language that all colleagues can recognise 
and relate to. Following Justin Ash’s 
appointment, we refreshed our values 
slightly to reinforce the importance of 
clinical excellence and that celebrating 
our successes is important.
We are committed to supporting the 
communities in which we operate, and 
we run a comprehensive programme 
of GP/clinical education events across 
our network of hospitals. In 2017, 1,500 
events were attended by over 23,000 GPs,  
nurses, physiotherapists and other 
healthcare professionals.

Last year, over £53,000 was raised by the 
hospitals for important local and national 
charitable causes. Next year, it is our aim 
to go further and raise more, and build 
upon the good work our colleagues 
already do. 
Our commitments
We are committed to delivering on our 
promises and making Spire Healthcare 
a ‘destination employer’ – attracting, 
recruiting, training and retaining the best. 
To do this we are committed to:
• being an employer of choice – based 
on an outstanding recruitment process, 
our quality performance culture, and 
with an aligned reward framework;
• growing our own – both at the key 
leadership roles in hospitals and 
with our qualified clinical and other 
colleagues – through training and 
development, a clear competency 
framework and apprenticeships to 
attract and develop new talent; and
• setting ourselves up to succeed through 
stronger human resources support, 
comprehensive workforce planning 
and effective communications across 
all our hospitals.
Our priorities
In 2017, we strengthened our central 
human resources capability and made 
step changes towards delivering on our 
commitments. We developed a Human 
Resources Business Partner structure 
to closely support each of our hospitals. 
Leadership is a key driver and influence 
on our culture so developing values-based 
leadership competencies for our senior 
hospital management teams was a top 
priority in 2017. All senior hospital

Tomorrow’s team
Spire Healthcare is leading 
developments in healthcare 
education – developing 
apprenticeship schemes 
that will train our hospital 
teams of tomorrow. We are 
working with universities 
across the country to develop 
new degree courses – 
enabling our staff to work 
and learn together. 
Jack Longhurst is a theatre healthcare 
assistant at Spire Parkway Hospital. 
Jack worked in a pharmacy before 
joining Spire Healthcare two years ago. 
He is currently on his Level 3 Healthcare 
Support Worker qualification, a new 
apprenticeship which became available 
in May 2017.
His next step will be as one of the 
first cohorts in the University of Derby’s 
new three-year Operating Department 
Practitioner (‘ODP’) degree course, 
starting in January 2019. 
As Jack says: “I asked about training 
in my first interview and Spire 
Healthcare has supported me all the 
way since. It’s really exciting to be one 
of the first to do this new university 
apprenticeship course – I can continue 
to work and get paid, and I don’t have to 
take out a loan for university fees. I’ll go 
to Derby three times a year but the rest 
of the time I’m in the hospital with my 
theatre team. At the end of the course 
I’ll be a fully qualified ODP , thanks to 
Spire Healthcare.”
Deborah Barker, Spire Healthcare’s 
national lead for developing 
apprenticeships and university 
relationships, comments: “In the 
new Level 3 Apprenticeship Standard, 
delivered by our supplier Eurosource 
Solutions Ltd, there are Theatre and 
Adult Nursing pathways, making it 
much more flexible and appropriate 
in hospitals. On completion of the 
qualification, Jack will be able to assist 
a fully qualified ODP to scrub in minor 
cases – and it qualifies him for the 
Degree Apprenticeship programme we 
are developing with the University of 
Derby. We’re committed to developing 
apprenticeships across the country – 
helping to develop the next generation 
of healthcare professionals.”

Gender pay gap (‘GPG’) reporting
Spire Healthcare’s workforce across all 
our hospitals and clinics is 75% female 
and includes 24% temporary workers 
(predominantly bank staff comprising 
nurses and other clinical staff). 
We are required to report GPG figures 
for our main employing entity – Spire 
Healthcare Limited – covering 98% 
of all relevant employees of Spire 
Healthcare Group. In the interests of 
full transparency, we have supplemented 
the statutory disclosure requirements 
with additional data that captures 
relevant employees across the Spire 
Healthcare Group. 
The GPG required by the Gender Pay Gap 
Regulations is expressed as an average 
figure. It represents the percentage 
difference between average hourly 
earnings for men and women. This is 
distinct from ‘equal pay’, which considers 
whether men and women are paid the 
same for carrying out the same work, 
or work of equal value. 
Key findings
The overall median GPG in both 
Spire Healthcare Limited and the 
Spire Healthcare Group (7.9% and 7.8% 
respectively) is considerably lower than 
the Office for National Statistics (‘ONS’) 
provisional national average of 18.4% 
(as per their publication of 26 October 
2017). The bonus GPG for 2017 should 
be treated with caution. Firstly, less 
than 3% of employees received a bonus 
in the period under review. This means 
that the data is based on a relatively 
small number of employees. Secondly, 
the data has been heavily skewed by a 
limited number of legacy share awards 
granted in 2014 to a very small number 
management teams will be assessed 
against these and in February 2018 
a dedicated leadership development 
programme at Ashridge Business 
School began.
Ensuring new recruits are a good cultural 
fit who will understand and support our 
values helps to set new colleagues up  
for a successful and rewarding career 
with Spire Healthcare. To enable this, the 
criteria from our leadership competencies 
will be used as a part of our recruitment 
processes in the future. To further improve 
our recruitment processes both internally 
and for candidates, we are aiming to 
reduce hiring time, assure candidate 
quality and improve retention.
During 2017, we completed a detailed 
review of our reward framework 
(including all benefits) to help develop 
a simple, clear framework that can be 
used across all roles and functions to 
provide consistency and fairness.
Our communications and engagement 
activity helps promote and maintain our 
culture. We invested more in these areas 
in 2017 across a number of channels and 
activities. We held our first leadership 
conference in over two years in December, 
attended by 200 leaders across our 
hospitals and central functions. The 
new CEO and executive team engaged 
the leaders in developing our forward 
strategy and, following the event, 95%
2
 
of delegates responded positively when 
asked if they were excited about the 
future of≈Spire Healthcare.
In 2018, we will continue to build on 
our engagement activities such as town 
hall forums, an executive leadership 
hospital visits programme and ‘all hands’ 
conference calls for all colleagues.
As demonstrated in our values, it is 
important that our colleagues always feel 
able to do the right thing. Whilst we 
encourage an open culture whereby issues 
can be raised and handled at a local level, 
we realise that there may be times where 
it is not appropriate, or a person may not 
feel comfortable, to raise a concern 
through their line management. 
Whistleblowing
We want colleagues to feel confident and 
empowered to raise any issues of concern 
they may have; however, we also have 
a robust whistleblowing policy in place. 
Our whistleblowing helpline is managed 
by a third-party provider, enabling 
colleagues to raise any concerns they 
may have about issues of safety or 
wrongdoing, if necessary, anonymously. 
All such concerns received through the 
helpline are sent to the Group Company 
Secretary for review, and to ensure that 
they are appropriately investigated and 
concluded. In 2017, we received two calls 
to the whistleblowing helpline. 
Anti-bribery and corruption
Spire Healthcare’s Anti-Bribery, Gifts 
and Hospitality policy extends to all of 
its employees. Spire Healthcare takes a 
zero-tolerance approach to bribery and 
corruption and we are committed to 
conducting our activities free from any 
form of bribery and corruption. We also 
expect the same from any third parties 
providing services for or on behalf of Spire 
Healthcare. Employees who fail to comply 
with the requirements of our policies and 
standards may face disciplinary action, 
including dismissal. 47

our Reward Framework Project and 
the introduction of the Leadership 
Development Programme, both 
discussed, under ‘Our priorities’, will 
provide greater consistency between 
roles and locations, assist reducing pay 
anomalies and, in time, help our GPG. 
In addition, we recently undertook 
a review of our approach to maternity 
pay. Previously, Spire Healthcare only 
provided statutory maternity pay (SMP) 
to eligible employees. We have reviewed 
the level of maternity benefits which 
we offer and we have enhanced our 
maternity pay so that employees receive 
100% of pay for six weeks, followed 
by 50% of pay (plus SMP) for the next 
18 weeks, to further improve reward 
and retention. This change was 
implemented in June 2017. 
We will continue to monitor our GPG 
and we are committed to taking steps 
and spotting opportunities to reduce 
it further.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
A key focus is to reduce carbon emissions 
associated with our usage of electricity 
and natural gas. The way we purchase, 
monitor, target and report on our 
buildings’ energy consumption is 
undertaken in partnership with our 
energy consultants, Inenco.
Energy
Targets vs performance
In 2016, we published the five-year energy 
reduction targets set out in our Carbon 
and Environmental policy document to 
reduce CO
2
e from electricity and natural 
gas by 15% per pound of revenue by 
2020 from the baseline year of 2015. 
We use the intensity metric of carbon 
emissions per £ revenue which increases 
in proportion to the growth in our business. 
The addition of Spire Manchester and 
Spire Nottingham hospitals to our portfolio 
for example, has added significant energy 
consumption overnight. Our values are 
based on providing excellence in clinical 
quality and innovation to our patients. As 
a consequence of continuing to meet these 
values we will continue to grow, to treat 
more patients, to provide more treatments 
and to offer the latest technology. 
Legislation
Since becoming a publicly listed company 
in 2014, Spire Healthcare is registered 
for the Government’s Carbon Reduction 
Commitment (‘CRC’) Energy Efficiency 
Scheme and will report our carbon 
emissions to the Environment  
Agency accordingly.
Our mandatory Energy Savings 
Opportunity Scheme (‘ESOS’) audits 
were completed on schedule and 
concluded that due to the excellent 
work already undertaken in improving 
energy efficiencies across our estate, 
their recommendations would be 
unlikely to produce large energy savings. 
The recommendations will, however, 
be incorporated into our carbon 
reduction planning for the future. 
Spire Healthcare was invited to participate 
in the Carbon Disclosure Projects (‘CDP’) 
again in 2017. We made our third 
submission to the CDP this year and Spire 
Healthcare have been graded C which 
demonstrates our knowledge of our 
impact on climate change issues.
Capital investment in low carbon 
infrastructure
We continue to invest in our engineering 
infrastructure to improve energy 
efficiencies. Key projects this year included 
investment in areas such as lighting, 
mechanical ventilation, building controls, 
heating and domestic hot water services. 
These projects are having a positive 
impact on relevant Energy Performance 
Certificates (‘EPCs’) for our buildings. 
For example, after completion of boiler 
replacement and LED lighting installation 
at Spire Leicester Hospital, our EPC 
improved dramatically from an energy 
performance rating of F to a much 
improved B rating.
High Efficiency Lighting – after the 
success of our lighting replacement 
projects previously reported, we have 
invested heavily in this area in 2017 to 
reduce our carbon footprint and also 
benefit from the much improved light 
quality that this technology brings. On 
the back of the measured energy and 
aesthetic benefits of our internal upgrade 
to LED lighting in previous years, we have 
invested in excess of £2.5 million across 
22 of our hospitals together with our 
finance offices at Regents Gate. We intend 
to invest further again in 2018 as part of 
our national refurbishment programme 
to ensure we continue to reduce our 
electricity consumption and ensure 
we meet our stated energy reduction 
targets in 2020.
High Efficiency Heating and Hot Water 
Services – modular condensing heating 
and hot water boilers were installed at 
Spire Dunedin, St Anthony’s, Leicester and 
Fylde Coast hospitals during 2017, which 
will deliver a reduction in as consumption 
in future years. 
High Efficiency Ventilation Systems – 
our theatre ventilation plant ensures rapid 
air exchange within our theatre suites to 
protect our patients from infection. By its 
nature these systems are energy hungry. 
We replaced ageing systems at Spire Leeds 
and Tunbridge Wells hospitals in 2017. The 
new systems now include high-efficiency 
control and heat recovery systems that 
help deliver this critical air in the most 
efficient way.
Looking after our environment 
Spire Healthcare realises that we have a ‘duty of care’ to 
the environment as well as our patients and we continue 
to promote a low carbon culture across our hospitals.  
We continually review how we operate our buildings  
and infrastructure to improve the carbon efficiencies.  49

Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG)
This section provides the emission data 
and supporting information required by 
The Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013.
Footprint boundary
An operational control approach has been 
used to set the Greenhouse Gas (‘GHG’) 
emissions boundary, as defined in Defra’s 
latest Environmental Reporting guidelines: 
‘Your organisation has operational 
control over an operation if it, or one 
of its subsidiaries, has the full authority 
to introduce and implement its operating 
policies at the operation’.
For Spire Healthcare, this captures 
emissions associated with the operation 
of all our hospitals and other buildings 
such as clinics, offices and distribution 
centre, plus company-owned and leased 
transport. As Spire Healthcare has no 
overseas operations, all emissions refer 
to UK operations only.
Emission sources
All material scope one and two emissions 
are included. These include emissions 
associated with: 
• fuel combustion: stationary (natural gas; 
and red diesel for backup generators); 
mobile (vehicle fuel); 
• purchased electricity; and
• fugitive emissions (refrigerants, 
medical gases). 
Methodology and emissions factors
This report was calculated using the 
methodology set out in Environmental 
Reporting Guidelines (ref. PB 13944), 
published by Defra in June 2013. 
Emissions factors are taken from 
the Department Of Business, Energy 
and Industrial strategy emissions 
factor update published in 2017. 
There are no notable omissions 
from the mandatory scope one and 
two emissions. Approximately 7% of 
emissions are based on estimated data.
GHG emissions data
The GHG emissions for Spire Healthcare 
for the reporting period January – 
December 2017 were 39,429tCO
2
e, 
tabulated by emissions source below. 
The ‘facility operation’ emissions are 
attributable to the use of medical gases, 
carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, 
(5,201tCO
2
e) and leakage of refrigerant 
gases (927tCO
2
e). This is 9% lower 
than the emissions reported for 2016 
(43,520 tCO
2
e).
For purposes of baselining and ongoing 
comparison, it is required to express the 
GHG emissions using a carbon intensity 
metric. The intensity metric chosen is 
£m revenue. Spire Healthcare’s revenue 
in 2017 was £931.7m, giving an intensity 
of 42.3 tCO
2
e per £m revenue, 10% lower 
than last year. 
Engineering Governance  
and Compliance
Our central engineering team was 
expanded in 2017. This development 
has allowed dedicated engineering 
risk and compliance auditing support 
in this complex arena.
The identification, publication and 
management of risk associated 
with our engineering infrastructure 
and its operation is managed though 
annual audit alongside our clinical 
team. These audits are used to make 
this risk transparent enabling a 
prioritised approach to risk mitigation. 
The resultant risk profile informs 
the business of future capital 
requirements, gives confidence this 
capital is managed on a true risk basis 
and is targeted in the most efficient 
and effective way. The central 
engineering team supplements the 
formal annual audits with regular 
routine visits which ensure the 
engineering governance system is 
dynamic with the continuous addition, 
closure and re-assessment of risk.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
The Audit and Risk Committee, with the 
assistance of the Clinical Governance and 
Safety Committee (‘CGSC’), provides the 
Board with a consolidated view of key 
risks from all levels of the Group, advice 
on the Group’s overall risk appetite and 
strategy, and on the effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management and internal 
control processes.
The risk management framework is 
designed to identify, evaluate and mitigate 
the risks that the Group faces at all levels. 
This is a core component of driving quality 
improvement across the Group in order 
to provide outstanding services. The 
underlying process aims to provide robust 
management information to enable 
conscious risk-based decision-making.
In 2016, the Group implemented risk 
management software to support its 
approach to risk management. This 
software has been implemented across 
the Group and is now populated by risk 
registers for all hospitals. This allows a 
greater degree of oversight and analysis 
across the Group as well as enhancing 
integrated governance. Risk management 
is supported by a detailed framework and 
methodology to ensure that all hospital 
and business-level risks are identified 
and assessed consistently across all of 
Spire Healthcare. 
The Board recognises that it has limited 
control over many of the external risks 
it faces, such as macroeconomic events 
and the complex regulatory environment. 
However, it is important to consider the 
potential impact of such ongoing risks to 
the business and where possible develop 
contingency plans to minimise the impact 
of these external risks.
In 2018, the Group will continue to  
evolve its approach to and use of risk 
management to drive quality improvement.
Each hospital has a risk register and 
supporting governance structure, with 
processes for managing and reporting 
risks. Work is ongoing to create a 
consolidated overview across the Group, 
with this being a priority area for 2018. 
In 2018, the risk management framework 
will be fully embedded and integrated 
with clinical governance and patient 
experience indicators to drive 
risk management as a cornerstone 
of outstanding quality.
Significant risks facing the Group are 
managed through risk registers and are 
assessed in terms of consequence and 
likelihood. Each risk has an identified 
lead who works to monitor and mitigate 
that risk. Risk registers are reviewed on 
a regular basis at all levels in line with 
the Group’s risk policy framework and/
or in response to changes in the risk 
environment (for example following 
a change in regulations). 
The principal risks facing the Group 
are drawn from the Group’s risk 
framework and are linked to the Group’s 
strategic drivers, as set out in the Chief 
Executive Officer’s strategy section 
on page 14. 
Clinical risks
During 2017, the CGSC chaired by 
Professor Dame Janet Husband focused 
on key clinical risks and trends including 
the review of notifiable incidents and 
external regulatory inspections across 
the Group. A copy of the CGSC Report 
can be found on pages 74 and 75.
Internal controls
The principal internal controls and 
assurance activity over the risks that are 
directly manageable by the Group are:
Standard policies and procedures
The Group has documented policies and 
standard procedures in place covering 
all significant activities and areas of risk, 
which are subject to regular review 
and update.
Assurance over clinical delivery and 
clinical regulatory compliance risks
As a provider of clinical services to 
patients, the Group faces a specific set 
of non-financial risks associated with 
such provision. 
In relation to these risks:
• the corporate Clinical Services team, 
which is independent of the hospital 
operations and is led by the Group 
Medical Director, oversees a national 
programme of clinical audits, in addition 
to conducting on-site clinical reviews 
of every hospital and non-hospital unit, 
according to the approach taken at 
regulatory inspections. These form 
part of the overall framework for clinical 
governance and quality, to ensure that 
clinical risk and clinical regulatory 
compliance is managed effectively 
across all registered sites. The results 
of these activities are regularly reviewed 
by the corporate Clinical Services team, 
Operations Directors, Matrons, the 
Executive Committee and the CGSC;
• each hospital has a risk register through 
which risks are managed; 
• comprehensive, non-financial 
management information on clinical 
performance, including safety, clinical 
effectiveness and customer experience, 
is produced and reviewed quarterly 
against pre-agreed standards by the 
corporate Clinical Services team, 
Operations Directors, Matrons, the 
Executive Committee and the CGSC. 
Specific KPI measures drawn from this 
management information are given 
on pages 18 and 19;
• the Group is subject to substantial 
levels of external inspection and review, 
both by the range of national healthcare 
regulators and through invited 
assurance inspections such as the 
rolling programme of health and safety 
inspections carried out by third-party 
specialists. The outcomes of these 
activities are reviewed by the Executive 
Committee and the CGSC; and
Risk management  
and internal control
The Group’s risk management and internal control systems  
are overseen by two Board committees, with overall 
responsibility lying with the Board of Directors as a whole. 51 
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
Governance Strategic Report Financial statements Other information
• the structures and processes for 
internal confirmation of clinical 
regulatory compliance and the level 
of evidence and assurance required 
to monitor this on an ongoing basis 
have been further strengthened and 
formalised in 2017.
Financial and operational controls
Financial control is established through:
• the annual process of preparing business 
plans and budgets, followed up by close 
monitoring of operational performance 
by the executive management and 
the Board;
• monthly monitoring of actual results, 
compared to budgets, forecasts and 
the previous year;
• all material capital expenditure is 
subject to an investment evaluation 
and authorisation procedure;
• common accounting policies and 
procedures; and
• the Group’s treasury position and 
forecast liquidity are kept under review 
to ensure that borrowings are aligned 
with the Group’s growth and are in 
compliance with banking covenants.
Other non-financial operational risks are 
managed by means of the application of 
best practice, as defined by Group policies 
and standard procedures, in areas such as 
project management, human resources 
management and IT security and delivery, 
supported by detailed performance 
monitoring of outputs and issues.
Internal audit/internal control assurance
The need for an Internal Audit function 
was reassessed by the Audit and Risk 
Committee early in 2017 and it was agreed 
that an Internal Audit function should be 
established. A process to recruit a Head 
of Audit was undertaken and the function 
established at the end of Q2 with a remit 
to establish the audit function and create 
a risk-based audit approach for 2018.
A small team of experienced, professional 
Internal Auditors is being assembled and 
the function will be fully staffed by the 
end of Q1, 2018. 
Internal Audit works closely with the 
other internal assurance mechanisms, 
i.e. Clinical Audit, Health and Safety 
Audits (including engineering) and Risk 
Management to align reviews where 
possible. Additionally, the Risk Management 
process moved its formal reporting line 
from Legal to Internal Audit in Q4.
Continuous learning
The Group recognises the importance 
of improving services by learning from 
events that fall below the expected 
outstanding quality. No matter how 
robust and reliable, internal control 
systems and risk management cannot 
guarantee to remove all error or loss. 
The Group takes all instances of incidents 
(including near misses), complaints, 
control failures, regulatory non-compliance 
or other risk events very seriously. As such, 
we have a detailed process in place to 
fully understand the cause and identify 
learning to minimise the chances of 
reoccurrence. 
An open culture is actively promoted and 
monitored within the Group to positively 
encourage the reporting of all risk events 
and other issues arising. The number and 
nature of events arising and the operation 
of event management processes are closely 
monitored by hospital management, the 
Executive Committee, the Audit and Risk 
Committee and the CGSC.
The Group offers an independent 
whistleblowing service to facilitate 
reporting of any issues or concerns that 
staff may have that they are unwilling 
to raise via any other channel.
Viability Statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
2014 revision of the Corporate Governance 
Code, the Directors assessed the viability 
of the Group and have adopted a period 
of three years for the assessment. A three-
year period was selected as it corresponds 
with the Board’s strategic planning horizon. 
Whilst existing bank facilities extend until 
July 2019, this viability assessment has 
also considered the ability of the Group to 
refinance bank facilities at the end of 2018 
based on current market-lending multiples.
The assessment conducted considered the 
Group’s revenue, EBITDA, operating profit, 
cash flows, risk management controls and 
loan covenants over the three-year period. 
These metrics were subject to severe 
downside stress testing and sensitivity 
analyses over the assessment period, taking 
account of the Group’s current position, the 
Group’s experience of managing adverse 
conditions in the past and the impact of 
a number of severe yet plausible scenarios, 
based on the principal risks set out in the 
Strategic Report.
These scenarios may be summarised 
as follows:
• Spire Healthcare is unable to access 
sufficient numbers of appropriately 
qualified clinical staff, restricting growth, 
driving up clinical staff costs and 
constraining the capacity of new hospital 
developments (this links with Availability 
of key medical staff);
• a key hospital is subject to temporary 
suspension of trade, with a permanent 
adverse impact on revenues, for example, 
due to failure to meet Care Quality 
Commission (‘CQC’) regulatory standards 
(this links with Compliance with laws, 
regulations and other applicable 
requirements);
• the Group is subject to temporary 
suspension of trade, with a temporary 
adverse impact on revenue, for example, 
as a result of a successful cyber attack 
on key business systems (this links with 
Cyber security); 
• the downside modelling of a number of 
risks which result in a decline in earnings, 
including lower NHS tariffs or referral 
rates or a general economic downturn 
(this links with Macroeconomic conditions 
and Government policy); and
• the business is subject to significant 
uninsured losses arising from medical 
malpractice, negligence or similar claims 
(this links with Insurance).
Based on the results of this analysis, 
the Directors confirm that they have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the next three years. 52

Clinical care The Group’s future growth depends upon its 
ability to maintain its reputation for high-quality 
services by meeting its quality goals. Poor clinical 
outcomes, negative media comment or patient, 
GP and/or consultant dissatisfaction could 
reduce the quality ratings, which could lead 
to a loss of patient referrals and lost earnings.
Spire Healthcare continually monitors its clinical 
standards, policies and procedures through the 
Board’s Clinical Governance and Safety Committee 
(‘CGSC’).
During 2017, regular management information 
and associated reporting has been provided to the 
Executive Committee. Management information is 
subject to continuous improvement to best leverage 
underlying clinical data.
There is a schedule of regular Clinical Reviews using 
the Care Quality Commission’s (‘CQC’) key lines of 
enquiries. Each hospital is reviewed at least annually 
with an action plan for improvement as well as 
an overarching improving plan across the Group.  
The Group reviews and maintains insurance to 
mitigate the possibility of a major loss. Adequacy of 
cover is reviewed annually with the Group’s brokers.
‘Project Outstanding’ was launched in early 2018 
with the overarching objective of achieving a rating 
of Outstanding across the Group by 2020. 
Government 
policy
Change in the medium-term public funding of 
NHS services provision, and/or the prioritisation 
of this funding to particular service lines over 
time (elective healthcare, A&E, community care, 
etc.), could adversely reduce the flow of NHS 
patients to Spire Healthcare.
Changes in the service level requirements for 
providers of NHS services, and service level 
commitments to members of the public 
served by the NHS, could adversely impact the 
attractiveness of privately funded treatment.
Changes in fiscal policy could increase the 
burden of welfare resulting in a reduction of 
NHS-funded options.
A fundamental change in the tariff structure 
(pricing arrangements) associated with the 
provision of services to the NHS could result 
in reduced access to patients, reduced tariffs, 
or reduced prices leading to reduced revenues 
and/or margins.
The Group derives revenues from three primary 
payor groups (PMI, NHS and Self-pay) and this 
provides a natural ‘hedge’ against exposure to risks 
in each of these payors. The Group looks to optimise 
the mix of revenues across each of these payor 
groups dependent upon local market circumstances. 
For example, restricted access to NHS treatment 
can lead to increased numbers of patients electing 
to pay privately for their healthcare needs.
The Group’s service levels are confirmed by 
regular surveys of patients, GPs and consultants, 
which provide ongoing feedback to ensure 
NHS requirements (whether as providers or as 
commitments to its patients) are met. In addition, 
the Board regularly reviews the competitiveness of 
its patient offering (both NHS and private patients).
The Board continually monitors Government policy, 
NHS requirements and associated tariff structures 
to consider the need for cost and/or investment 
reduction, whether in the short, medium or  
long term.

Compliance with 
laws, regulations 
and other 
applicable 
requirements
The Group operates in a highly regulated 
environment, including complying with the 
requirements of, for example, the CQC, NHS 
Improvement and the CMA.
Failure to comply with laws, regulations or 
regulatory standards may expose the Group 
to patient claims, fines, penalties, damage to 
reputation, suspension from the treatment of 
NHS patients, loss of hospital licence and loss 
of private patients, such that the Group may not 
be able to operate one or more of its hospitals, 
causing a significant reduction in profit.
The CQC has continued its inspection regime 
which assesses and rates hospitals and makes 
these results publicly available. If a hospital fared 
badly in one of these inspections, it could result 
in that hospital being assessed as ‘Inadequate’ 
which could have significant regulatory and 
reputational impacts. As at the end of 2017, 
no Spire Healthcare hospitals had received an 
‘Inadequate’ rating.
The introduction of the General Data Protection 
Regulation (‘GDPR’) will bring tighter controls 
and responsibilities to how the Group controls 
and processes personal data.
The Group is aware that HMRC has indicated 
it will hold a public consultation on reforms to 
the IR35 Regulation. It will be important that the 
Group understands the impact that any changes 
would have. 
In addition, the Group could fail to anticipate 
legal or regulatory changes leading to a 
significant financial or reputational impact.
The Group continues to strengthen its Group-wide 
risk management framework (and associated policies 
and procedures) to ensure that risks are mitigated 
as far as possible, the Executive Committee has 
appropriate visibility to ensure robust decision-
making, and the Group has the ability to monitor 
and react to the changing regulatory framework 
of a listed company in the healthcare sector.
The Group has a significant centralised clinical 
services team which assists hospitals in establishing 
and maintaining a high level of clinical performance.
Emerging legal or regulatory changes are monitored 
by the Board, the Executive Committee, the Audit 
and Risk Committee and the CGSC, in addition 
to consultations with external advisers and 
industry briefings. 
A GDPR implementation board is leading on 
preparation for GDPR. Progress has included 
a detailed gap analysis and the identification 
of associated risks and mitigations.
Insurance Healthcare companies, including Spire 
Healthcare, are sometimes subject to actions 
alleging negligence, malpractice and other legal 
claims that may involve large potential damages 
and significant defence costs, whether or not 
the defendant is ultimately found liable.
The Group could be subject to litigation for 
actions by third parties or may be found liable 
for damages which may not be covered by its 
insurance policies, if the claims are in excess of 
cover or claims are not covered by the Group’s 
insurance due to other policy limitations or 
exclusions or where it has failed to comply 
with the terms of the policy.
The Group’s insurance premiums may increase 
and, if there is a significant deterioration 
in its claims experience, insurance may not 
be available on acceptable terms.
The Group holds third-party liability insurance to 
partially cover patient, third-party and employee 
personal injury claims, and is partially self-insured up 
to predetermined levels, above which its third-party 
liability insurance applies.
The Group reviews and maintains insurance 
adequacy of cover annually with the Group’s broker. 54

Concentration of 
PMI market
The PMI market is concentrated, with the 
top four companies (Bupa, AXA, Aviva and 
VitalityHealth (formerly PruHealth)) having 
a market share estimated at over 85%.
Loss of an existing contractual relationship 
with any of the key insurers could significantly 
reduce revenue and profit.
Further consolidation of the PMI market could 
adversely impact Spire Healthcare’s relative 
bargaining power in any ongoing commercial 
arrangements.
The Group works hard to maintain good 
relationships and a joint product/patient health 
offering with the PMI companies, which, in the 
opinion of the Directors, assists the healthcare sector 
as a whole in delivering high-quality patient care.
The Board believes continuing to invest in its well- 
placed portfolio of hospitals should provide a natural 
fit to the local requirements of all the PMI providers.
The Group continues to ensure we have long-term 
contracts in place with our PMI partners to avoid 
co-termination of contractual arrangements. 
Availability of key 
medical staff
Growing demand for healthcare, changes to the 
working requirements and a limited supply of 
appropriately qualified key medical staff may 
lead to a shortage of medical staff. Profitable 
growth, in line with the Group’s strategy, 
requires an expansion of clinical services in 
hospitals, particularly including more complex 
surgical procedures and ongoing treatment of 
higher-risk patients, which could be impacted 
by a shortage of key medical staff. In order to 
expand our directory of services at hospital level, 
in line with our strategy, it is vital to have access 
to appropriately qualified, clinical staff.
The market may see salary rates rise as 
competition for staff increases and, as a result, 
the Group’s costs may increase and its profits 
may reduce. 
There may be further complexity to recruitment 
post-Brexit.
The Board focuses on staff retention, with trends 
and changes in our staff survey informing our 
strategy for engagement with a focus on incentives, 
staff development and training.
Management deploys productivity tools and 
pursues opportunities to reduce clinical nursing 
time spent on non-clinical activities to optimise 
the effectiveness of its clinical staff base.
The Group has looked to ensure that all significant 
contracts run for a minimum of a year to avoid 
co-termination of contractual arrangements across 
its PMI base.
The Group believes consultants are attracted by 
its advanced facilities, technology and equipment, 
excellent brand and reputation, the availability of 
a broad range of treatments, skilled nursing staff 
and medical support staff, and the efficiency of 
administrative support. The Group undertakes 
continuous investment in its equipment, facilities 
and services to retain high-quality consultants and 
also provides theatre capacity to new consultants. 
This is confirmed by good consultant satisfaction 
levels, though these fell in 2017 .
Macroeconomic 
conditions
Approximately 70% of the Group’s revenue 
is dependent on private patients having PMI, 
paid by their employer or paid by the individual, 
or being able to afford its services (Self-pay).
In an economic downturn, the number of 
insured individuals falls with the level of 
employment and individuals have reduced 
real income to fund insurance or Self-pay 
for procedures.
This would have an adverse effect on the 
Group’s business, the results of its operations 
and prospects.
The Board manages this risk by regularly reviewing 
market conditions and economic indicators to assess 
whether actions are required.
As successfully employed in the recent economic 
downturn, if the private market contracts, the Group 
can try to reduce costs and future investment to 
improve profit and cash flow, and may be able to 
offer the released capacity to the NHS at its lower 
tariff, reducing the impact on profit.
Macroeconomic conditions may put comparable 
finance strain on competitors, who may not be as 
well positioned to respond. Opportunities may arise 
from reduced competition or market consolidation.
Competitor 
challenge
Spire Healthcare operates in a highly competitive 
market. New or existing competitors may enter 
the market of one or more of our existing 
hospitals, or offer new services.
The potential impact would be the loss of 
market share due to a new competitor and 
reduced profitability and cash flow.
The Group maintains a watching brief on new and 
existing competitor activity and retains the ability 
to react quickly to changes inpatient and 
market demand.
The Group considers that a partial mitigation of the 
impact of competitor activity is ensured by providing 
patients with high-quality care and by maintaining 
good working relationships with GPs and consultants. 55

Risk theme Risk description and impact
Risk change  
2017 How we manage the risk
Cyber security The Group’s information technology platform 
supports, among other things, management 
control of patient administration, billing and 
financial information and reporting processes. 
In common with other corporate organisations, 
the Group faces the challenges of a continually 
evolving external cyber threat landscape, and 
could become vulnerable to computer viruses, 
break-ins and similar disruption from 
unauthorised tampering.
The Group’s business could be disrupted if its 
information systems fail or if its databases are 
breached, destroyed or damaged. This could 
cause financial and reputational impacts.
The level of risk to Spire Healthcare’s IT 
architecture and systems continues to grow 
as the volume of cyber security threats are 
increasing and becoming more sophisticated.
Spire Healthcare’s technical IT teams continually 
monitor these developments as a business as usual 
activity. Working with a number of specialist and 
industry leading technical partners, Spire Healthcare 
has created multiple layers of business protection 
through the use of advanced intrusion detection 
and protection systems, web access firewalls and 
advanced content filtering to combat denial of 
service attacks.
Business processes are also kept under review and 
user education regularly carried out to minimise 
the possibility of ransomware incidents.
Regular third-party penetration testing is performed 
on Spire Healthcare’s core IT systems. New IT system 
developments are subject to rigorous penetration 
testing prior to release. 
This approach allows us to keep pace with the 
increasing risk profile, ensuring that the risk to Spire 
Healthcare has remain stable.
Investment plans 
and execution
The capital investment programme (which 
includes IT system developments) at any time 
consists of a number of individually significant 
projects simultaneously in progress.
With any major project there are risks, such 
as major cost overrun or substantial delay 
in delivery, or disruption to business activities 
during capital builds which could impact 
upon the expected returns, the Group’s 
planned profit growth and future cash flow.
The Group conducts a financial and operational 
appraisal process to evaluate the expected returns 
on capital during the evaluation phase of the project.
Comprehensive project management is employed 
throughout the project, from the evaluation, 
to the bid process, agreement of contract terms 
and conditions, cost forecasting, as well as regular 
monitoring and management of progress.
Regular reporting of all significant projects to 
the executive sponsor and the Board is provided. 
Learnings from recent new builds will strengthen 
the process going forward. 
Liquidity and 
covenant risk
The Group may not have sufficient liquid 
resources to meet its financial liabilities as they 
fall due, or breach financial covenants linked 
to its borrowings.
Failure to meet its obligations or covenants 
would have a substantial adverse effect on the 
Group’s reputation and may lead to borrowings 
becoming repayable earlier than contracted for.
The Group actively monitors and manages its 
liquid asset position, its financial liabilities falling 
due and the cover against its loan covenants.
The Board has considered the risk in detail as part 
of its assessment of the viability of the Company.
The Strategic Report, from pages 1 to 55, was reviewed, approved by the Board  
and signed on its behalf on 1 March 2018.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
Dear Shareholder,
Executive Directors
It was with great sadness that we 
announced the death of Andrew White 
in July following a period of illness. Andrew 
joined Spire Healthcare towards the end 
of 2015 and was appointed an Executive 
Director the following June. He made a 
significant contribution during his time 
with us, and his enthusiastic and positive 
approach are deeply missed.
I stepped back from my position as 
Executive Chairman at the end of June 
due to an illness and resumed my previous 
role of Non-Executive Chairman. At this 
time Simon Gordon agreed to act as 
Chief Executive Officer on an interim basis 
until a full-time appointment was made. 
I remained engaged with the business 
during my period of treatment.
Chief Executive Officer
We were delighted to appoint Justin Ash 
as the Company’s new Chief Executive 
Officer from 30 October 2017. The Board 
believes Justin’s skillset is particularly 
suited to developing Spire Healthcare 
as the premier UK private hospital group 
and to creating and delivering a strategy 
focused on our private patients. 
Deputy Chairman and 
Senior Independent Director
I would like to take the opportunity 
to thank John Gildersleeve for his wise 
counsel and contribution to our Board. 
John served as our Senior Independent 
Director from Admission in July 2014 but 
chose not to seek re-election at last year’s 
annual general meeting.
After an extensive search which I led 
with the assistance of Heidrick & Struggles, 
we were delighted to appointed Peter 
Bamford as Deputy Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director. Peter brings 
considerable plc board and leadership 
experience and the appointment maintains 
a strong independent presence on our 
Board. He gave considerable focus to 
ensuring that there was appropriate 
scrutiny of decision-making during my 
period of illness. Peter also chairs our 
Nomination Committee. 
The table on page 61 summarises 
all of the changes to the Board made 
during 2017.
Subsequent to the year end, on 1 March 
2018, Simon Gordon, our Chief Financial 
Officer, resigned from the Board and will 
leave the Group at the end of March 2018. 
Further details of Simon’s departure are 
set out in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 78 to 95. 
Simon has made a significant contribution 
to Spire during his time with the Group, 
and I would like to thank him in particular 
for his extensive contribution to the 
transformation of the business from 
private ownership to public listing, and 
more recently for fulfilling the interim 
CEO role in difficult circumstances. 
We also recently received notification 
from Mediclinic Jersey Limited, our 
largest shareholder and a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of Mediclinic International PLC, 
that Danie Meintjes would not seek 
re-election at the annual general meeting 
in May. It has nominated Dr Ronnie  
van der Merwe to replace Danie as a  
Non-Executive Director of the Company 
from the conclusion of the meeting.
I am delighted with the Board appointments that the 
Company has been able to make during the year which has 
returned Spire Healthcare to a strong governance footing.
Chairman’s Governance Letter

Governance Strategic Report Financial statements Other information
Governance 
The Company did not comply with two 
aspects of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, one on a short-term basis during 
the year, and you can read further about 
these and the Board’s responses on 
page 62. The appointment of Justin Ash 
as Chief Executive Officer and Peter 
Bamford as Senior Independent Director 
has strengthened the Board.
As in previous years, the Board has taken 
the matter of governance extremely 
seriously and continues to perform 
well with the Non-Executive Directors 
all providing extensive challenge 
to management.
2017 performance evaluation
The Board’s evaluation in 2017 was led 
by Peter Bamford and facilitated using 
Thinking Board, Independent Audit 
Limited’s governance assessment process. 
Independent Audit Limited is a reviewer of 
board performance and is independent of 
the Company. This was the first time since 
Admission that an external third-party 
had been engaged by the Company 
and the review covered areas including 
strategy, Board and management 
succession, Board culture, balance 
and diversity, meetings and processes, 
investor relations, decision-making, risk 
management and Board committees. 
The principal conclusions of Independent 
Audit Limited’s review were presented by 
their lead facilitator and discussed at our 
meeting in November. It was determined 
that the Company’s Board continued 
to operate effectively, in an open and 
transparent manner, providing support 
and challenge to senior management. 
A fuller review of the results and our 
agreed action plan can be found on 
page 65 as well as an update on the 
actions identified from last year’s 
evaluation. The Board will again use 
the services of an independent third 
party to facilitate its evaluation in 2018.
Peter Bamford also separately led the 
review of my performance as chair of 
the Board in conjunction with the other 
Non-Executive Directors.
Risk management and corporate culture
Our risk culture is centred on risk 
awareness, openness, continuous 
improvement and encouraging the 
right behaviours to ensure an appropriate 
outcome for both the Company and 
its customers. A review of our principal 
risks is set out on pages 52 to 55.
Annual general meeting
Finally, the Board looks forward to 
meeting as many shareholders as possible 
at our annual general meeting which 
will be held at 11.00am on Thursday, 
24 May 2018 at the offices of Freshfields 
Bruckhaus Deringer LLP , Northcliffe House, 
28 Tudor Street, London EC4Y 0AY.

Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code in 2017
The UK Corporate Governance Code provides the standard for corporate governance in the UK. The Financial Conduct Authority 
requires listed companies to disclose whether they have complied with the provisions of the UK Code throughout the financial year 
under review.
The Company has complied with the principles (and code provisions) of the UK Corporate Governance Code issued in April 2016  
(the ‘UK Code’), throughout the year except as shown in the following table.
UK Code provision How has the Company not complied with the provisions of the UK Code? The Board’s response
A.2.1 From 14 March 2016 to 12 June 2017, the roles of Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer were exercised by Garry Watts.
Simon Gordon was appointed interim Chief Executive 
Officer on 13 June 2017 and the roles were split. 
Garry Watts resumed the position of Non-Executive 
Chairman on 1 July 2017.
A.3.1 Garry Watts was not independent on appointment to the 
Board having previously served as Executive Chairman of 
the Company prior to IPO.
The Non-Executive Directors have determined that  
Garry Watts continues to lead the Board effectively.
Director independence
Independence is determined by ensuring 
that, apart from receiving their fees for 
acting as directors or owning shares, 
Non-Executive Directors do not have any 
other material relationship or additional 
remuneration from, or transactions with, 
the Group, its promoters, its management 
or its subsidiaries, which in the judgement 
of the Board may affect, or could 
appear to affect, their independence 
of judgement.
The Chairman did not satisfy the 
independence criteria on his appointment 
to the Board. In addition, the Company 
does not consider the following two 
Non-Executive Directors to be independent 
for the reasons given:
• Simon Rowlands previously held a senior 
position with the Company’s former 
principal shareholder, Cinven; and
• Danie Meintjes has been nominated 
to act as a Non-Executive Director 
by Mediclinic International PLC, the 
principal shareholder, whose subsidiary, 
Mediclinic Jersey Limited (formerly 
Remgro Jersey Limited), entered into 
a relationship agreement with the 
Company in June 2015 (the ‘Relationship 
Agreement’). Under the terms of 
the Relationship Agreement, when 
Mediclinic International PLC controls 
15% or more of the votes, it will be 
entitled to appoint one Non-Executive 
Director to the Board. It controls 
29.9% of votes as at 1 March 2018. 
The Directors believe that the terms 
of the Relationship Agreement will 
enable the Group to carry on its 
business independently of Mediclinic 
International PLC.
The Board considers that, excluding 
the Chairman, half of the Board is 
independent of management and free 
from any business or other relationship 
that could affect the exercise of their 
independent judgement.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
Board and Committee structure
Ultimate responsibility for the 
management of the Group rests with  
the Board of Directors. 
The Board focuses primarily upon 
strategic and policy issues and is 
responsible for:
• leadership of the Group;
• implementing and monitoring effective 
controls to assess and manage risk;
• supporting the senior leadership 
team to formulate and execute 
the Group’s strategy;
• monitoring the performance 
of the Group; and
• setting the Group’s values 
and standards.
There is a specific schedule of matters 
reserved for the Board.
The Executive Chairman and the 
Chief Executive Officer
Between 14 March 2016 and 12 June 
2017, Garry Watts served as both 
Executive Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer. Simon Gordon was appointed as 
interim Chief Executive Officer on 13 June 
2017. Garry Watts resumed the role of 
Non-Executive Chairman on 1 July 2017. 
The Company has set out in writing a 
division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman, Senior Independent Director 
and the Chief Executive Officer.
The Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors bring a 
wide range of skills and experience to the 
Board. The independent Non-Executive 
Directors represent a strong, independent 
element on the Board and are well placed 
to constructively challenge and support 
management. They help to shape 
the Group’s strategy, scrutinise the 
performance of management in 
meeting the Group’s objectives and 
monitor the reporting of performance.
Their role is also to satisfy themselves 
with regard to the integrity of the Group’s 
financial information and to ensure that 
the Group’s internal controls and risk 
management systems are robust 
and defensible.
The independent Non-Executive 
Directors oversee the adequacy of the risk 
management and internal control systems 
(from their membership of the Audit and 
Risk Committee and Clinical Governance 
and Safety Committee (‘CGSC’)), as well 
as the remuneration for the Executive 
Directors (from their membership of the 
Remuneration Committee).
As members of the Nomination 
Committee, the Non-Executive Directors 
also play a pivotal role in Board succession 
planning and the appointment of new 
Executive Directors.
Your Board in 2017
During the year, the Board met for seven 
scheduled meetings but also convened on 
other occasions, normally by telephone, 
to discuss certain specific matters of 
business. Director attendance at scheduled 
meetings is shown on page 65.
The agenda at scheduled meetings in 
2017 covered standing agenda items, 
including: a review of the Group’s 
performance by the Chief Executive 
Officer or Chief Operating Officer, the 
current month’s and year to date financial 
statistics by the Chief Financial Officer 
and a review of clinical performance. 
In addition, the Board received a verbal 
report from committee chairs, where their 
committee met immediately in advance 
of the scheduled Board meeting, and the 
Board regularly received reports on legal 
and statutory matters.
During October and November, the Board 
devoted considerable attention to the 
potential offer for the Company received 
from Mediclinic International PLC. Before 
reaching its decision to reject the potential 
offer the Board gave consideration to the 
views of all stakeholders. Danie Meintjes 
did not attend Board meetings when 
the potential offer was discussed.
Also in 2017, the Board focused on major 
elements of the Group’s operations by:
• reviewing the opening of the two 
new hospitals at Manchester and 
Nottingham, and progress made 
at Spire St Anthony’s Hospital; and
• receiving, reviewing and approving 
other major capital expenditure 
proposals.
The Board received regular briefings on 
the trial of Ian Paterson and agreed the 
basis for a settlement fund for the benefit 
of his victims.
The Board has a formal schedule of 
matters reserved to it and delegates 
certain matters to committees. 
Specific matters reserved for the Board 
considered during the year to 31 December 
2017 included reviewing the Group’s 
performance (monthly and year to date), 
approving capital expenditure, setting 
and approving the Group’s strategy 
and annual budget.
The Board’s plan for 2018
It is planned that the Board will convene 
on seven formal scheduled occasions 
during 2018, as well as holding any 
necessary ad hoc Board and committee 
meetings to consider non-routine business.
The Chairman and the other Non-
Executive Directors will meet on their own 
without the Executive Directors present. 
In addition, the Senior Independent 
Director and other Non-Executive 
Directors will meet without the Chairman 
present to discuss matters such as the 
Chairman’s performance.
The Board will maintain its focus on the 
Group’s pursuit of its 2018 targets and 
also review succession planning during 
the year. Its activities will include:
• review and approve the 2017 
Annual Report;
• review the proposed final dividend 
for 2017;
• review the revised five-year strategic 
plan and approve the 2018 Annual 
Operating Plan;
• consider specific major themes;
• embed the risk management 
framework;
• review the make up of the Board; and
• follow a rolling agenda, ensuring 
proper time for strategic debate.
Furthermore, the Board will remain 
focused on continuous improvement 
of clinical quality and maintain 
overall responsibility for the Group’s 
system of internal control and risk 
management processes via the relevant 
Board committees.

clinical, and the risk register to ensure the Board 
has adequate oversight of risk management 
and risk appetite.

Board on progress made.
Following his appointment Justin Ash has taken the 
opportunity to review the Group’s strategy and to 
present the results thereof to the Board in January 2018.
2018 Action plan
The 2017 Board evaluation identified three principal areas of focus and associated actions to address them during 2018.

With the implementation of the EU’s 
Market Abuse Regulations in 2016, the 
Board established a Disclosure Committee 
to ensure, under delegated authority from 
the Board, that the Company complies 
with its disclosure obligations, specifically 
under the Market Abuse Regulation and 
related legislation. The Disclosure 
Committee also manages the Company’s 
share dealing code, ensuring colleague 
compliance and provides training where 
required. The members of the Disclosure 
Committee are disclosed below.
Share Schemes Committee
In addition, the Board delegates 
certain responsibilities in relation to the 
administration of the Company’s share 
schemes on an ad hoc basis to the Share 
Schemes Committee. This committee 
operates in accordance with the delegation 
of authority agreed by the Board.
Executive Committee
The Executive Committee meets twice a 
month, splitting its time between project 
work and strategic matters. The Executive 
Committee delegates certain matters to 
the Safety, Quality and Risk Committee 
who have specific focus on safety, quality 
and risk matters respectively (see the 
Governance framework on page 66). 
Catherine Mason served as Chief 
Operating Officer until October 2017, 
when she left the organisation. The Group 
is currently in the process of recruiting 
Catherine’s replacement.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
Governance Strategic Report Financial statements Other information
To the extent that Directors are unable to 
attend scheduled meetings, or additional 
meetings called on short notice, they will 
receive the papers in advance and relay 
their comments to the Chairman for 
communication at the meeting. The 
Chairman will follow up after the meeting 
in relation to both the discussions held 
and decisions taken.
Effectiveness
Board composition
The Board seeks to ensure that both it 
and its committees have the appropriate 
range of skills, experience, independence 
and knowledge of the Group to enable 
them to discharge their respective duties 
and responsibilities effectively; for 
example, the 2018 Board calendar 
includes both sessions on clinical and 
statutory regulations, and hospital visits.
The Board considers its size and 
composition to be appropriate for the 
current requirements of the business but 
will continue to keep this under review.
Committee composition is set out in the 
relevant committee reports. No one other 
than committee chairs and members of 
the committees are entitled to participate 
in meetings of the Audit and Risk, CGSC, 
Disclosure, Nomination and Remuneration 
committees, unless by invitation of the 
respective committee chair. 
Peter Bamford is the Deputy Chairman 
and Senior Independent Director. 
Biographical details of the Directors 
are set out on pages 56 and 57.
Appointments to the Board
Recommendations for appointments to 
the Board are made by the Nomination 
Committee. The Nomination Committee 
follows a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for the appointment of 
new Directors to the Board. Further 
information is set out in the Nomination 
Committee Report on pages 76 and 77.
Time commitment of the  
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors each have a 
letter of appointment, which sets out the 
terms and conditions of their directorship. 
An indication of the anticipated time 
commitment is provided in any 
recruitment role specification, and each 
Director’s letter of appointment provides 
details of the meetings that they are 
expected to attend.
Non-Executive Directors are required 
to set aside sufficient time to prepare 
for meetings, and to regularly refresh 
and update their skills and knowledge. 
In signing their letters of appointment, all 
Directors have agreed to commit sufficient 
time for the proper performance of their 
responsibilities, acknowledging that this 
will vary from year to year, depending 
on the Group’s activities.
Directors are expected to attend all 
Board and committee meetings, and any 
additional meetings, as required. Each 
Director’s other significant commitments 
were disclosed to the Board at the time of 
their appointment and they are required 
to notify the Board of any subsequent 
changes. The Group has reviewed the 
availability of the Non-Executive Directors 
and considers that each of them is able to, 
and in practice does, devote the necessary 
amount of time to the Group’s business.
During the Chairman’s illness in 2017, 
the other Directors ensured that adequate 
governance standards were maintained 
at Board and committee meetings that 
he missed.
Induction and training
Generally, reference materials are 
provided, including information about 
the Board, its committees, directors’ 
duties, procedures for dealing in the 
Group’s shares and other regulatory and 
governance matters, and Directors are 
advised of their legal and other duties, 
and obligations as directors of a 
listed company.
On appointment, Peter Bamford 
completed a detailed induction 
programme that included meeting with 
other members of the Board and the 
senior leadership team. He undertook a 
thorough familiarisation of the business 
which included a visit to Spire Bristol 
Hospital. The Company’s brokers and legal 
adviser also met with Peter to provide 
insight into the healthcare industry and 
provide training on directors’ statutory 
duties respectively. 
Justin Ash, on appointment as Chief 
Executive Officer, spent considerable 
time learning about the business through 
a number of hospital visits and meeting 
colleagues. He also received training on 
his statutory duties.
The Group Company Secretary ensures 
that any additional request for information 
is promptly supplied. The Chairman, 
through the Group Company Secretary, 
ensures that there is an ongoing process 
to review any internal or external training 
and development needs.
As already noted, in the event of a general 
training need, in-house training will be 
provided to the entire Board. Necessary 
and relevant regulatory updates are 
provided as a standing item at each 
Board meeting in the Group Company 
Secretary’s report and Board briefing by 
external advisers, where appropriate.
Information and support
The Board ensures that it receives, 
in a timely manner, information of 
an appropriate quality to enable it to 
adequately discharge its responsibilities. 
This is aided by the use of an online portal. 
Papers are provided to the Directors 
in advance of the relevant Board or 
committee meeting to enable them to 
make further enquiries about any matters 
prior to the meeting, should they so wish. 
This also allows Directors who are unable 
to attend to submit views in advance of 
the meeting.
Outside the Board papers process, 
the Executive Directors provide written 
updates to the Non-Executive Directors 
on important business issues, including 
financial and commercial information. In 
addition, relevant updates on shareholder 
matters (including analysts’ reports) are 
also provided to the Board.
All Directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Group Company Secretary. 
There is also an agreed procedure in place 
for Directors, in the furtherance of their 
duties, to take independent legal advice, 
if necessary, at the Group’s expense. 68 
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
Election of Directors
All the Directors, except John Gildersleeve, 
offered themselves for election or 
re-election at the third annual general 
meeting in May 2017 and, in future, will 
be re-elected in accordance with the 
requirements of the UK Code.
All Directors, except for Simon Gordon 
who leaves the Company on 31 March 
2018 and Danie Meintjes who will not 
seek re-election, will stand for election or 
re-election at the annual general meeting 
in 2018. The biographical details of each 
Director standing for election or re-
election is included in the 2018 Notice 
of Meeting. The Board believes that each 
of the Directors standing for election is 
effective and demonstrates commitment 
to their respective roles. Accordingly, 
the Board recommends that shareholders 
approve the resolutions to be proposed 
at the 2018 annual general meeting 
relating to the election of the Directors.
The biographical details of all current 
Directors are set out on pages 56 and 57.
Directors’ indemnities
The Directors of the Company have 
the benefit of a third-party indemnity 
provision, as defined by section 236 of 
the Companies Act 2006, in the Group’s 
Articles of Association. In addition, 
Directors and officers of the Group 
are covered by directors’ and officers’ 
liability insurance.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
The Companies Act 2006 provides that 
directors must avoid a situation where 
they have, or can have, a direct or indirect 
interest that conflicts, or possibly may 
conflict, with the Company’s interests. 
Directors of public companies may 
authorise conflicts and potential conflicts, 
where appropriate, if a company’s articles 
of association permit.
The Board has established formal 
procedures to authorise situations where 
a Director has an interest that conflicts, 
or may possibly conflict, with the interests 
of the Company (Situational Conflicts). 
Directors declare Situational Conflicts, 
so that they can be considered for 
authorisation by the non-conflicted 
directors.
In considering a Situational Conflict, these 
Directors act in the way they consider 
would be most likely to promote the 
success of the Group, and may impose 
limits, or conditions, when giving 
authorisation or, subsequently, if they 
think this is appropriate.
The Group Company Secretary records 
the consideration of any conflict and 
any authorisations granted. The Board 
believes that the system it has in place for 
reporting Situational Conflicts continues 
to operate effectively.
Accountability
The Audit and Risk Committee
The Audit and Risk Committee Report 
is set out on pages 70 to 73 and identifies 
its members, whose details are set out 
on page 57.
The report describes the Audit and Risk 
Committee’s work in discharging its 
responsibilities during the year ended  
31 December 2017, and its terms of 
reference can be found on the Group’s 
website at www.spirehealthcare.com.
Risk management and internal control
The Board has overall responsibility 
for establishing and maintaining a 
sound system of risk management and 
internal control, and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. This system is designed to 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risks 
facing the Group and safeguard its assets. 
No system of internal control can provide 
absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. The Group’s system 
is designed to provide the Directors with 
reasonable assurance that issues are 
identified on a timely basis and are dealt 
with appropriately.
The Audit and Risk Committee and 
the Clinical Governance and Safety 
Committee, whose reports are set out 
on pages 70 to 73 and pages 74 and 75, 
respectively, assist the Board in reviewing 
the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management system and internal 
controls, including financial, clinical, 
operational and compliance controls.
Executive compensation and risk
Only independent Non-Executive 
Directors are allowed to serve on 
the Audit and Risk Committee and 
Remuneration Committee. The Non-
Executive Directors are therefore able to 
bring their experience and knowledge of 
the activities of each committee to bear 
when considering the critical judgements 
of the other.
This means that the Directors are in a 
position to consider carefully the impact 
of incentive arrangements on the Group’s 
risk profile and to ensure the Group’s 
Remuneration Policy and programme 
are structured, so as to accord with the 
long-term objectives and risk appetite 
of the Group.
Financial and non-financial risk
The Clinical Governance and Safety 
Committee, with the Audit and Risk 
Committee, collectively ensure that the 
control and monitoring of both financial 
and non-financial risks is satisfactory.
In addition, both committees seek to 
ensure, as far as practicable, there are 
no elements omitted or unnecessarily 
duplicated and that all critical judgements 
receive the correct level of challenge.
Relations with shareholders
The Board is committed to 
communicating with shareholders 
and stakeholders in a clear and open 
manner, and seeks to ensure effective 
engagement through the Group’s 
regular communications, the annual 
general meeting and other investor 
relations activities.
The Group undertakes an ongoing 
programme of meetings with investors, 
which during 2017 was led by the Chief 
Financial Officer and the Director, Strategy 
and Investor Relations and they attend a 
majority of the meetings. During the year, 
there were in excess of 230 individual 
meetings, conference presentations, 
group lunches and telephone briefings 
with investors.

The chair of the Remuneration Committee 
led a consultation on executive 
remuneration in February 2017 with both 
major shareholders and voting agencies.
The Chairman, Senior Independent 
Director and committee chairs remain 
available for discussion with shareholders 
on matters under their areas of 
responsibility, either through contacting 
the Group Company Secretary or 
directly at the annual general meeting.
The Company reports its financial results 
to shareholders twice a year, with the 
publication of its annual and half yearly 
financial reports. In conjunction with 
these announcements, presentations 
or teleconference calls are held with 
institutional investors and analysts, 
and copies of any presentation materials 
issued are made available through 
the Company’s website at  
www.spirehealthcare.com.
All Directors are expected to attend 
the Company’s annual general meeting, 
providing shareholders with the 
opportunity to question them about 
issues relating to the Group, either during 
the meeting, or informally afterwards. 
Modern slavery
During the year, the Board approved its 
first Modern Slavery Act statement which 
confirmed that Spire Healthcare is 
committed to acting ethically and with 
integrity in all its business dealings, and to 
implementing and enforcing systems and 
controls to prevent modern slavery in our 
own business and our supply chains. We 
are also committed to ensuring there is 
transparency in our approach to tackling 
modern slavery in our own business and 
supply chains. Spire Healthcare expects 
the same high standards from all of its 
contractors, suppliers and other business 
partners. All suppliers are required to 
comply with the law as well as our policies 
and codes to combat the use of forced, 
compulsory or trafficked labour, or anyone 
held in slavery or servitude, whether 
adults or children. We expect our suppliers 
in turn to hold their own suppliers to the 
same high standards. All supplier-facing 
staff receive training to raise awareness 
on the requirements of the Modern 
Slavery Act and are required to support 
the continued risk assessment and roll-out 
of our due diligence processes.
A copy of our Modern Slavery Act 
statement can be found on our website.
Annual general meeting
Shareholders are encouraged to 
participate at the Company’s annual

Audit and Risk Committee Report
Dear Shareholder,
As Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee 
(the ‘Committee’), I am pleased to present 
our report for the year ended 
31 December 2017. 
Risk management and internal controls
Internal audit and risk management 
remained areas of particular focus for 
the Committee during the year and we 
allocated a significant proportion of each 
meeting to ensure a robust discussion 
on both matters.
Internal Audit function
As highlighted in our last annual report, 
we planned to set-up an in-house Internal 
Audit function and at the end of Q2 we 
appointed our new Director of Internal 
Audit and Risk. A small team of Internal 
Audit professionals were hired during the 
remainder of the year and the function 
should be fully resourced by the end of 
Q1 2018.
2017 and 2018 Internal Audit Plans
The 2017 Internal Audit Plan was focused 
on areas of higher risk and covered:
• a revenue audit (completed on behalf 
of Spire Healthcare by KPMG LLP);
• a review of physical asset assessments 
and maintenance through the buildings 
maintenance system; and 
• an audit of business continuity planning.
Summary reports are sent to me as chair 
of the Committee when published and 
also included in the quarterly activity 
report to the Audit and Risk Committee.
Our Internal Audit Plan for 2018 continues 
to focus on areas identified as higher 
risk. Additionally, a regular, risk-based 
rotational Internal Audit of each of 
the 39 principal hospital sites (initially 
covering Finance (including Revenue, 
Billing and Stock Management), HR, IT, 
Payroll, Health and Safety, and Hospital 
Governance) will commence in Q2 2018, 
such that each hospital is intended to be 
audited at least once every three years.
An Internal Audit Plan will continue to 
be approved by the Committee on an 
annual basis.
Risk management
This year, a new risk management 
framework was implemented, following 
the review of risk management by 
the Board noted in last year’s update.
Each hospital has a risk register and 
supporting governance structure, with 
processes for managing and reporting 
risks. In 2018, further work will be 
done to embed the risk management 
framework and integrate it with clinical 
governance and patient experience 
indicators to drive risk management 
as a cornerstone of outstanding quality.
Significant risks facing the Group are 
managed through risk registers and 
are assessed in terms of consequence  
and likelihood. Each risk has an identified 
lead who works to monitor and mitigate 
that risk. 
An overview of the risk management and 
internal controls processes are contained 
on pages 50 to 55. The Committee, with 
the assistance of the Clinical Governance 
and Safety Committee (‘CGSC’) (which 
focuses on key non-financial risks, 
including patient and clinical risks), 
carried out the following during the year:
• monitored the work carried out by 
the CGSC in relation to the risks within 
its remit;
• monitored the Group’s system of 
internal control;
• monitored the risks and associated 
controls over the financial reporting 
processes, including the process by 
which the Group’s financial statements 
are prepared for publication; and
• reviewed reports from the external 
auditor on any issues identified during 
the course of its work, including on 
control weaknesses.
Our priority is to deliver an effective governance and risk 
management framework that allows us to ensure the 
appropriateness of the Group’s financial reporting.

Significant issues and material judgements
The Audit and Risk Committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted and whether management has 
made appropriate estimates and judgements. The table below summarises the matters where the most material judgements 
have been made in relation to reporting in 2017:
Matters Judgement and estimation required How the Committee gained comfort on the matter
Improper 
revenue 
recognition:
Pressure to achieve results and secure bonus 
payments could lead management to manipulate the 
financial reporting of revenue. This could include the:
Management carry out a detailed review of monthly hospital 
performance compared to forecast, in particular focusing 
on the cut-off of revenue reported at the balance sheet date.
The Group maintains effective segregation of duties to 
safeguard the integrity of pricing masterfile data on which 
billing is dependent.
Management routinely reconcile revenues and cash collections 
as part of monthly cash flow management procedures.
Billing to PMIs is subject to selective independent audit by 
representatives of the relevant PMI and issues arising are 
subject to timely review by management as appropriate.
Internal audit work (commissioned from a third party) 
was carried out to test the adequacy of clinical coders, 
which did not raise any issues of concern.
The Committee noted the testing of revenue recognition 
in the year by the external auditors. This testing included the 
use of software-based assurance tools to check the accuracy of 
invoicing for services delivered to the NHS and to match pricing 
information to third-party reference information. This audit 
work covered over 90% of the NHS revenues recognised in the 
year. In addition the external auditors undertook sample-based 
substantive testing on private revenues, checking invoices 
back to procedure and price list information across a number 
of contracts. 
While considering the totality of revenues recognised in the 
year, external auditors also compared the total of revenues 
recorded in the year to cash collected to verify the recovery 
of revenue billed (after consideration of the movement in the 
year end debtors position). No significant differences were 
noted by the external auditors during the course of this work.
During 2017 an internal audit, supported by an external 
partner, was completed on Revenue and Billing function in 
a sample of hospitals which did not identify any significant 
errors or omissions. This area will remain a focus of the risk 
focused internal audit plan of hospitals during 2018.
• Management 
manipulation
• manipulation of prices charged, in particular 
in relation to PMI and NHS revenue;
• intentional mis-coding of procedures by hospitals 
impacting revenue recorded;
•  misreporting of other income in the year; and 
• overstatement of deferred revenue at the year end.
• Complexity 
of PMI and 
NHS contracts
The complexity of the pricing structures and the 
high volume of procedures undertaken present a 
risk in relation to the accuracy of revenue recognition, 
in particular the use of incorrect codes or prices.
Inappropriate 
capitalisation 
of development 
costs
Expenditure on capital projects has been significant 
in both 2016 and 2017. This expenditure covers 
a number of schemes across the network, most 
notably the development of two new hospitals 
in Manchester and Nottingham and the expansion  
of Spire St Anthony’s Hospital. There is a risk of 
inappropriate capitalisation of costs to these 
projects to enhance reported earnings
The Committee considered the controls over capital 
expenditure incorporated within the Group’s project 
management procedures, as implemented by the business 
development team.
The Committee noted that the work carried out by Ernst & 
Young LLP supported its own independent findings in this area.
Property 
carrying values
Freehold property is held at depreciated cost and its 
carrying value is required to be assessed for indicators 
of impairment by management on an annual basis. 
For those properties with an indicator, an impairment 
test is performed by calculating a value in use, 
by means of a discounted cash flow model. As this 
process involves some degree of estimation there 
is a risk that properties are held in the financial 
statements at inappropriate carrying values.
The Committee reviewed the impairment tests performed 
by management and the appropriateness of the 
assumptions applied.
For properties where headroom on the impairment test 
was limited the Committee reviewed the further evidence 
to support the specific site cash flow profile which supported 
the carrying value of the property. 72 
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
openness of interactions with management, 
confirmation that there has been no 
restriction in scope placed on them by 
management, the independence of 
their audit and how they have exercised 
professional scepticism. I also meet with 
the external lead audit partner ahead of 
each Committee meeting. Additionally, 
the Director of Internal Audit and Risk liaises 
with, and meets, the external auditors on a 
regular basis, and the external auditors also 
receive a copy of each internal audit report.
External financial reporting
The Committee is responsible for 
monitoring, reviewing and challenging the 
integrity of the financial statements, and 
ensuring compliance with legal, regulatory 
and statutory requirements, giving due 
consideration to the provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code.
The external auditor provided reports 
for the half year and year end reporting, 
including all significant issues, with 
an assessment of their view of the 
appropriateness of management’s 
judgements. 
At the request of the Board, the Committee 
considered whether the Annual Report 
and Accounts for the year ended 2017 
was fair, balanced and understandable, and 
whether it provided the necessary 
information for the shareholders to assess 
the Group’s performance, business model 
and strategy. The Committee took into 
account its own knowledge of the Group, 
its strategy and performance in the year, 
internal verification of the factual content, 
comprehensive review undertaken at 
different levels in the Group to ensure 
consistency and overall balance, and 
detailed review by senior management and 
the external auditor. The Committee was 
satisfied that, taken as a whole, the Annual 
Report and Accounts for the year ended 
2017 is fair, balanced and understandable, 
and has affirmed that view to the Board.
Recent accounting developments
The Committee gave particular focus 
to IFRS 16 Leases, which will be adopted 
in the year ending 31 December 2019, 
focusing on the implication for reported 
results, the methodology in which the 
standard would be adopted, and the 
implication for systems and process.
The Chief Financial Officer also updated 
the Committee on the Group’s adoption 
of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
The overall risk management framework, 
including the Board’s appetite for risk and 
the underlying process for capturing and 
reporting risk and control data, will 
continue to be reviewed and developed 
by the Board and its committees during 
2018 to ensure that changes to reflect the 
new regulatory environment and best 
practice are incorporated.
Other activities in 2017
In addition to providing oversight of 
the Group’s financial reporting, internal 
controls and risk framework, the Committee 
has had the opportunity to complete a 
number of deep dive sessions during the 
year. This included sessions on taxation, 
cyber security and health and safety. 
The Committee reviewed the nature of 
all items classified as ‘exceptional and 
other items’ in the year and management’s 
justification thereof against relevant 
accounting guidance. Where costs 
spanned a reporting period, the 
Committee considered the significance 
of the total expected costs to be incurred 
across reporting periods (based on 
management’s estimates) when 
determining the appropriateness of 
the accounting treatment.
External audit
The Committee has primary responsibility 
for the relationship with, and performance 
of, our external auditor. This includes 
making the recommendation on the 
appointment, reappointment and removal 
of the external auditor, assessing their 
independence on an ongoing basis and for 
negotiating the audit fee in conjunction 
with the Chief Financial Officer. 
Auditor appointment
Ernst & Young LLP was appointed as the 
Company’s external auditor in July 2014 
on our Admission to the London Stock 
Exchange, although they have served the 
business since 2008. Our current audit 
partner appointed by Ernst & Young LLP 
is Debbie O’Hanlon who took on the role 
in 2015. The Committee ensures that the 
external auditor adheres to The Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standard 3, which 
requires the rotation of the audit partner 
for listed companies every five years. 
As a result, Debbie O’Hanlon is anticipated 
to serve until the fiscal year commencing 
on 1 January 2020.
In May, the Committee discussed the 
mandatory requirement for companies 
to rotate their external auditor every 
10 years. Although noting that the 
10-year period technically began with the 
Company’s Admission in 2014, rather than 
an earlier point, the Committee agreed 
that a full external auditor tender should 
be linked to the end of Debbie O’Hanlon’s 
term as lead audit partner.
The Committee reviewed the 
independence and effectiveness of 
the external auditor. We did this by:
• reviewing its proposed plan for the 
2017 audit;
• discussing the results of its audit, 
including its views about material 
accounting issues and key judgements 
and estimates, and its audit report;
• reviewing the quality of the people and 
service provided by Ernst & Young LLP; and
• evaluating all of the relationships 
between the external auditor and the 
Group, to determine whether these 
impair, or appear to impair, the auditor’s 
independence.
The Committee recommended, and 
the Board subsequently agreed, that, 
for the year ending 31 December 2017, 
Ernst & Young LLP are reappointed under 
the current external audit contract 
and the Directors will be proposing the 
reappointment of Ernst & Young LLP at 
the annual general meeting in May 2018.
UK Competition and Markets Authority 
(CMA) Order
During the year, the Company has complied 
with the CMA Order in relation to Statutory 
Audit Services for Large Companies.
Audit risk
The Committee received from Ernst & 
Young LLP a detailed plan identifying the 
scope of their audit for the year, planning 
materiality and their assessment of key 
risks. The audit risk identification process 
is considered a key factor in the overall 
effectiveness of the external audit process.
These risks were reviewed by the 
Committee during the reporting of the half 
year results to ensure the external auditor’s 
areas of audit focus remain appropriate.
Working relationship with the 
external auditor
During the year, the Committee met with 
the external auditor without management 
present to provide additional opportunity 
for open dialogue and feedback between 
both parties. Matters typically discussed 
include the external auditor’s assessment 
of business risks, the transparency and

statements on page 120 for further 
information.
Our priorities for 2018
We will continue to enhance and improve 
our Risk Management structure within 
the organisation and better evaluate our 
principal risks using an enhanced Board 
Assurance Framework. Our Internal 
Audit team will be fully resourced during 
Q1 and will start undertaking regular 
audits in each of our hospitals on a risk 
rotational basis and following up on 
agreed improvements to ensure they 
are effectively implemented as well as 
completing a number of key corporate 
audits around governance. We will 
evaluate our Clinical Assurance programme 
to ensure its independence and focus 
remain appropriate and works closely 
with the internal audit function.
Non-audit services and independence
There are certain services termed ‘excluded 
services’ that are not permitted to be 
provided by the external auditor, including 
where the auditor may be required to audit 
its own work, would participate in activities 
that would normally be undertaken by 
management or is remunerated through 
a ‘success fee’ structure.
Ernst & Young LLP provided no non-audit 
services to the Group during the year 
ended 31 December 2017 (2016: nil). 
All non-audit fees are approved by 
the Committee.
Viability
The Committee reviewed the process 
undertaken by management to support 
and allow the Directors to make the 
Group’s viability statement. The Committee 
considered and provided input into the 
determination of which of the Group’s 
principal risks and combinations thereof 
might have an impact on the Group’s 
liquidity and solvency. The Committee 
reviewed the results of management’s 
scenario modelling and the stress testing 
of these models. The viability statement 
can be found on page 51.
Whistleblowing
The Committee also continued 
its monitoring and oversight of the 
procedures for the receipt, retention 
and treatment of qualifying disclosures 
by staff. Further details can be found 
in Our people on page 46.
Annual evaluation of the  
Committee’s performance
The evaluation of the Committee’s 
performance was carried out in November 
2017 which confirmed that it continued 
to perform effectively.

Clinical Governance and  
Safety Committee Report
Robust and effective clinical governance is central 
to Spire Healthcare’s focus on consistently delivering 
the highest quality healthcare for all our patients.
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Clinical Governance 
and Safety Committee (the ‘Committee’ 
or ‘CGSC’), I am pleased to present our 
fourth annual report on the Committee’s 
oversight of the Company’s clinical services, 
promotion of best practice and clinical 
governance.
Robust and effective clinical governance is 
fully recognised throughout the Company 
as the keystone to delivering excellence 
in every aspect of patient care. 
Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the 
support the Committee has received 
from the Board as a whole as well as 
that of individual non-executive members 
who have attended our meetings held 
in different Spire Healthcare hospitals 
around the country. 
I am extremely grateful to the central 
leadership team who have provided the 
Committee with a comprehensive review 
of clinical quality across our business. Early 
in the year we welcomed Alison Dickinson 
in her new role as Chief Nursing Officer. 
She has been working closely with our 
Group Medical Director, Dr Jean-Jacques 
de Gorter, driving forward a programme 
of continuous development and ever 
improving clinical quality. 
The appointment of our new Chief 
Executive Officer, Justin Ash, has brought 
new energy and focus to our drive for 
clinical excellence. While much has been 
accomplished during 2017, our Group 
Medical Director recently launched 
‘Project Outstanding’ which will introduce 
a programme of clinical and non-clinical 
workstreams to ensure that outstanding 
quality is delivered in everything we do 
within every hospital and clinic across 
our network.
2017 activities
During 2017, the CGSC met on seven 
occasions, three of which were at one of 
the Company’s hospitals. When holding 
our Committee meetings at hospitals, 
we extend the visit in order to engage 
with Hospital Directors, their senior 
management teams and front line staff. 
We also have a tour of the hospital 
facilities and discuss issues with members 
of the Medical Advisory Committee and 
other consultants in different specialties. 
These extended Clinical Governance 
visits give Committee members better 
insight into the particular strengths 
of an individual hospital as well as an 
appreciation of the local healthcare 
environment and specific challenges. 
Hospitals visited this year were to Spire 
Gatwick Park, Spire Manchester and 
Spire Leicester. 
Our clinical governance framework 
continues to underpin our approach 
to clinical assurance. The Committee 
regularly reviews a comprehensive set 
of data from our Clinical Reviews, our 
Quality Reports and a number of key 
performance indicators, including patient 
safety incidents. 
Our clinical assurance methodology 
follows that of the Care Quality 
Commission (‘CQC’) domains – Safe, 
Effective, Responsive, Caring, and Well-led. 
This approach allows us to align our own 
assessments with CQC inspections and 
to develop our services accordingly in a 
continuous bid to deliver outstanding care 
across our network.
This framework is augmented by a 
continued programme of Themed 
Reviews, which this year focused on:
• cancer, an area the Company continues 
to develop and where the drive for high 
standards involves co-ordinating our 
approach to bring our cancer teams 
together and working to strict protocols;
• complaints management, where the 
Company redesigned its approach to 
improve the patient experience; 
• pharmacy, where the Company has 
reorganised its service under a single 
management and governance 
programme; 
Professor Dame Janet Husband,  
Committee Chair 75 
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
Governance Strategic Report Financial statements Other information
• pathology, where the service has been 
redesigned with a new framework 
reporting directly to the clinical team; 
and
• Resident Medical Officers (RMOs), 
where we gained solid assurance from 
NES, our preferred supplier, on the 
appropriate selection, training and 
management of this key clinical cadre 
of trained medical practitioners.
In addition to regular governance reports 
the Committee receives ‘Responsible 
Officer Reports’ reviewing consultant 
appraisal and revalidation data as well 
as a recently introduced new metric of 
monitoring surgical intervention ratios 
across different specialties. This allows 
benchmarking of surgical procedures 
and is already proving to be a useful 
tool in assessing specialist practice 
and understanding practice trends. 
A culture of empowerment, team 
working and transparency is fostered to 
the benefit of all our staff and patients. 
In this light, whistleblowing is seen as a 
valuable tool for raising and understanding 
issues and oversight of its inquiry is an 
important role for the Committee both 
in identifying and rectifying any patient 
related concerns. 
As discussed in my report last year, during 
2017 the Committee worked closely with 
the Audit and Risk Committee (‘ARC’) in 
jointly reviewing our approach to risk. The 
two committees have clarified and revised 
their terms of reference, with the ARC 
being responsible for overall risk, while the 
CGSC concentrates on patient safety. The 
CGSC also has oversight of patient related 
aspects of Health and Safety Governance 
and Information Governance.
Regulatory inspections
Of the Spire Healthcare hospitals in 
England inspected by the CQC last year, 
three were rated ‘Outstanding’ and 
20 ‘Good’ overall. There were also many 
examples of hospitals rated ‘Outstanding’ 
and ‘Good’ for individual domains across 
our group. In addition, our two hospitals 
in Scotland were rated ‘Very Good’ by 
Healthcare Improvement Scotland and 
Spire Cardiff Hospital received a 
favourable inspection report (Healthcare 
Inspectorate Wales does not give ratings).
The process of preparing for and 
undergoing regulatory inspection has 
been immensely valuable in bringing 
teams together and in sharing information 
and best practice.
Hospital visits
At a personal level, I have now begun 
a second round of informal visits to all 
our hospitals. I do this primarily to listen 
to staff and patients; their engagement 
is extremely valuable in furthering my 
understanding of our services and of 
individual hospital culture. They also help 
to provide a strong link between the Board 
of Directors and our patients as I visit 
individual patients on the wards to ask 
about their experience. I am delighted to 
report that all the patients I have spoken 
to this year have been unanimous in their 
praise of our staff and their care. 
Health care, in all its guises, and however 
technically advanced it may become, will 
always be an intensely personal activity. 
I thank all our staff for their dedication to 
delivering the highest quality treatment 
and care.
Developing our work
While our Committee is functioning well, 
our approach and areas of focus will 
continue to be enhanced, linked to our 
annual evaluation of performance and 
the Company’s needs.
During 2018, the Committee looks 
forward to overseeing new approaches 
to quality governance, in particular to 
working with Justin Ash and his leadership 
team in their drive to deliver outstanding 
care across every hospital and every 
service in the Company.

Nomination Committee Report
The Committee’s principal activities in the year have been 
the arrangement of interim leadership, and the recruitment 
and appointment of our new Chief Executive Officer.
Dear Shareholder,
The Nomination Committee (the 
‘Committee’) plays a key role in appointing 
the right individuals to the Company’s 
Board and senior leadership team,  
and in their ongoing evaluation  
and development.
In the first part of the year under review, 
the Committee was chaired by John 
Gildersleeve, in his role as Deputy 
Chairman and Senior Independent 
Director. In anticipation of his retirement, 
in March the Committee reviewed a list 
of candidates to succeed him in the role, 
prepared by Heidrick & Struggles, an 
independent worldwide executive 
search firm. This review resulted in my 
appointment and I was pleased to join 
the Board as Deputy Chairman and 
Senior Independent Director at the end 
of May 2017. I look forward to chairing 
the Nomination Committee.
Director and Senior Management changes
Following my appointment, the 
Committee’s immediate focus was on  
the arrangements required to ensure 
continuity of leadership in the face of 
Andrew White’s tragic illness and to 
enable Garry Watts to revert to Non-
Executive Chairman of the Company. 
We again used Heidrick & Struggles in 
our executive search, and in August the 
Committee was able to review a strong 
list of candidates for the role of Chief 
Executive Officer. I am pleased to report 
that we were able to secure the services  
of Justin Ash as permanent Chief 
Executive Officer.
The Committee’s thanks go to Simon 
Gordon, who, as interim Chief Executive 
Officer, was able to provide excellent 
leadership during the transition period.
Since his appointment as Chief Executive 
Officer, the Committee has engaged 
positively with Justin Ash and we are  
now supporting him in his plans  
to further strengthen the Company’s 
senior leadership team.
Performance evaluation
In November, the Committee completed 
its annual performance evaluation. 
In discussing the findings, it was agreed 
that the Committee would become more 
actively involved in the development of 
skills and capabilities within the Executive 
Committee and other members of the 
senior leadership team, and in succession 
planning. To this end, post year end,  
at our February 2018 Board meeting,  
the Committee’s Terms of Reference  
were modified to reflect this change  
in emphasis, and are available on  
the Company’s website.
Diversity and inclusion
In the Committee’s report last year we 
noted the publication of the Hampton-
Alexander review of gender leadership 
in FTSE companies and in this year’s 
Annual Report we publish details of the 
Company’s staff diversity and gender pay 
gap, in line with reporting requirements 
(see the Our people section on pages 44 
and 47).

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
Governance Strategic Report Financial statements Other information
While Spire Healthcare employs a 
large majority of female staff and the 
Company’s gender pay gap is lower than 
average, we recognise that there is further 
progress to be made towards better 
gender representation at Board and senior 
leadership levels. Our aim is to move to 
33% female representation on the Board 
and Executive Committee as soon as 
practicable, commensurate with selection 
being on qualification and merit. 
Re-election of Directors
The Committee met in early 2018 to 
review the continuation in office, and 
potential re-appointment, of all members 
of the Board. Following this review, the 
Committee recommended to the Board 
that all Directors except for Simon Gordon, 
who resigned as an Executive Director on 
1 March 2018, and Danie Meintjes, who 
has announced that he will not stand for 
re-election, be re-appointed, and hence all 
Directors will seek election or re-election 
at the annual general meeting.

Committee members’ biographies are shown on pages 56 and 57. John Gildersleeve also 
served as a member of the Nomination Committee until 26 May 2017 when he resigned  
as a Director of the Company. 
The majority of Committee members were independent Non-Executive Directors at all 
times during the year, in line with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
The Board appoints the Chair of the Committee, who must be either the Chairman of the 
Board or an independent Non-Executive Director. 
The Group Company Secretary, or their appointed nominee, acts as secretary to 
the Committee.
Role and responsibilities
The Committee’s foremost priorities are to ensure that the Group has the best possible 
leadership and to plan for both Executive and Non-Executive Director succession. 
Its prime focus is, therefore, on composition of the Board, for which appointments 
will be made on merit against objective criteria. The Nomination Committee advises 
the Board on these appointments, oversees the recruitment processes,and also considers 
retirements and resignations from the Board, and its other Committees. The Committee 
will regularly examine succession planning based on the Board’s balance of experience, 
overall diversity and the leadership skills required to deliver the Company’s strategy. 
Process for Board appointments
When considering a Board appointment, the Committee will draw up a specification for 
the Director, taking into consideration the specific role together with the balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience of its existing Board members, the diversity of the Board, the 
independence of continuing Board members, together with the ongoing requirements 
and strategic development of the Group. Care is taken to ensure that proposed appointees 
will have sufficient time to devote to the role and do not have any conflicts of interest
The Committee will utilise the services of an executive search firm to identify appropriate 
candidates, ensuring that the search firm appointed does not have any other conflicts 
with the Group. In addition, the Committee will only use those firms that have adopted 
the Voluntary Code of Conduct addressing gender diversity and best practice in search 
assignments. A long list of potential appointees will be reviewed, followed by the 
shortlisting of candidates for interview, based upon the objective criteria identified in the 
specification. Committee members will interview the shortlisted candidates, together with 
other Directors as appropriate, and identify a preferred candidate. Following these 
meetings, subject to satisfactory references, the Committee will make a formal 
recommendation to the Board on the appointment.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Our proposed remuneration policy provides alignment to 
our strategy to be famous for quality, and provide medium- 
and long-term strategy for shareholders. 
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for 2017 . This year’s 
report also includes a slightly updated 
Remuneration Policy. The previous 
Remuneration Policy received strong 
support when last approved at the 2015 
annual general meeting. Shareholder 
approval for a new policy will need to 
be sought at this year’s annual general 
meeting under the three-year renewal 
cycle set out under the UK voting regime. 
Further detail regarding the policy 
renewal is set out below.
Alignment between pay and performance
While the Company has made positive 
progress in a number of strategic areas, 
trading conditions for Spire Healthcare 
remained challenging during 2017.
The Company’s performance showed 
further growth in our key private patient 
income and reasonable progress on 
our three new major capital investment 
projects. Operating profit was significantly 
impacted by exceptional and other material 
items totalling £49.2 million for the year 
and was lower than the range targeted 
at the start of the year.
Taking into account the Group’s 
performance, the Committee has 
determined that no bonus will be paid 
to any of our Executive Directors for 2017 . 
In addition the L TIP award that was based 
on performance over the three years 
to 31 December 2017 will lapse in full as 
threshold performance was not achieved. 
While these incentive outcomes are 
disappointing, they demonstrate the rigour 
of our approach to pay and our desire to 
align remuneration with both business 
performance and shareholder returns.
As we look ahead, the Board is excited 
by the new strategy put forward by the 
management team. We are optimistic that 
successful execution of this strategy will 
lead to long-term value for our shareholders 
and that this will be positively reflected 
in future incentive outcomes.
For 2018, we have decided that certain 
quality performance targets will 
constitute a hurdle (‘underpin’) for the 
payment of any bonuses. This applies 
across the entire management of the 
Company from Chief Executive Officer to 
senior leadership teams in hospitals and 
demonstrates our commitment to quality.
Board changes during the year
In October 2017 , Justin Ash joined the 
business as our new Chief Executive 
Officer. Justin has a proven track record in 
healthcare and the Board was delighted to 
have secured his appointment. Justin did 
not participate in any of the Company’s 
incentive arrangements in respect of 2017 . 
For 2018, the structure of his incentive 
arrangements and the maximum 
opportunity will be aligned with the 
existing package for Executive Directors, 
save that the level of bonus deferral into 
shares will be increased from one-third 
to one-half of any bonus earned. The 
Committee has made this change in order 
to increase alignment with our shareholders. 
In addition, shareholders will note 
that no buy-out awards were made  
to Justin on his appointment to the role.
Prior to Justin’s appointment, the Board 
had to respond to certain unplanned and 
unfortunate circumstances. Firstly, it was 
with great sadness that we reported that 
Andrew White passed away following 
a period of illness. In his time with the 
Company, Andrew made a significant 
contribution to the business and it was 
our plan for Andrew to play a pivotal role 
in the future direction of Spire. Andrew 
is deeply missed by all of us.
Secondly, during the year Garry Watts 
stepped down from the role of Executive 
Chairman, to resume his previous non-
executive Chairman role while he 
underwent medical treatment. In light 
of this, Simon Gordon agreed to undertake 
the role of interim Chief Executive Officer 
until Justin joined the business.

Further details regarding the remuneration 
decisions taken in respect of each of the 
above are set out in the main body of 
the report.
Annual evaluation of the Committee
The annual evaluation of the Committee’s 
performance was carried out in November 
2017 which confirmed that it continued 
to perform effectively.
AGM and Remuneration Policy renewal
The current remuneration policy was 
approved by shareholders at the 2015 
annual general meeting, and at the time 
of adoption this policy received support 
from more than 99% of shareholders. 
This policy was relatively simple and 
straightforward in nature with Executive 
Directors participating in an annual bonus 
which was partly deferred into shares 
and a share-based long-term incentive 
plan subject to performance targets 
assessed over three years. 
Shareholders will note that the key terms 
of the previous policy have been largely 
retained and that maximum incentive 
opportunities also remain unchanged. 
The only structural change proposed is 
for future LTIP awards to be subject to 
a post-vesting two-year holding period. 
This change will increase alignment with 
the long-term shareholder experience 
and more closely conforms with recent 
developments in best practice.
While the overall structure of remuneration 
for 2018 will remain substantially 
unchanged from prior years, during the 
year the Remuneration Committee intends 
to undertake an in-depth, holistic review 
of our arrangements to ensure that they 
remain aligned with our long-term strategy 
and shareholders’ interests. As in prior 
years we would seek to engage with 
shareholders regarding the outcomes 
of this review. 
We remain committed to having an 
open and transparent dialogue with 
shareholders on remuneration. If you 
have any questions about the content 
of this year’s Directors’ Remuneration 
Report you may contact me via  
companysecretary@spirehealthcare.com. 
The Remuneration Committee looks 
forward to your continued support 
at the 2018 annual general meeting.

the framework and total remuneration arrangements of the Executive Directors and, 
in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer, senior management. It also oversees 
the Group’s share-based incentive arrangements. In practice, the Committee agrees the:
• policy for cash remuneration, executive share plans, service contracts and 
termination arrangements;
• reward packages of Executive Directors;
• termination arrangements for Executive Directors;
• recommendations to the Board concerning any new executive share plans 
or changes to existing schemes which require shareholders’ approval;
• basis on which awards are granted and their amount to Executive Directors 
and senior management under the LTIP; and
• ensures a consistency of remuneration arrangements across all levels within 
Spire Healthcare.

Remuneration Policy Report
The following section sets out our Directors’ Remuneration Policy that will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the annual general 
meeting in May 2018. If approved, it will be effective from this date.
The current policy was approved by shareholders in 2015, and therefore a new policy is being presented to shareholders under 
the standard three-year renewal cycle. The key features of the current policy have been retained and remain unchanged under 
the new policy. The current policy received strong shareholder support and the Remuneration Committee is of the view that 
the structure continues to be aligned with prevailing market and best practice.
As part of the renewal process the Committee has taken the opportunity to make minor updates to certain detailed aspects 
of the policy (e.g. remove references to legacy arrangements) and to reflect developments in market and best practice over 
the last three years, in particular, the addition of a holding period for future LTIP awards.

Salary To provide fixed 
remuneration that 
is appropriate for 
the role and to 
secure and retain 
the talent required 
by the Group.
The Committee takes into account a 
number of factors when setting salaries, 
including:
•  scope and responsibility of the role;
•  the skills and experience of the individual;
• salary levels for similar roles within 
appropriate comparators; 
•  overall structure of the remuneration 
package; and
•  pay and conditions elsewhere in 
the Group.
Salaries are normally reviewed annually.
While there is no defined maximum 
opportunity, salary increases normally take 
into account increases for full-time employees 
across the Group.
The Committee retains discretion to make 
higher increases in certain circumstances, 
for example, following an increase in the 
scope and/or responsibility of the role, or a 
significant change in market practice or the 
development of the individual in the role.

Benefits Fixed element of

of the necessary 
calibre.
A range of role-appropriate benefits 
may be provided to Executive Directors, 
including such items as private medical 
cover (for the Executive Director and 
their family), participation in an income 
protection scheme, life assurance, 
an annual health assessment (for the 
Executive Director and their spouse) 
and a car allowance.
Additional benefits may also be provided 
where the Committee considers this 
appropriate (e.g. on relocation). 
Executive Directors are also eligible to 
participate in any all-employee share 
plans operated by the Company from 
time-to-time on the same basis as other 
eligible colleagues.
The Committee keeps the benefits package 
offered to existing and new Executive 
Directors under review.
Whilst no maximum limit exists, individual 
benefit arrangements take into account 
a number of factors, including market 
practice for comparable roles within 
appropriate pay comparators.
Participation in any HMRC-approved 
all-employee share plan is subject to 
the maximum permitted by the relevant 
tax legislation.
None
Retirement 
benefits
Fixed element 
of remuneration 
to assist with 
retirement 
planning.
Retirement benefits 
are provided to 
both support 
retention and 
recruit people of 
the necessary 
calibre.
Executive Directors can opt to join the 
Company’s defined contribution scheme, 
receive a contribution into a personal 
pension scheme, take a cash supplement 
or any combination of the three.
The employer defined contribution level, 
the contribution into a personal pension 
scheme and/or cash supplement are 
kept under review by the Committee.
The retirement benefits are not included 
in calculating bonus and long-term 
incentive quantum.
The maximum level of retirement benefits is 
25% of base salary, and the current provision 
for the Executive Directors is 18% of base salary.
They are set by taking into account a number of 
factors, including market practice for comparable 
roles at appropriate pay comparators.
For new Executive Directors, the nature and 
value of any retirement benefits provided 
will be, in the Committee’s view, reasonable in 
the context of market practice for comparable 
roles and take account of both the individual’s 
circumstances and the cost to the Group.

Annual 
bonus
To incentivise 
and reward the 
achievement of 
annual financial, 
operational and 
individual objectives 
that are key to the 
delivery of the 
Group’s strategy.
Objectives are set annually 
to ensure that they remain targeted 
and focused on the delivery of 
strategic goals.
The Committee sets targets that 
require appropriate levels of 
performance, taking into account 
internal and external expectations 
of performance.
As soon as practicable after the year 
end, the Committee meets to review 
performance against objectives 
and determines payout levels. The 
Committee may adjust payments 
to ensure they are reflective of 
overall performance.
A portion of any bonus (as determined 
by the Committee) is normally 
deferred into an award of shares 
under the Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DBP’). 
Currently at least one-third of any 
bonus is deferred for a period of three 
years with the Chief Executive Officer 
deferring one-half of any bonus.
DBP awards may be in the form of 
conditional share awards or nil-cost 
options or any other form allowed 
by the Plan rules. This deferred bonus 
element is not normally subject to 
any further performance conditions, 
although it is subject to continued 
employment.
Further details of the malus and 
clawback provisions applicable 
are set out on page 82.
Maximum award 
opportunity for 
Executive Directors 
is 150% of base salary 
for each financial year, 
a portion of which is 
normally deferred into 
an award of shares 
under the DBP.
Awards are based on a combination 
of financial, operational and 
individual goals measured over 
one financial year.
At least 50% of the award will 
be assessed against the Group’s 
financial metrics. The remainder 
of the award will be based on 
performance against strategic 
objectives and/or individual 
objectives.
A sliding scale between 0% and 
100% of the maximum award 
pays out for achievement between 
the minimum and maximum 
performance thresholds. 
For annual bonuses in respect of 
2018, the targets will be based on 
profit and certain strategic metrics. 
Further details are set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
The details of measures, targets 
and weightings may be varied by 
the Committee year-on-year based 
on the Group’s strategic priorities.
Long Term 
Incentive 
Plan (LTIP)
To incentivise and 
reward the delivery 
of long-term 
strategic objectives.
To align the interests 
of the Executive 
Directors with those 
of shareholders.
To assist recruitment 
and retention of 
Executive Directors.
Awards granted under the LTIP 
vest subject to achievement 
of performance conditions measured 
over a period of at least three years, 
unless the Committee determines 
otherwise.
The Committee will review 
performance against the targets 
set to determine the level of vesting. 
The Committee may adjust vesting 
outcomes to ensure that they are 
reflective of overall performance.
Awards may be in the form of 
conditional share awards or nil-cost 
options or any other form allowed 
by the Plan rules.
Further details of the malus and 
clawback provisions applicable 
are set out on page 82.
Awards granted in 2018 and future 
years will normally be subject to 
a two-year holding period.
The maximum award 
opportunity (at grant) 
for Executive Directors 
in respect of a 
financial year is 200% 
of base salary.
Vesting of awards will be dependent 
on a range of financial, operational 
or share price measures, as set by the 
Committee, which are aligned with 
the long-term strategic objectives 
of the Group and shareholder 
value creation.
Not less than 30% of an award will 
be based on share price measures. 
The remainder will be based on either 
financial and/or operational measures.
At the threshold performance, 
no more than 25% of the award 
will vest, rising to 100% for 
maximum performance.
For awards granted in 2018, 
vesting will be based on EPS (35%), 
relative TSR (35%) and Operational 
Excellence (30%) targets.
The details of measures, targets 
and weightings may be varied by 
the Committee prior to grant based 
on the Group’s strategic objectives. 82

Directors’ Remuneration Report  
Continued
Notes to the policy table performance 
measures and targets
Annual bonus
The annual bonus performance measures 
are designed to provide an appropriate 
balance between incentivising Executive 
Directors to meet financial targets for 
the year and to deliver specific strategic, 
operational and personal goals. This 
balance allows the Committee to review 
the Group’s performance in the round 
against the key elements of our strategy, 
and appropriately incentivise and reward 
the Executive Directors. 
Bonus targets are set by the Committee 
each year to ensure that Executive 
Directors are focused on the key financial 
and strategic objectives for the financial 
year. In doing so, the Committee usually 
takes into account a number of internal 
and external reference points, including 
the Group’s business plan.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The Committee believes it is important 
that the performance conditions applying 
to LTIP awards support the long-term 
ambitions of the Group and the creation 
of shareholder value. The Committee 
continues to consider that EPS and relative 
TSR metrics remain appropriate measures 
of long-term performance. Since 2017 
awards have included Operational 
Excellence metrics to provide qualitative 
measures which are strategically 
important given the highly regulated 
and quality sensitive nature of the 
healthcare sector.
The Committee will keep the measures 
and weightings under review to ensure 
that the most appropriate measures to 
incentivise the long-term success of the 
Group are used.
Recovery provisions  
(malus and clawback)
Prior to vesting, the Committee may 
cancel or reduce the number of shares 
subject to, or impose additional conditions 
on LTIP and DBP awards in circumstances 
where the Committee considers it to be 
appropriate (‘malus’). Such circumstances 
may include: a serious misstatement 
of the Group’s audited financial results; 
a serious miscalculation of any relevant 
performance measure; a serious failure 
of risk management or regulatory 
compliance by a relevant entity; serious 
reputational damage to the Group; or 
the participant’s material misconduct.
In addition, for cash bonus and LTIP 
awards the Committee may also apply 
malus and/or claw back in certain extreme 
circumstances (including those listed 
above) for up to two years following 
the determination of the relevant 
performance outcome.
Prior to applying malus or clawback, 
the Committee will take into account 
all relevant factors (including, where 
a serious failure of risk management 
or regulatory compliance or serious 
reputational damage has occurred, the 
degree of involvement of the employee 
in that failure or damage in question 
and the employee’s level of responsibility) 
in deciding whether, and to what extent, 
it is reasonable to operate malus and/or 
clawback. The Committee is satisfied 
that the above provisions provide robust 
safeguards against inappropriate payment 
of incentive awards.
Recruitment policy
In determining remuneration for new 
Executive Directors, the Committee will 
consider all relevant factors, including the 
calibre of the individual and the external 
market, while aiming not to pay more 
than is necessary to secure the required 
talent. The Committee would seek to 
act in what it considers to be the best 
interests of the Group and its shareholders. 
Normally, the Committee will seek 
to align the new Executive Director’s 
remuneration package to the 
Remuneration Policy, as set out above. 
Salary and benefits (including any 
retirement benefits) will be determined 
in accordance with the policy table above. 
In certain instances, the Committee may 
decide to appoint an Executive Director 
to the Board on a lower-than-typical 
salary, with the intention of gradually 
increasing the salary to move closer to 
the market level as they build experience 
in the role. Normally, benefits will be 
limited to those outlined in the policy 
table above, including a relocation 
allowance in certain circumstances.
The maximum level of variable pay 
(excluding any buyouts) that may be 
awarded to a new Executive Director will 
be limited to 350% of base salary, which 
is consistent with the policy table above. 
Incentives will normally be granted 
under the existing plans; however, where 
appropriate, the Committee may tailor the 
award (e.g. time frame, form, performance 
criteria) based on the commercial 
circumstances. 
The Committee may ‘buy out’ 
remuneration terms a new hire has had 
to forfeit on joining the Group. Buyout 
awards are intended to be of comparable 
commercial value, and capped accordingly. 
The Committee will take into account 
all relevant factors when determining 
the quantum and form/structure of 
any buyout, including any performance 
conditions attached to any forfeited 
awards, the likelihood of those conditions 
being met, and the proportion of the 
vesting/performance period remaining. 
The service contracts for new 
appointments will be consistent with 
the policy described below. Where an 
Executive Director is appointed from 
within the organisation, the policy of the 
Group is that any legacy arrangements 
would be honoured in line with the 
original terms and conditions. Similarly, 
if an executive is appointed following 
an acquisition of, or merger with, another 
company, legacy terms and conditions 
would be honoured. 83

Illustration of the remuneration policy
The remuneration arrangements have been designed to ensure that a significant proportion of pay is dependent on the delivery of 
stretching short-term and long-term performance targets aligned with the Group’s objectives, and on delivering shareholder value. 
The Committee considers the level of remuneration that may be received under different performance outcomes to ensure that 
this is appropriate in the context of the performance delivered and the value added for shareholders. 
The chart below provides illustrative values of the annual remuneration package for the Chief Executive Officer in 2018 under 
three assumed performance scenarios. This chart is for illustrative purposes only and actual outcomes may differ from those shown. 
In accordance with the disclosure regulations, share awards have been shown at face value, with no share price growth, dividend 
accrual or discount rate assumptions.

Executive Director service contracts and payments for loss of office
The key employment terms and other conditions of the current Executive Directors are set out below:
Provision Policy
Notice period 12 months’ notice by either the Group or the Executive Director. This is also the policy for new recruits.
Benefits The Group may agree that certain benefits will be specified within the Executive Directors’ service contracts.
The current Executive Directors are contractually entitled to private medical cover (for the Executive Director 
and his family), income protection, life assurance, an annual health assessment (for the Executive Director and their 
spouse) and a car allowance.
Termination 
payment
The Group may terminate employment by making a payment in lieu of notice (‘PILON’) equivalent to (i) 12 months’ 
base salary, and (ii) the cost of specific benefits (including retirement benefits).
Upon termination by the Group, the Group can determine whether a PILON is made as a single lump sum or paid 
in instalments, subject to mitigation. Where the sum is paid in instalments, the Executive Director has a duty to use 
reasonable endeavours to secure alternative employment as soon as reasonably practicable. In the event the Executive 
Director commences alternative employment with a salary above a de minimus level, there will be a pro rata reduction  
in the PILON payments.
Immediate 
termination
The service contract of an Executive Director may also be terminated immediately and with no liability to make payment 
in certain circumstances, such as the Executive Director bringing the Group into disrepute or committing a fundamental 
breach of their employment obligations.
External 
appointments
Executive Directors may accept one position as a non-executive director of another publicly listed company that is 
not a competitor of the Group, subject to prior approval of the Board. External appointments to any other company 
(and treatment of any fees) are also subject to the prior approval of the Board.
In the event that the employment of an Executive Director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined in 
accordance with the terms of the service contract between the Group and the employee, as well as the rules of any incentive 
plans in which they participate. Where appropriate, the Company may also make a payment in respect of outplacement costs, 
legal fees and the cost of settling any potential claims.
Where an Executive Director’s employment with the Group ceases prior to the payment of the annual bonus in respect of a financial 
year, the Committee in its absolute discretion will determine whether any bonus should be paid and the extent to which deferral 
into shares should be applied. Any awards would normally be prorated. Malus and clawback provisions will also apply. For the 
avoidance of doubt, in the event the Executive Director is dismissed for misconduct, no bonus will be payable.
The treatment of share awards made by the Company is governed by the relevant share plan rules. The following table summarises 
the leaver provisions of share plans under which Executive Directors may currently hold awards.
 
Plan
Leaver reasons where awards 
may continue to vest
 
Vesting arrangements
Deferred Bonus Plan 
(DBP) and LTIP
Death
Injury, ill health or 
disability
Retirement
The transfer of the 
individual’s employing 
company or business 
out of the Group
Any other scenario in 
which the Committee 
determines good leaver 
treatment is justified
LTIP awards will vest to the extent determined by the Committee, which, unless 
the Committee determines otherwise, will be calculated on the basis of the 
achievement of any performance conditions at the relevant vesting date and, 
unless the Committee determines otherwise, the period of time that has elapsed 
between grant and cessation of employment/directorship.
The vesting date for such awards will normally be the original vesting date, although 
the Committee has the flexibility to determine that awards can vest upon cessation 
of employment. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, LTIP awards will 
normally continue to be subject to any holding period which applies to an award.
DBP awards will normally vest in full on the original vesting date, although 
the Committee has the flexibility to determine that awards can vest earlier.
DBP and LTIP awards will continue to be subject to the malus provisions outlined 
on page 82 until the vesting of the awards. LTIP awards granted from 2015 onwards 
are subject to a clawback provision, as described above.
Any other reason Awards lapse in full.
Where Executive Directors participate in any HMRC-approved all-employee share plans, the leaver treatment will be consistent 
with the relevant legislation and on the same terms as all other employees. 85

Non-Executive Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The Group seeks to appoint Non-Executive Directors who have relevant professional knowledge (and/or specific technical skills) 
to support the current expertise of the Board and to match the healthcare sector within which the Group operates.
In the event of the appointment of a new Non-Executive Chairman and/or Non-Executive Director, remuneration arrangements 
will normally be in line with those detailed in the relevant table below. 
Remuneration of independent Non-Executive Directors, with the exception of the Chairman, is determined by the Chairman 
and the Executive Directors. The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Committee. Directors are not involved 
in any decisions in relation to their own remuneration. 
The table below sets out the remuneration policy with respect to Non-Executive Directors. Fees to Non-Executive Directors 
will not include share options or other performance-related elements. Non-Executive Directors do not participate in the Group’s 
bonus arrangements, share incentive schemes or retirement benefit plans. 
Approach to setting remuneration for Non-Executive Directors Opportunity
Fees are set at appropriate levels to ensure Non-Executive 
Directors are paid to reflect the individual responsibility 
taken, as well as the skills and experience of the individual. 
Fees are reviewed periodically. 
When setting fee levels, consideration is given to a number 
of factors, including responsibilities and market positioning. 
Where appropriate, benefits to the role may be provided. 
Travel and other reasonable expenses (including fees 
incurred in obtaining professional advice in the furtherance 
of their duties and any associated taxes) incurred in the 
course of performing their duties may be paid by the 
Group or reimbursed to Non-Executive Directors.
The total fees paid to Non-Executive Directors will remain within 
the limit stated in the Articles of Association of the Company.
Individual fees reflect responsibility and time commitment, as well 
as the skills and experience of the individual. Additional fees may be 
paid for further responsibilities, such as chairmanship of committees.
Any benefits provided will be reasonable in the market context and 
take account of the individual circumstances and benefits provided to 
comparable roles. Expenses reasonably incurred in the performance of 
the role may be reimbursed or paid for directly by the Group, as appropriate, 
including any tax due on the benefits. Non-Executive Directors will also 
be covered by the Group’s indemnity insurance.
The fees as at 31 December 2017 were: 
• Non-Executive Chairman: £295,000;
•  Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Director: £140,000;
• independent Non-Executive Director basic: £55,000;
• non-independent Non-Executive Director basic: £50,000;
•  Chair of Audit and Risk Committee: £10,000;
• Chair of Remuneration Committee: £10,000; and
• Chair of the Clinical Governance and Safety Committee: £15,000.
Under the terms of his appointment, Garry Watts is entitled to private medical cover (for both himself and his spouse and any 
dependent children), life assurance, annual health assessment (for both himself and his spouse) and office facilities to perform 
his duties as Chairman. Medical expenses insurance and life assurance will be provided under the Group’s arrangements or,  
if he obtains equivalent benefits directly, the Group will meet his costs (up to a specified cap).
Non-Executive Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment
The Non-Executive Chairman and Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment that set out their duties and responsibilities. 
They do not have service contracts with either the Group or any of its subsidiaries. 
The key terms of the appointments are set out in the table below. This is the policy for current and any new Non-Executive Directors.
Provision Policy
Period In line with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Chairman and all independent Non-Executive Directors are subject 
to annual re-election by shareholders at each annual general meeting.
After the initial three-year term, the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are typically expected to serve a further 
three-year term.
Termination The appointment of the Chairman is terminable by either the Group or the Director by giving 12 months’ notice.
The appointment of the Deputy Chairman is terminable by either the Group or the Director by giving three months’ notice.
The appointment of any independent Non-Executive Director is terminable by either the Group or the Director 
by giving two months’ notice.
The Non-Executive Director nominated by Mediclinic International PLC or any other shareholder representative 
is pursuant to the terms of any relationship agreement and is currently terminable without notice. 86 
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
Directors’ Remuneration Report  
Continued
Further detailed provisions
The DBP and LTIP will be operated in accordance with the relevant plan rules. The Committee may adjust or amend awards only in 
accordance with the provisions of the relevant plan rules. This includes making adjustments to awards to reflect one-off corporate 
events, such as a change in the Group’s capital structure. In accordance with the plan rules, awards may be settled in cash rather 
than shares, where the Committee considers this appropriate.
The performance conditions applicable to incentive awards may be amended on an appropriate basis determined by the Committee, 
if an event occurs or circumstances arise that cause the Committee to consider the performance condition is no longer a fair measure 
of performance.
Under the DBP and LTIP , participants may receive an additional amount, in cash or shares, to take account of the value of dividends 
the participant would have received on the shares that vest.
In the event of a change of control of the Company, LTIP awards may vest to the extent that the Committee determines, taking into 
account the extent to which any performance conditions have been satisfied, and such other factors as the Committee considers 
relevant in the circumstances, provided that, unless the Committee determines otherwise, awards will be adjusted to reflect the 
period of time that has elapsed between grant and cessation of employment/directorship; DBP awards will normally vest in full. 
Alternatively, awards may be exchanged for equivalent awards in the acquiring company.
The Committee may make any remuneration payments (including vesting of incentives) and payments for loss of office, 
notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy set out above, where the terms of that payment were either agreed: 
(i) prior to the implementation of the policy approved in 2014; (ii) during the term of, and were consistent with, any previous policy 
approved by shareholders; or (iii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of 
the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
The DBP and LTIP incorporate dilution limits. These limits are 10% in any rolling 10-year period for all plans and 5% in any rolling 
10-year period for executive share plans. Shares issued out of treasury will count towards these limits for so long as this is required 
under institutional shareholder guidelines. Shares issued, or to be issued, pursuant to any awards granted on or before the date of 
Admission will not count towards these limits. In addition, awards that lapse shall be disregarded for the purposes of these limits.
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Policy set out above for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative 
purposes or to take account of a change in legislation without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.
Remuneration arrangements throughout the Company
The Policy for our Executive Directors is designed in line with the remuneration philosophy and principles that underpin remuneration 
across the Group. When making decisions in respect of the Executive Directors’ remuneration arrangements, the Committee takes 
into consideration the pay and conditions for employees throughout the Group. As stated in the policy table, salary increases are, 
in practice, normally aligned to the general employee population. The Committee does not directly consult with our employees 
as part of the process of determining executive pay.
Differences in Remuneration Policy for all employees
The remuneration of the wider employee population is based on the same reward philosophy, whilst the components of 
remuneration vary with seniority. All employees, including Executive Directors, receive a salary and role-appropriate benefits. 
Role-specific annual bonus arrangements are operated across the Group. Only senior individuals who can have significant influence 
on the performance of the Group as a whole are invited to participate in the long-term incentive plans. This provides those individuals 
with an incentive to help achieve the Group’s medium- and long-term objectives and create shareholder value, whilst ensuring their 
remuneration varies to the extent these goals are achieved.
Consideration of shareholder views
The structure of remuneration for Board members was first presented to shareholders in the Prospectus prior to Admission. 
Since Admission, we have regularly engaged with shareholders regarding our approach to remuneration and we remain mindful 
of shareholders’ views and emerging market and best practice when evaluating and setting future remuneration strategy.
This Remuneration Policy will be presented to shareholders for approval at the 2018 AGM. 87

2 Simon Gordon stepped down from the Board on 1 March 2018.
3 Andrew White sadly passed away and ceased to be an Executive Director on 22 July 2017.
4  The 2015 LTIP award is based on performance to 31 December 2017; as noted below this award will lapse in full and therefore no value is shown for 2017. 
5  In line with the disclosure regulations, the LTIP value for 2016 has been restated to reflect the share price on 20 March 2017, being the date of vesting (333.5 pence). The restated 
amount includes a cash dividend equivalent payment of £8,440. On 30 March 2017, Simon Gordon exercised his 2014 LTIP award over 124,113 shares, selling 58,539 shares 
at an average price of 327.5 pence to cover tax and NIC due. 
6  These awards were granted in 2014 and were granted in respect of performance prior to Admission. There are no further outstanding awards under this plan. Details of awards 
vesting in 2016 were set out in last year’s Remuneration Report.
Additional notes to the table
Salary
Justin Ash’s salary on appointment was £615,000 per annum. Simon Gordon’s salary was increased from £367,500 to £373,013 
per annum on 1 April 2017. 
In June 2017, Garry Watts stepped down from his role as Executive Chairman, and Simon Gordon was appointed Interim Chief 
Executive. To reflect this role change and his expanded duties over the coming months, the Committee determined that Simon 
Gordon would be paid an interim salary supplement of £12,666 per month (equivalent to a total salary of £525,000 per annum) 
for a period of six months. This arrangement came to an end on 12 December 2017.
Benefits
The benefits consist of private medical cover (for the Executive Directors and their families), life assurance and income protection 
cover. Simon Gordon also receives a car allowance.
Retirement benefits
The amount set out in the table represents the Group contribution to the Executive Directors’ retirement planning at a rate of 
18% of base salary. Simon Gordon is a member of the Spire Healthcare Pension Plan. Amounts above the HMRC annual allowance 
are paid as taxable cash supplements.
Annual bonus
For the 2017 financial year, the maximum bonus opportunity for Simon Gordon was 150% of base salary. The annual bonus targets 
were set at the beginning of the financial year, with 70% of the award being assessed against EBITDA and 30% assessed against a 
balanced scorecard based on strategic targets including productivity, customer, quality and staff measures. The threshold EBITDA 
target for 2017 was set at £160.0 million and no bonus would be payable if this threshold was not achieved.
Once again the Company made progress in a number of areas, however, a number of internal and external factors impacted the 
business. This meant that it did not achieve the minimum EBITDA threshold of £160.0 million. Although Simon Gordon largely met 
his individual objectives under the balanced scorecard, the Committee determined that no bonus will be paid in respect of 2017.
The Committee note the importance of enabling our shareholders to understand the basis of bonus outcomes and the Company 
will therefore seek to provide expanded disclosure in respect of any bonuses paid in future years. 
Justin Ash was not eligible for a bonus in respect of 2017. 88

Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The performance period for awards granted in 2015 ended on 31 December 2017. This award was based on targets linked to EPS 
and relative TSR performance.
Half of the award was based on TSR performance measured against the constituents of the FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts). 
Over the period to 31 December 2017, the Company delivered negative total shareholder return which was below the median 
position and therefore threshold vesting was not achieved. This meant that none of this element of the award would vest. 
The remaining half of the award was based on EPS targets. The 2017 EPS was below the threshold of 23.8 pence. Therefore this 
award will lapse in full.
Awards under the LTIP were granted on 30 March 2017 . These awards were granted in the form of nil-cost options over Spire 
Healthcare Group plc shares, with the number of shares that may vest conditional on performance over the three-year period 
to 31 December 2019. The maximum award granted to Executive Directors was equivalent to 200% of base salary. Justin Ash 
and Garry Watts did not receive LTIP awards in 2017 .
The Committee determined that in addition to the value created for shareholders over the period, measured by EPS and relative  
TSR performance targets, 2017 awards should also include an element based on Operational Excellence. Further details of the 
performance conditions applying to the 2017 awards are set out below.
LTIP •  Conditional award over shares were made in 2017 equivalent to 200% of base salary in the form of nil-cost options.

2 Vesting for this element would be scaled back (including to nil) if any site is rated as ‘Inadequate’.
3 There is straight line vesting between the points shown.
4  The Committee may adjust targets or outcomes in certain circumstances (e.g. for changes to accounting standards or material acquisitions).  
In line with good practice, the Committee also retains the ability to exercise discretion so that the overall vesting level remains appropriate  
(e.g to reflect underlying performance).
Outstanding share awards
Under the DBP , awards are deferred for a period of three years and are conditional on continued employment. There are no further 
performance conditions attaching to these shares although they remain subject to a malus provision. No award was made under the 
DBP in 2016 or 2017. The following award over shares was granted under the DBP in 2015 and relates to the 2014 bonus which was 
disclosed in the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts:

Andrew White’s estate
Andrew White sadly passed away and ceased to be an Executive Director on 22 July 2017 . Andrew received an LTIP award over 
221,628 shares on 30 March 2017. As announced to the market in August 2017, the Remuneration Committee agreed that 
Andrew White’s estate would receive:
• cash bonus award for 2017 of £136,875. The bonus payment was pro-rated by 50% in respect of the first six months of the year 
before Andrew White commenced sick leave on 30 June 2017 and was further pro-rated by 50%, being the proportion of bonus 
maximum that would accrue for on-target AOP performance; and
• vesting of a total of 134,339 shares (c. 32% of maximum) in respect of the 2016 and 2017 LTIP awards to the date of Andrew White’s 
death as allowed for in the LTIP rules. Each award was pro-rated for time worked by Andrew White during the performance periods, 
i.e. up to 22 July 2017 and all performance metrics associated with each award were waived.
Single total figure of remuneration – Non-Executive Directors (audited)
The basic fee for independent Non-Executive Directors was increased from £50,000 to £55,000 per annum from 1 April 2017. 
This was the first increase in Non-Executive Directors fees since Admission. The fee for the chair of the Clinical Governance and 
Safety Committee was also increased from £10,000 to £15,000 per annum from 1 April 2017.

5  Reasonable expenses incurred by any Non-Executive Director will be reimbursed by the Company but they have no other contractual entitlement to benefits. For Non-Executive 
Directors certain expenses relating to the performance of a Non-Executive Director’s duties in carrying out activities, such as travel to and from Company meetings, are classified 
as taxable benefits by HMRC. In such cases, the Company will ensure that the Non-Executive Director is not out of pocket by settling the related tax via the PAYE Settlement 
Agreement. In line with current regulations these taxable benefits have been disclosed and are shown in the taxable benefits column in the Directors’ remuneration table above. 
The figures shown include the cost of the expenses grossed up for tax and national insurance. 90

£295,000 per annum. Between 14 March 2016 and 30 June 2017 he acted in the capacity of Executive Chairman.

Details of awards vesting in 2016 were set out in last year’s Remuneration Report.
Notes to the table
On Admission, Garry Watts was appointed as Non-Executive Chairman and, in line with corporate governance guidelines, in that 
role he did not participate in any future incentive plans.
On 14 March 2016, Garry Watts resumed the role of Executive Chairman, following Rob Roger’s notification to leave the Company. 
Garry Watts received an annual salary of £600,000 for that role, but did not receive any pension allowance or LTIP awards.
Although Garry Watts was eligible for a bonus in respect of his executive role, no bonus will be paid for 2017, in line with other 
Executive Directors.
On 1 July 2017, Garry Watts resumed the role of Non-Executive Chairman. Since 1 October 2017 he received a fee of £295,000 per 
annum for this role.
Garry Watts has a contractual entitlement to benefits, which include: private medical cover for himself and his family; life cover for 
himself only; annual health assessment for himself and his spouse; and office facilities to enable him to perform his duties as Executive 
Chairman. Reasonable expenses incurred will be reimbursed by the Company.  91

Implementation for 2018
The following table summarises how remuneration arrangements will be operated for 2018. Shareholders will note that, for the 
fourth year, the maximum opportunity under the incentive plans will also remain unchanged.
Salary and  
benefits
• Following the year end, the Committee reviewed the base salaries as part of the annual salary review process.
• Justin Ash’s salary will remain unchanged for 2018 at £615,000.
•  No changes to benefits for 2018 – benefits include private medical cover, permanent health assurance, income 
protection, life assurance, an annual health assessment and car allowance. Company contributions retirement benefits 
remain at 18% of salary.
Annual bonus The maximum opportunity will remain at 150% of salary.
• The performance targets in respect of the 2018 bonus will be based as to 75% on EBITDA and 25% on operational 
objectives. No bonus will be paid unless a minimum quality trigger or Group earnings targets are met. The detail 
of targets for the coming year is commercially sensitive; however, the Committee will look to provide disclosure 
regarding targets and bonus outcomes in next year’s report.
• For the Chief Executive Officer, one half of any bonus earned will be deferred into shares for three years.
LTIP • Conditional award over shares will be made in 2018 equivalent to 200% of base salary in the form of nil-cost options. 
• Performance will be measured over the period from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020. The 2018 award will 
continue to include an element based on Operational Excellence.
• The Remuneration Committee have reviewed the targets for the performance period to ensure that they suitably 
reflect both internal and external expectations over the performance period. The Committee are satisfied that the 
target ranges for the 2018 awards are suitably stretching in the context of current expectations and that the hurdles 
at the top-end of the range would suitably justify full vesting. The Committee have made some minor refinements 
to the Operational Excellence measures, while maintaining the stretch of targets.

1 There is no vesting for performance below these levels.
2  Vesting for this element would be scaled back (including to nil) if any site is rated as ‘Inadequate’. The target range has been adapted to reflect expected 
changes in the stringency of the external regulatory review process and the benchmarks required to achieve a ‘Good’ rating. The threshold hurdle 
would continue to require improvement from current levels.

4 There is straight line vesting between the points shown.

In line with good practice, the Committee also retains the ability to exercise discretion so that the overall vesting level remains appropriate  
(e.g to reflect underlying performance).

comfortable that the Deloitte LLP engagement partner and team that provides remuneration advice to the Committee do not have 
connections with the Company that may impair their independence.

offices of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer 
LLP , Northcliffe House, 28 Tudor Street, 
London EC4Y 0AY on Thursday, 24 May

elect or re-elect all of the Directors and 
to reappoint Ernst & Young LLP as auditor. 
Shareholders will also be asked to authorise

and is thought to be in the interests of 
shareholders as a whole). Further items

general meeting are described throughout 
this Directors’ Report.
Dividends
The Directors recommend the payment of 
a final dividend in respect of the year ended 
31 December 2017 of 2.5 pence (2016: 
2.5 pence) per ordinary share making a 
proposed total dividend for the year of 
3.8 pence per share (2016: 3.8 pence).

recommendation at the annual general 
meeting, the final dividend will be paid 
on 26 June 2018 to shareholders on the 
register as at 1 June 2018.
The Company paid an interim dividend 
in respect of the year ended 31 December 
2017 of 1.3 pence per share on

provides for all directors of FTSE 
companies to stand for election or 
re-election by shareholders every year. 
Accordingly, all members of the Board, 
except for Simon Gordon who leaves 
the Company on 31 March 2018 and 
Danie Meintjes who will not stand for 
re-election, will retire and seek election 
or re-election at this year’s annual general 
meeting. Full biographical details of all 
of the Directors can be found on pages 
56 and 57.
Further information on the contractual 
arrangements of the Executive Directors 
is given on page 84. The Non-Executive 
Directors do not have service agreement.
Subsequent to the year end, Simon 
Gordon resigned from the Board on 
1 March 2018. A search is underway 
for his replacement. 
Powers of the Directors
The business of the Company is managed 
by the Directors who may exercise all the 
powers of the Company, subject to any 
relevant legislation, any directions given  97 
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
Governance Strategic Report Financial statements Other information
by the Company by passing a special 
resolution and to the Company’s Articles 
of Association. The Articles, for example, 
contain specific provisions concerning the 
Company’s power to borrow money and 
issue shares.
Appointment and removal of Directors
Rules relating to the appointment and 
removal of the Directors are contained 
within the Company’s Articles of 
Association.
Director’s indemnities 
See page 68 in the Corporate 
Governance section.
Amendment of articles of association
The Company may only make amendments 
to the Articles of Association of the 
Company by way of special resolution 
of the shareholders, in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006.
Employees 
The Group is an equal opportunities 
employer and is committed to creating 
an environment which will attract, retain 
and motivate its people, by creating a 
working environment in which individuals 
are able to make best use of their skills, 
free from discrimination or harassment, 
and in which all decisions are based on 
merit. Spire Healthcare employs people 
who consider themselves to have a 
disability (a physical or mental impairment 
which has a substantial and long-term 
adverse effect on their ability to carry out 
normal day-to-day activities). Employees 
who consider themselves to have a disability 
are under no obligation to inform their 
employer of this, however, we are fully 
aware of, and comply with, our obligations 
in accordance with the relevant provisions 
of the Equality Act 2010.
We launched the ‘Spire Healthcare 
discussion channel’, a new communication 
channel established to provide colleagues, 
on a regular basis, with audio updates 
from our leadership team – covering 
topics which are pertinent to our business; 
from our strategic direction to operational 
and people highlights. When appropriate, 
consultations with employee and union 
representatives take place.
The Group gives full and fair consideration 
to applications for employment from 
disabled persons. Should an employee 
become disabled during their employment 
with Spire Healthcare, every effort is 
made to enable them to continue their 
service with the Group.
Further information on our employees 
can be found under Our people on 
pages 44 to 47.
Political donations and expenditure
The Group made no political donations 
during the year. Although the Company 
does not make, and does not intend to 
make, donations to political parties, within 
the normal meaning of that expression, 
the definition of political donations under 
the Companies Act 2006 is very broad and 
includes expenses legitimately incurred as 
part of the process of talking to members 
of Parliament and opinion formers to 
ensure that the issues and concerns of 
the Group are considered and addressed. 
These activities are not intended to 
support any political party and the 
Group’s policy is not to make any 
donations for political purposes in the 
normally accepted sense.
A resolution will therefore be proposed 
at the annual general meeting seeking 
shareholder approval for the Directors to 
be given authority to make donations and 
incur expenditure which might otherwise 
be caught by the terms of the Companies 
Act 2006. The authority sought will be 
limited to a maximum amount of £100,000.
Share capital
As at the date of this report, Spire 
Healthcare Group plc had an issued share 
capital of 401,081,391 ordinary shares 
of 1 pence each, being the total number 
of shares with voting rights.
Equiniti Trust (Jersey) Limited, as trustee 
of the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust, 
holds 281,631 ordinary shares of 1 pence 
each (2016: 670,559). Further details can 
be found in note 19 on page 132.
The rights attaching to the shares are 
set out in the Articles of Association. 
There are no restrictions on the transfer 
of ordinary shares in the capital of the 
Company other than those which may be 
imposed by law from time-to-time. There 
are no special control rights in relation to 
the Company’s shares and the Company 
is not aware of any agreements between 
holders of securities that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities 
or on voting rights. In accordance with the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules, certain 
employees are required to seek approval 
prior to dealing in the Company’s shares. 
The Company’s entire issued ordinary 
share capital is listed on the premium 
segment of the Official List of the Financial 
Conduct Authority and to unconditional 
trading on the London Stock Exchange plc’s 
main market for listed securities.
Further information relating to the 
Company’s issued share capital can be 
found in note 19 to the Company’s 
financial statements on page 132.
The Company has made no purchases 
of its own shares during the year and 
no shares were acquired by forfeiture or 
surrender or made subject to a lien or 
charge. Details of the shares purchased 
by the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust 
are shown in note 19 on page 132.
Allot shares and pre-emption rights
Shareholders will be asked to renew both 
the general authority of the Directors to 
issue shares and to authorise the Directors 
to issue shares without applying the 
statutory pre-emption rights. In this 
regard, the Company will continue to 
adhere to the provisions in the Pre-
emption Group’s Statement of Principles.
Further details on these matters can 
be found in the 2018 Notice of annual 
general meeting.
Voting rights
In a general meeting of the Company, 
on a show of hands, every member who is 
present in person or by proxy and entitled 
to vote shall have one vote. On a poll, 
every member who is present in person 
or by proxy shall have one vote for every 
share of which they are the holder.
Restrictions on voting
Unless the Directors otherwise determine, 
a shareholder shall not be entitled to 
vote either personally or by proxy:
• if any call or other sum presently 
payable to the Company in respect 
of that share remains unpaid; or
• having been duly served with a 
notice to provide the Company with 
information under Section 793 of the 
Companies Act 2006, and has failed 
to do so within 14 days, for so long 
as the default continues. 98

Directors’ interests in shares
The beneficial interests of the Directors’ 
and their families in the shares of the 
Company are detailed on page 92. 
During the year, no Director had any 
material interest in any contract of 
significance to the Group’s business.
Material interests in shares
As of 1 March 2018, the Company has 
been notified by the following investors 
of their interests in 3% or more of the 
Company’s issued share capital. These 
interests were notified to the Company 
pursuant to Disclosure and Transparency 
Rule 5:
Shareholder Current %
Mediclinic International PLC 29.90
Woodford Investment 
Management LLP 16.02
The Capital Group  
Companies, Inc 4.83
Norges Bank 4.32
GIC Private Limited 3.95
Significant agreements
The following agreements are considered 
to be significant in terms of their potential 
impact on the business of the Group 
as a whole and could alter or terminate 
on a change of control of the Group:
• the Group’s bank facility agreement 
contains provisions entitling the 
counterparties to exercise termination 
or other rights in the event of a change 
of control;
• there are a number of contracts which 
allow the counterparties to alter or 
terminate those arrangements in the 
event of a change of control of the 
Company. These arrangements are 
commercially sensitive and confidential 
and their disclosure could be seriously 
prejudicial to the Group; and
• the Company’s share incentive plans 
contain provisions relating to a change 
of control and full details of these 
plans are provided in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 78 to 93. 
Outstanding options and awards would 
normally vest and become exercisable 
on a change of control, subject to the 
satisfaction of performance conditions, 
if applicable, at that time.
The relationship agreement entered into 
with Mediclinic Jersey Limited (formerly 
called Remgro Jersey Limited), a subsidiary 
of Mediclinic International PLC, in June 
2015 is deemed a material agreement 
between the Company and its principal 
shareholder. The agreement does not 
include a change of control provision 
but does terminate upon the earlier of 
the Company’s ordinary shares ceasing 
to be listed and traded on the London 
Stock Exchange’s main market for listed 
securities and the principal shareholder’s 
ceasing to be entitled, in aggregate, 
to exercise or to control the exercise 
of 15% or more of the votes to be cast 
on all or substantially all matters of 
a general meeting of the Company.
Compensation for loss of office
There are no agreements between the 
Group and its Directors or employees 
providing for compensation for loss 
of office or employment that occurs 
as a result of a change of control.
Disclosures required under listing 
rule 9.8.4R
The above table is included to meet 
the requirements of Listing Rule section 
9.8.4R. The information required to

Events after the reporting period

affecting the Group or Company since 
31 December 2017.
Going concern
The Group is financed by a bank loan 
facility that matures in July 2019. The 
Directors have considered the Group’s 
forecasts and projections, and the risks 
associated with their delivery, and are 
satisfied, based on prevailing market 
conditions, that the Group will be able 
to refinance this bank loan facility, 
on terms largely comparable to the 
current facility, before it matures.
On the same basis, the Directors are also 
satisfied that the Group will be able to 
operate within the covenants imposed 
by the current bank loan facility for the 
foreseeable future. In relation to available 
cash resources, the Directors have 
had regard to both cash at bank and 
a £100.0 million committed undrawn 
revolving credit facility. Accordingly, they 
have adopted the going concern basis 
in preparing these financial statements.
Disclosure of information to auditor
Having made enquiries of fellow Directors 
and of the Company’s auditor, each of the 
Directors confirms that:
• to the best of their knowledge and 
belief, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s 
auditor is unaware; and
• they have taken all the steps a 
Director might reasonably be expected 
to have taken to be aware of relevant 
audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditor is aware 
of that information.
Reappointment of auditor
Resolutions for the reappointment of 
Ernst & Young LLP as the auditor of the 
Company and to authorise the Directors 
to determine its remuneration will be 
proposed at the annual general meeting. 
Ernst & Young LLP has expressed its 
willingness to be reappointed.

Statement of Directors’  
responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and Accounts for the 
year ended 31 December 2017, including 
the Consolidated financial statements and 
the Parent Company financial statements, 
Directors’ Report, including the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and the Strategic 
Report in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. Under that law, the 
Directors are required to prepare the 
Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the 
European Union and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation and have elected to prepare 
the Parent Company financial statements 
in accordance with IFRS, as adopted  
by the EU.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare such financial statements for 
each financial year. Under company law, 
the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company 
on a consolidated and individual basis, 
and of the profit or loss of the Company 
on a consolidated basis for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies 
in accordance with IAS 8: Accounting 
Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates 
and Errors and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent;
• present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures 
when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRS as adopted by 
the EU is insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions 
on the Group’s and Company’s financial 
position and financial performance;
• state that the Group’s and Company’s 
financial statements have complied 
with IFRS as adopted by the EU, subject 
to any material departures disclosed 
and  explained in the financial 
statements; and
• prepare the financial statements 
on a going concern basis, unless it is 
not appropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions, and disclose, 
with reasonable accuracy at any time, 
the Company’s financial position and 
enable them to ensure compliance 
with the Companies Act 2006. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding 
the Company’s assets and for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
Each of the Directors, whose names and 
functions are listed on pages 56 and 57, 
confirms that:
• to the best of their knowledge, the 
Consolidated financial statements 
and the Parent Company financial 
statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the EU, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit of the Company on a 
consolidated and individual basis;
• to the best of their knowledge, the 
Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report include a fair review of the 
development and performance of 
the business and the position of 
the Company on a consolidated 
and individual basis, together with 
a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that it faces; and
• they consider that the Annual Report 
and Accounts for the year ended 
31 December 2017, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable, 
and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy. 
By order of the Board.

give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s 
profit for the year then ended;
• the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’)  
as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, and, as regards  
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements which comprise:
Group Parent Company
Balance sheet as at 31 December 2017
Income statement for the year then ended
Statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended
Statement of changes in equity for the year then ended
Statement of cash flows for the year then ended
Related notes to the financial statements
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and, as regards the Parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our 
report below. We are independent of the Group and Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant 
to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, 
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report,  
or for the opinions we have formed. 101

Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the annual report, in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require 
us to report to you whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to:
• the disclosures in the annual report set out on pages 52 to 55 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being 
managed or mitigated;
• the Directors’ confirmation set out on page 99 in the annual report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group and the Parent Company, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity;
• the Directors’ statement set out on page 99 in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the entity’s 
ability to continue to do so over a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements;
• whether the Directors’ statement in relation to going concern required under the Listing Rules in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or 
• the Directors’ explanation set out on page 51 in the annual report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group and 
the Parent Company, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement 
as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the entity will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications 
or assumptions.
Overview of our audit approach
Key audit matters • Manipulation of revenue by changes to the pricing master file.
• Misstatement due to management posting fraudulent manual journal entries to revenue.
• Inappropriate capitalisation of costs to property, plant and equipment.
• Property carrying values (hospital assets).
Audit scope • We performed an audit of the complete financial information of four Group companies and 
audit procedures on specific balances for a further 14 Group companies.
• The Group companies where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for 100% 
of revenue and 100% of Total assets.
Materiality • Overall Group materiality of £3.5 million which represents 5% of profit before tax adjusted for 
certain exceptional items.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation 
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our 
audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 102

Manipulation of revenue by changes 
to the pricing master file
2017: NHS revenue 
£287 .8m 
2016: £293.4m
2017: PMI revenue 
£426.0m
2016: £429.3m
Refer to the Audit and Risk Committee 
Report (pages 70 to 73); Accounting policies 
(pages 115); and note 6 of the consolidated 
financial statements (page 123).
Inappropriate revenue recognition by 
way of management manipulation of the 
pricing master file, resulting in inaccurate 
patient invoicing in respect of PMI and 
NHS revenue.
The high volume of patient transactions, 
for which pricing is individually agreed by 
procedure with PMI providers and the NHS, 
leads to a higher likelihood of material 
misstatement through intentional 
changes to individual pricing on the 
pricing master file.
We considered that the pressure to achieve 
forecast results or targets increases the 
risk of financial reporting manipulation 
by management. 
 
To gain assurance over revenue recognised 
during the period, we tested the two-way 
correlation between revenue and trade 
receivables and three-way correlation 
between revenue, trade receivables and 
cash for the year. We also tested other 
revenue and receivables transactions 
that didn’t conform to our expectation 
of typical revenue postings.
In order to specifically address this fraud risk, 
we performed the following procedures: 
• we understood and evaluated the controls 
that have been designed and implemented 
to prevent or detect misstatements due 
to fraud associated with changes to the 
pricing master file. We adopted a fully 
substantive approach to addressing 
this fraud risk, and as such did not test 
or rely on the controls identified;
• for PMI revenue, we have tested a 
representative sample and agreed prices 
from SAP billings (revenue) to insurer 
contracts, price lists, or other supporting 
correspondence as applicable. In instances 
where no contract was available, we have 
traced settlement of the invoice directly 
to cash; 
• we used a data analytics tool to address 
the fraud risk for NHS revenue. We used 
publicly available NHS national tariff base 
prices and Market Force factors to check 
the pricing accuracy of the NHS revenue 
for the year. For the population outside 
of the National Tariff, we have agreed 
a sample of the billings to underlying 
signed agreements with NHS or other 
supporting correspondence as applicable, 
including cash; and 
• we investigated whether there had 
been pricing disputes with insurers or the 
NHS during the year through discussion 
with senior finance and commercial 
management, legal counsel, review of 
Board and Executive Committee minutes 
and verifying this to correspondence, 
where available. Additionally we searched 
journal descriptions for key words that 
might indicate the existence of pricing 
disputes; and 
• we reviewed the ageing of accounts 
receivable to identify instances of aged 
debt which might indicate a pricing 
dispute with the customer. 
We did not identify material errors on 
pricing, nor evidence of management 
manipulation of revenue through 
this means. 
Furthermore, we did not identify any 
indicators of pricing disputes with insurers 
or the NHS.
Based on our audit procedures performed, 
we concluded that revenue for the year 
is appropriately recognised and free from 
material misstatement. 103

Refer to the Audit and Risk Committee 
Report (pages 70 to 73); Accounting policies 
(page 115); and note 6 of the consolidated 
financial statements (page 123).
We consider that the pressure to achieve 
forecast results and analysts’ expectations 
increases the risk of financial reporting 
manipulation by management. 
Given management’s bonus structure 
and the pressure to achieve the agreed 
performance target, we consider there 
to be a risk of financial reporting 
manipulation by management.
Based on the key performance indicators 
that are analysed by both external and 
internal parties, we consider revenue to 
be susceptible to management override 
of control as this forms the foundation 
for the key performance indicators. 
We understand that the high volume 
of system generated and low value 
revenue transactions, results in limited 
opportunity for management to 
fraudulently misstate revenue at a 
transactional level, (other than through 
manipulation of changes to the pricing 
master file as considered on page 102). 
For management to be able to fraudulently 
misstate, we consider there to be a greater 
incentive to override controls by posting 
manual journal entries to revenue.
• We performed a walkthrough of the 
financial statement close process and 
obtained an understanding of the journal 
entry process, including the journal 
entry process for the consolidation, 
and adjusting journals which are posted 
directly to the financial statements. 
We have used our understanding 
of this process to develop our journal 
testing approach. 
• Utilising our analytics-based revenue 
programme, we have understood 
revenue trends through the use of 
analytics as follows:
 − analysis of double-entry postings 
to the related accounts and how 
these accounts are aligned with our 
understanding of the revenue process, 
activity and source; and
 − identifying revenue trends which do 
not correlate with our expectation and 
investigating and corroborating these 
uncorrelated trends.
• We performed mandatory journal testing 
by focusing on specific criteria designed  
to identify journals through which we 
believe management can post fraudulent 
manual entries to revenue.
We have not identified any 
misstatements due to management 
posting fraudulent manual journal 
entries to revenue. We have not found 
any instances of management override. 104

Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated to the  
Audit and Risk Committee 
Inappropriate capitalisation of costs  
to property, plant and equipment
2017: Costs capitalised 
£119.9m
2016: £160.4m
Refer to the Audit and Risk Committee 
Report (pages 70 to 73); Accounting policies 
(page 116); and note 13 of the consolidated 
financial statements (page 128). 
Given management’s bonus structure 
and analysts’ expectations of the Group’s 
performance, for example earnings per 
share, we consider the risk of inappropriate 
capitalisation to be a fraud risk. 
In the prior year, the Group had three large 
development projects (Spire Manchester, 
Nottingham and St Anthony’s hospitals) 
which were substantially completed in 
this year. The capital expenditure for FY17 
is across several existing hospitals and over 
all property, plant and equipment categories.
Given the scale of the capital expenditure 
in the current year relating to both 
development projects and general capital 
spend, we consider there is increased 
opportunity for management to 
inappropriately capitalise costs to 
manipulate the Group’s profits. The high 
volume of costs being capitalised over all 
property, plant and equipment categories 
means that it is harder for management 
to detect material inappropriate items.
• We understood and evaluated the controls 
that have been designed and implemented 
to prevent or detect misstatements 
due to fraud or error associated with 
the inappropriate capitalisation of costs 
on hospitals. We identified an operating 
control deficiency and as a result adopted 
a fully substantive approach to address 
this fraud risk. 
• We selected a sample of costs capitalised 
during the year to address the nature 
of the items capitalised, and to assess 
whether the items have been appropriately 
capitalised in accordance with IAS 16. Our 
sample included both high and low value 
items. We obtained the invoice to verify 
the existence and valuation of each item, 
and also obtained evidence that the 
expenditure was authorised based on the 
delegation of authority matrix. We verified 
that the expenditure was capital in nature 
by reading the descriptions and details 
on the invoices and supporting 
documentation. We obtained evidence 
certified by third-party surveyors to 
support the value of work completed 
by the main contractors for large project 
samples selected.
• Where internal costs were capitalised, 
we verified that the costs were directly 
attributable to the relevant project 
by obtaining calculation of staff cost 
multiplied by percentage time allocated 
to specific projects, correspondence 
from project managers confirming the 
percentage time for staff to be allocated, 
and payslips to confirm staff costs.
• We performed mandatory testing of 
journal entries. Our journal testing 
approach considered appropriate criteria 
to identify a journal testing sample 
which addressed the risk of inappropriate 
capitalisation of costs to property, 
plant, and equipment. 
Our audit procedures found no material 
instances of expenditure which had been 
inappropriately capitalised to property, 
plant and equipment.
Based on our audit procedures performed, 
we concluded that costs have been 
appropriately capitalised to property, 
plant, and equipment.

Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated to the  
Audit and Risk Committee 
Property carrying values (hospital assets)
2017: Freehold property carrying value 
£582.9m
2016: £575.2m
Refer to the Audit and Risk Committee 
Report (pages 70 to 73); Accounting policies 
(page 116); and notes 5 and 13 of the 
consolidated financial statements 
(pages 122 and 128)
Freehold property is held at depreciated 
cost and its carrying value is required to 
be assessed for indicators of impairment 
by management on an annual basis. 
For those properties with an indicator, 
an impairment test is performed by 
calculating a value in use, by means of 
a discounted cash flow model.
As this process involves some degree of 
estimation we consider that there is a risk 
that properties are held in the financial 
statements at an inappropriate 
carrying value. 
• We obtained a comparison of each 
hospital’s EBITDA for 2017 to its budget. 
We selected certain freehold and long 
leasehold hospital properties to focus on, 
specifically those which show notable 
underperformance compared to budget 
and prior year in percentage terms.
• We obtained management’s value-in-use 
calculation for the selected hospitals. We 
have understood the process and controls 
behind the preparation of management’s 
underlying three-year forecast, given 
management’s reliance on the plan for 
the value-in-use model. We have reviewed 
performance against budget to assess 
management’s ability to accurately forecast.
• We tested the reasonableness of 
management’s cash flow forecasts by 
comparing to prior year actuals and the 
prior year forecasts. We discussed the 
forecasts with management to 
understand local factors regarding 
strategy and market forces which had 
been taken into account in the forecasts. 
We corroborated the key assumptions 
to evidence. We focused our procedures 
on two hospitals which had minimal 
headroom. 
• We engaged our valuation specialist to 
assist us in verifying the appropriateness 
of certain key inputs to the discounted 
cash flow model, such as the discount rate, 
certain growth rates and the terminal 
growth rate.
Having sensitised management’s value- 
in-use calculations for the hospitals we 
focused on, we conclude that the risk of 
material misstatement is low. The carrying 
value was supported, suggesting no need 
to recognise impairment on these properties.
We therefore agree with management’s 
conclusion that the carrying value of the 
Group’s properties is appropriate.
In the prior year, our auditor’s report included a key audit matter in relation to manipulation of accrued patient revenue. In the 
current year we have concluded that, due to the size of the accrual at any point in the reporting period, any manipulation is unlikely 
to be material and have removed this as an area of significant risk. 
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit 
scope for each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 
We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide controls and changes in the 
business environment when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative 
coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, we identify the subsidiaries which represent the principal business 
units within the Group. The Group continues to operate solely in the UK.
We performed an audit of the complete financial information of four (2016: four) entities (‘full scope components’) which were 
selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For a further 14 (2016: 19) entities (‘specific scope components’), we performed 
audit procedures on specific accounts within that entity that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the 
significant accounts in the Group financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.  106 
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
The entities for which we performed audit procedures accounted for 100% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s revenue and 100% (2016: 
100%) of the Group’s total assets. For the current year, the full scope components contributed 92% (2016: 88%) of the Group’s revenue 
and 68% (2016: 69%) of the Group’s total assets. The specific scope components contributed 8% (2016: 12%) of the Group’s revenue 
and 32% (2015: 31%) of the Group’s total assets. The audit scope of these components may not have included testing of all significant 
accounts of the component but has contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group. It is not possible to 
present the split between full and specific scope components on a profit before tax basis in a meaningful way. This is due to intra-
Group profits earned in certain specific scope components which result in consolidated profit before tax amount to more than 100%.
For the remaining 17 non-dormant entities we performed other procedures, including analytical review and testing of the clerical 
accuracy of the consolidation to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement of the Group financial statements.
The audit of the entities within the Group is undertaken by one audit team which is led by the senior statutory auditor.
Changes from the prior year
There have not been any significant changes to the scope of our audit from the prior year.
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements  
on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.

Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our 
audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £3.5 million (2016: £4.1 million), which is 5% of adjusted profit before tax (2016: 5% 
of adjusted profit before tax). We have adjusted profit before tax for certain exceptional items amount to £47.7 million, in order to 
calculate materiality on a basis which reflects the underlying performance of the Group. We believe this provides us with the most 
applicable measurement basis for the users of the financial statements and is in line with the adjusted performance measures the 
Group uses. We have not adjusted for £1.5 million of exceptional items which are not significant.
We determined materiality for the Parent Company to be the same as materiality for the Group.
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level 
the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was 
that performance materiality was 75% (2016: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely £2.5 million (2015: £3.1 million). We have set 
performance materiality at this percentage due to our assessment of the overall control environment and the history of no or very 
few audit adjustments.
Independent Auditor’s Report  
Continued 107 
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
Governance Strategic Report Financial statements Other information
Audit work on subsidiaries for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken 
based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each entity is based on the relative size 
and risk of the entity in relation to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement arising in that entity. In the 
current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to subsidiary entities was £0.5 million to £2.5 million (2016: £0.5 million 
to £2.8 million). 
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of 
£0.2 million (2016: £0.2 million), which is set at 5% of materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light 
of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Other information 
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report set out on pages 2 to 99, including, the Strategic 
Report set out on pages 2 to 55 and Governance report set out on pages 56 to 99, other than the financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated 
in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit 
or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, 
we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement 
of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other 
information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address the following items in the other 
information and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that those items 
meet the following conditions:
• fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 99 – Statement of Director’s responsibility – the statement given by the 
Directors that they consider the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy, is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
• Audit and Risk Committee reporting set out on pages 70 to 73 – the section describing the work of the Audit and Risk Committee 
does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit and Risk Committee/the explanation as to why the 
annual report does not include a section describing the work of the Audit and Risk Committee is materially inconsistent with 
our knowledge obtained in the audit; and
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code set out on page 99 – the parts of the Directors’ 
statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose 
a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. 108 
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Company and its environment obtained in the course of 
the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• the Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 99, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as  
the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group and Parent Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but 
to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance  
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements. 
Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
The objectives of our audit, in respect to fraud, are; to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements due to fraud; to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement 
due to fraud, through designing and implementing appropriate responses; and to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected 
fraud identified during the audit. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both 
those charged with governance of the entity and management. 
Our approach was as follows: 
• we obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that 
the most significant are those related to the reporting framework (IFRS adopted by the EU, the Companies Act of 2006 and the 
Corporate Governance Code), the relevant tax compliance regulations in the UK, and the Data Protection Act of 1998. In addition, 
we conclude that there are certain laws and regulations which may have an effect on the determination of the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements being the Listing Rules of the London Stock Exchange, the Bribery Act of 2010 and certain 
laws specific to entities operating in the private healthcare provider industry; 
• we understood how Spire Healthcare Group plc is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, 
internal audit, those responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the Group Company Secretary. We corroborated our 
enquiries through the review of Board minutes, communications with the Audit and Risk Committee and correspondence received 
from regulatory bodies; and 
• we assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur 
by meeting with management and those charged with governance to understand where they considered there was a susceptibility 
to fraud. We also considered performance targets, forecasted results and bonus structures and their influence on efforts made 
by management to manage earnings or influence the perception of analysts. Where this risk was considered to be higher, 
we performed audit procedures to address each identified risk.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017
Governance Strategic Report Financial statements Other information
• Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. 
Our procedures included the review of Board minutes to identify any non-compliance with laws and regulations, a review of 
the reporting to the Audit and Risk Committee on compliance with regulations, enquiries with those responsible for legal and 
compliance, enquiries with the Group Company Secretary and with management.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Other matters we are required to address
• We were appointed as auditors by the Board in November 2008 to audit the financial statements of the Company for the period 
ending 31 December 2008 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement, including the period 
prior to the Companies admission on the London Stock Exchange in 2014, is 10 years, covering the years ended 31 December 2008 
to 31 December 2017.
• The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company and we 
remain independent of the Group and the Parent Company in conducting the audit. 
• The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit and Risk Committee.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017 Notes to the financial statements  
For the year ended 31 December 2017 
 
 
115 
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017 
1. General information 
Spire Healthcare Group plc (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the ‘Group’) owns and operates private hospitals and clinics  
in the UK and provides a range of private healthcare services. 
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of the Company on  
1 March 2018. 
The Company is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, incorporated, registered and domiciled in England 
and Wales (registered number: 9084066). The address of its registered office is 3 Dorset Rise, London EC4Y 8EN. 
2. Accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. 
Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the 
European Union and on an historical cost basis. The Group financial statements are presented in UK sterling and all values are rounded to  
the nearest million pounds (£ million), except when otherwise indicated. 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. Further details on the Group’s critical 
judgements and estimates are included in note 3. 
Going concern 
The Group is financed by a bank loan facility that matures in July 2019. The Directors have considered the Group’s forecasts, projections, 
ability to refinance, and the risks associated with their delivery, and are satisfied that the Group will be able to operate within the covenants 
imposed by the bank loan facility for at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements. In relation to available cash 
resources, the Directors have had regard to both cash at bank and a £100.0 million committed undrawn revolving credit facility. Accordingly, 
they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements. 
Revenue recognition 
The Group derives its revenue primarily from providing private healthcare services to both the public sector and private patients in the UK. 
Revenue from charges to patients is recognised when the treatment is provided. 
Interest income 
Interest is recognised on an effective interest rate basis. 
Cost of sales 
Cost of sales principally comprises salaries of clinical staff, consultant and clinical fees, medical services and inventories, including drugs, 
consumables and prostheses.  
Other operating costs 
Other operating costs mainly comprise non-clinical staff costs, rent associated with properties leased under operating leases, depreciation, 
maintenance and running costs of properties and equipment. It also includes administrative expenses, including the provision of central 
support services, IT and other administrative costs.  
Operating profit 
Operating profit is the profit arising from the normal, recurring operations of the business and after charging exceptional and other items,  
as defined below.  
Operating profit is adjusted to exclude exceptional and other items to calculate the Key Performance Indicator ‘Operating profit before 
exceptional and other items’. 
Exceptional and other items 
Exceptional items are those items which, by virtue of their nature, size or incidence, either individually or in aggregate, need to be disclosed 
separately to allow a full understanding of the underlying performance of the Group. Items which may be considered exceptional in nature 
include significant write-downs of goodwill and other assets, restructuring costs, impairments, hospital closures and set-up costs, business 
acquisition costs, medical malpractice provision, aborted project costs and executive medical leave and death in service.  
Other items are those items which the Directors believe are relevant to the understanding of the results for the year and which are  
excluded from the adjusted measures, where the Directors considered necessary to do so due to their nature or amount, to provide further 
understanding of the Group’s financial performance and comparability between reporting periods. Other items include compliance set-up 
costs and deferred tax adjustments in relation to revised property carrying values. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part 
of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the statement of cash 
flows. There are no bank overdrafts in either year presented.

2. Accounting policies continued 
Taxation including deferred taxation 
Total income tax on the result for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to 
the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity and other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised directly in 
equity and other comprehensive income. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable result for the year, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance 
sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes 
and the amounts used for taxation purposes, except for:  
• goodwill not deductible for tax purposes; 
• the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and which, at the time of the transaction, 
affects neither the accounting profit nor the taxable profit or loss; and 
• investments in subsidiary companies where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
The amount of deferred tax recognised is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be used. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major projects are treated as assets in the course of 
construction until completed when they are transferred to the appropriate asset class. 
No depreciation is charged on freehold land or assets in the course of construction. Other assets are depreciated so as to write-off the 
carrying amounts of the assets, less their estimated residual values, over their expected useful lives, as follows: 
Freehold buildings and improvements – 5 to 50 years 
Leasehold buildings and improvements  – lower of unexpired lease term or expected life, with a maximum of 35 years 
Plant and machinery – 5 to 10 years 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment  – 3 to 10 years 
The expected useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually and revised as appropriate. The review  
of the asset lives and residual values of properties takes into consideration the plans of the business and levels of expenditure incurred on an 
ongoing basis to maintain the properties in a fit and proper state for their ongoing use as hospitals. 
Consolidation 
The results of all subsidiary undertakings are included in the Consolidated financial statements. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of  
a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains 
control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.  
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability  
to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has:  
• power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee);  
• exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and  
• the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.  
The Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) is treated as an extension of the Group and the Company.

2. Accounting policies continued 
Business combinations 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the 
consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each 
business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate 
share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in other operating costs.  
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation  
in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of acquired 
businesses at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses.  
Goodwill is allocated to one cash-generating unit and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if there  
is an indication that the value of the goodwill may be impaired. 
Financial Instruments 
i) Financial assets other than derivatives 
Initial recognition and measurement 
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. The Company’s financial assets include 
cash and short-term deposits and trade and other receivables. 
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables,  
held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective  
hedge, as appropriate. The Company determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. 
Subsequent measurement 
Trade receivables are generally accounted for at amortised cost. The Company reviews indicators of impairment on an ongoing basis and 
where such indicators exist, the Company makes an estimate of the asset's recoverable amount. 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. On 
initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, such assets are 
measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate (‘EIR’) method, less any allowance for impairment. 
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the 
EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in interest receivable in the Consolidated income statement. 
Losses arising from impairment are recognised in the Consolidated income statement in Other operating costs . 
ii) Financial liabilities other than derivatives 
Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings  
or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge as appropriate. The Company determines the classification  
of financial liabilities at initial recognition. 
Initial recognition and measurement 
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings, plus directly attributable transaction costs. 
Subsequent measurement 
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in interest 
receivable and interest payable. 
iii) Offsetting of financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet if, and only if, there is a currently 
enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle 
the liabilities simultaneously. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost means purchase price, less trade discounts, calculated on an average 
basis. Net realisable value means estimated selling price, less trade discounts, and less all costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. 
The Group holds consignment stock on sale or return. The Group is only required to pay for the equipment it chooses to use and therefore 
this stock is not recognised as an asset.

2. Accounting policies continued 
Interest-bearing borrowings 
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition,  
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost on an effective interest basis. 
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take  
a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets  
are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.  
All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. 
Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event,  
and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected, risk-adjusted, future cash flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate. Provisions are measured gross of  
any expected insurance recovery. Any such insurance recoveries are recognised in other receivables when the receipt of them is judged 
sufficiently probable. 
Leases 
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangements at the inception  
date: whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to  
use the asset. 
Leasing arrangements which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are treated as if the asset 
had been purchased outright. The assets are included in tangible assets and depreciated over their estimated economic lives or over the term 
of the lease, whichever is the shorter. 
The capital element of the leasing commitments is included in liabilities as obligations under finance leases. The lease rentals are treated  
as consisting of capital and interest elements. The capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligation and the interest element 
is charged to the income statement in proportion to the capital element outstanding. 
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Sale and leaseback of properties 
In circumstances where the Group sells a property to a third party and then enters into an agreement with the buyer to lease the asset back 
under an operating lease (a ‘sale and leaseback transaction’), the asset is shown as disposed from property, plant and equipment. If the sale is 
at fair value, the profit or loss on disposal is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the sale price is below fair value, the profit or 
loss on disposal is also recognised immediately, except if a loss is compensated for by future rentals being below a market price, in which case 
the loss is amortised over the life of the lease. If the sale price is above fair value, the excess over fair value is deferred and amortised over the 
period of the lease. 
Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are deducted from share premium. 
Where the employee benefit trust purchases the Company’s equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable 
incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders in both the Company and the Consolidated balance 
sheet until the shares are cancelled or reissued. 
Dividend distribution 
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the 
dividend is approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid. 
Pensions 
The Group operates the Spire Healthcare Pension Plan, a defined contribution scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from 
those of the Group in independently administered funds. 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement  
as incurred. 
Other employee benefits 
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.  
A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonuses if the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

2. Accounting policies continued 
Share based payments 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share based payment schemes under which the Group receives services from employees  
as consideration for equity instruments (options) of the Group. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant  
of the options is recognised as an expense. Where the share awards have non-market related performance criteria, the Group has used the 
Black Scholes valuation model to establish the relevant fair values. Where the share awards have total shareholder return (‘TSR’) market-
related performance criteria, the Group has used the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to establish the relevant fair values (see note 
21). The resulting fair values are recognised in the income statement over the vesting period of the options. 
At the end of each year, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market 
conditions and recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment 
to equity. 
The social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the share options is considered to be an integral part of the grant  
itself, and the charge will be treated as a cash-settled transaction. 
Non-current assets held for sale 
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset  
or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale, which should  
be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification. 
Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less  
costs to sell.  
Changes in accounting policy 
New standards, interpretations and amendments applied 
The following amendments to existing standards were effective for the Group from 1 January 2017, but either they were not applicable  
to or did not have a material impact on the Group: 
• Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiatives 
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014 ‒2016 Cycle: Clarification of the scope of the disclosure requirements in IFRS 12 
• IAS 12 (Income taxes) Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised losses 
New standards, interpretations and amendments not applied 
As at date of approval of the Group financial statements, the following new and amended standards, interpretations and amendments in 
issue are applicable to the Group but not yet effective and thus, have not been applied by the Group: 
 Effective date* 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018 
Clarification to IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018 
Amendments to IFRS 2: Classification and Measurement of Share based Payment Transactions 1 January 2018 
Annual Improvements 2014 ‒2016 Cycle 1 January 2018 
IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration 1 January 2018† 
Annual Improvements 2015 ‒2017 Cycle 1 January 2019† 
IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 
* The effective dates stated above are those given in the original IASB/IFRIC standards and interpretations. As the Group prepares its financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted  
by the European Union (EU), the application of new standards and interpretations will be subject to their having been endorsed for use in the EU via the EU Endorsement mechanism. In the 
majority of cases this will result in an effective date consistent with that given in the original standard or interpretation but the need for endorsement restricts the Group’s discretion to early 
adopt standards. 
† At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, these standards and interpretation have not yet been endorsed or adopted by the EU. 
The Directors do not expect the adoption of these standards, interpretations and amendments to have a material impact on the Consolidated 
or Parent Company financial statements in the period of initial application, except for IFRS 16 Leases. The Group’s assessment of the impact of 
applying IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 are discussed on page 120.

2. Accounting policies continued 
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with early adoption 
permitted. The standard (endorsed on 22 September 2016) establishes a five-step principle-based approach for revenue recognition and is 
based on the concept of recognising an amount that reflects the consideration for performance obligations only when they are satisfied and 
the control of goods or services is transferred. It applies to all contracts with customers, except those in the scope of other standards. It 
replaces the separate models for goods, services and construction contracts under the current accounting standards. 
Impact of adoption 
The Group is in the business of providing healthcare services. During 2017, the Group completed an impact assessment of IFRS 15 and 
concluded that the adoption of IFRS 15 will have an insignificant impact on its consolidated results. As such, the Group will adopt IFRS 15  
with effect from 1 January 2018 using the Modified Retrospective approach. 
Analysis 
Approximately 70% of the Group’s revenue is derived from in-patient and daycase admissions. Revenue is recognised day by day, as services 
are provided to patients. These services are typically provided over a short time frame, that is, one to three days. Out-patient cases and other 
revenue represent approximately 30% of the Group’s revenue. Out-patient cases generally do not involve surgical procedures and revenue is 
recognised on an individual component basis when performance obligations are satisfied. Similarly, other revenue, which includes consultant 
revenue and other third-party revenue streams, is recognised when performance obligations are satisfied and the control of goods or services 
is transferred. The current revenue recognition policy is in line with the requirements of IFRS 15 five-step model. 
Disaggregated revenue disclosure 
Spire Healthcare reports disaggregated revenue by material revenue stream (i.e. type of payor: PMI, NHS and Self-pay) and other revenue 
which includes consultant revenue, third-party revenue streams (e.g. pathology services) and of commissioning for quality and innovation 
payments (‘CQUIN’). Material revenue streams are consistent in nature, being the consideration received in return for the provision of 
healthcare services to patients. The timing and uncertainty of cash flows is similar for PMI and NHS business while Self-pay revenue  
is received in advance or collected by credit card shortly after treatment. In addition, Spire Healthcare reports revenue split between  
in-patient/daycase, out-patient and other. As noted above, in all cases, revenue is recognised as performance obligations are completed  
in the form of services being provided to patients. Uninvoiced revenue is accrued at period ends. Invoices for the combination of services 
provided to patients are generally produced within three days of discharge. Spire Healthcare believes that these disclosures satisfy the 
requirements of IFRS 15 to enable the reader to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows. 
IFRS 16 Leases 
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 with early adoption permitted for entities that apply 
IFRS 15 at or before the date of initial application of IFRS 16.  
IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognises a right-of-use asset representing its right 
to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. There are recognition exemptions for 
short-term leases and leases of low-value items. 
The Group has completed an initial assessment of the potential significant impact on its Consolidated financial statements but has not yet 
completed a detailed assessment of all leases. At 31 December 2017, the Group’s future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable 
operating leases amounted to £1,587.6 million, on an undiscounted basis. In addition, the nature of expenses related to those leases will  
now change as IFRS 16 replaces the straight-line operating expense with a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and interest expense  
on lease liabilities. No significant impact is expected for the contracts currently accounted for as finance leases. 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. IFRS 9 sets out requirements for 
recognising and measuring financial assets, liabilities and some contract to buy or sell non-financial items. The standard replaces IAS 39 
‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. 
IFRS 9 new impairment models requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on the expected credit loss (‘ECL’) model which 
replaces the ‘incurred loss’ model in IAS 39. Under the new loss allowance method, it can be measured on either of the following bases: 
• 12 month ECLs: these are ECLs that result from possible default events within the 12 months after the reporting date; and 
• Lifetime ECLs: these ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument. 
Concerning impairment, the Directors expect to apply the simplified approach to recognise lifetime ECLs for the Group’s trade receivables. 
This will result in an insignificant increase to the impairment provision on adoption of IFRS9 and going forwards greater judgement due to 
the need to factor in forward looking information when estimating the appropriate amount of provision. In applying IFRS 9 the Group must 
consider the probability of default occurring over the contractual life of its trade receivables.

3. Critical accounting judgements and estimates 
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements and estimates about the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based  
on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The following 
accounting policies have been identified as involving particularly complex judgements or subjective estimates: 
Judgements 
Exceptional and other items 
Judgements are required as to whether items that are material in size, unusual or infrequent in nature should be disclosed as exceptional  
and other items. Deciding which items meet the respective definitions requires the Group to exercise its judgement. Details of these items 
categorised as exceptional and other items are outlined in note 9. 
Estimates 
Deferred tax liabilities and assets 
The Group owns a portfolio of freehold and leasehold property interests. In previous years, the Group had recognised a deferred tax liability in 
its financial statements in respect of capital gains tax and other taxes based on the assumption that a proportion of the freehold properties 
would have been disposed of in future years, whilst the remaining properties were realised through use. This calculation previously required 
judgement about the timing and number of the related property disposals, which was potentially impacted by changes to plans made by the 
business over time and, in particular, changes in business plans in respect of the holding or disposing of properties.  
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unutilised trading losses and capital losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable income will be available in future against which they can be utilised. Future taxable profits are estimated based on 
business plans which include estimates and assumptions regarding economic growth, interest, inflation rates and taxation rates.  
During 2016, the Group considered it to be appropriate to reassess the basis for calculating deferred tax on the property portfolio and has 
since based the assessment on solely held-in-use basis. In 2016 this gave rise to a material tax charge of £8.4 million (refer to note 11). 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is considered for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired. This is 
achieved by comparing the value-in-use of the goodwill with its carrying value in the accounts. The value-in-use calculations require the 
Group to estimate future cash flows expected to arise in the future, taking into account market conditions. The present value of these cash 
flows is determined using an appropriate discount rate.  
The assumptions considered to be most critical in reviewing goodwill for impairment are contained in note 14. 
Leases 
In the determination of the classification of a number of leases over hospital properties as operating leases, assumptions have been made 
about the discount rate applied to the annual rent payable over the remainder of the lease term compared against their respective fair values 
and of the useful economic life of the hospitals. Further information about commitments under these leases is given in note 25.  
Share based payments 
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the  
non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a 
corresponding adjustment to equity.  
The assumptions considered to be most critical in estimating share based payments are contained in note 21. 
Provision for medical malpractice claims 
In the measurement of such provisions where the recognition criteria are met, the typical complexity of claims – for example, in respect of 
their outcome and the extent of damages (if any) assessed on the Group – requires management to use estimation. Such estimates are 
typically based on professional advice on expected outcomes and historical information on similar claims.  
In some cases, judgement is also required, for example, as to whether the criteria for recognising provisions are met and whether a reliable 
estimate of the outcomes can be made.  
Further details of claims and the amounts provided are given in note 22. 
Property impairment 
Property is considered for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there is an indication that carrying amount may be impaired. 
This is achieved by comparing the value-in-use of the property with its carrying value in the accounts. The value-in-use calculations require 
the Group to estimate cash flows expected to arise in the future, taking into account market conditions. The present value of these cash flows 
is determined using an appropriate discount rate.

4. Non-current assets held for sale 
As at December 2017, the Group’s management have committed to sell two properties which previously formed part of the Group  
operations, Spire St Saviour’s Hospital which closed in 2015 and Whalley Range, Manchester which is due to close in April 2018. The properties  
are expected to be sold within twelve months, have been classified as held for sale and are presented separately in the Consolidated  
balance sheet.  
The proceeds of disposal are expected to exceed the net carrying amount of the relevant assets and accordingly, no impairment loss has  
been recognised on the classification of these operations as held for sale.

6. Segmental reporting 
In determining the Group’s operating segment, management has primarily considered the financial information in internal reports that are 
reviewed and used by the executive management team and Board of Directors (in aggregate the chief operating decision maker) in assessing 
performance and in determining the allocation of resources. The financial information in those internal reports in respect of revenue and 
expenses has led management to conclude that the Group has a single operating segment, being the provision of healthcare services.  
All revenue is attributable to and all non-current assets are located in the United Kingdom.  
Revenue by wider customer (payor) group is shown below:

1 Other exceptional items in 2017 predominantly relate to the Mediclinic takeover bid, relocation of HR and payroll functions and the release of an onerous lease provision. In 2016 the costs 
primarily relate to National Insurance on Directors’ Share Bonus Award granted at the time of the IPO. 
Following the completion of the criminal proceedings against Ian Paterson (a consultant who previously had practicing privileges at Spire 
Healthcare) earlier in 2017, Spire Healthcare settled all current and known claims against Spire relating to his practice at Spire Healthcare. 
Accordingly, Spire Healthcare has provided £28.7 million in relation to this settlement, plus related costs, of which £26.1 million has been 
paid. Spire is currently pursuing legal action against its insurers to seek recoveries against this settlement and related costs, which may give 
rise to future exceptional income being recognised in the income statement. No account has been taken of these further recoveries in the 
results for the year ended 31 December 2017. 
In the final quarter of 2017, management undertook a strategic review of its current portfolio of sites and the future development options  
for the Group. As part of the process, the decision was taken to cease the provision of radiotherapy services at the Spire Specialist Cancer Care 
Centre in Baddow (Essex) as a consequence of poor commercial performance. The charge for the year includes £10.3 million for the write-off 
of fixed assets, net of recoverable value, and a provision for site closure costs. Additionally, certain well progressed capital projects, notably 
the development of a hospital in Central London, have been aborted and the costs associated with these projects have been charged as 
exceptional items in the year due to the fundamental change in development strategy. 
Hospital set-up and closure costs include the pre-opening expenses for the two new hospitals opened during 2017 (Spire Manchester and 
Spire Nottingham hospitals), plus the decommissioning costs of the former Manchester hospital site.  
An Executive Director had a period of illness during 2017. Costs associated with his remuneration during his medical leave were duplicative  
to the business. After sadly passing away in July 2017, Spire Healthcare made a death in service payment which has also been included in 
exceptional items. 
In the year ended 31 December 2016, business reorganisation mainly comprised staff restructuring costs and the closure costs relating to  
an onerous contract. In the year, the Group’s goodwill in relation to the Lifescan business was written-off following a strategic review and  
the closure of this operation. Hospital set-up costs refer to pre-opening costs for the new Spire Manchester and Spire Nottingham hospitals.  
The reversal of the impairment is the result of the reassessment of the lives of medical and other equipment following the relocation of the 
assets from the previous Spire Manchester Hospital to the new hospital facility and other Group hospitals following its closure. Hospital 
closure costs relate to the decommissioning of the assets related to the previous Spire Manchester Hospital. Corporate restructuring related 
to an internal Group reorganisation and transaction costs relating to the Asset Swap Transaction as described below. Except for the corporate 
restructuring costs, which were capital in nature, and write-off of intangible assets, all other exceptional costs are expected to be tax 
deductible. 
On 31 August 2016, as a result of the development of a new hospital facility in Manchester and the closure of the previous Spire Manchester 
Hospital (previously held under an operating lease), the freehold interest in Spire Wirral Hospital with a net book value of £11.7 million was 
disposed of, and leased back in a sale and leaseback transaction. The consideration for the sale was realised in the form of a non-cash asset, 
being the freehold of the previous Spire Manchester Hospital, which was simultaneously acquired by the Group (the ‘Asset Swap 
Transaction’). The overall loss on these transactions was £7.7 million before sale costs of £1.2 million. 
For 2017, £4.0 million (2016: £3.7 million) in respect of wages, salaries and social security costs (see note 8) is included in write-off and 
aborted project costs, executive medical leave and death in service, business reorganisations, hospital set-up costs, hospital closure, other  
and corporate restructuring costs.

The UK Government has announced a further decrease in the future UK corporation tax rate from 18% to 17% from April 2020. This change 
has resulted in a deferred tax credit arising from the reduction in the balance sheet carrying value of deferred tax liabilities to reflect the 
anticipated rate of tax at which those liabilities are expected to reverse. 
During 2016, the Group considered it to be appropriate to reassess the basis for calculating deferred tax on the property portfolio and has 
now based the assessment on solely held-in-use basis (see note 3). This gave rise to a material tax charge in 2016 which is excluded from tax 
on underlying profit.

Deferred tax on property, plant and equipment has arisen on differences between the carrying value of the relevant assets and the tax base. 
The losses relate entirely to non-trade losses.  
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the 
liability settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date. The Finance Act 2016, which 
included a further reduction in the UK corporate tax rate from 18.0% to 17.0% on 1 April 2020, has been enacted and so deferred tax assets 
and liabilities have been calculated at this rate unless the temporary difference is expected to reverse sooner than 1 April 2020 in which case 
the applicable rate of 18.00% to 19.25% has been used.

11. Taxation continued 
The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets as at 31 December 2017 as follows: 
(£ million) 2017  2016  
Trading losses 0.9 0.9 
Capital losses 0.1 0.1 
Tax basis for future capital disposals 17.9 17.9 
 18.9 18.9 
These amounts are the expected tax value of the gross temporary difference at the enacted long-term tax rate of 17% (2016: 17%). A deferred 
tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these amounts due to uncertainties as to the timing of future profits that the trading losses 
could be offset against and whether capital gains will arise against which the capital losses and tax basis for capital disposals could be utilised. 
12. Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number  
of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. 
 2017  2016  
Profit for the year attributable to owners of the Parent (£ million) 16.8 53.6

Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue (No.) 400,614,357 399,995,435 
Basic earnings per share (in pence per share) 4.2 13.4 
For dilutive earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to include all dilutive potential ordinary 
shares arising from share options. Refer to the Remuneration Committee Report for the terms and conditions of instruments generating 
potential ordinary shares that affect the measurement of diluted EPS. There are no instruments that are antidilutive for the periods 
presented which have been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.

As at 31 December 2017, included in the net book value of property, plant and equipment above is £20.3 million (2016: £21.7 million)  
relating to assets held under finance leases on which there was a depreciation charge of £1.2 million in the year (2016: £1.2 million).  
The amount of borrowing costs capitalised during the year ended 31 December 2017 was £0.7 million (2016: £1.8 million). The rate used  
to determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation was 3.4% (2016: 3.5%) which is calculated on a weighted cost  
of borrowing.

At 31 December 2017 517.8 
At 31 December 2016  517.8 
The goodwill arising on acquisitions is reviewed annually for impairment on 31 December or when there is an event that may indicate 
impairment. The recoverable amount of the Group’s cash-generating unit exceeds its carrying value and no impairment charge has been 
recognised (2016: £nil) and no event has given rise to amounts written-off (2016: £1.3m).  
The Directors do not believe that any impairment is required in the current financial year.  
Impairment testing 
The Directors treat the business as a single cash-generating unit for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. The recoverable 
amount of goodwill is calculated by reference to its estimated value-in-use.  
In order to estimate the value-in-use, management has used trading projections covering the five-year period to December 2022.  
Management identified a number of key assumptions relevant to the value-in-use calculations, being revenue growth, which is impacted  
by an interaction of a number of elements of the operating model, including pricing trends, volume growth and the mix and complexity of 
discharges, assumptions regarding cost inflation and discount rates. These variables are interdependent and the forecast cash flows reflect 
management’s expectations based on current market trends. Revenue growth is projected to be in line with past experience averaging  
4.3% for the five-year period (2016: 4.1%). Cost assumptions are consistent with the Group’s historical track record, after taking account  
of headline inflation at 3.0% (2016: 1.0%).  
A long-term growth rate of 2.25% (2016: 2.25%) has been applied to cash flows beyond 2022, which is based on historic growth rates 
achieved by the sector, which have typically exceeded the retail price index (‘RPI’). Pre-tax discount rates were based on the capital asset 
pricing model, utilising a sector-specific Beta in arriving at the equity premium and cost of debt based on current bank lending rates. A 
specific pre-tax discount rate was calculated to reflect the profile of cash flows inherent to the cash-generating unit and this was 9.0%  
(2016: 9.0%). 
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to review the impact of changes in key assumptions. For example, an increase of 3.0% in 
the pre-tax discount rate to 12.0%, with all other assumptions held constant, did not identify any impairments. Similarly, zero growth in the 
period beyond 2022, with all other assumptions held constant or combined with a 1.0% increase in the pre-tax discount rate, did not identify 
any impairment. The pre-tax discount rate would need to increase to 12.4%, with all other assumptions held constant, in order to reduce 
recoverable value equal to the carrying amount.

Trade receivables comprise amounts due from private medical insurers, the NHS, patients, consultants and other third parties who use the 
Group’s facilities. Invoices to customers fall due within 60 days of the date of issue. Some of the agreements with NHS customers operate  
on the basis of monthly payments on account with quarterly reconciliations, which can lead to invoices being paid after their due date. 
The ageing of trade receivables is shown below and shows amounts that are past due at the reporting date. A provision for doubtful 
receivables has been recognised at the reporting date through consideration of the ageing profile of the Group’s receivables and the 
perceived credit quality of its customers. The carrying amount of trade receivables is considered to be an approximation to its fair value.

The Group operates a number of share based payment schemes for Executive Directors and other employees, all of which are equity settled. 
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle any of the options in cash. The total cost recognised in the income 
statement was £1.0 million in the year ended 31 December 2017 (2016: £0.4 million). Employer’s National Insurance is being accrued, where 
applicable, at the rate of 14.3%, which management expects to be the prevailing rate at the time the options are exercised, based on the 
share price at the reporting date. The total National Insurance charge for the year was £0.1 million (2016: £0.2 million).

21. Share based payments continued 
A summary of the main features of the scheme is shown below: 
Long Term Incentive Plan 
The Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) is open to Executive Directors and designated senior managers, and awards are made at the discretion  
of the Remuneration Committee. Awards are subject to market and non-market performance criteria. 
Awards granted under the LTIP vest subject to achievement of performance conditions measured over a period of at least three years, unless 
the Committee determines otherwise. Awards may be in the form of conditional share awards or nil-cost options or any other form allowed 
by the Plan rules.  
Vesting of awards will be dependent on a range of financial, operational or share price measures, as set by the Committee, which are aligned 
with the long-term strategic objectives of the Group and shareholder value creation. Not less than 30% of an award will be based on share 
price measures. The remainder will be based on either financial and/or operational measures. At the threshold performance, no more than 
25% of the award will vest, rising to 100% for maximum performance. For awards granted in 2017, vesting will be based on EPS (35%), relative 
TSR (35%) and Operational Excellence (30%) targets. The details of measures, targets and weightings may be varied by the Committee prior to 
grant based on the Group’s strategic objectives. 
Deferred bonus plan 
The Deferred Bonus Plan is a discretionary executive share bonus plan under which the Remuneration Committee determines that a proportion of  
a participant’s annual bonus will be deferred. The market value of the shares granted to any employee will be equal to one-third of the total 
annual bonus that would otherwise have been payable to the individual. The awards will be granted on the day after the announcement  
of the Group’s annual results. The awards will normally vest over a three-year period.

*  The Directors’ Share Bonus Award was divided into two equal tranches, the first of which vested on 23 July 2015 and the second tranche vested on 23 July 2016. The number of options that 
vested depended on conditions relating to share price on the relevant dates. The second tranche, which vested on 23 July 2016, resulted in 781,718 options (23 July 2015: 801,824 options) 
being issued. All qualifying options relating to the Directors’ Share Bonus Award were exercised during 2016. For further details, see the Directors’ Remuneration Report, on pages 78 to 95 . 
The weighted average remaining contractual life for the share options outstanding as at 31 December 2017 was 1.3 years (2016: 1.9 years).

Medical malpractice relates to commitments to patients in respect of the removal or replacement of the PIP brand of breast implants, and 
estimated liabilities arising from claims for damages in respect of services previously supplied to patients. Amounts are shown gross of 
insured liabilities. Any such insurance recoveries are recognised in other receivables. Following the completion of the criminal proceedings 
against Ian Paterson, a consultant who previously had practicing privileges at Spire Healthcare, management agreed settlement with all 
current and known civil claimants (and the other co-defendants) and have made a provision for the expected remaining costs (see note 9). 
The provision in relation to Ian Paterson costs have been determined before account is taken of any potential further recoveries from insurers. 
Business restructuring and other includes staff restructuring costs and closure costs relating to the Specialist Cancer Care Centre in Baddow (Essex).  
The provisions are shown gross of any expected reimbursement from insurers of the related risks. The reimbursement is recognised  
as a separate receivable when receipt of it is judged sufficiently probable. The amount included in other receivables in that respect was  
£7.5 million (2016: £6.7 million).  
Provisions as at 31 December 2017 are materially considered to be current and expected to be utilised at any time within three years.

25. Commitments 
Operating leases 
The Group had future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, based on rents prevailing at the year end, as set  
out below:

buildings Other

Later than five years  1,263.1 –  1,282.9 – 
 1,587.6 3.3  1,595.7 3.3 
The Group has a number of long-term institutional lease arrangements. These include leases over 12 properties with a term up to December 
2042, subject to renewal or extension over each of the 12 properties. The leases include key terms such as annual rental covenants and 
minimum levels of capital expenditure invested by the Group. Rent is indexed annually in line with RPI, upwards only and subject to a cap of 
5.0%. The capital expenditure covenants measured on an average basis over each five-year period during the term of the leases, require the 
Group to incur, in total, £5.0 million of maintenance capital expenditure and £3.0 million of additional capital expenditure each year, such 
being subject to indexation in line with RPI.  
Other operating leases are in respect of vehicles and medical transportation. 
Consignment stock 
At 31 December 2017, the Group held consignment stock on sale or return of £23.0 million (2016: £22.1 million). The Group is only required 
to pay for the equipment it chooses to use and therefore this stock is not recognised as an asset. 
Capital commitments 
Capital commitments comprise amounts payable under capital contracts which are duly authorised and in progress at the balance sheet 
date. They include the full cost of goods and services to be provided under the contracts through to completion. The Group has rights within 
its contracts to terminate at short notice and, therefore, cancellation payments are minimal.  
Capital commitments at the end of the year were as follows:  
(£ million) 2017  2016  
Contracted but not provided for 65.5 63.8 
26. Contingent liabilities 
The Group had the following guarantees at 31 December 2017: 
• the bankers to Spire Healthcare Limited have issued a letter of credit in the maximum amount of £1.5 million (2016: £1.5 million) in relation  
to contractual pension obligations and statutory insurance cover in respect of the Group’s potential liability to claims made by employees 
under the Employers’ Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969;  
• under certain lease agreements entered into on 26 January 2010, the Group has given undertakings relating to obligations in the lease 
documentation and the assets of the Group are subject to a fixed and floating charge; and 
• see note 22 for details of a contingent liability in respect of Medical Malpractice.

27. Financial risk management and impairment of financial assets 
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:  
• credit risk;  
• liquidity risk; and  
• market risk.  
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes  
for measuring and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these financial statements.  
The Directors have overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework.  
The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits  
and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. 
Credit risk and impairment 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and investment securities.  
Trade and other receivables  
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The Group’s exposure to credit risk 
from trade receivables is considered to be low because of the nature of its customers and policies in place to prevent credit risk occurring.  
Most revenues arise from insured patients’ business and the NHS. Insured revenues give rise to trade receivables which are mainly due from 
large insurance institutions, which have high credit worthiness. The remainder of revenues arise from individual Self-pay patients and 
consultants.  
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables.  
This allowance is composed of specific losses that relate to individual exposures and also a collective loss component established in respect  
of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified, determined based on historical data of payment statistics.  
Note 17 shows the ageing and customer profiles of trade receivables outstanding at the year end.  
Investments  
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in short-term money market deposits with large financial institutions, which 
must be rated at least Investment Grade by key rating agencies. 
Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of 
financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable 
parameters, while optimising the return on risk.

27. Financial risk management and impairment of financial assets continued 
Interest rate risk 
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in market rates. This affects future cash flows from money market 
investments and the cost of floating rate borrowings.  
From time-to-time, the Group considers the cost benefit of entering into derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest 
rate volatility based on existing variable rates, current and predicted interest yield curves and the cost of associated medium-term derivative 
financial instruments.  
Interest rates on variable rate loans are determined by LIBOR fixings on a quarterly basis. Interest is settled on all loans in line with 
agreements and is settled at least annually.

Sensitivity analysis  
A change of 25 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased/(decreased) equity and reported results by the 
amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.

Variable rate instruments  (0.3) 0.3  (0.3) 0.3 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to managing 
liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and 
stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.  
Liquidity is managed across the Group and consideration is taken of the segregation of accounts for regulatory purposes. Short-term 
operational working capital requirements are met by cash in hand and overdraft facilities.  
Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a period of at least 90 days, 
including the servicing of financial obligations. In addition to cash on demand, the Group has available the following lines of credit:  
• £100.0 million of revolving credit facility, which was fully undrawn as at 31 December 2017 (2016: £100.0 million undrawn).

 556.1 782.3 75.3 19.8 687.2 
Bases of valuation 
The management assessed that cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables and other current liabilities approximate 
their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. 
The carrying value of the other financial instruments, being finance leases and debt, is approximately equal to their fair value based on review 
of current terms against market and expected short-term settlements, except for floating rate debt, which is after the deduction of £1.8 million 
(2016: £2.9 million) of issue costs. 
As at 31 December 2017, the Group did not hold any financial instruments measured at fair value (2016: nil). 
Capital management 
The Group’s objective is to maintain an appropriate balance of debt and equity financing to enable the Group to continue as a going concern, 
to continue the future development of the business and to optimise returns to shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders.  
The Board closely manages trading capital, defined as net assets plus net debt. The Group’s net assets at 31 December 2017 were £1,037.9 million 
(2016: £1,035.3 million) and net debt, calculated as total debt (comprising obligations under finance leases and borrowings), less cash and 
cash equivalents, amounted to £462.8 million (2016: £432.3 million).  
The principal focus of capital management revolves around working capital management and compliance with externally imposed financial 
covenants. Throughout the period and up to the date of approval of these financial statements, the Group complied with all covenants 
required by our lending group.  
Major investment decisions are based on reviewing the expected future cash flows and all major capital expenditure requires approval  
by the Board.  
At the balance sheet date, the Group’s committed undrawn facilities, and cash and cash equivalents were as follows: 
(£ million) 2017 2016 
Committed undrawn revolving credit facility 100.0 100.0

This section contains the notes to the Company financial statements. The issued share capital and EBT share reserves are consistent 
with the Spire Healthcare Group plc Group financial statements. Refer to note 19 of the Group financial statements. 
C1. Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the 
European Union and on an historical cost basis. The financial statements are presented in UK sterling and all values are rounded to the 
nearest million pounds (£ million), except when otherwise indicated. 
See note 1 for general information about the Company.  
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors believe there are no material uncertainties that  
lead to significant doubt that the Company can continue as a going concern for at least 12 months from the date of approval of these 
financial statements. 
The Company applies consistent accounting policies, as applied by the Group. To the extent that an accounting policy is relevant to both  
Group and Company financial statements, refer to the Group financial statements for disclosure of the accounting policy. Material policies  
that apply to the Company only are included as appropriate. 
The Company has used the exemption granted under s408 of the Companies Act 2006 that allows for the non-disclosure of the income 
statement of the Parent Company. 
The Company did not have items to be reported as other comprehensive income; therefore, no statement of comprehensive income  
was prepared.

The Company’s investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less provisions resulting from impairment. In testing for impairment,  
the carrying value of the investment is compared to its recoverable amount, being its value-in-use. 
Share based payments 
The financial effect of awards by the Company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary undertakings is recognised by  
the Company in its individual financial statements as an increase in its investment in subsidiaries with a credit to equity equivalent to the  
IFRS 2 cost in subsidiary undertakings. The subsidiary, in turn, will recognise the IFRS 2 cost in its income statement with a credit to equity 
to reflect the deemed capital contribution from the Company. 
C3. Key estimates and assumptions in this section 
Impairment testing of investments in subsidiaries 
The Company’s investments in subsidiaries have been tested for impairment by comparison against the underlying value of the subsidiaries’ 
assets based on value-in-use calculated using the same assumptions as noted for the testing of goodwill impairment in note 14 of the Group 
financial statements. 
C4. Staff costs and Directors’ remuneration 
The Company had no employees during the year, except for the Directors. The information on compensation for the Directors, being 
considered as the key management personnel of the Company, is disclosed in note C12.

C10. Capital management and financial instruments

Credit risk  
As at 31 December 2017, the Company had amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings of £122.0 million (2016: £80.8 million). The Company’s 
maximum exposure to credit risk from these amounts is £122.0 million (2016: £80.8 million).

Market risk 
Interest rate risk and sensitivity analysis 
As at 31 December 2017 the Company had short-term borrowings of £2.4 million (2016: £2.3 million) owed to subsidiary undertakings,  
which are repayable on demand and bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.00% (2016: LIBOR plus 2.00%). Interest on these borrowings in the year 
amounted to nil (2016: nil) and the Directors do not perceive that servicing this debt poses any significant risk to the Company given its  
size in relation to the Company’s net assets.  
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures required a market risk sensitivity analysis illustrating the fair values of the Company’s financial 
instruments and the impact on the Company’s income statement and shareholders’ equity of reasonably possible changes in selected  
market risks. Excluding cash and cash equivalents, the Company has no financial assets or liabilities that expose it to market risk, other than 
the amounts owed by/to subsidiary undertakings of £122.0 million (2016: £80.8 million) and £2.4 million (2016: £2.3 million) respectively. 
The Directors do not believe that a change of 25 basis points in the LIBOR interest rates will have a material impact on the Company’s income 
statement or shareholders’ equity.  
C11. Contingent liabilities 
Lease arrangements with a consortium of investors 
The Company has given a guarantee to a consortium of investors, comprising Malaysia’s Employees Provident Fund (‘EPF’), affiliated funds  
of Och-Ziff Capital Management Group and Moor Park Capital, in relation to the sale of 12 of the Spire Group’s property-owning companies  
on 17 January 2013. With effect from 17 January 2013, the total third party annual commitments of the Group under these operating leases 
increased by £51.3 million per annum. 
As a result of the sale, the Group has long-term institutional lease arrangements (up to December 2042, subject to renewal or extension),  
with the landlord for each of the 12 properties. The leases include key terms such as annual rental covenants and minimum levels of capital 
expenditure invested by the Group. The capital expenditure covenants measured on an average basis over each five-year period during the  
term of the leases, require the Group to incur, in total, £5.0 million of maintenance capital expenditure and £3.0 million of additional capital 
expenditure on the portfolio of 12 hospitals each year, such being subject to indexation in line with RPI. If the minimum rent cover ratio  
is not met, the Group is required to enter into an asset performance recovery plan in order to comply with the covenants, but no default  
would be deemed to have occurred. The Company is a party to this guarantee. As at 31 December 2017, the Group complied with the 
required covenants. 
Lease agreements entered into by Classic Hospitals Limited 
Under lease agreements entered into on 26 January 2010 by Classic Hospitals Limited, a subsidiary undertaking of the Company, the 
Company has undertaken to guarantee the payment of rentals over the lease term to August 2040, and to ensure that the other covenants  
in the lease are observed. The initial rentals payable under the leases in 2010 were £6.3 million per annum, which will be subject to an 
increase in future years. As part of these arrangements, the assets of the Company are subject to a fixed and floating charge in the event  
of a default. As at 31 December 2017, there was no breach in the required covenants.

‘Boiler room’ scams
From time-to-time, in common with other 
listed companies, shareholders may receive 
unsolicited phone calls or correspondence 
concerning investment matters. These are 
typically from overseas-based ‘brokers’ who

and high-pressure tactics to lure investors 
into scams in what often turn out to be 
worthless, non-existent or high-risk shares 
in US or UK investments. These operations 
are commonly known as ‘boiler rooms’.
Shareholders are advised to be very wary 
of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy 
shares at a discount or offers of free 
company reports. Further information

Forward looking  
statements
Important information: forward-looking statements 
These materials contain certain forward-looking statements 
relating to the business of Spire Healthcare Group plc (the 
‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the ‘Group’), 
including with respect to the progress, timing and completion 
of the Group’s development, the Group’s ability to treat,  
attract, and retain patients and customers, its ability to engage 
consultants and GPs and to operate its business and increase 
referrals, the integration of prior acquisitions, the Group’s 
estimates for future performance and its estimates regarding 
anticipated operating results, future revenue, capital 
requirements, shareholder structure and financing. In addition, 
even if the Group’s actual results or development are consistent 
with the forward-looking statements contained in this 
presentation, those results or developments may not be 
indicative of the Group’s results or developments in the future. 
In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements 
by words such as ‘could,’ ‘should,’ ‘may,’ ‘expects,’ ‘aims,’ ‘targets,’ 
‘anticipates,’ ‘believes,’ ‘intends,’ ‘estimates,’ or similar words. 
These forward-looking statements are based largely on the 
Group’s current expectations as of the date of this presentation 
and are subject to a number of known and unknown risks and 
uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, 
performance or achievements to be materially different from 
any future results, performance or achievement expressed or 
implied by these forward-looking statements. In particular, the 
Group’s expectations could be affected by, among other things, 
uncertainties involved in the integration of acquisitions or 
new developments, changes in legislation or the regulatory 
regime governing healthcare in the UK, poor performance by 
consultants who practice at our facilities, unexpected regulatory
