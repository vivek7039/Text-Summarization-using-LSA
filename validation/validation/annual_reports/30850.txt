NON-FINANCIAL
At 31 December 2017, 81% of our mutual 
fund assets under management (AUM) 
were outperforming the median over 
three years. This helped us to achieve 
net inflows of £5.5bn, contributing to an 
increase in AUM of 24% to £50.2bn.
FINANCIAL
The growth in AUM was the primary 
driver of the 19% increase in net 
management fees to £392.4m. This 
enabled the continued investment in  
our business. Our efficient platform and 
operating model helped turn revenue 
growth into underlying earnings per 
share of 34.2p, up 16%. Other financial 
highlights include:
l l Basic earnings per share  
up 14% to 34.5p
l l Profit before tax up 13%  
to £192.9m. 
RETURNS TO 
SHAREHOLDERS
Our total dividends for the year were 
32.6p per share, including ordinary 
dividends of 17.1p (up 16%) and a  
special dividend of 15.5p (2016: 12.5p).
HIGHLIGHTS
DELIVERING GROWTH THROUGH INVESTMENT EXCELLENCE
In 2017, we maintained strong investment outperformance after 
all fees for our clients. Healthy net inflows demonstrate the 
success of our diversification strategy, underpinned by a resilient 
balance sheet, allowing healthy returns to shareholders.

Strategic report
AT A GLANCE
Jupiter manages mutual funds, segregated mandates and investment trusts 
on behalf of individuals and institutions. We are a leader in the UK mutual 
fund market and have a growing presence in our chosen European and 
Asian locations.
INVESTMENT OUTPERFORMANCE 
IS AT THE HEART OF WHAT 
WE DO
We aim to deliver value for money to 
our clients through active fund 
management that delivers long‑term 
investment outperformance, after all fees. 
Investment outperformance helps us to 
grow our assets under management 
(AUM), by ensuring we keep existing 
clients and attract new ones. In turn, 
growing our AUM increases our revenues 
and profits, allowing us to invest for 
continued growth as well as rewarding 
employees and adding value for 
shareholders through ordinary and 
special dividends and capital 
appreciation.
OUR PEOPLE AND CULTURE 
ARE KEY
We believe that talented individuals who 
are free to pursue their own investment 
styles can make the most difference for 
clients. With no ‘house view’ to constrain 
them, our fund managers actively seek 
the best investment opportunities through 
fundamental analysis, with a focus on 
good stewardship.
Our fund managers are organised into 
strategy teams, ensuring that they can 
share ideas and information, while 
retaining accountability as individuals for 
their funds’ performance. As we grow, 
this approach helps to give us a more 
diversified business by asset class, 
geography and investment style.  
At 31 December 2017, we employed  
74 investment professionals in London, 
supported by 449 other employees. This 
included 34 people located in Europe 
and Asia providing in‑ country support 
for our international business growth. 
A DIVERSIFIED AND 
RESILIENT BUSINESS MODEL
In recent years, we have followed a 
successful strategy of diversifying Jupiter 
by geography, client type and product 
while maintaining and investing in our 
efficient operating platform. This has 
given us a more resilient business and 
provides a broader range of growth 
opportunities for the years ahead.
OUR VALUES
Our primary responsibility is to our 
clients who entrust their savings to  
our management. We aim to protect 
and grow their assets and provide  
an excellent service.
Every employee can make a difference 
to Jupiter. We value individual talent 
and independent thought and seek  
to give freedom to employees to 
deliver. We do this within a team 
framework where respect, high 
standards and innovation are key  
to our high‑ performance culture.
We aim to make a positive 
contribution to society as managers 
of other people’s money. We seek  
to do so by increasing the value of 
our clients’ savings, in the way we  
run money and by behaving in an 
ethical manner.
We believe that if we live by our 
values, Jupiter will be a profitable and 
sustainable company which provides 
fair returns to clients, employees and 
shareholders.

Strategic report
DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS
The Board was very pleased with 
the Group’s performance this year. We 
maintained strong levels of investment 
outperformance for our clients after 
all fees, which is our primary aim. This 
strong investment performance enabled 
us to retain existing clients and attract 
new ones. New clients came from 
across an increasingly broad distribution 
network of partners with wider 
geographical reach. This resulted in 
significant net inflows of £5.5bn into 
our increasingly diversified range of 
investment strategies and products. 
The increase in assets under 
management to £50.2bn contributed 
to a 1 3% rise in statutory profit before 
tax to £192.9m (on an underlying basis 
this was £193.8m).
Investment outperformance
During the year, a significant amount 
of hard work was undertaken to 
ensure that we can continue to deliver 
investment outperformance for clients 
and thus financial results for shareholders. 
This included investing in our business 
by recruiting and developing existing 
employees in the fund management 
strategy teams to broaden and deepen 
our investment capability. It also included 
substantial changes to our operating 
platform in preparation for all the 
requirements of MiFID II. 
Earlier in the year we announced 
changes to pricing for our UK unit trusts 
and that Jupiter would meet the cost of 
research used in our fund management 
process. Both of these changes benefit 
clients and increase transparency, 
enabling them to more easily assess the 
investment performance after all fees. 
Dividends to shareholders
Jupiter’s progressive dividend policy 
targets an ordinary payout of 50% 
of our underlying earnings per share. 
In order to provide shareholders with 
a smoother flow of returns, we 
rebalanced the dividend this year 
towards the interim. We increased it 
to 6.8p per share from the 4.5p paid 
in 2016. The Board is now declaring a 
full‑ year dividend of 10.3p per share 
(2016: 10.2p), to give a total ordinary 
dividend of 17.1p, up 16%.
In addition, the Group’s financial results 
and strong balance sheet allow us to 
announce a special dividend of 15.5p 
per share for 2017 (2016: 12.5p per 
share), giving a total dividend of 32.6p. 
This will be paid at the same time as 
the full‑ year dividend. Special dividends 
enable us to deliver returns to our 
shareholders sooner rather than later, 
using cash we do not need to hold 
for other purposes and we remain 
committed to this policy.
Taking the ordinary and special 
dividends together, shareholders will 
receive a total of 32.6p. This represents 
a 20% increase on last year, and a 
distribution of 95% of our underlying 
earnings. 
A consistent strategy
Under Maarten Slendebroek’s leadership, 
Jupiter has followed a consistent strategy, 
with investment outperformance for our 
clients at its heart, which has successfully 
diversified and grown the Group. 
During the year, the Board reviewed 
the strategy in detail in the context of 
Jupiter’s evolving markets, our success to 
date and the environment of significant 
change around us. The Board reaffirmed 
the strategic direction of the Group. 
It is confident that Jupiter’s position 
as an active fund manager focused 
on investment performance after all 
fees can support its continued growth.
Board and governance
We were delighted to welcome Roger 
Yates as a Non‑ Executive Director in 
October 2017. Roger led Henderson’s 
successful global expansion and has 
over a decade of non‑ executive 
experience on the boards of UK financial 
services companies. His insights will be 
invaluable as we move forward.
Lorraine Trainer has decided to retire 
from the Jupiter Board and will not be 
seeking re‑ election at the Company’s 
AGM on 18 May 2018. Lorraine joined 
the Board in May 2010 at the time of 
the IPO and served as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee from May 2011 
to June 2017 and Senior Independent 
Director from September 2014 to July 2017. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
express my gratitude to Lorraine for 
her support and significant contribution 
during her eight years on the Board. 
Lorraine has brought energy, commitment 
and a different perspective to the Board 
and this has been invaluable to Jupiter 
as the business has grown and 
developed. Her experience and insight 
will be missed.
During the year, we completed a 
full external Board evaluation, which 
confirmed that the Board and its 
committees continue to function well. 
People and culture
Jupiter has good gender balance at 
Board level but this is not replicated in 
all areas of the Group. While we ensure 
we pay men and women the same for 
performing the same roles to the same 
performance levels, the high percentage 
of senior fund manager and sales 
positions held by men is the driver of 
our gender pay gap. We expect the 
gender pay and bonus gaps between 
female and male employees to gradually 
decline as we recruit and develop senior 
female talent across the business.
Jupiter has a strong culture and a 
set of values that are central to our 
business. They ensure we put clients 
first, collaborate effectively and remain 
conviction led. Our people embody 
these values and I want to thank 
everyone at Jupiter for their contribution 
to the Group’s success this year.
Looking forward
There are undoubtedly challenges in the 
external environment, most specifically 
the uncertainties surrounding Brexit. The 
Board believes that Jupiter has a robust 
and sustainable business model and is 
confident that, with the delivery of value 
for clients, Jupiter can continue to thrive.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
A STRONG YEAR
2017 was a good year for Jupiter 
across all our activities: three-year 
investment performance, net inflows 
and delivery on a number of strategic 
projects. This was delivered within a 
supportive market environment.
The key measure of our investment 
performance is the percentage of mutual 
fund AUM with above‑ median performance, 
after all fees, over three years. This 
increased from 75% in 2016 to 81% in 2017, 
as our clients continued to benefit from our 
culture of high performance, independent 
thinking and accountability. 
I was very pleased with the net inflows 
of £5.5bn (2016: £1.0bn), which help to 
show the success of our diversification 
strategy, with positive inflows across 
each quarter. These inflows, coupled 
with our investment outperformance 
and market movements, resulted in a 
24% increase in our AUM. This, in turn, 
underpinned our financial performance.
Net revenues totalled £409.5m, up 17% 
(2016: £351.4m), including a 19% increase 
in net management fees to £392.4m 
(2016: £330.2m). The adjusted cost 
income ratio was steady at 55%, which 
meant that the revenue growth funded 
continued investment in our business and 
platform as well as increased profitability. 
Statutory profit before tax rose by 13% 
to £192.9m; underlying profit before tax 
increased from £168.4m in 2016 to 
£193.8m in 2017, representing growth of 
15%. Underlying earnings per share were 
16% higher at 34.2p (2016: 29.4p). The 
Group converts a high proportion of 
earnings into cash, generating operating 
cash flows after tax of £194.6m in 2017 
(2016: £147.3m). This supports our ability 
to maintain a strong balance sheet 
position while paying significant 
dividends to shareholders.
Our strategic progress was recognised 
in 2017 when Investment Week named 
Jupiter ‘Global Group of the Year’, based 
on our ‘strong investment performance 
across the board and a developing pool 
of rising talent, combined with a 
willingness to tackle industry issues 
ahead of others’. This award reflects our 
transformation over the past five years 
and our adaptability in changing 
regulatory environments.
A successful diversification strategy
All regions contributed to our net 
inflows in 2017, with the offices in Italy 
and Spain exceeding our expectations 
for the year. In total, the international 
distribution platform we have built 
provided 75% of our net inflows in 2017, 
without requiring significant additional 
resources in country to deliver that 
growth. The UK also grew in 2017, as 
inflows to investment strategies launched 
in recent years more than offset outflows 
from our longstanding fund of funds 
strategy.
Fixed income has been a major 
contributor to our AUM growth for 
several years and it was the largest 
source of net inflows in 2017. Fixed 
income AUM now stands at £13.4bn 
or 27% of the total for the Group, 
contributing towards our strategic goal 
of diversifying across different product 
types. There was also meaningful 
demand for a range of other strategies, 
including absolute return and global 
emerging markets. Growth in our 
Absolute Return, India and Distribution 
unit trusts means that 13 of our funds 
now have assets of more than £1bn, 
together accounting for £36.5bn of 
our AUM.
We continue to develop attractive 
new products. In 2017, we launched 
two emerging market debt funds and 
the Emerging & Frontier Income Trust. 
These launches underline Jupiter’s 
growing expertise and reputation in 
emerging markets, which accounts for 
an increasing proportion of our AUM. 
We also see alternatives as an exciting 
area of growth for Jupiter and we 
launched the Global Levered Absolute 
Return Fund to build on the success of 
the Absolute Return Fund. Looking 
further ahead, we see real opportunities 
to serve more institutional clients who 
seek active outperformance; we will 
continue to develop our institutional 
capabilities during 2018 and beyond.
Investing for growth
Towards the end of the year, we 
completed the implementation of a 
significant upgrade to our fund 
management, investment operations and 
risk platform. This will help us to support 
an increasingly diverse set of investment 
strategies and underpins our ability to 
grow. It was also an essential component 
of our programme of work to be well 
prepared for MiFID II compliance from 
January 2018. These important and 
complicated projects were finished on 
time. Continued investment to support 
the business is a vital element of our 
growth strategy and we will continue 
to invest in enhancing our systems and 
processes to prepare effectively for new 
regulations over the coming years.
Outlook
I am pleased that Jupiter’s operating 
model continues to demonstrate 
resilience and agility against a 
continually challenging and evolving 
backdrop. The strong growth we have 
experienced is because we put the 
client at the heart of everything we do. 
Our creative responses to delivering 
what they want has driven our success. 
The increase in our AUM in 2017 
should translate into a good start for 
the business in 2018. However, the 
previously announced changes to our 
unit trust pricing and our decision to 
bear all the costs of research will result 
in a profit headwind of around £18m from 
2018. Our investment performance 
statistics are at a high, in part due to the 
very strong performance of three years 
ago. Maintaining this level is a key 
challenge in 2018. We will also continue 
to invest in the business, embedding and 
optimising our new platform and starting 
a programme to upgrade systems 
supporting the sales and distribution 
teams.
The resilience of our current operating 
model and balance sheet strength mean 
that, despite the continued disruptions 
and uncertainties that exist around us, 
we are well placed to continue our 
growth trajectory and look for new 
areas of opportunity.
MAARTEN SLENDEBROEK
Chief Executive Officer 6
Strategic report
As a high conviction 
active asset manager, 
Jupiter operates within 
the wider long-term 
savings markets in  
both the UK and 
internationally.
MARKET DRIVERS 
In the markets where we choose to 
operate, a number of powerful long‑ term 
trends are driving demand for investment 
products that deliver attractive returns, 
have transparent fees and create value 
for clients.
Populations are growing and ageing
Populations around the world are 
increasing and people are living longer. 
According to the United Nations, 13% 
of the global population was aged 60 
or over in 2017, equating to 962m people. 
Europe has the largest proportion of over 
60s at 25%, while Asia is in line with the 
global average at 12%.
Worldwide, the population aged 60 or 
over is growing faster than all younger 
age groups, at about 3% per annum. 
The number of older people is projected 
to reach 1.4bn by 2030 and 2.1bn by 
2050. All regions except Africa will have 
a quarter or more of their population 
over 60 by 2050.
Developing economies are 
getting richer
In addition to ageing populations, 
developing economies are enjoying 
rising wealth. As their incomes grow 
and demand for savings products 
increases, individuals in these countries 
are increasingly demanding foreign 
investments to help them diversify their 
holdings and to give them access to a 
wider range of assets. Mutual fund 
providers, pension funds and insurance 
companies are providing more 
opportunities for these individuals to 
achieve their investment goals.
Individuals are having to save 
for retirement
These population trends mean that 
many more people need to fund longer 
retirements than previously expected. 
However, governments and companies 
are limiting pension provision, due to the 
cost of funding this provision. Individuals 
are therefore increasingly required to 
provide for retirement themselves, using 
defined contribution pension schemes 
and other forms of long‑ term savings, 
to build up enough capital to provide 
the income they will need.
Individuals continue to look for 
positive returns on their investments
Alongside the need to build up capital 
for the long term, individuals and their 
advisors are also having to consider the 
returns on their assets. Persistently low 
interest rates in many countries mean 
that traditional savings accounts offer 
negative real returns. As a result, 
pre‑ and post‑ retirement savers are 
turning to investment products such as 
those offered by Jupiter which offer the 
prospect of positive returns on their 
savings. In particular, the ability to 
increase the value of savings during 
the post‑ retirement phase, as well as 
generating income over and above that 
provided by the state, is changing the 
characteristics of client demand.
Clients are demanding a range of 
different products
Flows into mutual funds continue to 
polarise. At one end of the spectrum, 
there is growing demand for low‑ cost 
exchange‑ traded and index funds, where 
returns track an underlying market index. 
These offerings are generically known 
as passive funds. 
At the other end, there are significant 
inflows into high‑ performance, outcome‑ orientated active strategies, capable of 
delivering additional returns. This is the 
area in which Jupiter operates.
OUR MARKETS
WHAT THESE TRENDS MEAN FOR JUPITER
The trends in our markets have important implications for our strategy and operations:
l l There is substantial demand for 
investment products that offer strong 
outperformance after fees. Jupiter 
must meet this challenge in order to 
retain clients, attract greater inflows 
and grow revenues. Investment 
outperformance after all fees, 
delivered through active asset 
management, is therefore our 
number one priority.
l l Demand for different product 
types alongside shortening product 
lifecycles means we will need to 
further innovate and diversify our 
active range. We will continue to 
develop and launch new investment 
products, where we have the ability 
to differentiate our active offering, 
and look to attract and retain the 
best investment talent.
l l Attractive long‑ term demographics 
are increasing demand for mutual 
funds in the UK and in our 
international markets. This gives us 
the opportunity to further expand 
our distribution, as we continue to 
diversify geographically and broaden 
our client base. 7
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
In the middle of the spectrum are 
traditional funds, such as long‑ only, 
single‑ geography equity and fixed 
income funds. These have seen sizeable 
outflows, especially from funds which 
stick closely to the benchmark and 
which are therefore competing with 
low‑ cost passive alternatives. This is a 
result of investors looking for funds that 
consistently deliver value for money 
through outperformance after fees.
These dynamics mean that active 
asset managers must be able to 
clearly differentiate their products and 
demonstrate that they deliver positive 
returns after all fees, so they continue to 
attract and retain clients. 
Clients are demanding fee 
transparency and value for money
Fees can have a significant impact 
on returns to clients over time, which 
is why Jupiter targets investment 
outperformance after all fees. The 
importance of fees means that clients 
want a clear understanding of how 
much they are paying, so they can 
assess whether they are receiving value 
for money from their asset managers. 
Our primary regulator is the Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK. In 
2017, the FCA published the final findings 
of its market study, which looked at 
competition in the UK fund management 
industry. We welcome the FCA’s drive 
towards transparency in fee charges 
and the focus on value to clients of 
the investment service provided. 
Demonstrating that they offer value 
for money will be increasingly important 
for active managers. 
Uncertainties facing our markets and 
investors
In addition to the trends outlined above, 
there are some uncertainties which 
could affect how our market operates 
or influence which market participants 
are successful. 
There is political uncertainty in a number 
of the countries in which we operate, 
including the outcome of the Brexit 
process. These uncertainties could result in 
unforeseen changes in government policy 
or the regulatory and legal framework for 
the fund management industry. These 
could also impact clients’ wealth and 
subsequent attitude towards savings and 
investment. 
Technology could also affect the 
way the industry operates. Artificial 
intelligence, machine learning, data 
and analytics have the potential to 
fundamentally change portfolio 
management. Technology may also 
have an increasing role in distribution 
and client services, for example by 
enabling precisely targeted marketing 
and messages to specific intermediaries, 
and providing digital services that allow 
advisers to self‑ serve and find answers 
to their common questions.
l l To take advantage of these trends, 
we need to focus on the agility and 
innovation that allow us to anticipate 
and meet client needs. This requires 
investment in our business to ensure 
we have systems that can sustain our 
growth, support different product 
types and allow us to operate 
efficiently and in compliance with 
regulations, as they evolve. We 
therefore continue to invest in our 
operating platform. We are also 
investing in new technologies, such as 
data analytics, to ensure we keep 
pace with technological change.
l l To ensure we continue to deliver for 
clients, as well as our people and 
shareholders, we need a governance, 
risk and control framework designed 
to support our growth. We continue 
to develop and evolve our internal 
processes in a way that recognises 
the importance of controls.
l l To deliver our strategic goals, we 
need the financial strength to continue 
to invest in the business, support our 
growth, and reward our people and 
increase returns to shareholders.
l l With shorter product lifecycles and 
the changing face of distribution 
partners and clients, it has become 
more critical that funds quickly 
achieve scale. To accelerate this 
process, we are proactively deploying 
more of our balance sheet as seed 
investments. We follow a highly 
disciplined process in deploying, 
redeeming and recycling such 
seed investment. 8
Strategic report
UNITED KINGDOM
The majority of our clients’ assets in the 
UK are held within our unit trusts, which 
are a standard UK mutual fund product. 
The wider UK mutual fund industry has 
£1.2trn of assets under management. 
As the chart below shows, holdings of 
mutual funds tend to be robust across 
the market cycle, with consistent demand 
for equity products as well as a growing 
appetite for fixed income products.
The UK is also an important location for 
global financial institutions which operate 
in the resilient and growing high net 
worth market. The pool of assets 
managed in the UK by members of The 
Investment Association is estimated to be 
in excess of £6.9trn, with a large 
proportion of these funds channelled 
through decision‑ making centres in 
London. Given the historic importance 
of London as a financial centre, and the 
supporting infrastructure and resources 
that have built up there, we do not 
believe that Brexit will fundamentally 
affect London’s importance, even if 
businesses relocate some operations 
to European centres.
The UK government encourages 
individuals to invest by providing 
tax‑ efficient vehicles, in the form of 
pension funds and Individual Savings 
Accounts (ISAs). Individuals can make 
tax‑ free contributions to their pension 
schemes within annual and lifetime 
limits, although these limits have been 
significantly reduced in recent years. 
Since 2016, individuals have had more 
freedom over how they use their pension 
pots at the point of retirement. This is 
creating demand for products that 
provide income, as an alternative 
to annuities.
ISAs currently allow individuals to invest 
£20,000 a year in cash, funds, bonds 
or shares, with any resulting income or 
capital gains being tax‑ free. Other forms 
of ISA have been introduced in recent 
years, which allow people to save to buy 
their first home or for retirement. These 
have much lower savings limits but 
receive government top ups to the 
amounts saved.
Longer lives mean that investing for 
retirement is also becoming more 
complex. Individuals now need to 
accumulate assets during their working 
lives and shift their investments to 
income‑ producing assets at the point 
of retirement. Once retired they need to 
continue to adjust their investments, to 
ensure they do not outlive their savings. 
Many people will also find themselves 
working at least part‑ time beyond their 
retirement dates. Fund management 
groups have an opportunity to develop 
new products to support all these 
different phases of retirement.
2017 was a notable year for asset 
flows in the UK, with all asset categories 
positive, but heightened demand for 
fixed income products and strategic 
bonds in particular. Total net inflows 
were £47.5bn, up from £8.4bn in the 
previous year when political uncertainty 
dampened clients’ investment appetite.

JUPITER’S POSITION
The UK is our core market, as it 
is home to the majority of our 
current clients. Our strong brand 
and historical presence, deep 
distribution and track record of 
outperformance after fees mean 
that we are well-positioned to 
continue to succeed.
Regardless of how our clients access 
our products, over the last decade, 
the UK market has evolved away 
from clients purchasing directly 
from fund managers. Instead, they 
purchase via intermediaries such 
as investment platforms or wealth 
managers. Relationships with 
increasingly professional distribution 
partners are critical to our success. 
Direct clients now form a low 
proportion of our asset base. 
Fee transparency and clear 
demonstration of value for money 
are critical to both distribution 
partners and clients. In early 2017, we 
proactively reviewed our unit trust 
pricing structure and, in anticipation, 
adopted an approach aligned with 
the objectives of the FCA’s market 
study, which will come into effect for 
2018. This means moving to a single 
price for buying and selling fund 
units, thereby eliminating ‘box profits’ 
earned by the Group. This is an 
important step in the evolution of 
our unit trust pricing structure, 
increasing transparency and further 
demonstrating the value we bring to 
clients. In addition, research costs 
previously borne by funds, and 
therefore clients, will now be borne 
by Jupiter without a consequential price 
change in the amounts we charge.

Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
INTERNATIONAL
Continental Europe includes a number 
of the world’s larger economies and 
has a substantial mutual fund market. 
Retail and private banks are the main 
distribution channels, followed by 
financial advisers, insurance companies, 
platforms and direct sales. Appetite for 
different products varies between 
countries but, in general, an environment 
of negative or very low real interest rates 
is pushing European investors away from 
traditional savings products based on 
cash returns and towards products 
that offer better returns. 
International fund managers have built 
good positions in many European markets, 
helped by passporting of UCITS, which 
are mutual funds that can be sold to any 
investor in the EU, under a harmonised 
regulatory regime. This enables fund 
managers to run funds on a cross‑ border 
basis, without needing a presence in 
each country where funds are domiciled. 
Assets in cross‑ border UCITS total 
€1.4trn, compared with €1.2trn at the 
end of 2016. Fixed income funds make 
up the largest proportion of these assets 
at 41% of the total. Equity and multi‑ asset 
funds represent 38% and 1 2% 
respectively. European cross‑ border net 
flows in 2017 were €127.4bn with positive 
flows into fixed income, equity and 
multi‑ asset funds.
After Europe, Asia is the second‑ largest 
cross‑ border mutual fund market in the 
world, with total cross‑ border mutual 
fund assets of £0.3trn. Hong Kong is the 
largest market in the region, followed 
by Taiwan and Singapore. While there 
is no common regional framework like 
European UCITS, there are moves 
towards mutual recognition of funds and 
regional passporting, which will further 
open up these markets. Since December 
2016, the Asia Region Funds Passport 
(ARFP) has been established and the 
ARFP Joint Committee has had a number 
of face‑ to‑ face meetings, published its 
first Annual Report and initiated a 
Pilot Program.
Distribution of our product types in 
Hong Kong is largely achieved through 
retail banks, while Singapore is 
dominated by private banks. Global 
financial institutions have a significant 
presence in the region, enabling mutual 
fund providers such as Jupiter to build 
on relationships developed in other 
markets. Although product preferences 
in Asia vary by country, fixed income 
and multi‑ asset funds have been most 
in demand across those markets in 2017. 
In addition, holding periods in Asian 
markets tend to be shorter than in the 
UK and Europe.

JUPITER’S POSITION
Diversifying the business, including 
by geography, continues to prove 
highly successful for Jupiter and we 
have a growing presence in both 
Europe and Asia. Our international 
strategy is primarily to continue 
to deepen our distribution in our 
existing markets, by building on 
existing relationships with 
distribution partners, targeting 
new intermediaries and continuing 
to expand the range of funds we 
offer internationally.
Jupiter has a UCITS passport, 
allowing us to act from our UK base 
as the management company for our 
Luxembourg‑ based SICAV range. In 
advance of the expected Brexit date 
in early 2019, we expect the 
management company activities for 
the SICAV will need to take place 
within a legal entity domiciled in 
Europe as we expect that, post Brexit, 
this will not be possible from the UK. 
Our project to achieve this is well 
advanced and will require a limited 
amount of restructuring of our legal 
entities during 2018, the identification 
of premises in Luxembourg and 
associated roles and activities that 
will be transferred to or created 
in Luxembourg.
A loss of delegation rights would 
require greater reorganisation; it is 
not currently clear whether this will 
be one of the outcomes of the Brexit 
negotiations and we consider this an 
unlikely outcome, but are monitoring 
developments very closely.

Strategic report
OUR BUSINESS
Jupiter’s business has six essential 
building blocks. Together, they 
allow us to balance and align 
the interests of our three core 
stakeholder groups – our clients, 
our shareholders and our people. 
While each building block addresses 
the interests of all our stakeholders, 
some have a primary focus on one 
particular stakeholder group. 
At all times, we look to act in the best 
interests of our clients, by helping them 
meet their long‑ term savings objectives 
and acting as stewards of their assets, 
as outlined in our corporate values.
In addition to our core stakeholders, we 
have a number of interested parties such 
as our regulators, business partners, the 
Government and society. Our approach 
to engaging with these parties is covered 
in the Corporate Responsibility section.

OUR BUSINESS MODEL 
INVESTMENT  
CAPABILITY AND  
CAPACITY
Primary focus: our clients
The essential part of acting in clients’ 
best interests is the delivery of 
value through long‑ term investment 
outperformance, after all fees. Our 
people and positive culture are central 
to this. As an active fund manager, 
we believe that talented investment 
professionals, who are free to pursue 
their own investment styles within a 
collegiate environment, can make a 
positive difference for clients. This allows 
us to combine the best aspects of 
boutique fund managers with the 
systems, processes and risk management 
framework that our scale provides.
With no ‘house view’ to constrain them, 
our fund managers actively seek the 
best investment opportunities through 
fundamental analysis and clear investment 
processes for their specific strategies, 
with a focus on good stewardship. We 
organise our investment professionals 
into strategy teams, so they can share 
ideas and information, while remaining 
individually accountable for the 
performance of their funds. 
The need for a track record can be 
a barrier to entry in the active fund 
management market, since it generally 
takes three years to build a track record 
that is attractive to certain clients or 
distribution partners. This is especially 
true of larger institutional clients and 
distribution partners. As a group, Jupiter 
has a reputation for delivering a strong 
investment track record, which helps us 
to attract and retain client assets.
Clients also benefit from our clear focus 
on active asset management; we have 
no distractions from this core purpose. 
Principal risks
Our ability to attract and retain critical 
staff, sustained market decline and 
sustained fund underperformance. 11

DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS,  
CHANNELS, CLIENTS AND  
GEOGRAPHIES
Primary focus: our clients
Our mutual fund clients are typically 
individual investors who require investment 
products to meet their savings and 
retirement needs and for whom the 
active returns we offer are key to 
achieving the income and growth which 
they are looking for. In many cases, 
these individuals also need financial 
planning advice, which is not part of 
Jupiter’s business model. Therefore, 
we do not engage with these investors 
directly. Instead, we access them through 
our distribution partners such as financial 
advisers and wealth managers. This 
intermediated approach, which is a 
feature of all the markets we operate in, 
is significantly more efficient for us than 
engaging directly with clients. It allows us 
to target our marketing and brand and 
develop strong relationships with our 
distribution partners, while maintaining a 
straightforward client service model.
Platforms are an important form of 
intermediation. These online services 
enable advisers and individuals to invest 
in selected funds from different providers, 
and to access consolidated reporting 
and analytics tools. In the UK, around 
67% of our annual gross flows into 
mutual funds are through platforms, up 
from 37% in 2010. We focus on building 
our relationships with the biggest platforms 
and making our funds available through 
them. Due to this change in distribution 
trends, our direct retail book now makes 
up only 8% of our overall assets.
There are also influential organisations in 
the mutual fund market, such as research 
consultants and rating agencies. Their 
recommendations affect the demand 
for our products. Jupiter works with 
them to ensure they fully understand 
our investment capabilities and related 
products and can make appropriate 
recommendations.
Institutions access our investment expertise 
through mutual funds, investment trusts 
and segregated mandates. The route 
to accessing and attracting institutions 
to our investment products is generally 
through investment advisers, who play an 
increasingly major role in helping their 
clients to select which fund managers to 
choose.
We continue to deepen our distribution 
in the UK, focusing on financial advisers 
and wealth managers. The Jupiter 
brand is highly recognised, giving us a 
competitive advantage in the UK market.
Our strong UK position provides a base 
for further growth. In overseas markets, 
we adopt a ‘follow the client’ approach, 
using our strong relationships with large 
fund distribution partners, such as 
international banks, to gain a foothold 
in new countries. Our relationships with 
these distribution partners enhance 
our credibility with other intermediaries, 
helping us to grow in each market 
over time.
Successful distribution requires products 
that appeal to clients in multiple 
countries and that can deliver superior 
returns over the medium‑ to‑ long term. 
We only look to launch products where 
we can differentiate ourselves as a form 
of competitive advantage. The breadth 
of our product range means that clients 
can choose products which meet their 
needs and suit current market conditions.
By providing value and strong service 
to our clients over the long term, we 
retain the assets entrusted to us and 
attract new assets, underpinning our 
revenue growth.
Principal risk
Ineffective product, client and 
geographic diversification.

FINANCIAL  
RESOURCES
Primary focus: our shareholders and people
Maintaining a resilient balance sheet 
helps ensure a sustainable business 
model for the benefit of all our 
stakeholders. Allied to the highly cash‑ generative nature of our profits, 
this gives us the financial resources and 
liquidity we need to invest for growth, 
take advantage of market opportunities 
and reward our people and shareholders. 
Maintaining the right balance between 
these competing demands on our 
financial resources ensures we are 
equipped with the tools we need for 
value creation and business growth. 
We consistently apply the following 
model to guide the balance of distribution 
between staff and shareholders.
We generate profit and cash as follows:
Net revenue*
Net revenues are the fees we earn, 
less payments to our distribution partners 
for their services to clients. Fees are 
typically based on a percentage of 
assets, although some funds earn 
performance fees for above‑ target 
returns. By attracting inflows across the 
cycle and outperforming against the 
market, we are well‑ positioned for net 
management fee growth year on year.
Operating expenses*
Operating expenses comprise salaries 
and the costs of running our operating 
platform and support infrastructure, 
including the costs of outsourced service 
providers. Such costs include IT systems, 
rent, administration and brand 
investment.
As we continue to grow, we will continue 
to invest in and maintain our operating 
model, as well as acquiring new talent 
across the business. As a people 
business, these investments are generally 
recognised as expenses in the profit and 
loss account.
Available profit*
Deducting operating expenses from net 
revenue leaves us with available profit 
for distribution to our people and our 
shareholders. Our high conversion rate 
of available profits to cash ensures we 
have sufficient liquidity to do so, while 
maintaining our resilient and sustainable 
balance sheet.
Remuneration is one tool we use to 
attract, retain and motivate the high‑ performing staff we need. Paying 
variable compensation out of available 
profits aligns their interests with those 
of our shareholders.
The rewards of profitability and growth 
are shared with our investors through 
ordinary dividends, supplemented by 
special dividends which vary as our 
earnings vary. We ensure 
the sustainability of our delivery to 
shareholders of the ordinary dividends 
by running a sustainable balance 
sheet over the cycle. This balance 
sheet approach is designed to provide 
investors with progressive returns from 
the ordinary dividend as well as 
giving us a comfortable surplus over 
and above our legal or regulatory 
capital requirements. 
Around half of available profit is paid 
to shareholders as ordinary and 
special dividends. Under our progressive 
dividend policy, we target an ordinary 
payout ratio of 50% of underlying 
earnings per share. We pay special 
dividends out of available profits after 
a modest retention for capital purposes. 
Taking into account the amounts due to 
tax authorities and the amounts retained 
for capital purposes, the relative share of 
available profit between staff and 
shareholders is guided by the 
proportions depicted in this graphic.
Model for available profit 
distribution
Variable staﬀ compensation <30% 
Corporation tax 13%-15%
Dividend payments 
to shareholders ~50%
Capital retention <10%
Balance sheet and seed investment 
The Group actively manages its balance 
sheet positions to maintain appropriate 
levels of liquidity. A high percentage 
of earnings from the Group’s operations 
result in cash inflows, enabling us to 
meet our liabilities as they fall due 
and seed investments in our own funds. 
Our liquidity position also gives us the 
ability to pay out the majority of our 
post‑ tax earnings to our shareholders 
as dividends whilst retaining a 
comfortable regulatory capital surplus.
 
In 2017, we expanded our seed 
investment programme, extending its size, 
scope and making it more dynamic. This 
programme assists new fund launches 
and existing funds to enable them to 
reach scale and increase their 
marketability. There are rigorous internal 
controls for the allocation, placing and 
redemption of seed investment.
Principal risks
Failure to deliver strategy, sustained 
market decline and sustained fund 
underperformance.

Performance Measures (see page 31 for the relevant

OPERATING  
MODEL AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE
Primary focus: our clients, shareholders 
and people
Our operating model aims to ensure that 
as much of our growth in revenues as 
possible drops through to available profit 
and operating cash flow. 
Operating an efficient platform is 
critical to this. In addition to providing 
operational leverage, our platform 
enables us to expand distribution, allows 
fund managers to work effectively and 
supports the addition of new products 
and investment strategies. 
We continually invest in our platform 
to ensure it meets the needs of our 
business as it grows and supports our 
regulatory compliance. Our significant 
investment in 2017 will, over time, deliver 
efficiencies and more operating scale, 
facilitating further growth through a 
standardised approach to running the 
platform. We have also invested to 
ensure we comply with new regulations, 
notably MiFID II. Investment in our 
platform to support our growth and 
diversification strategies will continue 
in 2018.
Principal risks
Failure to enhance operating platform 
to support future business requirements, 
failure of critical outsource partner.
TALENT  
AND  
CULTURE
Primary focus: our clients and people 
Jupiter has an established reputation for 
attracting talented individuals in all areas 
of the business.
We nurture our fund management talent 
to develop their capabilities and ensure 
we have succession plans to advance 
talented managers. We balance this with 
bringing in new people with specialist 
skills, giving us strength and depth 
as well as enabling us to expand the 
breadth of investment strategies we offer.
We invest in all our people through 
training and development, and look 
to maintain high levels of engagement 
and strong communication. We value 
the differences between people, 
which promote different viewpoints 
and diversity of thought, helping us 
to innovate and make better decisions 
for our clients.
Our culture is underpinned by a set 
of values, which help our people to 
understand how to drive change through 
their behaviour. 
Principal risk
Ability to attract and retain critical staff.
GOVERNANCE,  
RISK AND  
CONTROL
Primary focus: our clients, shareholders 
and people
Our governance, risk and control (GRC) 
framework is critical to our success. It 
ensures we protect the interests of our 
clients, people and shareholders, and 
that we meet their expectations of us. It 
also ensures that we are proactive in 
meeting all new regulatory requirements.
We have invested significantly in our 
GRC environment in recent years, so it 
remains fit for purpose as the business 
grows and new regulations are introduced. 
We continue to enhance our governance, 
process and controls, and to evolve the 
management information and reporting 
that supports our decision‑ making.
Principal risks

OUR STRATEGY
Jupiter’s purpose is to 
help investors meet their 
long-term investment 
objectives. 
Since listing, Jupiter has followed a 
consistent strategy which has successfully 
diversified and grown the Group.
During the year, we undertook a detailed 
review of the strategy in the context of 
the performance over the last five years, 
the evolution of clients’ needs, markets 
and competitors, as well as the 
continued state of change, disruption 
and uncertainty around us. As a result 
of this review, we have reaffirmed the 
strategic direction and focus on three 
strategic objectives:
1
Deliver outperformance after fees 
to our clients. This directly contributes  
to increasing our clients’ wealth.
2
Sell this expertise through products 
suited to our distribution strengths. 
By growing the range of products we 
offer and expanding their distribution,  
we can help more people to achieve 
their savings goals.
3
Deliver attractive returns to 
shareholders. By ensuring we remain 
a strong, efficient and profitable business, 
we will be able to meet our clients’ 
needs for the long term which creates a 
sustainable business for our shareholders.
To achieve our reaffirmed strategic 
objectives, we need to continue to invest 
in the development of our six building 
blocks and implement our strategic plans 
for each, as set out here. 
Each of our building blocks supports one 
or more of our objectives. We track our 
progress towards our objectives using 
the key performance indicators set out in 
the Strategic Delivery section on pages 
16 and 17. 15

There is a risk that our clients will not 
meet their investment objectives, due to 
poor relative performance by one or 
more of our funds over a prolonged 
period.
Potential impact
Weak financial markets specific to our 
funds or poor performance by our 
fund managers may lead to our 
products being uncompetitive or 
otherwise unattractive to new or 
existing clients. This could result in 
clients not receiving their desired 
investment outcomes, outflows from 
Jupiter (and the related decline in 
revenues) and a failure to attract new 
business and thus not meet our 
strategic growth objectives.
Mitigation/controls
Jupiter maintains a diversified range of 
flexible investment products, and aims 
to deliver long‑ term value to our clients 
across different market conditions. Our 
investment process seeks to meet 
investment targets within clearly stated 
risk parameters.
Our Investment Risk team works closely 
with fund managers to challenge fund 
risk profiles, assess the risks across the 
portfolios and to further develop our 
capabilities. This challenge process is 
formally reported to, and overseen by, 
our Risk Committee, which meets 
quarterly (and more frequently when 
required).
2017 impact
We continued to enhance our 
investment, risk management and 
research capabilities in 2017 through 
the expansion and development of our 
investment management teams.
81% of our mutual fund AUM achieved 
above medium returns over a three‑ year period (47% over one year). 
Looking ahead, the generally strong 
investment performance experienced in 
2015 will need to be replicated in 2018 
to maintain strong three‑ year 
performance figures.
The risk of failure to achieve our 
strategic objectives, through internal or 
external factors, which would impair 
our ability to deliver value to our 
stakeholders.
Potential impact
A failure to achieve one or more 
strategic objectives could result in a 
reduced pool of available profit for 
distribution to shareholders. This would 
limit growth and potentially long‑ term 
viability.
Mitigation/controls
The Board sets the strategy and is 
responsible for ensuring the Group has 
the right structure, leadership and 
culture to execute it. 
The Board and the Executive Committee 
regularly review the strategic options, 
opportunities and threats. Plans, 
budgets and targets are set to be 
aligned with delivery of the strategic 
goals. Progress is monitored and where 
necessary corrective action is taken.
2017 impact
We continued to deliver on our 
strategic objectives by further 
diversifying client type, product and 
geographic reach. 
In 2017 we undertook a comprehensive 
review of our strategy where we looked 
in detail at achievements to date as 
well as the challenges facing our 
industry as we look ahead. We 
reaffirmed our strategy as a high 
conviction active fund manager and 
established strategic goals and an 
underpinning financial plan compatible 
with these goals.
The risk of failure to attract or retain 
the people critical to successfully 
delivering investment outperformance 
to our clients and all other aspects of 
our strategy.
Potential impact
The unplanned departure of a member 
of our leadership team could lead to 
significant redemptions from our funds, 
failure to deliver our strategy or failure 
to run our business efficiently, resulting 
in a material impact on corporate 
performance.
Mitigation/controls
Our culture is a key differentiator for 
us, enabling us to attract, motivate and 
retain talented individuals, which in turn 
drives outperformance. We give 
autonomy coupled with personal 
accountability, and encourage 
independence of thought and 
challenge. Our investment function is 
arranged around 12 strategies, 
providing a framework for repeatable 
performance, but the teams themselves 
are small and nimble. This culture and 
structure gives us clarity of purpose 
and helps us to attract and retain the 
best active fund managers. We actively 
manage succession and transition.
We believe that high levels of 
engagement and equity ownership 
encourage our people to take personal 
responsibility for their work and to 
strive to enhance our business. We 
maintain a remuneration philosophy 
and approach that continues to 
promote a strong culture of 
performance and alignment of 
employees’ and shareholder interests.
2017 impact
We have continued to invest in our 
people, expanding our fixed income 
and emerging market debt capabilities 
and adding to our distribution resource 
across a number of key markets to 
ensure we can deliver both a high level 
of service to existing clients and attract 
new business.
The risk that our product range, 
distribution partnerships, client type or 
geographic diversification are 
ineffective at growing AUM particularly 
in light of continued change and 
disruption in the competitive landscape.
Potential impact
Our ability to generate fund inflows 
and prevent outflows may be 
jeopardised by fundamental changes in 
distribution patterns or by a sustained 
market preference for products we do 
not offer. This would have a detrimental 
impact on profitability and shareholder 
value.
Mitigation/controls
We continually analyse our markets to 
ensure we maintain a diverse product 
suite that appeals to existing and 
potential clients. We focus on 
investment outperformance after fees. 
In response to the rising demand and 
supply of passive investment products, 
we focus on the clear differentiation of 
our active strategies and routes to 
markets where active solutions are in 
strong demand. Our well‑ defined 
product development process enables 
us to deliver new products or 
enhancements, so we can target client 
groups in a timely and efficient way. 
We continue to diversify our client 
base, distribution partners, geographies 
and channels.
2017 impact
Our strategy of diversifying by client, 
product and geography continued in 
2017. 
Expansion of our distribution channels 
and geographies successfully 
contributed towards increasing 
diversification of inflows.
We launched a number of new 
products in 2017 for both UK and 
international clients to enhance our 
product diversification and offering to 
enable future growth.
The Board has ultimate 
responsibility for risk 
management.
To help the Board discharge its 
responsibilities, the Group has a 
comprehensive approach to identifying, 
monitoring, managing and mitigating risk, 
which is described in the Governance 
Framework section. 
Our Enterprise Risk Management 
framework clearly defines essential 
information about the Group’s risks and 
provides a process for escalation through 
our governance structure, which enables 
continuous and robust oversight by the 
Audit and Risk Committee and the Board.
Risk appetite
An important part of the Board’s remit is 
to determine our risk appetite and the 
tolerances within which we must operate. 
This is defined as the amount and type 
of risk we are willing to accept in order 
to achieve our strategic and business 
objectives. This takes into account the 
interests of our customers and 
shareholders, as well as capital and 
other regulatory requirements.
The Board formally considers our risk 
appetite, taking into account our 
strategic plans, the business environment 
and the current and likely future 
condition of our business and operations. 
The Board sets our appetite for seven 
categories of risk. These are:
l l Strategic risk
l l Investment risk
l l Operational risk
l l Capital adequacy risk
l l Liquidity risk
l l Credit/counterparty risk
l l Market risk
Definitions of these categories can be found 
in the Governance Framework section.
Risk overview
The Group is exposed to various risks, 
such as investment and operational, in 
pursuing its business objectives. These 
can be driven by internal and external 
factors. Understanding and managing 
these risks is both a business imperative 
and a regulatory requirement.
The type and severity of these risks can 
change quickly in a complex and 
competitive environment. The framework 
is dynamic and forward looking to 
ensure it considers both current and 
emerging risks which could potentially 
impact the Group.
Emerging risk
Emerging risks are considered a 
condition, situation or trend that could 
significantly affect the Groups financial 
strength, competitive position or 
reputation within the next five years.  
These are raised by the business and 
challenged by Executive risk owners to 
consider estimates of likelihood, impact 
and timing.
Key risk themes/impacts
As a business, we have a relatively low 
appetite for risk, particularly for those 
that could lead to negative regulatory, 
conduct and reputational outcomes.
Conduct risk
The Group defines conduct risks as risks 
which result in customer detriment, 
negative impact to market stability or 
restrict effective competition. Conduct 
risk is not considered a separate risk 
category. Risks in the strategic, investment 
and operational risk categories may 
result in conduct risk impacts.
Reputational risk
The risk of loss or other adverse impact 
arising from the unfavourable perception 
of the Group on the part of clients, 
counterparties, employees, regulators, 
shareholders, other stakeholders, the 
media or the general public. The Group 
treats reputational risk as a potential 
impact that may arise from operational 
risks and operational risk incidents.
Risk management process
Our risk management process identifies 
the most significant risks we face. All 
these risks have a named owner, which  
is either a member of the Executive 
Committee (ExCo) or, for a small number 
of risks, the ExCo as a whole. We define 
the potential impact of each key risk and 
monitor it using key risk indicators (KRIs). 
We set thresholds for each KRI and use 
them to keep the Board informed about 
the Group’s position in relation to its risk 
appetite. This enables us to identify 
trends and take action if it seems likely 
we will exceed this appetite.
The following section shows our 
assessment of the top 10 risks that we 
face, along with the Board’s rating of 
each risk and how the significance of the 
risk has changed during the year. All our 
top risks fall into the investment, strategic 
and operational categories. These risks 
are not static, new and emerging risks 
are considered and assessed by the 
Board throughout the year for inclusion 
in this list.

The risk of a severe market and 
economic downturn which affects all 
fund managers and all asset types 
across all geographic markets.
Potential impact
A secular downturn could result in a 
reduction in assets under management 
leading to a decline in revenue and 
capital levels. There may be additional 
outflows as investors switch to non‑ financial assets.
Mitigation/controls
Our investment philosophy allows our 
fund managers to pursue their own 
investment styles and the flexibility to 
adjust strategies as far as possible to 
retain value during unfavourable market 
conditions. We have a broad range of 
investment strategies which enables us 
to offer products suitable for different 
market conditions.
We regularly review our discretionary 
expenditure and cost base to ensure 
sustainability. Our strong capital position 
and relatively low cost base means we 
are well placed to cope with this risk.
2017 impact
Our assessment of capital adequacy in 
2017 included the modelling of five 
stress tests to ensure that the Group 
remained adequately capitalised under 
severe but plausible conditions. The 
analysis concluded that we could 
continue to pay dividends and would 
remain adequately capitalised over the 
three‑ year planning horizon without 
needing to raise additional capital.
Increased diversification by product 
strategy and asset class has reduced 
our exposure to market direction.
Markets continued to rise in 2017 
building on the strong performance 
experienced in 2016. The risk of a 
market correction is therefore 
considered more likely and we have 
increased the risk rating to Medium.
Due to the uncertainty regarding the 
implications of Brexit, the risk that we 
are not ready to comply with post‑ Brexit requirements which could restrict 
our ability to operate within the EU.
Potential impact
An unexpected change in regulation 
(for example, the loss of delegation 
rights from our fund management 
function in London), could mean that 
we are not operationally ready to 
comply with post‑ Brexit requirements 
which delays our ability to manage, 
distribute and market our funds to 
investors in EU countries. This could 
result in reduced inflows and increased 
outflows over the period. 
Mitigation/controls
In advance of Brexit, we have 
substantive plans to relocate the 
Management Company activities for 
the SICAV product range to a legal 
entity domiciled in Europe.
Throughout the current period of 
uncertainty, we are maintaining close 
dialogue and communication lines with 
both UK and EU regulators to ensure 
we remain aware of and responsive to 
the latest industry guidance with the 
support of specialist experts.
2017 impact
The Brexit Working Group, established 
in 2016, has been working with senior 
representatives from across the 
business and specialist industry experts 
to develop a plan that we believe 
ensures we are well‑ positioned to 
continue to operate within the EU with 
minimal disruption. 
Significant progress was made on the 
design of the proposed Management 
Company, selection of a preferred 
location and preparation of the 
regulatory application. We rate the risk 
as medium in recognition of the short 
timeframe to implement and the 
ongoing uncertainty with fund 
management delegation rights.
We could suffer a material error 
executing a key business process, or 
from our systems or business premises 
being unavailable.
Potential impact
A significant error or breach of a client 
agreement may result in additional 
costs to redress the issue and could 
lead to outflows. The unavailability of 
our key systems or business premises 
could mean we are unable to act on 
behalf of our clients and/or perform 
other time‑ critical activities to ensure 
the smooth running of our business.
Mitigation/controls
We have efficient and well‑ controlled 
processes and maintain a 
comprehensive Enterprise Risk 
Management framework as described 
in detail in the Governance review. We 
have continuity and business 
resumption planning in place to support 
our critical activities. We have 
implemented remote working, including 
core system access for all our essential 
staff if they cannot travel to our offices. 
If our normal business systems or 
premises become unavailable, we have 
alternative premises including a 
dedicated office suite equipped with all 
of our critical business systems.
2017 impact
A Governance, Risk and Controls 
programme was initiated in early 2017 
to review the Group’s organisational 
design, corporate governance, controls, 
management information and 
preparations for compliance with the 
requirements of SMCR.
The Group continues to work to 
formalise its control environment 
through the further development of its 
processes and the depth of its controls. 
During 2017 this was evidenced by 
business process mapping reviews 
being conducted across the investment 
lifecycle and CASS oversight processes 
to improve effectiveness and efficiency.
The failure or non‑ performance of a 
third party provider who we rely on for 
business processing may lead to us 
failing to deliver the required service to 
our clients and/or regulatory non‑ compliance.
Potential impact
Our relationships with stakeholders may 
be jeopardised if we provide 
inadequate service, resulting in the loss 
of clients or regulatory or financial 
censure and negative financial 
consequences.
Mitigation/controls
We subject all third parties who provide 
us with critical services to a high level 
of ongoing oversight, through our 
established Supplier Management 
framework, giving us assurance that 
they meet our required standards. 
Jupiter has formal guidelines for 
managing and overseeing all third‑ party relationships, ensuring they 
receive a level of scrutiny that reflects 
their potential risk to our business. 
2017 impact
One of our critical suppliers is rated as 
high risk as a consequence of our 
overall assessment. We have engaged 
extensively with that supplier during 
2017 to ensure that appropriate 
remedial action is being taken. This has 
resulted in a number of improvements 
such that the operational service 
received is now generally good and 
the overall level of risk has been 
reduced.
The risk rating nevertheless remains as 
high while work continues with this 
supplier to ensure that the progress 
achieved is fully embedded and 
sustained over time.
The risk that a successful cyber‑ attack 
or fraud attempt could result in the loss 
of clients’ assets or data or cause 
significant disruption to key systems.
Potential impact
A significant attack could undermine 
client confidence in our ability to 
safeguard assets, which could affect 
our ability to retain existing clients and 
attract new business. This could drive 
negative financial consequences.
Mitigation/controls
We commit considerable human and 
technological resources to preventing a 
cyber security incident. Our server 
environments are housed in two data 
centres provided by a specialist third 
party and offer fully resilient and 
secure facilities. We have established a 
security awareness programme to 
extend knowledge and understanding 
within the business. Jupiter applies best 
practices from the ISO 27001 controls 
framework with additional reference to 
SANS Critical Security Controls in order 
to prioritise our technology defences. 
We have produced an extensive Cyber 
Security Incident Response plan to 
ensure departmental heads can 
adequately respond to the growing 
threat of cyber crime.
2017 impact
We integrated Threat Intelligence and 
monitoring with an industry leading 
Managed Services Security Provider 
and further enhanced our Cyber 
defence layers by deploying multiple 
machine learning and behavioural 
modelling systems to detect advanced 
threats.
The Cyber Essentials Plus accreditation 
in 2017 was successfully maintained.
The risk that changes in regulation 
restrict or impact our ability to do 
business or that we fail to implement 
changes required to meet new 
regulatory requirements.
Potential impact
Our ability to do or support our 
business may be inhibited, which could 
lead to negative financial 
consequences. Regulatory censure and 
the related negative publicity could 
damage our clients’ confidence in us 
and affect our ability to generate new 
business.
Mitigation/controls
We continually monitor regulatory 
developments to assess potential 
business implications. We invest in the 
expertise, systems and process change 
necessary to enable compliance with 
regulatory requirements by the required 
dates. We maintain a robust 
compliance culture and require all 
relevant employees to undertake 
training on regulatory matters. Our 
Compliance department’s monitoring 
programme ensures we adhere to 
regulatory controls.
2017 impact
We continued to invest substantial time 
and resource throughout 2017 into our 
main regulatory project, MiFID II. Jupiter 
met its regulatory obligations under 
MiFID II by the 2018 effective date. We 
have put in place appropriate 
procedures and controls which will 
enable monitoring of our ongoing 
compliance with MiFID II. One direct 
impact of MiFID II was the Group’s 
decision to bear research costs 
incurred on behalf of funds in its own 
corporate income statement from 2018.
Good progress was made in 
preparation for GDPR and SMCR. 21

Jupiter’s primary

As an active manager, we believe that 
measuring the performance of our 
mutual funds against other comparable 
managers and funds is the best way of 
measuring our competitive advantage. 
Clients typically see three years as the 
key period for measuring investment 
performance and we use this time 
period as our primary measure. 
At 31 December 2017, 81% (2016: 75%
1
) 
of our mutual fund AUM delivered 
above‑ median performance over three 
years, including 38% achieving first 
quartile performance. Over one year, 
47% (2016: 54%
1
) of our mutual fund AUM 
delivered above‑ median performance.
Jupiter continually reviews the reporting 
of investment performance to provide 
the most meaningful picture of our 
competitive position within the 
industry. During 2017 we refreshed 
our methodology which broadened 
coverage of the asset base.
Our strategy of diversifying by product 
type has supported our investment 
performance. The chart to the 
right shows three‑ year investment 
performance for our 13 biggest funds, 
each of which has more than £1bn of 
assets. Bond, equity, alternatives and 
multi‑ asset funds all contributed to our 
strong investment performance this year. 
A number of these high‑ performing 
areas have benefited from our 
recruitment of fund management 
expertise in recent years.
In addition to the strong performance by 
our mutual funds, we delivered strong 
performance against benchmark in our 
segregated mandates and investment 
trusts. Unlike mutual funds, there is no 
industry‑ wide data to record performance 
against peers for these assets, but 
comparing returns against the benchmark 
determines whether the Group is meeting 
performance targets agreed with investors 
and is therefore considered a suitable 
proxy. Over three years, 57% of AUM in 
segregated mandates and 75% of AUM 
in investment trusts were above benchmark.
We continued to enhance our investment 
capabilities in the year. In particular, 
we expanded our fixed income 
capability, building on the success of 
the Dynamic Bond Fund over the last 
five years. Global emerging market debt 
(EMD) has been our first area of focus. 
We have recruited a team and launched 
Corporate Bond and Short Duration 
Bond funds, which have made an 
encouraging start. The EMD team is 
fully integrated into our fixed income 
capability, enabling an active exchange 
of ideas between fund managers and 
analysts across sectoral and regional 
specialisms. In fixed income, we have 
continued to add to our research team 
and promoted two of our analysts to 
assistant fund manager roles.
We see increasing interest in alternative 
products among retail and wholesale 
investors, in the UK and internationally, 
which has been reflected in our alternative 
AUM doubling in 2017. We now have four 
funds in this asset class and, following 
the recruitment of a Head of Investments 
for alternatives towards the end of last 
year, we intend to further expand our 
alternatives capability. In February 2018, 
we announced the hire of a Head of 
Strategy in Multi‑ Asset to lead our strategic 
plans to offer investment capabilities for 
our retail, wealth and institutional client 
base globally. 
In early 2017, we announced that from 
2018 Jupiter would bear the costs of 
research previously borne by the funds. 
We engaged throughout the year with 
our research providers to contract for 
the research we need, focusing on those 
providers that add the most value for 
our clients. By the year end, the majority 
of our research providers were signed 
up, putting us in a strong position to 
ensure we receive the service we need. 
High‑ quality research is an essential 
input to our active fund management 
process. We intend to continue to be a 
consumer of such research provided by 
external analysts, coupled with our 
existing internal analytical capabilities 
and commissioning of academic and 
other research.
1 We have restated the 2016 three‑ year comparative from 66% and the one‑ year comparative from 55%, to reflect 
an update in our internal investment performance methodology, which increased the proportion of AUM covered 
by the measure.

DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS,  
CHANNELS, CLIENTS AND  
GEOGRAPHIES
An important trend in 
2017 was the continued 
blurring of the 
distinction between  
the retail, wealth and 
wholesale channels. 
This results from our distribution 
partners changing the ways in which 
they characterise themselves and 
engage with clients. This creates 
opportunities for us to support them 
more creatively through our strong 
relationship‑ based model, with new 
products and client service solutions.
PERFORMANCE
Turning investment outperformance 
into fund flows drives our growth in 
AUM, which in turn drives our financial 
performance. In 2017, we received net 
inflows of £5.5bn. This represented a 
significant increase compared with 2016, 
when political and economic uncertainty 
restrained our clients.
The table below breaks down our net 
flows by product type. The largest inflows 
to our mutual funds came in the fixed 
income, alternatives and global emerging 
markets strategies, demonstrating the 
benefits of our product diversification.
Net inflows/(outflows)

Multi asset (440) (1,302)
Other 296 (315)
UK equities (150) (64)
5,478 1,047
Net fund sales grew in the UK in 2017, 
with inflows to a broad range of fund 
types, including absolute return, strategic 
bond and emerging markets, more than 
offsetting outflows from the more mature 
fund of funds products. 
Our international operations continued 
to contribute significantly to our growth, 
providing 75% of our net fund sales 
this year. All of our European markets 
delivered net inflows, with strong 
demand in fixed income as well as 
alternatives and European equities. 
The attractiveness of our fixed income 
products helped our newer offices 
in Italy and Spain to exceed our 
expectations for the year, supported 
by highly experienced distribution leaders 
on the ground and a multi‑ lingual 
London‑ centred service model. Demand 
for our fixed income and multi‑ asset 
strategies led to strong inflows in Asia, 
primarily in Hong Kong and Singapore.
Market and exchange rate movements, 
coupled with the benefit of our investment 
outperformance, increased our AUM by 
£4.2bn during the year. At the year end, 
our total AUM stood at £50.2bn, up 24% 
from the end of 2016. Of this, our SICAV 
AUM stood at £14.1bn at 31 December 
2017, up from £9.4bn at the end of 2016, 
showing the continued success of our 
geographical diversification.

ENHANCING DISTRIBUTION 
AND SERVICE
In the UK, the retail and wealth channels 
are consolidating, as distributors acquire 
each other. These channels are converging, 
for example as these advisory practices 
launch their own funds. We see these 
organisations behaving more like 
institutions, such as using independent 
consultants and third‑ party research 
and support. 
Jupiter is responding to these trends in 
a number of ways. We are increasingly 
positioning ourselves as strategic 
partners to our UK retail and wealth 
distribution partners. Our retail and 
wealth teams are working together to 
help them understand our capabilities 
and performance, engage them in new 
product design and support them with 
high‑ quality service. This encourages our 
partners to broaden the range of Jupiter 
products they offer. We also look to 
align ourselves with those distribution 
partners who are growing most quickly. 
For example, the creation of increasingly 
large networks of financial advisers 
allows us to efficiently influence many 
advisers at once, through their central 
decision makers. In addition, we also 
work closely with ratings agencies. This 
changing landscape also makes it more 
important to offer the right solutions to 
our distribution partners and clients. The 
investments we have made across the 
business will help us to meet these 
demands in the future.
In 2017, we further developed our 
institutional proposition, where we see 
good prospects in the medium term, 
both in the UK and internationally. We 
recruited a Global Head of Institutional 
and refined our institutional offer, which 
includes identifying the most appropriate 
investment capabilities, developing our 
marketing materials and starting to 
take that offer to market. In an early 
success, we leveraged an existing 
consultant relationship in the UK to win 
a global mandate.
In Europe, we have continued to work 
with key asset allocators such as private 
banks, to broaden the range of Jupiter 
products they offer to their clients. We 
also made further progress with 
diversifying our distribution in selected 
markets, as we expanded in the retail 
channel in Germany and began to target 
IFA‑ style networks in Italy.
In our Asian markets, we increased 
our presence in the Hong Kong retail 
channel, gaining traction with key retail 
players and signing agreements with 
a number of smaller banks. We also 
invested significantly in brand and 
product building in Hong Kong, running a 
successful outdoor advertising campaign. 
In Singapore, we continued to develop 
in the private bank and high‑ net‑ worth 
markets, and increased brand awareness 
through a digital marketing campaign. 
Thailand offers significant growth 
potential and we entered the market 
through an agency relationship, which is 
already producing inflows. We also see 
good prospects in the institutional market 
in Asia in the medium term.
Other growth initiatives during the year 
included hiring an agent to represent 
us in Latin America, where many of the 
distribution partners are global banks 
with whom we already have strong 
relationships. 24

TALENT  
AND  
CULTURE
Jupiter is a people 
business; only through 
them can we achieve 
our objectives.
We aim to maximise the potential and 
performance of our people and recruit 
other talented people to strengthen the 
pool of talent we already have.
In May 2017, we ran our latest employee 
engagement survey, which achieved a 
response rate of 78%. Results were 
strong, with an overall engagement 
score of 87%, 11 points above the 
financial services average. Among the 
top results, our people said they had 
a clear understanding of what Jupiter 
is trying to achieve and how they 
contribute to it, a strong sense of 
treating clients fairly, and management 
who communicated clearly and treated 
their teams with respect.
The survey also highlighted areas where 
we can improve, and these inform our 
people‑ related plans for 2018 and 
beyond, which are described below. 
Implementing these plans will help ensure 
that our people strategy supports our 
overall business strategy.
We will continue to enhance the 
capabilities of line managers with 
ongoing training and development. 
We have developed a pilot programme 
covering high‑ impact leadership and a 
second programme for people who have 
become managers for the first time. We 
are also helping our managers manage 
their teams effectively, with a focus on 
improving management and personal 
development conversations around 
performance. In addition to our 
management development programmes, 
we have designed a comprehensive core 
curriculum of learning and development 
which is available to all of our people. 
This will help us support our employees’ 
personal development and enrich their 
roles through career progression or 
moves into different roles that enhance 
their skills and experience. This helps 
our people to achieve their potential 
within Jupiter.
Succession planning is also important for 
bringing people through the organisation. 
By the end of 2017, we had completed 
succession plans for the top three layers 
of the workforce. This allows us to 
identify and fill any gaps, including 
moving people between departments 
to broaden their skills, providing us 
with stronger bench strength across all 
functions. Other programmes of work for 
2018 will include developing a new 
induction programme for joining 
employees to ensure they understand 
our culture, value and strategy, a review 
of the benefits we offer our people, 
and an increase in the talent resourcing 
conducted in‑ house, rather than through 
external agencies.
We continue to participate in Investment 
2020, which provides opportunities for 
young people to join Jupiter from a 
diverse range of backgrounds. We are 
also looking at how we can utilise the 
apprenticeship levy to provide additional 
training for people in the organisation.
Diversity and inclusion mean having the 
right people, regardless of background, 
ethnicity or gender, in the right roles. 
We are committed to increasing diversity 
within Jupiter and promoting mutual 
understanding between our employees. 
This is clearly stated in our Diversity 
Policy which is published on our intranet 
and provides clear goals and measures.
Creating a diverse mix of younger 
people joining the firm is an important 
contributor to improving diversity over 
time. Jupiter is a founding member of the 
Diversity Project. This is an industry‑ wide 
body which looks to create an inclusive 
culture within the investment industry 
through a number of work streams in 
which Jupiter participates, eg improving 
maternity return rates. The importance 
of this initiative is that we are able to 
contribute to and leverage the work 
done as an industry collectively to move 
the dial more quickly than if all firms 
acted independently.
An important analysis of employee 
diversity is by gender (excluding 
contractors), which is shown in the table 
below:
2017 2016
At 31 December Female Male Female Male
Board 5 5 5 4
Senior 
management 11 71 9 63
Other 
employees 168 233 169 218
Total 184 309 183 285
Jupiter rewards employees equally for 
doing equivalent jobs, at the same 
level of performance and experience. 
However, our gender pay gap – the 
percentage male employees overall are 
paid more than female employees – 
was 38% on a mean basis at April 2017, 
slightly more than the 34% average for 
the finance services sector
1
. The gap is 
due to our workforce structure, in 
particular because we have more senior 
men in our fund management and sales 
teams. This is a structural issue across 
the industry. We seek to address this gap 
by attracting more young women in to 
the industry, having a gender mix in our 
recruitment shortlists, providing support, 
mentoring and development, and looking 
to engage and retain women within 
the business. Jupiter’s full Gender Pay 
Disclosure, including more information 
on how we are seeking to address it, 
can be found online on our website at 
www.jupiteram.com.
OUR VALUES
Jupiter’s values encapsulate our culture 
and are aligned to the strategy. As we 
continue to grow, we need to make sure 
that we reinforce our values through our 
induction processes and how we behave 
and operate every day. We also recognise 
that the talented people who join us 
bring their own perspectives, which make 
a positive contribution to Jupiter’s culture.

OPERATING  
MODEL AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE
Jupiter’s growth  
in scale and the 
diversification in  
the business adds 
complexity and 
requires continual 
investment in the 
operating model. 
We run an efficient operating model 
and infrastructure. This requires 
continuous investment in technology, 
process and people to ensure it remains 
fit for purpose as our business grows 
and diversifies and to meet developing 
regulatory requirements. We continually 
optimise this infrastructure investment to 
ensure it is efficient. A single, business‑ wide platform with the capacity to 
support growth, whilst satisfying 
increased regulatory control, ensures 
that as much of the revenue growth as 
possible drives growth in earnings and 
therefore shareholder returns. In ensuring 
this is the case, we continually monitor 
the forecast development of key metrics 
including the cost/income ratio to inform 
our decisions on the pace and extent of 
investment spending. Over the last five 
years, our cost/income ratio has been 
stable.
2017 has seen a focus on transformational 
change in investment operations with the 
implementation of a new investment 
management platform and the 
streamlining of investment data flows. 
This provides enhanced tools to our fund 
managers and investment risk function, 
adding the capability to support 
continued business growth and 
diversification. It has also streamlined the 
sharing of data across business functions, 
which helps us to make well‑ informed 
decisions that ultimately benefit our 
clients. This development was a critical 
enabler of our MiFID II compliance 
programme, explained below. 
Regulatory change continued to be 
a significant feature of the fund 
management industry in 2017 and we 
have been committed to responding 
efficiently to these demands. MiFID II has 
been the most wide‑ ranging of the new 
regulations and it has touched many 
parts of the firm, requiring us to review 
and amend policies and procedures, as 
well as agreements with our partners, 
brokers and clients. Putting clients first 
is core to our values and MiFID II aligns 
with our approach, by emphasising the 
need to sell and distribute products 
appropriate for our clients. The 
investment in technology and work 
performed has been integral to ensuring 
that Jupiter was in a position to comply 
with MiFID II from its start date of 
3 January 2018. Investment in change 
programmes to ensure we comply with 
new requirements such as the General 
Data Protection Regulation and those 
of SMCR will continue throughout 2018.
Spend on technology focuses on 
delivering security, resilience and 
simplicity. Cyber security is an industry‑ wide issue and we have invested 
significantly in this area to maintain 
our Cyber Essentials Plus status, an 
accreditation backed by the UK 
Government. The Cyber Essentials 
Assurance Framework demonstrates 
to our clients, insurers and business 
partners that essential precautions for 
cyber security have been taken. The 
provision of dual data location sites for 
our private cloud off‑ premise server 
estate facilitates robust business 
continuity planning. Business interruption 
plans also include the availability of 
dedicated and shared disaster recovery 
locations that facilitate the continuation 
of core business processes.
Our fund administration and accounting 
operating model focuses on utilising 
the scale of global outsourced service 
providers with appropriate control and 
oversight performed by Jupiter. Our 
funds use third party providers for 
services including administration and 
transfer agency across our product 
range, with oversight and management 
by relevant Jupiter operational teams. 
As we develop our operating model, 
we ensure that the appropriate risk and 
control oversight is embedded into the 
core processes.
2018 will continue the focus on the 
quality and use of data, both from an 
operational efficiency perspective and 
to support investment performance. 
Planned investment includes delivering an 
enhanced view of customer and market 
data, to support the servicing of clients, 
and the utilisation of data science 
techniques to promote insights into client 
behaviours and enhance investment 
portfolio management. The scope of 
technology in the firm is also expanding 
to include the use of machine learning 
and robotics, to automate processes 
and support the delivery of an efficient 
operating model. 26

INVESTING IN SEED
In 2017, we expanded our corporate 
seed investment programme, as explained 
on page 12. A new governance framework 
and set of limits were agreed with the 
Board at the start of 2017. Through 2017 
we actively sought to redeem historic 
seed investments and to support 
dynamically the launch of new funds and 
those approaching meaningful 
anniversaries or size with the injection of 
corporate seed investment. Examples 
included corporate seed investment in 
Jupiter Emerging and Frontier Income 
Trust, Global Emerging Markets Short 
Duration Bond Fund, Global Levered 
Absolute Return Fund and Europa Fund.
The graphic to the right shows the 
development of the corporate seed 
investment portfolio as a result of the 
expanded programme.
FINANCIAL  
RESOURCES
We continue to 
distribute available 
profit in a balanced 
manner; we invest in 
our business, maintain 
a resilient balance 
sheet and share the 
rewards of profitability 
and growth between 
our people and 
shareholders. 
DISTRIBUTION OF 
AVAILABLE PROFIT
In 2017 we have maintained the balance 
of distribution of available profits in line 
with the model set out on page 12 
and as shown in the graphic opposite.
As discussed in the Remuneration 
Report, the variable compensation pool 
in 2017 was assessed as a proportion 
of adjusted available profit at £73.8m 
(2016: £59.4m), below 27.5%, as previously 
guided. The variable compensation pool 
represents the aggregate value to the 
employees at the grant date of the 
awards irrespective of the nature of the 
compensation instruments that are used 
in the delivery of the awards. As these 
compensation instruments include 
share‑ based awards with deferred 
vesting, IFRS require the variable 
compensation expense on those awards 
to be recognised over the service and 
vesting period. As a result, some of the 
cost of the 2017 variable compensation 
pool does not form part of the 2017 
variable compensation expense. 
Furthermore, some of the costs arising 
from prior year awards are included in 
the 2017 variable compensation expense. 
In addition, variable compensation 
expense includes national insurance and 
other social security levies. Whilst the 
share‑ based compensation expense is 
not sensitive to movements in Jupiter’s 
share price, the associated national 
insurance cost is. In 2017 the Jupiter 
share price appreciation of 42% led to 
an increase in this component of variable 
compensation expense of £3.0m. 
Additionally, in 2017 Jupiter reviewed 
its remuneration structure in line 
with regulation and other market 
developments. This has led to an 
increase in the proportion of overall 
variable compensation which is deferred 
as well as altering the vesting profile of 
deferred awards granted in 2017 from 
three‑ year cliff vesting to equal tranche 
vesting over three years. These changes 
impact the timing of recognition of the 
compensation expense in 2017 and 
subsequent years; prior‑ year awards 
are unaffected.
Collectively all these factors work 
towards a total variable expense of 
£82.5m being recognised in 2017 
(2016: £66.6m). As a proportion of 
available profit, this results in a variable 
compensation ratio of 29.7% (2016: 
28.2%). This is at the higher end of our 
guidance for variable compensation 
ratio which is expected to be in the mid 
to upper 20% range.
Tax in 2017 was 13.5% of available profit 
(2016: 14.3%) or 19.8% (2016: 20.5%) of 
statutory profit before tax. Tax continues 
to be in line with the headline 
corporation tax rate of 19.25% (2016: 
20%) in the UK.
As noted on page 30 in the Financial 
Review, in assessing the dividends, 
the Board continued its approach to 
ordinary dividends and declared total 
ordinary dividends of 17.1p per share 
(2016: 14.7p per share) which represents 
50% of underlying EPS. In assessing the 
level of special dividend, the Board 
considered the strength of the balance 
sheet and the capital needs of the 
business going forward. It concluded 
that a modest 5% of underlying EPS 
(2016: 7%) should be retained and, 
therefore, declared special dividends of 
15.5p per share (2016: 12.5p). As a result, 
total dividends represented 53.8% of 
available profit (2016: 52.7%). 
Taking all these components together, 
the balance of the distribution of 
available profit between staff and 
shareholders was maintained in line with 
the model.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
FINANCIAL RESOURCES: DELIVERING VALUE TO SHAREHOLDERS
Significant increase 
in AUM from sales and 
markets throughout 
the year contributed 
to strong revenue 
growth; control over 
costs allowed these 
gains to flow through 
to the bottom line.
NET REVENUE
Net revenue (£m) 2017 2016
Net management fees 392.4 330.2
Net initial charges (before 
box profits) 1.6 2.2
Performance fees 1.9 6.2
Net revenue before 
box profits 395.9 338.6
Box profits 13.6 12.8
Total 409.5 351.4
Net revenue (see page 31) for the year 
was £409.5m (2016: £351.4m), a year ‑ on‑ year increase of 17%, driven by both 
strong net sales and asset appreciation 
from markets and investment 
outperformance. 
Box profits cease from early 2018 as a 
result of our decision to move to single 
pricing for buying and selling fund units 
in our unit trust range. Box profits made 
in 2017 of £13.6m (2016: £12.8m) are 
presented separately from net initial 
charges of £1.6m (2016: £2.2m) above to 
reflect the discontinuation of this 
earnings line. Performance fees were 
£1.9m (2016: £6.2m).
2017 2016
Net management fees (£m) 392.4 330.2
Average AUM (£bn) 46.2 37.8
Net management fee 
margin (bps) 85 87
Almost all of the Group’s revenue 
is earned in the form of recurring 
management fees. The net management 
fee margin for the year was 85 basis 
points (2016: 87 basis points). This 
decrease was a result of continued 
positive momentum in a changing 
business mix, principally in the form of 
substantial growth in our lower margin 
fixed income product range. We continue 
to expect margins to decline by 1‑ 2 basis 
points a year over the longer term as a 
result of changes in product mix. 
ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
Costs by category (£m) 2017 2016
Fixed staff costs 54.3 48.3
Other expenses 77.8 67.1
Operating expenses 132.1 115.4
Variable staff costs 82.5 66.6
Underlying administrative 
expenses 214.6 182.0
Charge for options over 
pre‑ Listing shares 0.2 0.1
Administrative expenses 214.8 182.1
Underlying administrative expenses of 
£214.6m (2016: £182.0m) rose by 18%, driven 
by business volumes and investment. Our 
cost discipline focus has allowed us to 
continue to invest for growth while 
maintaining our adjusted cost/income 
ratio at 55%.
The increase in fixed staff costs of 
£6.0m relates to new hires in the fund 
management and distribution teams in 
the second half of 2016 and throughout 
2017 and other structural changes to 
our workforce. 
Other expenses of £77.8m (2016: £67.1m) 
increased by 16%. This was primarily 
driven by higher transaction costs linked 
to increasing AUM in our SICAV range 
of funds as well as investment in the 
business, either in further strengthening 
our fund management and distribution 
capabilities or in enhancing our 
operating model. These investments are 
designed to support our strategy of 
continued diversification and growth.
From 2018, operating expenses will 
include an additional amount of around 
£5.0m as a result of the Group’s decision 
to take fund research costs as charges 
within the Group’s own income statement. 
Variable staff costs (£m) 2017 2016
Cash bonus 41.6 42.4
Deferred bonus, LTIP, SAYE 
and SIP 40.9 24.2
Total 82.5 66.6
Variable compensation 
ratio 29.7% 28.2%
Total compensation ratio 33.4% 32.7%
Variable staff costs increased by 24% 
to £82.5m (2016: £66.6m). The variable 
compensation ratio rose by 1.5% from 
28.2% to 29.7%, within our previous 
guidance. Overall, the variable 
compensation expense increase was 
primarily due to the higher profitability 
and strong delivery on all key 
performance indicators. 
Within the overall variable compensation 
expense, cash bonus costs of £41.6m 
(2016: £42.4m) declined marginally as 
increases due to higher levels of 
profitability were more than offset by a 
greater proportion of the 2017 variable 
compensation being in the form of 
deferred awards. Increasing the amount 
of deferred compensation has the effect 
of switching the classification of costs 
from cash bonus to deferred bonus as 
well as changing the timing of expense 
recognition. Lower levels of variable 
compensation directly linked to 
performance fees also contributed 
to a reduction in the cash bonus. 
The increase in other variable 
compensation charges was driven by a 
number of different factors. The largest of 
these was the increase in profitability. The 
charge was also materially impacted 
by the proportion of deferred variable 
compensation being greater than in the 
prior year (as explained above) and 
higher levels of deferred compensation 
charges arising from awards made in prior 
years. 
As a reminder, the equity‑ settled nature of 
previously awarded deferred bonus 
and LTIP schemes means that their 
costs are fixed at the time of grant and 
subsequently do not change if future 
earnings rise or fall, although social 
security costs vary with the Group’s share 
price. Due to this accounting treatment, 
there was an increase in social security 
costs on all unexercised share awards. It 
rose sharply as a result of the 42% 
increase in the Jupiter share price in the 
year. The apprenticeship levy, which has 
the same impact as an increase in 
national insurance, came into force in the 
UK in the second quarter and also 
affected the charge. 
We adopt a consistent approach to 
remuneration and expect the variable 
compensation ratio to remain within 
guidance in the mid to high 20% range 
over the medium term. 
OTHER INCOME STATEMENT 
MOVEMENTS
Amortisation relating to software and 
the Jupiter brand name was £2.3m 
(2016: £3.3m). The Jupiter brand name 
became fully amortised in June 2017.
Other gains in 2016 included a one‑ off 
credit of £5.0m relating to foreign 
exchange gains arising from the 
liquidation of two overseas subsidiaries.  29

Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
PROFIT BEFORE TAX (PBT)
PBT for the year increased by 13% to 
£192.9m (2016: £171.4m) due to a 15% 
increase in operating earnings, partially 
offset by a reduction in other gains, 
which benefited from a one‑ off foreign 
exchange gain of £5.0m in 2016. 
TAX EXPENSE
The effective tax rate for 2017 was 
19.8% (2016: 20.5%), against a headline UK 
corporation tax rate of 19.25% (2016: 20%).
We have a published tax strategy, 
which is available from our website at:

The Group’s basic and diluted EPS 
measures were 34.5p and 33.7p 
respectively in 2017, compared with 
30.3p and 29.6p in 2016.
ADJUSTED EBITDA
Other than its use as a profitability 
performance measure in the assessment 
of variable compensation for Executive 
Directors, the Group no longer uses 
adjusted EBITDA as a performance 
measure as there are no material 
differences between Jupiter’s underlying 
PBT and its adjusted EBITDA.
CASH FLOW
The Group generated positive operating 
cash flows after tax in 2017 of £194.6m 
(2016: £147.3m). The Group invested 
£70.1m in seeding funds during the year, 
a significant increase as the Group seeks 
to build a track record in recently‑ launched products. Proceeds from 
disposals of seed investments were 
£14.8m. Outflows from financing activities 
included £132.2m of dividend payments 
to shareholders and £26.4m of shares 
purchased by the Employee Benefit 
Trust to avoid future shareholder dilution 
from compensation schemes. The net 
decrease in cash in the period was 
£24.7m (2016: £0.5m).
ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
The Group’s cash position at the year‑ end 
date was £234.2m (31 December 2016: 
£258.9m), as trading profits were offset 
by dividend payments to shareholders, 
an increase in seeding of funds and the 
compensation round. As outlined in the 
Equity and Capital Management section, 
it remains our intention to return a high 
proportion of surplus cash to 
shareholders as it arises. 
SEED INVESTMENTS
We deploy seed into funds to ensure 
an effective launch and to accelerate 
the timescale over which the funds can 
pass through critical size thresholds. 
As at 31 December 2017, we had a total 
investment of £96.6m carried at fair 
value in Jupiter funds (31 December 2016: 
£58.7m). This excludes £10.7m of 
investments in our own funds to hedge 
our obligation to settle amounts payable 
to employees in relation to Deferred 
Bonus Plan awards. 
These investments are shown on the 
Group’s balance sheet under the 
appropriate heading for the relevant 
level of ownership in each fund. The 
Group only invests in liquid funds and 
chooses to hedge market and currency 
risk on the majority of its holdings 
of seed investments, with all seed 
investments either hedged or invested 
in absolute return or fixed income 
products. As a result, the value of these 
investments is stable and available to 
improve the Group’s cash balances and 
liquidity if required.
EQUITY AND CAPITAL 
MANAGEMENT
Total shareholders’ equity increased by 
£29.9m to £640.3m in the year, with the 
continued profitability of the Group being 
substantially offset by distributions to 
shareholders, in line with the Group’s 
dividend policy below. 
Capital and regulatory position
The Group formally assesses its capital 
position and requirements annually 
through its ICAAP. The ICAAP document, 
which is approved by the Board, makes 
estimations and judgements to establish 
whether the Group holds an appropriate 
level of regulatory capital to mitigate the 
impact of its key risks in the event of 
these crystallising.
At present, the Group has a comfortable 
surplus over regulatory requirements, 
holding qualifying capital of around 
£146m against a requirement of £55m, 
an indicative surplus of £91m, after 
allowing for the full‑ year and special 
dividends. The adoption of IFRS 16 
Leases in 2019, which will require the 
recognition of an illiquid asset in the 
Group’s balance sheet, is expected to 
reduce this surplus.
This position of capital strength enables 
us to be agile when assessing and 
pursuing market opportunities in which 
we see the potential for value creation. 30
Strategic report
FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Dividends 
Jupiter has a progressive ordinary 
dividend policy, and our intention is 
for the ordinary dividend payout ratio 
to be around 50% of earnings across the 
cycle. The Board then expects to retain 
up to 10% of earnings for capital 
maintenance. The remaining balance, 
after taking account of any specific 
events, will be returned to shareholders 
through the payment of a special 
dividend. 
The Board considers the dividend on 
a total basis, taking into account our 
resilient balance sheet and our long‑ term 
approach to running the business and 
maintaining an appropriate balance 
between interim and full‑ year ordinary 
dividends. The Board’s intention is to use 
profits and cash flow to pay shareholder 
dividends, to retain sufficient capital 
to maintain a strong balance sheet and 
meet regulatory requirements, and to 
return excess cash to shareholders 
according to market conditions at the 
time. 
The Board has declared a full‑ year 
ordinary dividend for the year of 10.3p 
(2016: 10.2p) per share. This results in a 
total ordinary dividend for the year of 
17.1p (2016: 14.7p), an increase in line with 
underlying EPS and maintaining the 
ordinary dividend payout ratio at 50% of 
earnings. Due to the increase in 
profitability in the year and our sound 
financial position, the Board has decided 
to retain less than 10% of earnings, 
declaring a special dividend of 15.5p 
(2016: 12.5p) per share. 
The full‑ year dividend payment will be 
paid alongside the special dividend on 
6 April 2018 to shareholders on the 
register on 9 March 2018. The Board 
does not seek approval for dividend 
payments at the AGM, which means 
that full‑ year and special dividends can 
be paid together before the AGM.
Taking both ordinary and special 
dividends together, the Board is 
declaring a total dividend of 32.6p 
(2016: 27.2p) per share, representing a 
20% increase on last year. 
We believe our distribution policy and 
the consequent yield this delivers, allied 
with our growth prospects, is 
an attractive model for shareholders. 
LIQUIDITY
The Group has a robust free cash position, 
supported by an undrawn RCF and 
hedged seed investments. The Group 
has maintained a consistent liquidity 
management model, with core cash 
(after earmarked needs) run at levels 
sufficient for the needs of the business.
STATEMENT OF VIABILITY
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
2016 revision of the Code, the Directors 
have assessed the prospects of the Group 
over a longer period than the 12 months 
required by the Going Concern provision.
The Directors confirm that they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group 
will continue to operate and meet its 
liabilities, as they fall due, up to 
31 December 2020. The Directors’ 
assessment has been made with 
reference to the Group’s current position 
and strategy, the Board’s risk appetite, 
the Group’s financial plans and forecasts, 
and the Group’s principal risks and how 
these are managed, as detailed in the 
Strategic Report.
The Group defines its long‑ term strategic 
planning objectives over five years and 
this is underpinned by a rolling five‑ year 
financial plan, the first year of which is 
the current year budget. The further into 
the future the planning horizon is, the 
greater the level of uncertainty in the 
financial projections. Therefore, the 
Group uses a three‑ year period in 
assessing viability in order to be 
consistent with the Group’s ICAAP 
and because it has the sharper focus 
than the full five‑ year rolling financial 
planning horizon. 
The rolling financial plan incorporates 
both the Group’s strategy and principal 
risks and is reviewed by the Board at 
least annually when the budget for 
the following year is approved. In 
exceptional circumstances, the Board 
reviews and approves structural changes 
to the budget intra‑ year. These formal 
approval processes are underpinned by 
regular Executive Committee and Board 
discussions of strategy and risks, in the 
normal course of business. 
Throughout the year the Board 
assesses progress by reviewing forecasts 
compared to the budget and longer‑ term projections compared to the 
financial plan. The current year forecast 
and longer‑ term financial projections 
are regularly updated as appropriate 
and consider the Group’s profitability, 
cash flows, dividend payments, share 
purchases, seed investments and other 
key internal and external variables. 
Scenario analysis is also performed as 
part of the Group’s ICAAP, which is 
approved by the Board. These scenarios 
evaluate the potential impact of severe 
but plausible occurrences which reflect 
the Group’s risk profile. Scenarios include:
l l active regulatory breach by key fund 
manager; 
l l the loss of key fund managers; and
l l cyber‑ risk.
These considerations also include 
assessing the impact of different 
assumptions around the development of 
market levels and the impact this has on 
the value of assets under management 
and the Group’s revenues. 
We believe that the statement of viability 
continues to reflect our internal financial 
planning, budgeting, forecasting, review 
and challenge processes which assess 
profitability as well as those through 
which we assess risk exposures arising 
from the implementation of the Group’s 
operational strategy. 31

All APMs relate to past performance.
Changes in the use of APMs
1.  In prior periods, the Group has used 
adjusted EBITDA as a measure of 
performance, principally to enable 
users of the accounts to better 
compare the earnings of the Group 
with those of its competitors. Being 
debt‑ free and having now fully 
amortised its trade name intangible 
assets, there are currently no 
material differences between Jupiter’s 
underlying PBT and its adjusted 
EBITDA; additionally, amortisation 
charges going forward will principally 
relate to assets developed as part 
of the operating business which should 
be taken into consideration when 
measuring performance. For these 
reasons, adjusted EBITDA has been 
removed as an alternative 
performance measure, although it is 
still in use as one of the performance 
criteria for the remuneration of 
Executive Directors (see page 74). and 
is therefore included in the table below.
2.  Further to 1 above, adjusted EBITDA 
margin has been replaced by 
‘Adjusted cost/income ratio’ to retain 
a metric that provides a measure 
of operational efficiency.

Strategic report
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 
Being a responsible 
business is integral to 
the way we work. This 
responsibility is wider 
than our clients or our 
shareholders. 
Our three primary stakeholder groups 
are our clients, people and shareholders. 
In addition, our regulators, business 
partners, the state and other authorities, 
and wider society all have an interest in 
how we work.
The way we attract, develop and retain 
our people is discussed under Talent 
and Culture in the Performance Review. 
Relations with shareholders are covered 
throughout the Strategic Report as well 
as in the Governance section. The 
remainder of this section therefore 
provides more details about how we 
protect the interests of our clients, 
as well as our interactions with 
regulators, business partners, society 
and the state and authorities.
We have utilised the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) to structure our disclosure 
of corporate responsibility information. 
Disclosing our corporate responsibility 
performance in this way helps us to 
meet regulatory and best practice 
developments, and provides greater 
insight into our responsibilities. Our GRI 
G4 Report and Environmental Policy 
Statement is available from our website 
at www.jupiteram.com. 
CLIENTS
Jupiter can only succeed by offering 
products that our clients want and 
that meet their investment needs by 
selling and marketing these products 
responsibly and by offering high levels of 
client service. Ensuring we meet client 
needs comes from a combination of our 
culture and our governance. These are 
closely linked. Our policies, principles, 
codes of conduct and our corporate 
values all inform our culture and align 
our interests with those of existing and 
potential clients and our staff.
As part of this, we look to exercise good 
stewardship on behalf of our clients and 
to behave ethically. We believe that our 
biggest sustainability impact comes from 
looking after our clients’ needs and our 
engagement with the companies we 
invest in.
Our policies
Our key policies relating to our clients 
include:
l l Treating customers fairly (TCF). TCF is 
a core FCA principle, which promotes 
fair treatment of clients from product 
inception through to marketing and 
post‑ sales support. Our TCF policy 
commits us to dealing with clients 
honestly, openly and competently, not 
just as part of regulatory compliance 
but as a fundamental guiding principle. 
Our TCF Committee, chaired by our 
Chief Executive Maarten Slendebroek, 
ensures that our services meet our TCF 
obligations and our policy.
l l Conflicts of interest. We take all 
appropriate steps to identify, prevent 
or manage conflicts of interest that 
arise or may arise in the course of 
providing investment services to clients, 
whether between us and a client 
or between one client and another. 
Where circumstances are considered 
to exist that may give rise to a conflict 
of interest, details will be provided 
to clients as well as the mitigating 
procedures. No such circumstances 
are currently considered to exist 
which require disclosure to clients.
We have several methods for ensuring 
we successfully implement our policies. 
These include:
l l training programmes, covering areas 
such as anti‑ bribery and corruption, 
money laundering and market abuse, 
which employees are required to 
complete during the year;
l l our employee handbook, which assists 
with contractual terms, expected 
conduct and our policies;
l l our intranet, through which we make 
our key policies available to our people;
l l internal audits, which review our 
compliance with our legal and 
regulatory obligations, as well as 
our own policies and procedures;
l l supervisory controls, including a 
TCF sponsor in every client‑ facing 
department; and
l l our governance framework, 
including our Board, management and 
reporting committees with their own 
terms of reference, which provide us 
with a robust structure within which we 
implement our governance and policies.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Our Compliance department monitors 
our success with implementing our 
policies, principles and codes of conduct. 
We review the majority of our policies 
annually and circulate the updated 
versions to all staff.
Conduct risk
The Group defines conduct risks as risks 
which result in customer detriment, 
negative impact to market stability or 
restrict effective competition. Conduct 
risk is not considered a separate risk 
category. Risks in the strategic, investment 
and operational risk categories may 
result in conduct risk impacts.
Our approach to stewardship
Effective stewardship is fundamental 
to achieving the best risk‑ adjusted 
returns for our clients. We do not view 
governance themes in isolation but seek 
to understand how they affect long‑ term 
performance. Our investment teams and 
specialist governance and sustainability 
analysts therefore work together, to 
integrate stewardship into our investment 
approach, and all our fund managers 
are involved in voting decisions and our 
governance dialogue with companies. 
Jupiter has a formal Stewardship 
Committee, which develops and 
delivers a coordinated approach to our 
engagement with companies. The Chief 
Investment Officer chairs the Committee, 
which comprises fund managers, 
the Head of Governance, corporate 
governance and sustainability analysts 
and representatives from across the 
business. The Committee looks at trends 
in our engagement with companies, the 
issues arising and how we can enhance 
our processes and information gathering. 
It also approves our submissions to 
consultations, for example, on changes 
to the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC) 
UK Stewardship Code (the Code). Jupiter 
is a signatory to the Code.
In 2017, we continued to engage 
with companies and policy makers. 
Most notably, Jupiter responded to 
the UK Government’s consultation 
on corporate governance reform in 
February 2017. The response was 
informed by governance themes that 
our fund managers have encountered 
over many years. These included:
l l the core principle that executive pay 
must be linked to performance;
l l the importance of providing companies 
with the flexibility to create pay 
structures suited to their business 
models; and 
l l the need to preserve the UK’s 
successful unitary board model. 
The FRC began a review of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code in late 
2017 and launched a consultation on 
proposed amendments in December 
2017. The aim is to ensure the UK best 
practice regime retains its leading 
elements, while adapting to the changing 
economic and social climate. Jupiter 
intends to respond to this consultation.
The Chief Investment Officer also chairs 
our Sustainability Review Committee, 
which comprises portfolio managers and 
sustainability and governance specialists. 
The Committee:
l l oversees the approval of companies 
for investment in ethically screened, 
socially responsible or environmental 
solutions funds; and
l l reviews our engagement with 
companies on social and 
environmental issues and monitors 
these risks and opportunities across 
our funds. 
We link this analysis of major social and 
environmental issues to our key holdings. 
Our sustainability specialists and 
investment teams collaborate on 
sustainability research, to improve our 
investment outcomes.
During the year, the UN‑ backed 
Principles for Responsible Investment 
(PRI) released its Transparency Report 
for 2017, in which it assessed Jupiter’s 
wider approach to the PRI’s six 
responsible investment principles. Jupiter 
once again scored strongly across 
several modules assessed by the PRI. 
In particular, we were rated A+ for 
Strategy & Governance as well as A for 
both Listed Equity – Incorporation and 
Listed Equity – Active Ownership.
Implementing the recommendations of 
the FSB Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures
Our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and 
Chief Financial Officer (CFO) signed 
Statements of Support for the 
recommendations of the FSB Task Force 
on Climate‑ related Financial Disclosures, 
and we will be implementing the 
recommendations over the next few 
years. Our initial disclosure is below.
Governance
l l The CEO, together with the executive 
Directors, are responsible for the 
management of the Group’s day‑ to‑ day business and for ensuring the 
implementation of strategy, and, as 
such, have specific responsibility for 
climate change‑ related issues.
l l The Board has established a 
committee structure to assist in the 
discharge of its responsibilities across 
our investment activities, including 
climate change responsibilities. 
Our Sustainability Review Committee, 
chaired by the Chief Investment Officer, 
reviews our engagement activity 
with companies on climate‑ related 
issues and monitors these risks and 
opportunities across Jupiter’s funds.
Strategy
l l The key aspects of climate change that 
have influenced the business strategy 
are climate change opportunities/risks 
associated with the assets we manage. 
These include increasing climate 
change regulation, changes in physical 
climate parameters, changing consumer 
demands, and opportunities to develop 
business solutions to global challenges. 
We work to try and understand these 
levels of risk and opportunities across 
our underlying investments where 
we estimate these to be material. 
We focus on our investments in the 
energy, industrials, utilities and auto 
sectors in particular. We seek to 
engage with company management 
where appropriate.
l l Jupiter is not a significant producer of 
GHG emissions, and we consider our 
direct climate‑ related risk to be limited. 
However, the risks associated with 
rising energy prices and the necessity 
to reduce emissions have influenced 
our business strategy, as evidenced 
by the decision to move to a new 
BREEAM Excellent rated building in 
December 2015 and our commitment 
to purchase 100% of our electricity 
from renewable sources under the 
RE100 initiative. 34
Strategic report
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
Risk management
l l We collate our corporate global 
environmental data and produce 
quarterly reports on our direct 
environmental impact, allowing the 
identification of climate change risks 
and opportunities related to our direct 
operations (consumption and waste).
l l At an asset level, as mentioned above, 
our Sustainability Review Committee 
reviews our engagement activity with 
companies on climate‑ related issues 
and monitors these risks and 
opportunities across Jupiter’s funds. 
Our sustainability specialists and 
investment teams conduct research 
in partnership.
l l We monitor climate change risks and 
opportunities in our investments by 
hosting or attending meetings with 
management teams and non‑ executives to question and challenge 
companies about the issues we think 
may affect their long‑ term value.
Metrics and targets
Please see ‘Our environmental 
performance’ below for our emissions 
metrics and RE100 target. 
Our stewardship performance
We monitor the companies we invest in 
by hosting or attending regular meetings 
with their executive management. These 
meetings allow us to question and 
challenge companies on the issues we 
think may affect their long‑ term value.
We also separately engage with 
company chairmen and non‑ executive 
directors. The content of these meetings 
varies but can include strategy, board 
effectiveness, remuneration, shareholder 
rights, culture, values, succession planning 
and sustainability. This gives us a different 
perspective on a company’s performance 
and prospects and helps us to drive 
long‑ term investment performance, by 
engaging before problems arise, rather 
than holding companies to account after 
the event. During the year, we engaged 
with 160 companies to primarily discuss 
stewardship matters, in addition to the 
1,000+ meetings held with company 
management around the financial calendar.
Voting at company general meetings is 
also an important part of exercising our 
stewardship responsibilities. In 2017, we 
voted at 371 meetings in the UK and 930 
overseas. We voted against management 
or abstained on at least one resolution 
at 12% of UK meetings and 31% of 
overseas meetings.
As part of our approach to stewardship 
and responsible investment, we review 
key themes that could affect the long‑ term value of companies. In 2017, for 
example, we considered the financial risk 
to our investments from a potential ban 
on diesel passenger vehicles in European 
cities and growing labour issues in the 
Asian textiles sector.

to corporate governance, corporate 
responsibility and voting can be found 
in the Jupiter Asset Management 
Corporate Governance and Voting 
Policy and The UK Stewardship Code: 
Jupiter’s Approach, both of which are 
available on our website.
REGULATORS
Jupiter’s primary regulator is the FCA 
in the UK. It oversees all aspects of 
our work, from how we run our fund 
management operations to how we 
communicate to our clients, both directly 
and through our distribution partners.
While we also come under the jurisdiction 
of other regulators overseas, the high 
standard of UK regulation means the 
FCA sets the benchmark for what we do. 
When we face overseas regulations that 
are more onerous than in the UK, we 
comply with the higher standard.
Ongoing regulatory change is a feature 
of our markets. One change being driven 
by the FCA is the Senior Managers and 
Certification Regime (SMCR). This aims to 
protect consumers and market integrity, 
by making individuals working in financial 
services more accountable for their 
conduct and competence. We are 
working towards SMCR compliance, 
in line with the anticipated FCA deadline. 
The FCA also published the final findings 
of its asset management market study 
in June 2017. This outlines reforms to 
make competition work better, including 
greater fee transparency and a focus 
on creating value for clients. Our 
decision to move to single pricing for 
unit trusts, which we announced in 
February 2017, anticipated these changes 
and simplifies our client proposition.
Significant new regulations also arise 
from European directives. These include 
MiFID II, which is discussed in more detail 
in the Operating Model and Infrastructure 
section of the performance review. 
Other notable upcoming regulation 
includes the General Data Protection 
Regulation, which comes into force in 
May 2018. We continue to prepare 
effectively for these changes, supported 
by our investment in our systems 
and processes.
BUSINESS PARTNERS
Our key business partners include our 
distribution partners in the UK and 
overseas markets. They encompass 
funds of funds, platforms, global financial 
institutions, advisers, wealth managers 
and life companies. Our interactions with 
our distribution partners are described 
in the Business Model section and in the 
Distribution Partners, Channels, Clients 
and Geographies section of the 
Performance Review.
Services provided by key partners help 
to optimise our business model and 
ensure we serve our clients in the best 
way possible. For product distribution, 
we use third‑ party platforms, wealth 
managers and financial advisers to 
access clients. This intermediated 
approach, which is a feature of all the 
markets we operate in, is significantly 
more efficient than engaging directly with 
clients. It allows us to target marketing 
and brand building and develop 
relationships with distribution partners, 
while maintaining a simplified service 
model. Online services enable advisers 
and individuals to invest in selected funds 
from different providers, and to access 
consolidated reporting and analytics 
tools. We are building relationships with 
the biggest platforms and making our 
funds available through them. 
To support an efficient and scalable 
operating platform, third‑ party 
administration services are provided by 
a range of global financial institutions 
including JP Morgan, HSBC, RBS, and 
Northern Trust. Fund administration 
services for our unit trust range are 
provided by DST Systems and the 
SICAV funds are administered by JP 
Morgan Luxembourg. We maintain 
appropriate oversight and control of 
our partners’ activities, and also act as 
the delegated management company 
for the SICAV funds.  35

SOCIETY 
Our corporate values set out our aim of 
making a positive contribution to society, 
as managers of other people’s money. 
We also have an impact on society 
through our environmental performance, 
our approach to protecting human rights 
and preventing modern slavery, and 
through our charitable activities.
The environment
In 2011, we began working with Carbon 
Credentials to measure our carbon 
footprint. Since then, we have gathered 
data on a variety of emissions sources. 
The table below presents the operational 
boundary for our reported GHG 
emissions in 2017:

Our environmental performance
The table below breaks down our 
GHG emissions by scope. We use the 
operational control approach to 
consolidating GHG emissions. Our 
chosen GHG methodology (Defra’s 
Environmental Reporting Guidelines) 
defines this as operations where we, 
or one of our subsidiaries, have full 
authority to introduce and implement 
our operating policies. We believe this 
approach incorporates all of our entities 
with sustainability impacts that are 
actually or potentially material.
At the end of 2017, Jupiter had physical 
operations in nine countries. We have 
therefore applied a materiality threshold 
of 5% for the purposes of reporting GHG 
data, in line with practice among similar 
sized firms in our sector. As a result, 
locations with eight or more staff are 
defined as material and included in the 
disclosure. For the first time in 2017, we 
are therefore including emissions from 
our offices in Hong Kong and Frankfurt.

understanding of the metering structure, 
2016 emissions have been restated.
Our emissions intensity measure is tCO
2
e 
per full time employee equivalent (FTE). 
Using direct emissions (scope 1) and 
location‑ based scope 2 emissions, our 
emissions intensity in 2017 was 1.28 tCO
2
e 
per employee FTE (2016: 1.51 tCO
2
e per 
employee FTE). Using direct emissions 
(scope 1) and market ‑ based scope 2 
emissions, our 2017 emissions intensity 
was 0.31 tCO
2
e per employee FTE (2016: 
0.30 tCO
2
e per employee FTE). 
Our location‑ based scope 2 emissions 
have decreased by 17% compared to 
2016 due to more efficient working 
practices being implemented in 2017, 
resulting in reduced electricity consumption. 
Our scope 3 emissions are almost 
entirely made up of emissions from air 
travel which increased by 138% in 2017 
as we expanded our international 
presence. 
In 2017 Jupiter joined The Climate 
Group’s RE100 initiative, committing to 
source 100% of the energy consumption 
in its leased offices from renewable 
sources by the end of 2017. We achieved 
our RE100 commitment in 2017. This 
means that, using the market‑ based 
approach to Scope 2 emissions 
reporting, our electricity emissions in 2017 
were nil tCO2e. Our office in Hong Kong, 
where renewable tariffs are not 
available, purchased internationally 
recognised I‑ RECS, using Chinese wind 
power to offset the electrical KW/h 
usage. Jupiter’s London headquarters in 
the Zig Zag Building already uses 100% 
renewable electricity.
Our CEO, Maarten Slendebroek , said: 
“We believe our decision to target 100% 
renewable electricity through RE100 
highlights the alignment between our 
corporate strategy and our investment 
activities. As long‑ term active investors, 
we believe that climate change and 
energy transition carry risks and 
opportunities that warrant our attention. 
This initiative demonstrates Jupiter’s 
commitment to environmentally 
responsible corporate behaviour.”
Human rights and modern slavery
We recognise the importance of 
upholding human rights in our business 
operations, both in how we treat 
individuals and how we encourage 
individuals within the Group to interact 
with each other. This is at the heart of 
our corporate values. 
We protect the rights of our employees 
through our employment policies and 
practices, which prohibit discrimination 
and encourage diversity. At Jupiter, we 
believe diversity and inclusion are simple 
concepts – to have the right people, 
regardless of background, in the right 
role. Our Equal Opportunities Policy 
requires all employees and job applicants 
to be treated fairly and equally. All our 
procedures and policies are bias‑ free 
and we have a zero‑ tolerance policy to 
bullying and harassment. Our managers 
are supported in embedding an inclusive 
culture within their teams and we are 
dedicated to engendering a culture 
of openness so that any issues 
or concerns can be discussed.
We protect the rights of our other 
stakeholders through our insistence 
on high standards of ethical behaviour. 
This is embedded in our culture through 
our policies, principles, codes of conduct 
and our corporate values. Our TCF, 
anti‑ bribery and corruption and conflicts 
of interest policies are particularly 
important in upholding high standards 
of ethical behaviour. 
We expect our suppliers to uphold human 
rights both in their own organisations 
and, in turn, in those of their suppliers. 
In particular, we will not tolerate modern 
slavery or human trafficking.

website at: www.jupiteram.com. 36
Strategic report
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
Community
As well as our impact on wider society 
which comes through the individuals we 
employ, suppliers we use, the taxes we 
pay and those we collect on behalf 
of individuals, we also aim to make 
a positive contribution to society as 
managers of other people’s money and 
by helping investors to meet their 
long‑ term investment objectives. In 
addition, we make a difference to the 
communities we operate within through 
charitable giving directed by our 
employees and through the support and 
engagement of a corporate partner 
charity. 
In 2017 Jupiter directly contributed 
£153,000 to charitable causes. In line 
with Jupiter’s culture, this giving is 
primarily driven by supporting double‑ matched giving for individuals who 
participate in the Give As You Earn 
scheme operated by the Charities 
Aid Foundation. This allows individual 
employees to align charitable giving with 
the causes they feel a personal 
connection with. As a corporate, we 
further directly supported a number of 
other fundraising events and charitable 
causes in 2017, including wearing 
Christmas jumpers to support Save 
The Children, a sponsored abseil event 
for CASCAID, the Asset Management 
initiative that raises funds for Cancer 
Research UK, fundraising for SANDS 
during baby loss awareness week 
and collecting supply donations for 
Grenfell Tower victims and local 
foodbanks through the Trussell Trust’s 
Harvest Appeal.
Our partner charity is selected based 
on nominations from employees, who 
look for an organisation which aligns 
with our corporate values. Our current 
partner charity is Teach First. It focuses 
on reducing inequality in education, 
primarily by training and supporting 
new teachers, to help them develop as 
leaders in schools. In 2017 employees 
and Jupiter supported Teach First by 
raising £90,234 for the charity through 
various events including staff quiz nights, 
dress downs and charity run and cycling 
events. In addition, Jupiter employers 
have also dedicated their time to 
working with close to sixty pupils from 
two Teach First partner schools, teaching 
guest lessons, coaching new teachers 
and mentoring Teach First Directors. 
THE STATE AND AUTHORITIES
The state and authorities set the legal 
and taxation frameworks we must 
operate within.
We comply with all applicable laws, 
including those relating to financial crime, 
in the countries within which we operate.
Financial crime 
We are committed to combatting 
financial crime, including money 
laundering, terrorist financing, bribery 
and corruption, tax evasion and fraud. 
We therefore have numerous policies 
and procedures to reduce the extent to 
which it is possible that Jupiter’s products 
could be used in connection with 
financial crime. 
The topics covered by those policies and 
procedures include:
l l Financial crime prevention training
l l Transaction monitoring
l l Suspicious activity reporting
l l Anti‑ money laundering, sanctions and 
Politically Exposed Persons
l l Customer, distributor and enhanced 
due diligence
l l Compliance monitoring and internal 
audit
l l Employee vetting
l l Anti‑ bribery and corruption
l l Tax evasion
l l Data protection and security (cyber 
crime)
l l Whistleblowing
These measures are designed to ensure 
we comply with applicable UK law, 
including the Money Laundering 
Regulations 2017, Bribery Act 2010 and 
Criminal Finances Act 2017 (see below).
Our senior managers are required to 
actively engage in managing financial 
crime risks. The Group’s Audit and Risk 
Committee meets at least four times a 
year and considers matters related to 
financial crime matter. These matters are 
also considered by the Risk Committee 
and other operational forums.
The Criminal Finances Act 2017 took 
effect on 30 September 2017 and 
introduced Corporate Criminal Offences, 
which criminalise the failure of an 
organisation to prevent the facilitation 
of UK and foreign tax evasion by its 
associated persons, as defined by the 
Act. We have adopted appropriate 
procedures to support our policy 
towards the prevention of the facilitation 
of tax evasion. We do not tolerate 
tax evasion, nor do we tolerate the 
facilitation of tax evasion by any 
person(s) acting on the Group’s behalf.
Taxation
We seek to manage our tax affairs 
in a straightforward manner, paying 
what we owe at the right time in order 
to comply with our tax obligations 
worldwide. Our corporate structure 
and operating model ensure that our 
tax affairs are easy to explain and 
transparent to the tax authorities.
Our approach is governed by a Board‑ approved tax strategy, which we have 
shared with HM Revenue & Customs. 
We ensure this strategy, and the 
procedures and controls which underpin 
our approach, are appropriate, 
monitored and fully implemented.
More information on our tax strategy 
can be found on our website:

Governance
DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
Jupiter puts considerable emphasis on 
effective governance, so I am pleased 
to report on the governance of your 
Company in 2017.
THE ROLE OF THE BOARD 
AND OUR CORPORATE VALUES
The Board’s role is to set the Group’s 
strategy, ensure it has the right 
leadership and culture, monitor the 
performance of the business and 
oversee its risk management structure. 
The Board’s effectiveness in carrying 
out this role is supported by its focus 
on culture, setting the tone from the 
top and paying close attention to good 
governance throughout the Group. 
As Chairman, my role is to lead the 
Board, set its agenda and ensure it 
operates effectively.
Our corporate values are long‑ standing 
and were first documented in 2015. 
They are central to our business 
success. You will see them set out fully 
in the Strategic Report. They describe 
clearly our client‑ centric culture, 
focused on integrity and excellence 
of client outcomes.
THE BOARD
The Board is responsible for the Group’s 
long‑ term success. This success is 
promoted by having Board members 
with a diverse range of relevant skills 
and experiences. As the biographies 
set out later in this section illustrate, 
the Board has a good balance of asset 
management, accounting, financial 
services, international, regulatory and 
governance experience. The Board is 
supported by a succession plan, which 
balances continuity and refreshment of 
Board membership, and ensures 
members continue to demonstrate 
appropriate experience in the asset 
management markets within which we 
operate.
During the year, after having served 
eight years as a Non‑ Executive Director 
of Jupiter, Lorraine Trainer announced 
her intention to step down from the 
Board following the 2018 AGM. On 
behalf of the Board, I would like to 
express my thanks to Lorraine for her 
invaluable support over the years and 
for her significant contribution to Jupiter.
In accordance with good succession 
management, Jonathon Bond and Bridget 
Macaskill succeeded Lorraine in the roles 
of Senior Independent Director and 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, 
respectively. Lorraine supported Jonathon 
and Bridget in their transition to the 
new roles. Jonathon and Bridget bring 
considerable experience and insight to 
these positions and I look forward to the 
additional contributions both will make in 
these new roles. 
In October, after a rigorous search and 
selection process, I was very pleased 
to announce Roger Yates’s appointment 
as a Non‑ Executive Director. Roger 
brings significant asset management 
and international business management 
experience to the Board from his 
previous board and executive positions 
at multinational asset managers. His 
insight and knowledge has already 
provided a significant contribution to our 
discussions. The Board now comprises 
three Executive Directors and seven 
Non‑ Executive Directors, including me.
In December, Adrian Creedy stepped 
down as Company Secretary and has 
been succeeded by Adam Westley. 
The Board is very grateful for Adrian’s 
contribution during a career with Jupiter 
spanning over two decades.
OUR COMMITTEES
Our Board committees play integral roles 
in supporting the Board’s work. They are 
provided with the resources they need to 
undertake their duties, including access 
to the Company Secretary and external 
advisers. The committees, their mandates 
and memberships are shown later in 
this section.
The Audit and Risk Committee continued 
its role of overseeing the Group’s 
financial reporting, risk management 
and internal controls framework, 
compliance framework and relationship 
with the External and Internal auditors. 
During the year, the Committee 
monitored the progress of a new 
enhanced Governance, Risk and Controls 
programme. The Committee was also 
active in overseeing Jupiter’s significant 
change programmes.
The Nomination Committee has 
progressed its work on Board and senior 
management succession planning to 
ensure diversity of perspective as well as 
ensuring the candidates have the 
relevant skills and experience.
The Remuneration Committee continued 
to perform its role of ensuring that 
Jupiter can attract and retain talented 
individuals. Following feedback from a 
number of shareholders prior to the 2017 
AGM, the Committee spent considerable 
time on developing a new remuneration 
policy, which a number of our larger 
shareholders were invited to discuss with 
the Remuneration Committee Chairman, 
Bridget Macaskill, in a consultation 
during late 2017. The new remuneration 
policy introduces a number of best 
practice features for Executive Director 
pay which reflects feedback received 
from shareholders and investor bodies. 
Simultaneously, it aims to maintain the 
strong culture of pay for performance 
and align the reward to employees 
with the experience of our clients and 
shareholders. Further details of the 
new policy may be found in the 
Remuneration Report.
CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION 39
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
The reports from each of the Board 
committees which follow, further explain 
their work over the past year and 
their ongoing priorities.
BOARD EFFECTIVENESS
In June 2017, we undertook our 
annual review of Board effectiveness. 
This year we worked with a specialist 
consultancy, Independent Board 
Evaluation, to help us ensure that we 
utilise individual Director’s strengths 
most effectively in the Board environment. 
The recommendations of the review are 
further described later in this 
Governance section.
Since 2016, Jupiter has operated a 
pairing arrangement between Non‑ Executive Directors and members of 
the senior executive team to foster 
deeper engagement. This has led to an 
increased understanding of the Board’s 
role for senior executives and of the 
Group’s business and operations for the 
Non‑ Executive Directors. This programme 
is being continued in 2018.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
REFORM
The Board supports the proposed 
revisions to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and proposals for 
corporate governance reform as 
announced by the UK Government in 
August 2017 and published by the FRC in 
December 2017. The Board has assessed 
the implications of these proposals and 
has concluded that the Company is well 
placed to comply with the new 
requirements as and when they become 
effective.
I hope that this introduction has added 
some colour to the formal reports from 
the Committees that follow in the next 
few pages. I look forward to meeting 
you and answering any questions you 
may have at our AGM on 16 May 2018.
LIZ AIREY
Chairman 
26 February 2018
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
Jupiter supports the principles of 
corporate governance as set out in 
the 2016 version of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code) issued 
by the Financial Reporting Council. 
A copy of the 2016 version of the 
Code can be found on the FRC 
website at: www.frc.org.uk
Having reviewed the provisions of 
the Code (dated April 2016) the Board 
is satisfied that throughout 
the accounting period ended 
31 December 2017, Jupiter complied 
with all of the provisions of the 
Code. More information on how the 
Company applied the principles of 
the Code is set out later in this 
Governance section. 40
Governance
LEADERSHIP
The Board is responsible for the 
leadership of the Group and for its 
long‑ term success within an effective risk 
and control framework, as well as setting 
the Group’s strategic aims. Liz Airey has 
chaired the Board since September 2014. 
The Board comprises three Executive 
Directors, six Non‑ Executive Directors 
and the Chairman. The Non‑ Executive 
Directors constructively challenge the 
executive management of the Company 
and provide valuable insight to the 
development of the Group strategy. 
They provide a diverse and effective 
balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience, to closely consider 
management’s performance in running 
the Group’s business and in meeting 
its goals and objectives. 
Jonathon Bond was appointed Senior 
Independent Director in August 2017. 
Jonathon acts as a sounding board for 
the Chairman, supporting her objectives 
for the Board. When appropriate, 
Jonathon is also an intermediary for 
other Directors and meets major 
shareholders, ensuring a good 
understanding of their issues and 
concerns. Further details are provided 
later in this report.
The Board has established three standing 
Board committees and the Executive 
Committee (membership of the Executive 
Committee is noted in the table 
opposite). The Board’s responsibility for 
overseeing control and disclosure of 
inside information is delegated to the 
Disclosure Committee, which was 
established in 2016 and is convened as 
required to consider such matters. In 
addition, during 2017 there were six 
committees reporting to the Executive 
Committee. These committees complete 
the Board’s framework of control.
The Board committees are the Audit 
and Risk, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees. Liz Airey chairs the 
Nomination Committee and is a member 
of the Remuneration Committee. The 
Board considered her to be independent, 
within the terms of the Code, at the time 
of her appointment as Chairman of the 
Board. All other members of the Board 
committees are independent Non‑ Executive Directors. The Board 
committees operate within defined terms 
of reference, which are published on the 
Company’s website at 
www.jupiteram.com.
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND 
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
The Chief Executive Officer (Maarten 
Slendebroek), Charlotte Jones (Chief 
Financial Officer) and the Executive 
Committee are responsible for managing 
the Group’s day‑ to‑ day business and for 
implementing the Board’s strategy.
Charlotte Jones was appointed Chief 
Financial Officer in September 2016.
Edward Bonham Carter was appointed 
Vice Chairman in March 2014. His role 
focuses on engaging with the Group’s 
stakeholders including clients, prospective 
clients and industry bodies. Edward also 
has Board responsibility for environmental 
and social governance matters.
GOVERNANCE WITHIN 
THE GROUP
The Executive Committee has established 
the six management and reporting 
committees shown in the diagram 
overleaf, which assist the Executive 
Committee with managing the Group’s 
business. Each of these committees 
operates under defined terms of 
reference. The diagram also sets out the 
main responsibilities of each committee. 
During the year, a review of Jupiter’s 
corporate and product governance 
arrangements was undertaken to help 
ensure that they continued to meet the 
evolving regulatory and best practice 
requirements. This has led to a number 
of recommendations, primarily relating to 
the Group’s reporting committees, which 
will be implemented during 2018.
In the UK Jupiter has two regulated 
companies – Jupiter Asset Management 
Limited (JAM) and Jupiter Unit Trust 
Managers Limited (JUTM). JAM’s principal 
activity is providing investment 
management services. JUTM’s principal 
activity is to act as the management 
company for the unit trusts, SICAVs and 
investment trusts managed by Jupiter. 
The boards of these companies oversee 
the activities of JAM and JUTM.

Governance
MATTERS RESERVED  
TO THE BOARD
The Board has a formal schedule 
of matters reserved for its decision, 
which it reviews and updates annually, 
to incorporate governance changes 
and developments within the Group.
The key issues reserved for its 
decision are:
l l establishing the Group’s commercial 
objectives and strategy;
l l approving the dividend policy;
l l overseeing financial reporting, 
including approving the annual report 
and interim financial statements;
l l setting the annual budget;
l l approving significant capital 
projects, expenditure and 
borrowings;
l l deciding major acquisitions, 
disposals and investments;
l l overseeing the Group’s operations 
and management, and maintaining 
an effective system of internal 
controls and risk management; and
l l ensuring adequate succession 
planning, including agreeing Board 
and other senior appointments and 
the appointment or removal of the 
Company Secretary.
THE BOARD MEMBERS
Maarten Slendebroek was appointed 
CEO in March 2014. His role, and that 
of the Chairman, Liz Airey, are 
separate and there is a clear division 
of responsibilities which is documented 
and examined annually by the Board. 
The Chairman is primarily responsible 
for leading the Board, setting its agenda, 
ensuring its effectiveness and that 
enough time is allocated for open 
debate and discussion, particularly of 
strategy and complex or contentious 
issues. She facilitates the contribution 
of all Non‑ Executive Directors and 
maintains appropriate contact with major 
shareholders, in order to understand 
their issues and concerns relating to 
governance, strategy and remuneration, 
among other key issues. 
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible 
for implementing the strategy that the 
Board has agreed and for the day‑ to‑ day management of the Group’s 
business, while optimising the adequacy 
and use of the Group’s resources. He 
keeps the evolving culture in Jupiter 
under review, particularly its impact on 
risk management and controls. He also 
keeps succession management under 
review, making recommendations to the 
Nomination Committee on the role and 
capabilities required in respect of the 
appointment of Executive Directors.
At the beginning of 2017, the Board 
comprised: Liz Airey (Chairman), Jonathon 
Bond (independent Non‑ Executive 
Director), Edward Bonham Carter (Vice 
Chairman), Charlotte Jones (Chief Financial 
Officer), Bridget Macaskill (independent 
Non‑ Executive Director), Maarten 
Slendebroek (Chief Executive Officer), 
Lorraine Trainer (Senior Independent 
Director), Karl Sternberg (independent 
Non‑ Executive Director) and Polly Williams 
(independent Non‑ Executive Director). 
DURING 2017 THE FOLLOWING 
CHANGES TO THE BOARD HAVE 
TAKEN PLACE:
l l Lorraine Trainer stepped down as 
Remuneration Committee Chairman 
and Senior Independent Director in 
July and August respectively;
l l Bridget Macaskill was appointed as 
Remuneration Committee Chairman 
in July;
l l Jonathon Bond was appointed as 
Senior Independent Director in 
August; and
l l Roger Yates was appointed as an 
independent Non‑ Executive Director 
and joined the Board in October.
BOARD BALANCE AND 
INDEPENDENCE
The Board now has 10 members, 
comprising the Chairman, three Executive 
Directors and six Non‑ Executive Directors. 
The Board considers each of its Non‑ Executive Directors – Jonathon Bond, 
Bridget Macaskill, Karl Sternberg, 
Lorraine Trainer, Polly Williams and 
Roger Yates – to be independent in both 
character and judgement and free of 
any relationship which could materially 
interfere with exercising their independent 
judgement. The Board considered the 
Chairman to be independent within the 
terms of the Code at the time of her 
appointment. The biographies of all 
Directors are set out earlier in this section.
No individual or group of individuals 
dominates the Board or its decision 
making. The Non‑ Executive Directors 
constructively challenge and help 
develop proposals on strategy and 
bring strong, independent judgement, 
knowledge and experience to the 
Board’s deliberations. 
The Board requires all Directors to 
devote sufficient time to their duties 
and to use their best endeavours to 
attend meetings. During the year, the 
Non‑ Executive Directors’ letters of 
appointment were reviewed. Non‑ Executive Directors are expected to 
spend up to 30 days a year in their 
roles as Directors. Committee chairmen 
are expected to commit up to 18 further 
days a year.
In 2017, the Chairman met with the 
Non‑ Executive Directors on a regular 
basis and also with the Chief Executive 
Officer. A meeting is held once a year 
when the Senior Independent Director 
meets the Non‑ Executive Directors, with 
neither the Chairman nor Executive 
Directors being present. Non‑ Executive 
Directors also met regularly with senior 
management.
OPERATION OF THE BOARD
The Board has a rolling agenda which 
ensures that the key issues set out 
above, including items relating to 
strategy, risk, finance, operations, 
corporate governance and compliance, 
are appropriately reviewed at its 
meetings. Six scheduled Board meetings 
took place during the year, with an 
additional meeting off‑ site in June for 
a two day discussion of strategy related 
matters. Progress on action points 
agreed at previous strategy days on 
fund management and distribution was 
also reviewed. A summary of the 
agenda items for the scheduled Board 
meetings and details of attendance by 
Directors is set out on the following 
page. 
A comprehensive set of papers is 
circulated approximately one week 
before Board and committee meetings. 
These include regular business progress 
reports, investment performance data, 
distribution activity reports, financial 
statements and shareholder information. 
Full minutes of previous meetings are 
also circulated promptly and any 
concerns which are raised regarding 
the running of the Company are noted. 
Adam Westley (the Company Secretary) 
manages the timely circulation of 
information to the Board and ensures 
Board procedures are complied with 
and that applicable rules and regulations 
are followed. The Company Secretary 
reports to the Chairman on corporate 
governance matters.

INDUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
New Directors are given a full, formal 
and tailored induction to the business, 
organised by the Company Secretary, 
including meetings with senior 
management and advisers. The 
Chairman, working with the Company 
Secretary, is responsible for ensuring that 
training programmes are provided to 
Directors either directly or by the 
Company through legal and regulatory 
updates. Non‑ Executive Directors also 
have access to external programmes. 
Jupiter expects Directors to identify their 
own training needs and to ensure they 
are adequately informed about Jupiter’s 
business and their responsibilities as a 
Director. The Chairman regularly reviews 
and agrees training and development 
needs with each Director.
Directors have access to independent 
professional advice at the Company’s 
expense, where they judge this necessary 
to discharge their responsibilities as 
Directors. All Directors have access to the 
Company Secretary’s advice and services.

Governance
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Company’s Articles of Association 
permit the Board to consider and 
authorise situations where a Director has 
an actual or potential conflict of interest 
in relation to the Group. The Board 
has a formal system to record conflicts 
and, if appropriate, to authorise them. 
Conflicts of interest are included as an 
agenda item at each Board meeting. 
When authorising conflicts or potential 
conflicts of interest, the Director 
concerned may not take part in the 
Board’s decision‑ making. Non‑ conflicted 
Directors are required to act in a way 
they consider would be in the best 
interests of the Company and most 
likely to promote its success. These 
procedures on conflicts of interest have 
been followed throughout the year, 
are overseen by the Nomination 
Committee and are considered to 
have operated effectively.
BOARD AND BOARD 
COMMITTEE EVALUATIONS
In accordance with the Code, 
Independent Board Evaluation (IBE), 
an external consultancy with no other 
connection to the Company, conducted 
an external evaluation exercise during 
the summer of 2017, the results of which 
are shown below. 
A comprehensive brief was provided to 
IBE, together with supporting materials, 
prior to their attending Board and 
committee meetings. Detailed interviews 
were conducted with each of the 
Directors, certain senior executives and 
the lead partners of the Group’s External 
Auditor, PwC and Internal Auditor, EY. 
Feedback was provided to the Chairman 
and the committee chairs and a report 
on the Chairman was presented to the 
Senior Independent Director. The overall 
findings of the evaluation were presented 
to the Board. Specific reports were also 
provided to each Board Committee. 
Overall, the evaluation found the Board 
to be operating effectively. Governance 
and compliance were areas rated 
particularly highly, with a strong 
performance recorded in the areas of 
strategy, shareholder accountability and 
relations, risk management, Board culture 
and focus and the relationship with 
senior management.
The key recommendation was to 
consider establishing annual Board 
strategic objectives to be reviewed at 
the end of each meeting and cascaded 
down to Board Committees as 
appropriate. This has now been done 
and the Executive Committee is 
establishing complementary objectives. 
In addition there were a number of 
governance related actions as follows:
l l Improving Board and Committee 
materials and information flows;
l l Introducing training for key senior 
managers on board functions and 
requirements to assist them in 
preparing for Board and Committee 
meetings;
l l Enhancing Director induction and 
onboarding;
l l Reviewing the Board skills matrix and 
succession plans to ensure the Board’s 
composition remains appropriate and 
identify any skills gaps; and
l l Undertaking deep dive reviews of 
specific risk areas which could 
potentially impact the Group’s strategy.
Further details of the 2017 Audit and 
Risk, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee evaluations are provided in 
the respective committee reports.
As part of the Board effectiveness 
review, and following conversations 
between the Chairman and each 
Director, the Nomination Committee 
reviewed the performance of all 
Directors (except the Chairman, whose 
performance review was led by the 
Senior Independent Director, without the 
Chairman being present). The Committee 
has recommended to the Board that all 
serving Directors (with the exception of 
Lorraine Trainer who is not standing for 
re‑ election) should be proposed by the 
Board for election or re‑ election as 
appropriate, at the forthcoming AGM. 
SUCCESSION PLANNING
The Nomination Committee is responsible 
for both Executive and Non‑ Executive 
Director succession planning and 
recommends new appointments to the 
Board. When making Board appointments, 
the Board seeks to ensure that there is a 
diverse range of skills, backgrounds and 
experience, including relevant industry 
experience. Further information is included 
in the Nomination Committee report.
DIRECTOR ELECTION  
AND RE-ELECTION
All Directors appointed by the Board 
are required by the Company’s Articles 
of Association and the Code to be 
elected by shareholders at the first AGM 
following their appointment by the Board. 
Accordingly, Roger Yates will be seeking 
election and his biographical details can 
be found earlier in this section. 
Also in accordance with the Code, all 
serving Directors with the exception of 
Lorraine Trainer, will seek re‑ election at 
the 2018 AGM. The Chairman believes 
that each Director continues to perform 
effectively, demonstrating commitment 
to their roles, and that their skills 
complement each other to enhance the 
Board’s overall operation. Full details of 
the skills and experience of all Directors 
can be found in their biographies earlier 
in this section.
ACCOUNTABILITY
The statement of Directors’ responsibility 
for preparing the Annual Report and 
Accounts is set out at the end of this 
Governance section. Within this, the 
Directors have included a statement that 
the Annual Report and Accounts present 
a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Group’s position and 
prospects. To help the Board discharge 
its responsibilities in this area, the Board 
consulted the Audit and Risk Committee, 
which advised on the key considerations 
to comply with best practice and the 
Code’s requirements. Following the 
Committee’s advice, the Board 
considered and concluded that:
l l the business model and strategy were 
clearly described;
l l the assessment of performance was 
balanced;
l l KPIs were used consistently;
l l the language used was concise, with 
good linkages to different parts of the 
document; and
l l an appropriate forward‑ looking 
orientation had been adopted.
The Directors’ report on viability and 
the going concern basis of accounting, 
which the Directors have determined to 
be appropriate, can be found in the 
Strategic report, which also describes the 
Group’s performance during the year.

GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK 
MANAGEMENT
The Board is responsible for the 
Group’s system of internal control and 
for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a 
system can provide only a reasonable 
assurance against material financial 
misstatement or loss and is designed to 
mitigate, not eliminate, risk.
The Board, assisted by the Audit and 
Risk Committee, periodically assesses 
the effectiveness of the internal controls. 
This review covered all material controls 
including the following compliance, 
operational and financial aspects:
l l Operational – Reviewing the method 
by which the Executive Committee 
gains assurance that the business 
operates within the risk appetite set 
by the Board and examining the whole 
of the Group’s control environment.
l l Operational – Reviewing the Risk 
Committee’s ‘Enterprise Risk 
Management Dashboard’ methodology 
and overseeing the roles of various 
committees in overseeing risk within the 
business. 
l l Financial – Receiving regular reports 
on the Group’s financial position, its 
progress against budget and ongoing 
forecast of its results. Through these 
regular updates, as well as the annual 
ICAAP process, the Board regularly 
reviews the Group’s balance sheet 
levels and capital requirements. The 
Audit and Risk Committee assists the 
Board in this area, reviewing the 
half‑ year and annual results, the 
ICAAP process and the Annual Report, 
before recommending these to the 
Board for approval. The Audit and 
Risk Committee regularly receives 
reports in relation to the key aspects 
of the financial reporting process. 
Reports on financial controls are also 
issued by Internal and External Audit.
l l Compliance – Overseeing the 
compliance framework operating 
throughout the Group and reviewing 
an annual report from the Money 
Laundering Reporting Officer on 
the Group’s anti‑ money laundering 
and fraud prevention (financial 
crime measures).
The Board believes that the ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the principal risks to achieving 
the Group’s strategic objectives works 
effectively. The process was in place 
for the year ended 31 December 2017 
and up to the date of approval of the 
Annual Report and Accounts. This 
process is regularly reviewed by the 
Board and complies with the guidance, 
‘Internal Controls Revised Guidance 
for Directors’. 
SUPPLIER OVERSIGHT AND 
SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTS
Jupiter has five significant oversight 
relationships: DST Financial Services 
(DST) (previously International Financial 
Data Services), HSBC Securities Services 
(HSBC), JP Morgan (Luxembourg) (JPML), 
National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) 
and Northern Trust (Northern).
In support of the unit trust fund range, 
DST’s services include dealing and 
registration processing, the distribution of 
income, record keeping and responding 
to customer enquiries. HSBC provides 
fund accounting services and passive 
hedging services. NatWest directly 
provides trustee services and delegates 
custody services to Northern.
JPML provides a range of services 
in support of the SICAVs, including 
depositary, custody, company secretarial, 
fund accounting, dealing and registration 
processing, the distribution of income, 
record keeping and responding to 
customer enquiries. 
These organisations’ activities are 
defined in service level agreements that 
are closely monitored to ensure that 
service delivery standards are met. 
Jupiter’s Supplier Management function 
oversees a suite of agreed activities, 
including: formal meeting governance; 
the review of key performance indicators; 
reviews by Jupiter’s’ assurance functions 
(including Service Delivery, Business 
Continuity, IT security, Enterprise Risk, 
Compliance and internal Audit where 
appropriate); site visits; and the review of 
key reports (including controls assurance 
reports and the financial report and 
accounts). Any risks or issues arising are 
progressed through to resolution and, 
where appropriate, escalated to Senior 
Management and reported to the Board. 
ASSURANCE PROCESS
The Group’s control environment is 
reviewed during the course of each year 
by one or more of the three assurance 
functions (Compliance, Enterprise Risk 
and Internal Audit). Assurance reports 
are provided to senior management, the 
Board and the Audit and Risk Committee 
as appropriate.
Each year Jupiter commissions the 
External Auditor to test the integrity 
of aspects of the control environment. 
The results of this testing, including any 
exceptions identified, are made available 
to the Group’s institutional and 
investment trust clients, as Jupiter has 
adopted the International Standard on 
Assurance Engagement (ISAE) 3402, 
together with AAF 01/06 as 
recommended by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants in England and 
Wales in the November 2010 technical 
release of AAF 01/06. 
RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
The Board has ultimate responsibility 
for the Group’s risk strategy and for 
determining an appropriate risk appetite, 
as well as the tolerance levels within which 
the Group must operate. By defining 
these, the Board demonstrates that it is 
aware of, and, where appropriate, has 
taken steps to mitigate the risks that may 
have a material impact on the Group.
To assist with its oversight of risk, the 
Executive Committee has formed an 
Executive Risk Committee chaired by the 
Chief Executive Officer. All members of 
the Executive Committee attend the Risk 
Committee, together with the Director of 
Compliance and Head of Risk. The 
Committee is responsible for overseeing 
all risk categories, within a coherent and 
manageable structure. 48
Governance
APPROACH TO RISK
The Board determines the appropriate approach to risks, within which the Group 
must operate. Risk tolerances are the Group’s actual boundaries and limits, through 
which the business monitors and, if appropriate, escalates concerns to the Board. 
Risks and the Group’s attitude to them are considered and monitored in the 
following categories:
1
Strategic risk 
The risk that the Group is unable to meet its strategic objectives, as a  
result of matters inherent in the nature of its business or the markets in  
which it operates
2
Investment risk
Underperformance of Jupiter funds relative to benchmarks, objectives or 
competition or other failure to meet investors’ objectives
3
Operational risk
The risk of loss caused by weaknesses or failures in the Group’s systems 
and controls, related to people, systems or processes. These include risks 
arising from failing to properly manage key outsourced relationships and 
cyber security
4
Capital adequacy risk
The risk that the Group has insufficient capital in relation to its risk profile to 
comply with regulatory requirements
5
Liquidity risk 
The risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources to 
meet its obligations as they fall due or can only secure such resources at 
excessive cost
6
Counterparty/credit risk
The risk of loss caused by the corporate failure of one of the trade, prime 
brokerage or treasury counterparties to which the Group may be exposed, 
or of a custodial institution with which the Group has a relationship
7
Market risk
The risk of loss arising from changes in the price of financial assets, interest 
rates or FX rates. This includes the risk that any market risk mitigation 
techniques used by the Group prove less effective than expected
RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS 
The departmental risk self‑ assessment 
process is the foundation of the Group’s 
risk framework. Each functional business 
area completes a risk assessment at 
least annually, and more frequently 
when required which, when taken in 
conjunction with the ongoing control 
performance assessments, is considered 
to be adequate for capturing any 
ongoing and emerging risks to 
the business.
The departmental risk self‑ assessments 
are conducted by the senior managers 
of each functional area and are 
facilitated by the Enterprise Risk team. 
This involves all material risks being 
reviewed with the risk owners against 
agreed key risk indicators and 
tolerances. The risk owners also consider 
any relevant operational losses that have 
occurred, as well as any current system, 
process or staffing changes within the 
department, together with the integrity of 
existing processes and controls. Where 
processes or controls are seen to be 
insufficiently robust, line management is 
required to define improvements to the 
operating environment to ensure they 
pose a minimal (or acceptable) level of 
risk to the Group.
Identified risks that have a sufficiently 
high likelihood of potential impact on the 
Group are reflected in the Enterprise Risk 
Management Dashboard, to ensure they 
receive an appropriately high level of 
senior management and Board attention. 
The Board takes action where these risks 
are deemed to be outside the Group’s 
risk tolerance.
The Group’s risk management assurance 
programme is closely linked with its 
compliance monitoring programme. 
Any breaches found by the Compliance 
department are recorded in the in‑ house 
error database and allocated to a failed 
control and the associated risk category. 
The business therefore considers any 
breaches as part of the risk and control 
assessment process.
Management, with the assistance of 
the Finance function, is responsible 
for maintaining appropriate financial 
records and processes that ensure 
all financial information is relevant, 
reliable, in accordance with the 
applicable laws and regulations and 
distributed both internally and externally 
in a timely manner.
Management reviews the consolidation 
and financial statements to ensure that 
the Group’s financial position and results 
are appropriately recorded, circulated 
to members of the Board and published 
where appropriate. All financial 
information published by the Group is 
subject to the Board’s approval on the 
recommendation of the Audit and 
Risk Committee.
MONITORING FUNCTIONS
The Group’s monitoring functions 
comprise the Compliance, Enterprise Risk 
and Internal Audit departments.
The Compliance department oversees 
the Group’s compliance with the relevant 
regulations. The Group maintains 
comprehensive procedures and 
compliance manuals, covering all 
business operations. The Compliance 
department also maintains detailed 
monitoring programmes for all regulated 
activities, to monitor the perceived 
regulatory risk within the business. The 
findings of the monitoring programmes 
are circulated to the responsible Director 
and Executive Committee member.
The Internal Audit function is currently 
outsourced to EY and is focused on 
ensuring that operations comply with 
the Group’s policies and procedures, 
including in relation to efficient 
operations, financial reporting, fraud, 
safeguarding assets and compliance 
with laws and regulations. The Internal 
Audit team is independent of business 
operations and has a reporting line to 
the Audit and Risk Committee. In 
addition, the Group periodically uses 
external parties to review counterparty 
relationships. This includes reviewing legal 
documentation as well as testing the 
operations of external service providers.
Further details of the Internal Audit 
function can be found in the Audit and 
Risk Committee report.

REMUNERATION
Executive Directors’ remuneration is 
structured to promote the long‑ term 
success of the business, with variable 
remuneration paid to Executive Directors 
based on stretching performance 
conditions which are aligned with the 
business strategy. No Executive Director 
is involved in deciding his or her own 
remuneration. Further information on 
Jupiter’s proposed new remuneration 
policy and Executive Director 
remuneration outcomes for 2017 is 
set out in the Remuneration Report.
CORPORATE VALUES 
AND CULTURE
Jupiter’s corporate values have 
underpinned its strategy for success, 
based on seeking long‑ term 
outperformance for clients. These values 
have long been deeply embedded 
in Jupiter’s culture and are clearly 
documented. Twice a year, during 
mid‑ year and annual reviews, staff are 
encouraged to review their performance 
against these values, to ensure our 
clients remain the key focus of their 
performance. 
The Board communicates through the 
Executive and Management Committees 
to all our staff to ensure Jupiter’s culture 
is preserved, with a focus on high 
performance, individual responsibility 
and putting clients first. This culture 
has helped retain and attract talented 
individuals. The Board seeks to ensure 
that its culture is reflected in all areas of 
the business and it is a vital lens through 
which the Board and its Committees look 
at elements of Jupiter’s business activities.
PEOPLE AND TALENT 
MANAGEMENT
Jupiter is a people business and the 
Board is focused on ensuring that it 
understands how the Group develops 
existing talent and brings new talent into 
the organisation. 2017 saw considerable 
developments in talent management, 
as detailed in the Strategic report. 
The Nomination Committee was involved 
in the recruitment of the more senior 
hires, with the Remuneration Committee 
integrally involved in ensuring that Jupiter 
has the right reward structure to enable 
it to recruit and retain talent. At every 
meeting, the Board receives an update 
on key people issues, including the 
broad themes affecting the management 
of talent in the asset management 
industry and succession planning for 
the efficient execution of the Group’s 
growth strategy.
RELATIONS WITH 
SHAREHOLDERS
Communication with shareholders is 
a high priority and is conducted to 
promote a common understanding of the 
Group’s strategic objectives and current 
performance. The Group has an Investor 
Relations function within the Finance 
team, which supports the Chief Executive 
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer in 
their relations with shareholders and sell 
side analysts. Through the Investor Relations 
function, Jupiter maintains a regular 
dialogue with interested shareholders, 
potential investors and industry analysts, 
as well as ensuring that the Group 
adheres to both regulatory changes and 
best practice issuance from other bodies. 
During 2017, the Chief Executive Officer, 
Chief Financial Officer and Head of 
Finance held over 100 shareholder and 
investor meetings, using the materials 
published at the time of the most recent 
results. These meetings were separate to 
the AGM and the briefings provided at the 
time of the announcement of the half‑ year 
and full‑ year results. Presentations to 
analysts and investors are simultaneously 
posted on the Company’s website, 
to ensure they are available to all 
interested parties. All Directors are 
invited to attend these presentations.
As part of the process of ensuring that 
good channels of communication are 
in place, and in order to maintain an 
understanding of the view of the major 
shareholders about the Company and its 
strategy, meetings are arranged with the 
Chairman following which a full briefing 
is provided to the Board. The following 
issues were discussed:
l l investment and development strategy 
and performance;
l l Board and management structure and 
succession;
l l regulation and the FCA’s market study;
l l corporate culture and gender diversity 
at Jupiter;
l l AGM resolutions; and
l l executive remuneration.
During the latter part of the year, 
those larger shareholders were also 
invited to meet with the Chairman and 
Bridget Macaskill, the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee, to consult 
on the proposed changes to the 
remuneration policy. Representatives 
of the Company’s largest shareholders 
attended these meetings. Jonathon Bond, 
in his capacity as Senior Independent 
Director, has attended meetings with some 
major shareholders during the latter half 
of the year (since his appointment to 
the role). He is also available to meet 
shareholders on request, if they have 
concerns that contact through the 
Chairman has failed to resolve, or for 
which such contact is not appropriate. 
Shareholders are encouraged to attend 
the AGM and to put their questions to the 
Directors and to the Chairmen of the 
Board committees in person. In order to 
support shareholders prior to the 
consideration of the Company’s resolutions 
at the AGM, the Company Secretary 
maintains contact with a number of 
well‑ known voting bodies including ISS, 
IVIS, and Glass Lewis, to ensure all relevant 
information concerning the Company and 
its strategy is made available.
The Company communicates 
electronically with its shareholders 
whenever possible. To reduce wasted 
resources and pollution associated with 
paper printing, shareholders are 
encouraged to accept electronic access 
to the Notice of Meeting and Annual 
Report and Accounts, which will be 
made available at least 20 working days 
prior to the AGM on the Company’s 
website at www.jupiteram.com

* Roger Yates was appointed to the Committee on 10 October 2017 
Details of attendance by members of Board committees are set out in the Governance report. While only members of the 
Committee have the right to attend its meetings, from time to time others are invited to attend the discussion of particular 
agenda items, including other Directors, senior management and external recruitment consultants.
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
The Nomination Committee has an 
important role in ensuring the Board and 
its Committees have the right 
composition, a good balance of the 
experience and skills required to perform 
their duties, and appropriate diversity of 
thought and perspective. 
The Committee undertakes succession 
planning for both Executive and Non‑ Executive Directors and makes 
recommendations to the Board when 
changes may be appropriate. There was 
one change to the membership of the 
Board during the year, with the 
appointment of Roger Yates as a 
Non‑ Executive Director on 10 October 
2017. Roger Yates has substantial and 
recent asset management experience 
both in the UK and internationally which 
the Board considered would be valuable 
as Jupiter continues to pursue its 
strategic goals. 
During the summer Lorraine Trainer 
stepped down as Senior Independent 
Director (having served in this capacity 
since September 2014) and as Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee (having 
served from May 2010). Jonathon Bond, 
who joined the Board in July 2014, was 
appointed as Senior Independent 
Director and Bridget Macaskill, who is an 
experienced Remuneration Committee 
Chairman, was appointed as 
Remuneration Committee Chairman. 
Lorraine will not be seeking re‑ election 
at the 2018 AGM, having served as a 
Non‑ Executive Director for eight years.  
In keeping with the Board’s continual 
process of refreshing its membership, a 
recruitment process will be commenced 
in the summer of 2018.
As a people business, one of Jupiter’s 
key risks relates to attracting and 
retaining talented people and ensuring 
appropriate succession arrangements 
are in place. Succession planning for 
executive Directors and senior executives 
has been a key area of focus for the 
Committee. It has also overseen the 
executive team’s drive to broaden the 
leadership group and its initiatives aimed 
at improving talent and career 
development for all staff.
The Committee has also continued to 
focus on diversity matters and has 
reviewed the progress made in 
implementing the Company’s diversity 
and inclusion policy. This was noted by 
the Hampton‑ Alexander review, where 
Jupiter was one of only three companies 
to have gender equality on the Board. 
The Board is cognisant that diversity is 
more than gender and during the year 
the Vice‑ Chairman, CFO and HR 
Director, together with a number of 
employees, have been actively involved 
in the industry‑ wide Diversity Project. This 
project has a number of practical 
workstreams to promote better diversity 
practices across the financial sector. 
We will continue to focus on succession 
planning, talent‑ management, Board 
recruitment and diversity throughout 
2018.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT 51
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE’S WORK IN 2017 
The Committee meets at least twice each 
year, with further meetings taking place 
as required, for example to consider 
non‑ executive or senior executive 
recruitment as it arises. Three meetings 
were scheduled in 2017 and one further 
meeting took place. The Committee 
reports formally to the Board on its 
proceedings. Liz Airey chairs the 
Committee but does not do so when the 
Chairman’s appointment is being 
considered.
Each year the Nomination Committee 
evaluates the Board’s and the Board 
Committees’ balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge. This 
informs its assessment of the Board’s 
development, Committee composition 
and helps it prepare a description of the 
role and responsibilities required for 
each new Board appointment. During 
2017, there was one new Board 
appointment. 
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR 
APPOINTMENT
In carrying out this work, the Committee 
determines the best selection process, 
choosing the right recruitment firm to 
help identify external candidates, as well 
as identifying internal candidates itself. 
Selected candidates are interviewed by 
members of the Committee and meet 
other Directors and senior managers as 
appropriate, before being recommended 
to the Board, which makes the final 
decision on Board appointments.
The Committee appointed an 
independent consultant, Russell Reynolds, 
to recruit a Non‑ Executive Director as 
part of its continuing role of reviewing 
and refreshing the Board’s composition. 
Russell Reynolds does not have any 
other connection to the Company, other 
than having been used for a previous 
Board recruitment. The Committee 
specified the skills, knowledge and 
experience required. Roger Yates was 
selected and joined the Board in 
October 2017.  
Following Lorraine’s retirement at the 
2018 AGM, the Committee will define the 
specific skills, knowledge and experience 
required in order to initiate a search for 
a new independent Non‑ Executive 
Director in the summer of 2018.  
Details of other commitments held by the 
Chairman and Non‑ Executive Directors 
are set out in their respective 
biographies. 
EXECUTIVE APPOINTMENTS 
AND DEVELOPMENT
The Committee has continued to oversee 
the talent management and development 
of senior executives. This has included:
l l the ongoing development of the 
Executive Committee;
l l consideration of talent acquisition, 
retention, succession planning and 
diversity; and
l l employee engagement including 
actions from the 2017 Employee 
Opinion Survey.
The Committee has also overseen a 
pairing arrangement with each Non‑ Executive Director having one or two of 
the senior executives meet with them 
during the year. The purpose of this is to 
increase the Non‑ Executive Director’s 
understanding of particular areas of 
Jupiter’s business and for the senior 
executives to better understand the 
Non‑ Executive Director’s role in the 
Company.
COMMITTEE EFFECTIVENESS
An externally facilitated Board and 
Committee evaluation was carried out in 
2017 by Independent Board Evaluation. 
The review found the Committee was 
operating effectively and highlighted the 
quality of recent Board appointments. 
However the challenges in identifying an 
extensive list of suitably qualified and 
diverse candidates, particularly in the 
investment sector were also noted. In 
addition to a number of housekeeping 
matters, the review also identified areas 
of focus for the Committee during 2018, 
namely:
l l talent‑ management within the 
organisation; 
l l further development of the skills 
matrix;
l l continued focus on succession 
planning and diversity across the 
Group; and
l l enhancements to the Board 
recruitment and interview process.
As previously disclosed Lorraine Trainer 
will not be seeking re‑ election at the 
forthcoming AGM. All other Directors will 
be seeking re‑ election or (in the case of 
Roger Yates) election at the AGM on 
16 May 2018. The Committee has 
reviewed the Directors standing for 
election or re‑ election (with Committee 
members recusing themselves in respect 
of their own review), taking into account 
their effectiveness and commitment. It 
has also considered the independence of 
the Non‑ Executive Directors and is 
satisfied that they are independent in 
both character and judgement, in 
accordance with the Code. The 
Committee therefore recommended to 
the Board all of the Directors standing 
for election or re‑ election at the AGM. 
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
The Committee believes that diversity 
among Board members, including 
gender diversity, is of great value and 
carefully considers this in making new 
Board or senior executive appointments. 
The Company’s policy on Board diversity 
is available at www.jupiteram.com 
The Hampton‑ Alexander Review sets a 
target of 33% women on FTSE 350 
Boards and I am pleased to confirm that 
Jupiter exceeds this target and is one of 
the few FTSE 350 Boards to have female 
directors constituting 50% of the Board. 
Currently 22% of the Executive 
Committee are female members, against 
the target recommendation of 33%.  The 
Group continues to implement a diversity 
and inclusion policy, to give greater 
emphasis to supporting diversity 
throughout Jupiter. Further details of our 
initiatives in this area, together with the 
key Group metrics, can be found in the 
Talent and Culture section of the 
Strategic Report. The Nomination 
Committee continues to monitor diversity 
within the business, as well as the goals 
set under the diversity and inclusion 
policy. 
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
During the year, the Committee 
continued its review of the Board’s 
operation of the Conflict of Interest 
policy. Further details of the operation 
of this policy can be found in the 
Governance section. 52
Governance
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
The Audit and Risk Committee is integral 
to helping ensure good governance 
throughout the Group. The Committee is 
responsible for overseeing and advising 
the Board on the integrity and 
effectiveness of the Group’s financial 
reporting, the effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management framework 
and internal control procedures. We 
also oversee the relationships with 
the Group’s External Auditor and the 
Internal Audit function.
As Chairman of the Audit and Risk 
Committee, I report to the Board after 
each meeting on the items reviewed and 
debated, how the Committee has 
discharged its responsibilities and, where 
appropriate, any recommendations to 
the Board resulting from the meetings. 
I am pleased to present our report for 
2017, which provides you with an 
overview of the Committee and insight  
to the Committee’s work during the year.
AREAS OF FOCUS IN 2017
A full review of the Committee’s activities 
during 2017 can be found on pages  
54 – 58. 
In addition to the regular agenda items 
the Committee focused on a number of 
areas throughout the year. One of the 
key items was the review of the 
significant change programmes being 
implemented by the Group. These 
included the work streams to ensure 
compliance with MiFID II, the investments 
in the Group’s operating platform and 
the Governance, Risk and Controls 
Programme which includes corporate 
governance enhancements (as detailed 
in the Governance section on page 40), 
developments in business process 
management and the risk control 
self‑ assessment process. The Committee 
monitored the implementation of these 
programmes by reviewing the progress 
of each against the planned timetable, 
ensuring that they met regulatory 
requirements and that implementation 
risks were managed appropriately. These 
programmes were of critical importance 
to the Group and I am pleased with the 
Committee’s oversight role.
The Committee also reviewed and 
challenged management’s use of 
alternative performance measures and 
ensured that these were relevant and 
only used where they would provide a 
better understanding of the Group’s 
performance. 
THE COMMITTEE’S MEMBERS
Lorraine Trainer, Jonathon Bond and  
Karl Sternberg served with me on the 
Committee throughout the year. Every 
member has fully engaged in the 
Committee’s work and their contributions 
to Committee discussions have been 
positive, well informed and demonstrate 
sufficient challenge. As previously 
disclosed Lorraine Trainer will be 
stepping down at the conclusion of the 
2018 AGM and I would like to thank her 
for her valuable contribution to the 
Committee’s work during her tenure. 
COMMITTEE EFFECTIVENESS 
REVIEW
In June, a review of the effectiveness of 
the Committee was facilitated externally 
by Independent Board Evaluation.
In addition to observing the May 
Committee meeting, detailed interviews 
were held with every Committee member, 
members of executive management and 
the lead external and internal audit 
partners. 
I am pleased to say that the results  
of this review were very positive. The 
Committee was found to be diligent, 
rigorous in its reviews and operating 
effectively. A number of helpful 
suggestions were made in relation to 
future areas of focus for the Committee. 
In addition, recommendations on further 
improvements to the Committee’s papers, 
which are circulated in advance of each 
meeting, were also made and these will 
be progressed during 2018. 
TERMS OF REFERENCE
In our December meeting, we reviewed 
the Committee’s Terms of Reference 
(TOR) and an updated version was 
approved by the Board for adoption. 
These revisions further clarified the roles 
and responsibilities of the Committee but 
have not changed the duties or practices 
followed. For instance, one of the 
amendments included the requirement 
for a member of the Committee to be a 
member of the Remuneration Committee, 
a practice which has been followed for 
some time. 
The Committee’s terms of reference are 
published on the Company’s website at 
www.jupiteram.com
LOOKING FORWARD
It is anticipated that key areas of focus 
for the Committee throughout 2018, in 
addition to it’s core functions, will be to:
l l continue to monitor the implementation 
of the Governance Risks & Controls 
Programme, including preparation for 
compliance with the FCA’s Senior 
Managers Certification Regime and 
enhancements to the overall 
governance regime;
l l review the processes and controls in 
place to ensure compliance with the 
General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR) and ensure any improvements 
to such controls are duly implemented; 
and
l l undertake an in‑ depth review of the 
controls in place to mitigate the 
Group’s exposure to financial crime.
I am looking forward to meeting our 
shareholders at our AGM on 16 May 
2018, to answer questions about the 
Committee’s work.

In addition to its regular meetings, the 
Committee Chairman maintains a close 
and open dialogue with executive 
management and the Group’s assurance 
functions throughout the year. 
Detailed below is an overview of the key 
areas considered by the Committee 
under each of the Committee’s core 
areas of responsibility.
FINANCE
Review of the Annual Report 
and Accounts
The Committee reviewed the half‑ year 
financial statements in July. The financial 
statements for the year ended 
31 December 2017 were reviewed in 
February 2018.
Financial reporting processes
The Committee receives updates on 
future accounting developments under 
IFRS and how these will impact the 
Group. The Committee agreed with 
management’s assessment that the 
changes, effective from 1 January 2018, 
would have minimal impact on the 
financial position and public disclosures 
of the Group.
The Committee considered the 
accounting issues and significant matters 
of judgement impacting the preparation 
of the 2017 accounts. As a matter of 
good practice, the External Auditor was 
asked for its view of the judgements 
made by management and all relevant 
issues were scrutinised and challenged 
by the Committee. The table below 
details the reporting issues, the role of 
the Committee and the conclusion of the 
judgement.

and demonstrated that there was 
significant headroom available. The 
Committee agreed with managements 
view that no impairment of the 
goodwill was required
Trade and other 
receivables/
payables
Deferred income
The Company receives upfront 
payments for initial charges on 
sales of unit trusts and associated 
distribution costs. However, under 
accounting standards, these 
payments are deferred and 
recognised over the anticipated life 
of the investment management 
services
The Committee considered the 
historical average period of 
investment services provided 
to clients and any 
developments which may 
impact these trends
The Committee agreed the assumptions 
for the periods of deferral/recognition 
of revenue and expenses in line with 
historical averages
Bonus payments 
Bonus payments to employees are 
not made until after the financial 
year‑ end but before the finalisation 
of the Annual Report and therefore 
an accrual is made in accordance 
with the calculated bonus pool and 
amounts approved by the 
Remuneration Committee. Certain 
assumptions, mainly surrounding 
employee’s ability to opt to defer 
into fund units or shares, were 
required to be assessed
The Committee tested the 
model for calculating 
accounting charges for the 
bonus deferral schemes and 
assessed the deferral 
assumptions used
The Committee confirmed that the use 
of the previous year’s actual deferral 
rates was appropriate for the 
assumptions and the model for 
calculating accounting charges was 
appropriate
Input VAT
As disclosed in previous Annual 
Reports, in 2013 HMRC issued a 
revised assessment in relation to 
input VAT recovered by Jupiter 
Asset Management Group Limited 
since September 2009, which has 
yet to be fully settled. It is 
anticipated this will result in monies 
being returned to the Group and 
an appropriate receivable is in the 
accounts
The Committee challenged 
management on the current 
level of receivable as held in 
the accounts
The Committee noted that some 
elements of the dispute had been 
settled and that the remaining 
receivable was appropriate
Consolidation of 
funds
The Group is required to 
consolidate entities under the 
control of Jupiter Fund 
Management plc into the Group 
accounts.  In addition to Group 
owned companies, this includes 
certain funds whereby the Group 
acts as the fund manager and 
owns a significant proportion of the 
fund (for example funds that have 
been seeded by the Group)
The Committee considered the 
requirements of the 
accounting standard, 
particularly relating to the 
definition of control
It was agreed that any investment for 
which the Group holds an interest 
amounting to 30% or more, should be 
consolidated unless this can be 
rebutted based on specific 
circumstances (for instance another 
investor in the Fund holding a greater 
percentage) 56

AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
Judgement area Reporting issue Role of the Committee Conclusion
Long-term viability The directors are required to make 
a statement in the Annual Report 
regarding the long‑ term viability of 
the Company. This can be found in 
the Financial Review section of the 
Strategic Report
The Committee reviewed the 
proposed viability statement 
considering if the period of 
three years remained the most 
appropriate period over which 
Jupiter’s viability should be 
considered
The Committee considered the Group’s 
strategic plan, it’s financial plan, the 
ICAAP, the Group’s business and cash 
flow projections and the current net 
cash balance and loan facilities 
available to the Group. The Committee 
challenged management on forecasts 
and projections and reviewed the levels 
of surplus capital and cash liquidity. 
The Committee recommended to the 
Board that the viability statement be 
approved
Fair, balanced and 
understandable
The Directors are required to 
ensure that the Annual Report is 
fair, balanced and understandable
The Committee first reviewed 
the Strategic Report and 
considered that the 
information being 
communicated relating to the 
business model, strategy and 
risks was understandable and 
clear. It then reviewed the 
whole of the report, including 
the notes to the accounts and 
disclosures to ensure it was 
fair, balanced and 
understandable
The Committee advised the Board that, 
in its view, the Annual Report and 
Accounts taken as a whole was fair, 
balanced and understandable and 
provided shareholders with the 
necessary information to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy
Going concern The Directors are required to 
decide whether to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the half‑ year and annual 
financial statements for the 
year ended 31 December 2017
The Committee reviewed a 
number of factors such as 
liquidity management and 
cash generation from 
operations, contingent 
liabilities, unfavourable market 
scenarios versus the Group’s 
core forecasts and other risks 
to the Group’s operations or 
balance sheet position
The Committee considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the half‑ year and annual 
financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2017, and did not identify 
any material uncertainties or notify the 
Board of any qualifications or 
assumptions as to the Company’s 
ability to continue to do so over a 
period of at least 12 months from the 
date of approving such financial 
statements
RISK MANAGEMENT AND 
INTERNAL CONTROLS 
The Head of Risk provides reports to the 
Committee, at each meeting on the work 
of the firm’s Risk Committee including 
any updates to the Group’s risk profile, 
the effectiveness of the Group’s 
enterprise risk framework and internal 
controls, with applicable risk dashboards. 
This includes the Group’s emerging, 
strategic and operational risk areas and 
conduct and regulatory risks.
The General Counsel also regularly 
attends the Committee’s meetings, to 
advise on current legal and regulatory 
matters including any litigation and 
intellectual property issues affecting any 
Group company. 
DURING THE YEAR, 
THE COMMITTEE:
l l received quarterly reports on the 
progress of the Group’s ICAAP 
process, which enabled it to provide 
feedback throughout the process on 
various scenarios and assumptions 
utilised. The Committee reviewed and

GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
EXTERNAL AUDITOR
PwC is the Group’s External Auditor, 
having been reappointed following a 
formal tender in 2014. Jeremy Jensen was 
the lead audit Partner throughout 2017.
The Statutory Audit Services for  
Large Companies Market Investigation 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive 
Tender Processes and Audit 
Committee Responsibilities) Order 
2014 – statement of compliance
The Company confirms that it has 
complied with the provisions of the CMA 
Order 2014 for the financial year under 
review. The Company intends to retender 
the external audit contract no later than 
2024.
Each year the External Auditor presents 
to the Committee the proposed scope of 
its full‑ year audit plan, together with a 
review plan for the half‑ year. This 
includes its assessment of the material 
risks to the Group’s financial statements 
and its proposed materiality levels, for 
the Committee’s discussion and 
agreement. In 2017, PwC attended all of 
the Committee’s regular meetings and 
also provided reports on specific topics 
requested by the Committee, which 
included the CASS audit and associated 
audit opinions.
The Audit and Risk Committee has 
primary responsibility for the Group’s 
relationship with the External Auditor. 
A review of the effectiveness of the 
External Auditor was undertaken by 
means of a questionnaire, which was 
completed by members of the 
Committee, one member of the Board, 
and the Finance and Compliance teams. 
The questionnaire consisted of questions 
on a variety of sections including the 
quality of people and service, robustness 
of audit, quality of delivery and audit 
fees. PwC was found to have performed 
effectively during the audit and was 
responding constructively to new 
challenges. A summary of the 
questionnaire’s findings was discussed at 
the Committee’s meeting in July and the 
Committee Chairman then discussed the 
action points with Jeremy Jensen. The 
Jupiter audit for the year ended 
31 December 2016 was chosen by the 
Financial Reporting Council (FRC) for an 
Audit Quality Review (AQR) as part of 
their routine quality monitoring process. 
The AQR team engaged with the 
Committee during the inspection process 
and the Committee were satisfied that 
no matters arose which required action.
The Committee reviewed and approved 
PwC’s terms of engagement and the 
proposed fee for the 2017 audit. The 
Committee has reviewed and satisfied 
itself with respect to the External 
Auditor’s qualifications, expertise, 
resources and independence. It continues 
to believe that PwC conducts its audit 
work with objectivity and to a high 
standard. This was reviewed and 
discussed by the Committee. It 
considered the External Auditor’s 
proposed audit scope and plan at the 
October meeting and found it to be 
effective. There are no contractual 
obligations restricting Jupiter’s choice of 
External Auditor, other than in respect of 
EY’s appointment as Internal Auditor.
The Committee has a primary 
responsibility to safeguard the External 
Auditor’s objectivity and independence. 
A non‑ audit services policy, which was 
approved by the Board in December 
2016 and implemented from 1 January 
2017 assures compliance with the EU 
Audit Regulation by 2020 as required by 
the Regulation. It confirms a list of 
services which the External Auditor is not 
permitted to provide to the Group, 
including advice in relation to its tax 
affairs. The policy caps the value of 
non‑ audit services that can be spent in 
any one year to 70% of the average 
statutory audit fee in the previous three 
year rolling period and prescribes the 
activities for which PwC may be retained 
to assist Jupiter outside the audit. The 
policy requires that all non‑ audit spend, 
for services which are permissible under 
the policy, amounting to £50,000 or 
more must by pre‑ approved by the 
Committee. For permissible services 
amounting to between £30,000 and 
£50,000 prior approval from the CFO 
must be sought. For all amounts below 
this threshold the Head of Finance can 
approve.
Regular reports are circulated to the 
Committee setting out the non‑ audit 
services provided by the External Auditor 
throughout the year to date and the 
fees charged. These services mainly 
related to the review of the interim 
results, audit of the assurance controls 
report, CASS audits, remuneration 
advisory services and advice relating to 
the provision of professional services to 
the Luxembourg based management 
company. There are areas of assurance 
where the work being done is, in the 
view of the Group, similar in type and 
scope to the work performed during the 
audit and as such, can be provided 
more efficiently and cost effectively by 
the auditor. We continue to look at these 
items on a case by case basis, to 
determine whether PwC is the 
appropriate supplier. A different supplier 
would be considered where it would not 
be detrimental to the Group. 
An analysis of fees paid in respect of 
PwC’s audit and non‑ audit services is 
included within Note 1.3 of the Financial 
Statements. The Board has 
recommended the reappointment of PwC 
as External Auditor, which will be put to 
shareholders at the AGM on 16 May 
2018.

Governance
COMPLIANCE 
The Head of Compliance reports to the 
Committee at each meeting which 
includes a compliance risk dashboard, 
comprehensive updates on regulatory 
developments, an update on staff 
compliance training and departmental 
resourcing. 
During the year, the Committee reviewed:
l l the Group’s ongoing compliance with 
the Market Abuse regulation and 
recommended to the Board the 
adoption of revised policies and 
procedures; 
l l reviewed the implementation of the 
plan to ensure compliance with MiFID 
II;
l l considered the Group’s preparedness 
for the enforcement of the GDPR and 
the Senior Managers Certification 
Regime;
l l approved the annual compliance plan;
l l monitored various change programmes 
designed to ensure compliance with 
the evolving regulatory framework;
l l reviewed the updated whistleblowing 
policy and procedures, which provide 
improved facilities for employees to 
report any concerns and confirmed 
the appointment of Polly Williams as 
the Group’s whistleblowing champion; 
and
l l reviewed reports regarding the 
adoption and integration of a new 
compliance system.
INTERNAL AUDIT 
EY has provided the Group’s Internal 
Audit function since 2008. The Internal 
Auditor reports directly to the Chairman 
of the Audit and Risk Committee and, in 
addition to submitting status reports for 
each Committee meeting, provides 
Committee members with copies of any 
internal audit reports completed between 
meetings. The status reports tabled at 
meetings include findings and 
recommendations, as well as the Group’s 
progress with implementing previous 
recommendations. These help inform the 
Committee’s discussion of any required 
follow‑ up. The Committee works with the 
Internal Auditor to ensure that its work is 
embedded in the business and is 
co‑ ordinated with that of the External 
Auditor.
The 2017 audit plan was reviewed and 
approved by the Committee, with audit 
fieldwork completed during the year. The 
plan was designed and assessed against 
the Enterprise Risk Management 
Framework of the Group and focused on 
aspects of Jupiter’s strategic risks.
Seventeen audits were conducted in the 
period. The audits included:
l l CASS governance;
l l investment Risk Framework review;
l l cyber security review; 
l l ICAAP; and
l l a Market Abuse regulation review.
These reviews have helped the Group to 
implement more robust control 
procedures. Internal Audit continues to 
work closely with the firm’s Risk and 
Compliance teams to ensure a holistic 
approach to the provision of assurance 
in the Group.
The Committee has agreed seven audits 
will follow in H1 2018. The basis of the H1 
2018 audit plan will be the enterprise 
strategic risks, with particular emphasis 
on the implementation of new operating 
platforms and adherence to new 
regulatory requirements.
2017 REVIEW OF THE 
EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL 
AUDIT
As part of good governance it is vital 
that the independence of the Internal 
Audit function is maintained. The 
Committee reviewed and confirmed the 
continued independence of EY. In order 
to further improve governance, the 
Committee agreed to introduce guidance 
and procedures to monitor the services 
EY are utilised for, outside of the scope 
of Internal Audit. These were adopted 
and implemented during the year. The 
guidance details the types of services EY 
should not supply and places restrictions 
on the amount of fees, outside of the 
Internal Audit fees, payable to EY in any 
one year. In addition, all services 
proposed to be supplied by EY, must be 
approved by either the Head of Finance 
or the Chief Financial Officer.
The effectiveness of Internal Audit was 
reviewed by the Committee in the 
October and December meetings. A 
two‑ stage evaluation process comprising 
a survey and analysis of key Internal 
Audit Metrics was undertaken. The 
survey was distributed to the Chairman, 
members of the Committee, senior 
management and other senior 
employees who had been involved in 
Internal Audit’s work throughout the year. 
The key performance metrics were split 
into three categories: people and 
process; coverage; and value. Although 
a good level of satisfaction was reported 
in most of the responses received, 
certain areas of possible improvement 
were identified. In addition, the 
Committee received a third party 
assessment of the Internal Audit function. 
The review examined the key attributes 
of the existing service and suggested 
changes for the future. The effectiveness 
of the existing Internal Audit approach 
was considered and alternative models 
were examined.
Having considered the findings of this 
assessment, the Committee remains of 
the view that outsourcing the function to 
a specialist independent provider is 
appropriate and allows for the provision 
of subject experts as required. It was 
noted that the lead partner would be 
rotated in 2018. Following a 
comprehensive interview process 
involving the Chairman, Chief Executive 
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Risk 
Officer and General Counsel, Amarjit 
Singh was approved as the new lead 
Internal Audit partner. 59

GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
I am pleased to present our Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for 2017, my first as 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee. I 
would like to thank my predecessor, 
Lorraine Trainer, for her leadership over 
the previous six and a half years, and 
her on‑ going valuable contribution as a 
member of the Committee.
The 2017 report is split into two parts:
l l The Directors’ Remuneration Policy. 
This is subject to a binding vote and 
sets out our future policy for approval 
by shareholders.
l l The Annual Report on Remuneration. 
This outlines how we implemented our 
current policy in 2017 and how we 
intend to apply the new Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy in 2018. This is 
subject to an advisory vote by 
shareholders.
To reflect changes resulting from our 
proposed new Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy, we are also putting forward new 
rules for our deferred bonus and 
long‑ term incentive plans for shareholder 
approval at our 2018 AGM.
REMUNERATION REVIEW AND 
NEW POLICY
Our existing remuneration arrangements 
for Executive Directors were put in place 
when Jupiter listed in 2010 and were 
approved by shareholders in 2014, and 
again in 2017 for a limited twelve month 
period. It is now time to seek reapproval 
of our policy from shareholders and, 
given the changes in best practice and 
regulatory and investor remuneration 
guidelines since 2010, we believe that it is 
now necessary to rebalance our 
remuneration arrangements and adopt a 
structure in line with these developments. 
I am grateful to all the shareholders and 
investor bodies who have continued their 
positive engagement with Jupiter 
throughout 2017. This has allowed us to 
develop a new policy which reflects the 
feedback from investors, whilst continuing 
to ensure the remuneration arrangements 
support our business strategy and reflect 
regulatory requirements.
Our proposals are not intended to 
increase overall remuneration 
opportunity for Executive Directors; they 
are designed to keep total remuneration 
opportunity in the same range as recent 
compensation, and the potential upside 
has now been capped. We propose to 
rebalance the remuneration structure, 
adopting a more market conventional 
approach through introducing a cap on 
the maximum incentive opportunity by 
reference to a multiple of salary and 
increasing the base salary. Under the 
proposed approach a greater 
proportion of the overall package will be 
delivered in the form of share‑ based 
incentives and awards under which 
performance will be assessed on a 
multi‑ year basis, including over five 
years. We consider that this increase in 
weighting towards longer‑ term 
performance‑ based awards offsets the 
increase in salary.
The key changes to our Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy are summarised 
below and are set out in more detail in 
the remainder of this report on pages 63 
to 69.
Reinforcing long-term value strategy
The objective of our corporate strategy 
is to deliver long‑ term value to clients 
and shareholders. The remuneration 
structure in the proposed new policy will 
align more closely with this objective by 
increasing focus on long‑ term results 
through a number of changes.
Removal of salary cap
Our current policy contains a £250,000 
per annum cap on salaries that applies 
throughout Jupiter. Whilst appropriate in 
the immediate period post Jupiter’s 
listing, this cap has become increasingly 
uncompetitive in the market, limiting 
internal progression and leading to high 
proportions of variable pay when 
applying individual caps on incentive 
plans. The proposed new policy will 
enable us to provide market competitive 
salaries within a rebalanced pay 
framework. Any future salary increases 
for incumbent Executive Directors during 
the policy period will be limited to the 
same level as the average increase in 
employee salaries.
Introducing capped incentives
Our current policy contains no limits on 
the amounts that individual Executive 
Directors can be awarded under 
incentive schemes. Practice in the asset 
management sector has evolved with an 
increasing number of companies now 
operating incentive caps so as to comply 
with investor guidelines. Our proposed 
new policy will introduce individual 
incentive caps on both bonus and LTIP 
to bring us in line with best practice and 
reflects a response to shareholder 
feedback.
Simplification
Our current remuneration arrangements 
involve a large number of corporate 
financial measures which make them 
relatively complex. The proposed new 
policy will reduce the number of measures 
used and, as a result, simplify the structure.
Governance features
In addition, there are a number of 
additional features within the new policy 
which align with current governance 
guidelines and best practices for 
executive pay in listed companies:
l l Around 90% of the Chief Executive’s 
maximum annual remuneration 
package (and approximately 80% of 
the Chief Financial Officer’s) will be 
subject to performance conditions. 
l l Future Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) 
awards granted to Executive Directors 
will be subject to a two‑ year post‑ vesting holding period, bringing the 
total timescale for awards to five 
years.
l l Executive Director annual bonus and 
LTIP awards are subject to the 
satisfaction of a risk, conduct and 
compliance underpin. Future LTIP 
awards will also only vest subject to 
satisfaction of an additional underlying 
business performance underpin.
l l Executive Director incentive awards 
are subject to malus and clawback 
provisions.
l l Executive Directors are required to 
build up and retain significant holdings 
of Jupiter shares (300% of salary for 
the Chief Executive; 200% of salary for 
other Executive Directors). This is an 
upper quartile shareholding 
requirement for companies in the FTSE 
250 index.
l l Jupiter offers a consistent level of pension 
provision to its UK workforce, including 
Executive Directors, of 15% of salary.
REMUNERATION REPORT 60
Governance
THE LINK BETWEEN STRATEGY 
AND REMUNERATION
Jupiter’s primary focus is on delivering 
value to clients through long‑ term 
investment outperformance after all fees. 
Jupiter’s business model of combining this 
investment outperformance with an 
effective distribution platform, supported 
by efficient and scaleable operations, 
allows us to deliver value to our 
shareholders. Jupiter’s strategic growth has 
enabled us to deliver significant value to 
shareholders since listing in 2010, through a 
progressive ordinary dividend policy, 
special dividend and via capital 
appreciation. 
Jupiter’s remuneration policy will continue 
to support the delivery of the Company’s 
growth strategy, and it is important to 
ensure that an appropriate balance is 
maintained in how the Company’s 
profitability is shared between staff and 
shareholders, after ensuring adequate 
capital is retained to maintain a strong 
balance sheet. The table below 
demonstrates how Jupiter’s remuneration 
policy for Executive Directors successfully 
supports the continued delivery of 
Jupiter’s business model.
PERFORMANCE AND 
REMUNERATION FOR 2017
As discussed throughout this Annual 
Report, 2017 delivered a continuation of 
Jupiter’s growth strategy. This was 
anchored in the investment performance 
of our mutual funds where 81% of AUM 
performed above median over three 
years, after all fees. This strong long‑ term 
investment performance translated into 
high levels of positive net flows across 
our funds, totalling £5.5bn for the year, 
174% ahead of budget. Combined with 
positive markets, AUM closed at £50.2bn 
at year end, up 24% year‑ on‑ year.
Incentive awards for Executive Directors in 
2017 reflect this strong overall corporate 
performance and are consistent with the 
experience of shareholders, who saw a 
42% growth in the share price and an 
increase in dividends for the year. Details 
of actual performance against the targets 
set for 2017 and the specific individual 
variable pay awards can be found on 
pages 72 to 77. 
Overall, the pool spend remains below 
27.5% of adjusted pre‑ incentive operating 
profit with the variable and total 
compensation expense ratios at 29.7% 
and 33.4% respectively; therefore, it is 
within the expected ranges previously 
communicated. In establishing the total 
variable compensation pool, the 
Remuneration Committee considered the 
relative distribution of value between 
staff and shareholders and that required 
for tax authorities and to be retained for 
capital purposes. 
As illustrated on page 91, employees’ 
total compensation increased by 14% in 
line with the increase in profit after tax, 
and at a lower rate than the 20% 
increase in the dividends.
The Remuneration Committee concluded 
that the increase in variable 
remuneration expense year‑ on‑ year 
remained balanced with an increase in 
the proportion paid as dividends to 
shareholders.
1. Investment outperformance 
l l As an active investment firm, 
investment outperformance is critical 
to delivering value to our clients. It is 
measured in both the annual bonus 
and the LTIP performance metrics. 
l l Measurement is calculated over 
multiple time periods. For the annual 
bonus, we look back at investment 
performance over one and three 
years. For the LTIP, we measure 
outperformance over a three and five 
year period. 
2. Effective distribution 
l l Measurement of fund flows is included 
in the annual bonus. 
l l Diversification is an important overlay, 
which helps in delivering stable returns
to shareholders by avoiding over 
concentration. Within the annual bonus 
we examine the mix of AUM across 
different geographies, asset classes 
and client channels.
3. Efficient operations 
l l Profitability is a key measure within the 
annual bonus, with a target set for 
underlying Profit Before Tax. We also 
have a three year Earnings Per Share 
growth target in our LTIP. 
l l The strategic and individual elements of 
the bonus allow us to encourage our 
Executive Directors to focus on and 
invest in key projects, which enable us 
to grow a long‑ term, sustainable 
business, protecting our operating 
margin and keeping up with changing 
regulatory requirements.
4. Value creation 
l l Our remuneration philosophy aligns 
executive rewards with long‑ term 
value creation for clients and 
shareholders across a range of 
features, including bonus deferral, 
LTIP and shareholding requirements. 
l l There will continue to be a strong link 
between the available profit for 
distribution to shareholders and the 
variable compensation spend for 
employees, as detailed on page 12. 
In future, with the removal of the 
salary cap, we will focus on 
reporting our total compensation 
ratio, which captures all elements 
of compensation and is in line with 
good market practice.
REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED 61
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
In future years, with the removal of 
salary caps and the introduction of 
capped individual variable incentives for 
Executive Directors, the Committee will 
focus on the total and variable 
compensation expense ratios as the key 
measures in assessing the overall level of 
variable compensation spend. 
LINKING RISK AND REWARD
Risk and compliance continue to serve 
an important role in remuneration for all 
our employees, ensuring the desired 
behaviours are being demonstrated. The 
Committee evaluates a robust set of risk 
checkpoints before approving the 
variable compensation pool each year 
(as described in detail on page 89), as 
well as operating a risk, conduct and 
compliance underpin for all individuals. 
This allows for individual variable 
compensation awards to be reduced 
where appropriate, potentially to zero.
EMPLOYEE SHARE OWNERSHIP
Jupiter continues to encourage a culture 
of employee share ownership. Currently, 
around 58% of our employees hold 
shares in the Company and are 
therefore aligned with our other 
shareholders in having a long‑ term 
interest in the Group’s performance. 
Approximately 25% of employees hold 
share options under one or both of our 
deferred bonus and long‑ term incentive 
plans. We also operate two HMRC 
approved plans, a Sharesave and a 
Share Incentive Plan. To reflect our 
strategy of diversifying internationally, in 
2017 we also introduced a Sharesave 
equivalent for all our employees based 
outside the UK. At the end of the 2017 
financial year 79% of eligible employees 
were participating in at least one of the 
Share Incentive Plan, Sharesave or the 
international equivalent. 
The Company has also recently 
established a HMRC approved Company 
Share Option Plan which will be used to 
make further UK tax‑ efficient share 
awards to employees, excluding 
Executive Directors, from 2018 onwards. 
This plan, along with the Share Incentive 
Plan, further promote an environment of 
high employee share ownership and 
alignment of interests with those of our 
other shareholders. 
SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
As mentioned above, I am grateful for 
the constructive engagement and 
valuable feedback from our major 
shareholders and the investor bodies in 
helping develop the new policy. We 
received a strong level of support for this 
policy, and have incorporated investor 
feedback when possible. We are keen to 
encourage an ongoing dialogue with our 
shareholders on our remuneration 
framework and look forward to receiving 
your support at the forthcoming AGM.

GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
DIRECTORS’ 
REMUNERATION POLICY
This section of the report sets out our 
proposed new Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy (the ‘Policy’). The Policy is subject 
to a binding shareholder vote at our 
2018 AGM. Our intention is to operate 
the Policy for the 2018 performance year 
and onwards, subject to shareholder 
approval. We are also presenting two 
new sets of plan rules for the Deferred 
Bonus Plan (‘DBP’) and Long Term 
Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) for shareholder 
approval, to allow for awards resulting 
from the new Policy to be granted. 
CHANGES TO THE POLICY 
As noted in the Chairman’s Statement, 
the Committee has continued its 
consultation exercise with shareholders 
throughout 2017. This Policy reflects the 
outcome of this extensive consultation 
exercise. The main changes that have 
been made to the Policy are set out in 
the Chairman’s Statement and the 
summary table on page 62. 
The Committee reserves the right to 
make minor amendments to the Policy in 
the future without shareholder approval 
for customary administrative reasons or 
to obtain or maintain favourable tax, 
exchange control or regulatory treatment 
for a Director. 
REMUNERATION POLICY TABLE
The policy table (‘Policy Table’) on pages 
66 to 69 summarises each of the 
elements of the remuneration package 
for Executive Directors under the Policy. 
The Policy Table specifies how each 
element of remuneration is linked to 
Jupiter’s strategy, how it will be operated, 
the maximum opportunity available to 
Executive Directors and whether any 
performance conditions apply to it. 
CONTEXT OF ALL-EMPLOYEE PAY
The Jupiter Remuneration Committee 
considers the pay and conditions of all 
employees when determining remuneration 
arrangements for Executive Directors.
The new Policy for Executive Directors 
contains some minor differences in the 
structure of pay compared to that of all 
other employees, predominantly the 
capping of individual variable pay 
awards for Executive Directors. 
Notwithstanding this, variable 
compensation awards for Executive 
Directors and all other employees are 
funded from the same variable 
compensation pool, and impact the 
overall variable and total compensation 
ratios which the Committee ensures are 
within acceptable ranges when 
approving the variable compensation 
spend in any year. All employees, 
including Executive Directors, are 
incentivised in a similar way and are 
rewarded according to the success of 
the Group and personal performance.
Participation in the all‑ employee share 
plans (the HMRC approved Sharesave 
and Share Incentive Plan) is offered to all 
UK employees on the same terms. Jupiter 
has also recently introduced a plan similar 
to Sharesave for our employees based 
outside of the UK, allowing all employees 
to benefit from the opportunity of owning 
shares in the Company and helping 
further align the interests of all employees 
with shareholders.
Benefits are also offered on a consistent 
basis – for example, the level of employer 
pension contributions is 15% of base salary 
for Executive Directors and all UK 
employees and other benefits, such as 
private medical insurance, are offered to 
all UK employees on the same terms.
STAKEHOLDER VIEWS 
The Remuneration Committee is 
committed to ongoing dialogue with 
investor bodies and shareholders, and 
consulted extensively with both in 
determining this Policy. The level and 
importance of feedback received from 
shareholders and investor bodies during 
2016 was sufficient to persuade the 
Committee to defer the introduction of 
this Policy for another year in order that 
appropriate consideration could be given 
to the comments received. This has lead 
to a number of revisions.
The Remuneration Committee has 
considered the impact of this Policy on 
wider stakeholders, including our clients, 
our employees and the wider economy. 
After consulting with our major 
shareholders and other stakeholders, it is 
apparent that views across and within 
these groups are not always uniform, but 
we did receive strong positive feedback 
for the new Policy, particularly from our 
largest shareholders. Jupiter does not 
currently have a formal employee 
representative body for discussing 
remuneration matters. However, the 
Committee is satisfied that the Policy 
takes a responsible approach to pay 
and guards against irresponsible 
behaviour or excessive risk‑ taking. 
EXPLANATION OF PERFORMANCE 
MEASURES
Performance measures and targets are 
selected and set by the Committee at 
the beginning of each performance year, 
to support the execution of our business 
strategy. Aligned with the strategic and 
financial objectives set by the Board, 
measures are chosen and targets are set 
to appropriately measure and incentivise 
delivery of the key elements of Jupiter’s 
business model.
For annual bonuses, the Committee 
believes it is appropriate to use a 
balanced scorecard approach. The 
diversity of metrics allows multiple 
elements of corporate performance to 
be evaluated. This is in the best interests 
of our shareholders and clients, whilst 
also being in line with shareholders’ 
expectations. Furthermore, it is in line 
with regulatory expectations under 
UCITS V, AIFMD and CRD regimes. 
Setting appropriately stretching targets is 
an area of particular focus for the 
Committee. We have set out our 
approach and process in respect of the 
annual bonus cycle in detail on page 82. 
Achieving a maximum bonus award and/
or full vesting under the LTIP will only 
occur for what the Committee considers 
to be exceptional performance.
Risk and compliance underpins apply to 
all variable compensation which can 
reduce awards, potentially to zero. LTIP 
awards will also only vest subject to 
satisfaction of an additional underlying 
business performance underpin. 
Furthermore, the Committee makes 
reference to a series of checkpoints as 
outlined in our ‘risk and reward’ section 
on page 89, when approving the overall 
variable compensation pool for all 
employees. 
SHAREHOLDING REQUIREMENTS 
The Committee increased the 
shareholding requirements for Executive 
Directors with effect from the 2017 
performance year. The Chief Executive 
and other Executive Directors are 
expected to build up shareholdings within 
five years of their appointment date and 
maintain holdings of at least 300% and 
200% of base salary respectively. These 
new shareholding levels were one of the 
minor changes to the remuneration 
policy which shareholders approved at 
the 2017 AGM and will remain at these 
levels for the new Policy. 
The Committee monitors shareholdings 
against these requirements annually and 
decides at its discretion what (if any) 
action should be taken, which may 
include requiring an individual to hold a 
proportion of vested shares until the 
requirements are met.  64

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
MALUS AND CLAWBACK 
Jupiter operates a malus and clawback 
policy to support wider aims, including: 
ensuring greater alignment between risk 
and individual reward; discouraging 
excessive risk taking and short‑ termism; 
encouraging effective risk management; 
and promoting positive behaviours and a 
strong and appropriate conduct culture.
Malus provisions apply so that relevant 
awards can be withheld or reduced 
(including to zero) in certain 
circumstances. Clawback provisions 
apply so that relevant awards can be 
reclaimed in certain circumstances.
For the DBP and LTIP, malus and 
clawback provisions can apply in the 
following circumstances: 
(i)  Financial results would have been 
materially lower on the basis of 
information that comes to light after 
the accounts for that year are 
finalised (other than as a result of 
change of accounting policy 
subsequent to the end of the year);
(ii)  Material failure of risk management 
suffered by a Group Company;
(iii)  Gross misconduct or material error on 
the part of the individual;
(iv)  Material reputational damage 
occurring to a group company; 
(v)  Performance assessment error in 
relation to an individual when 
determining the level of their award; 
and
(vi)  Any other circumstances which the 
Board considers to be similar in its 
nature or effect to those specified 
above.
Malus provisions apply for all unvested 
DBP and LTIP awards granted in 2016 
and later years in respect of any events 
referred to above.
Clawback provisions apply to all vested 
DBP and LTIP awards granted in 2016 and 
later years, in respect of events described 
in (i) to (iii), and (iv) to the extent that the 
individual is considered to be directly 
responsible or directly accountable.
Recovery of DBP awards may be 
invoked at any time in the three years 
from the grant date through either malus 
or clawback, in respect of a malus or 
clawback event that occurs at any time 
before the end of this period. 
LTIP awards may be recovered via malus 
at any time in the three years prior to 
the vesting date, and through clawback 
at any time after the vesting date for a 
period of two years, in respect of any 
applicable event that occurs at any time 
before the end of this period.
Clawback provisions also apply in 
respect of bonus payments delivered as 
cash for a period of two years after 
payment, such that all variable 
compensation is subject to malus and 
clawback provisions.
The Committee has recently reviewed the 
malus and clawback provisions and is 
satisfied that they continue to 
appropriately support the wider aims 
discussed above.
RECRUITMENT 
In the case of the future recruitment of a 
new Executive Director, the Company 
would apply the following principles:
l l Base salary: set in line with the Policy 
Table. 
l l Bonus: expected to be on the same 
basis as all other Executive Directors 
as outlined in the Policy Table. 
Notwithstanding this, the Committee 
retains the flexibility to determine that 
for the first year of appointment any 
annual incentive award will be subject 
to such terms as it may determine.
l l DBP: awards will be granted in respect 
of the relevant proportion of any 
bonus paid in the year of recruitment, 
on the same basis as it applies for all 
other Executive Directors and the usual 
malus and clawback provisions would 
apply to any award as outlined above.
l l LTIP: in the year of recruitment, any 
awards granted will be granted on the 
same terms as apply to other 
Executive Directors and the usual 
malus and clawback provisions would 
apply to any award as outlined above.
l l All‑ employee share plans: participation 
in the HMRC approved Sharesave Plan 
and HMRC approved Share Incentive 
Plan will be offered on the same basis 
as it is for all other Executive Directors 
and employees.
l l Benefits: pension contributions, private 
medical insurance, life assurance, 
dependants’ pension and income 
protection will be provided on the 
same basis as they are for all other 
employees (including Executive 
Directors). Where the Remuneration 
Committee determines that such a 
payment is necessary for recruitment, 
payments, for example, relocation 
allowances and other relocation 
related expenses, may also be paid at 
a level determined as appropriate by 
the Remuneration Committee.
l l Variable remuneration: The maximum 
level of variable remuneration which 
may be awarded to Executive 
Directors in the first year of 
recruitment (excluding any buy‑ outs 
referred to below) will be in line with 
the individual variable remuneration 
limits set in the Policy Table. 
Any buy‑ out awards granted in addition 
to the above elements of the remuneration 
package will be required to be granted on 
equivalent or no more favourable terms, in 
accordance with applicable regulatory 
rules and regulations, than the awards 
which they are buying out, in particular in 
respect of the: quantum of the award; 
timing of delivery; form of award; and 
existence of performance conditions. 
Where necessary, any buy‑ out awards 
granted outside of the provisions of the 
rules of the LTIP will be granted under 
the Listing Rules exemption applicable to 
such share arrangements.
In the case of the future recruitment of a 
new Executive Director, the Company will 
disclose the full details of the recruitment 
package and the approach taken in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration 
following the appointment.
The other main contractual terms of the 
service contract would follow the same 
principles as those of existing Executive 
Directors. 
Any new Non‑ Executive Director would 
be appointed with contractual terms and 
a fee basis in line with the other existing 
Non‑ Executive Directors.
EXIT PAYMENTS 
Our overriding policy on termination 
payments to Executive Directors is that 
we do not include any contractual 
provisions for compensation on early 
termination, other than the amount due 
under law. The Committee will seek to 
keep any other such payments to an 
appropriate level, reflecting performance. 
In case of termination, a payment in lieu of 
notice may be due if such notice is not 
given by the Company. As set out in the 
summary table of Executive Director 
service contracts, no contractual 
entitlement to a bonus payment accrues or 
arises during the notice period. Any bonus 
payment that the Committee determines is 
appropriate to be paid in respect of an 
Executive Director notice period will be  65

GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
based on performance and may be made 
in such proportions of cash and shares as 
the Committee may determine. 
Leaver provisions under both the DBP and 
LTIP are aligned. The respective rules 
provide that any awards will lapse on 
cessation of the individual’s office or 
employment, other than in limited 
circumstances, as follows: death of the 
employee; the ill‑ health, injury or disability 
of the employee; redundancy; retirement; 
the sale of the individual’s employing entity 
out of the Group; and any other reason 
which the Remuneration Committee in its 
absolute discretion so permits. Where LTIP 
awards vest in these circumstances, they 
would normally only vest to the extent the 
Remuneration Committee determines, 
taking into account the extent that 
performance conditions have been 
satisfied and, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise, the proportion of 
the vesting period that has elapsed.
The Committee reserves the right to make 
any other payments in connection with a 
Director’s cessation of office or 
employment where the payments are 
made in good faith in discharge of or to 
mitigate an existing legal obligation (or by 
way of damages for breach of such an 
obligation) or by way of settlement of any 
claim arising in connection with the 
cessation of a Director’s office or 
employment. Any such payments may 
include, but are not limited to, paying any 
fees for outplacement assistance and/or 
the Director’s legal and/or professional 
advice fees in connection with the 
cessation of office or employment.
In the case of a change in control of the 
Company (or equivalent transaction), the 
Remuneration Committee may exercise its 
discretion to assess performance 
conditions applicable to outstanding LTIP 
awards to the date of the relevant event. 
The Board may determine that outstanding 
LTIP or DBP awards be exchanged for 
equivalent awards on such terms as 
agreed with the acquiring company. If the 
Company is wound up the vesting of an 
award will be accelerated.

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
REMUNERATION POLICY TABLE –  
COMPONENTS OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures
Base salary Provides an element of fixed remuneration 
which reflects the size and scope of the 
role and the calibre of the individual.
Base salaries are generally reviewed annually and take into 
account a range of factors, including:
l l size and scope of the role;
l l skills, performance and experience of the individual;
l l market competitiveness;
l l wider market and economic conditions; and
l l the level of increases in the wider employee population.
There is no defined monetary maximum. For the Policy period, the 
annual salary increases for incumbent Executive Directors will be 
limited to the average salary increases for other employees. 
Increases for any new Executive Directors may be made in certain 
circumstances such as a significant change in the scale, scope or 
responsibility of a role; or significant market movements.
The annual base salaries for 2017 and 2018 for each Executive 
Director are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
N/A
Pension Provides individuals with market competitive 
retirement benefits. Supports recruitment 
and retention of high‑ calibre people to 
deliver the business strategy.
Payments are made at a consistent level to all UK employees, 
either into a pension plan (for example, into a defined 
contribution plan or some other arrangement which the 
Committee considers to have the same economic benefit) or 
delivered as a cash allowance of the same equivalent cost to 
the Company.
15% of salary. N/A
Benefits Provides individuals with market aligned 
benefits.
Benefits are provided on a consistent basis to all UK employees. 
Typical benefits include: private medical insurance, life 
assurance, dependants’ pension and an income protection 
scheme to cover long‑ term illness.
There is no defined maximum. The value of other benefits will vary 
year‑ on‑ year, depending on factors such as the third party 
provider charges and market conditions. They are set at a level 
the Committee considers reasonable in the context of the local 
jurisdiction and the individual’s circumstances.
N/A
Annual bonus and 
Deferred Bonus 
Plan (‘DBP’)
The annual bonus rewards corporate 
performance and the achievement of 
stretching strategic and personal objectives. 
The DBP provides a deferral element in the 
form of Jupiter shares. This provides a 
strong link to long‑ term and sustainable 
value creation and reinforces retention.
Clawback and malus provisions apply, to 
mitigate actions and behaviours outside of 
Jupiter’s risk appetite.
The Company operates a balanced scorecard approach across 
a range of metrics.
At the beginning of each performance year, the Committee 
agrees a range of targets for each metric. Multiple factors are 
considered in setting targets, including the Board approved 
budget, market expectations, prior year achievement, strategic 
focus and priorities, as well as the wider economic landscape.
During the year, the Committee monitors performance against 
these targets.
After the year end, annual bonus awards are determined based 
on actual performance against the balanced scorecard. The 
overall outcome is not formulaic; the Committee applies a level 
of judgement to ensure the pay‑ out levels reflect both individual 
performance and the experience of shareholders for the year.
50% of the non deferred bonus is delivered in shares, subject to 
a six month holding period. Under the DBP, 50% of the total 
bonus is deferred into shares, vesting annually in equal tranches 
over three years, and subject to an additional six month holding 
period. 
Individual bonus limits (inclusive of any DBP award), expressed as 
a percentage of salary, apply per role as follows:
l l 425% for the Chief Executive Officer;
l l 250% for the Chief Financial Officer; and
l l 200% for the Vice Chairman.
Measures and weightings are set by the Committee at the start 
of each performance year and will be disclosed prospectively in 
our Annual Report on Remuneration. Under the balanced 
scorecard approach, the following will also apply:
At least 75% of the annual bonus award will be based on 
corporate quantitative measures. No more than 25% of the 
annual bonus award will be based on individual and strategic 
measures.
All variable compensation is subject to a risk and compliance 
assessment, under which payments can be reduced, including to 
zero.
Actual performance, target ranges for objective measures and 
commentary for strategic and individual measures will be 
disclosed retrospectively in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
All-employee  
share plans
Jupiter encourages employee share 
ownership and operates an HMRC 
approved Sharesave plan and an HMRC 
approved Share Incentive Plan. Executive 
Directors are eligible to participate in both 
plans on the same basis as other UK 
employees.
Under the Sharesave plan, employees enter into a three or five 
year savings contract and are granted linked options over 
shares in the Company.
The Share Incentive Plan awards take the form of shares in the 
Company acquired by employees from pre‑ tax salary in 
conjunction with matching shares awarded.
Under the Sharesave and Share Incentive Plan, maximums are as 
prescribed by HMRC from time to time.

limited to the average salary increases for other employees. 
Increases for any new Executive Directors may be made in certain 
circumstances such as a significant change in the scale, scope or 
responsibility of a role; or significant market movements.
The annual base salaries for 2017 and 2018 for each Executive 
Director are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
N/A
Pension Provides individuals with market competitive 
retirement benefits. Supports recruitment 
and retention of high‑ calibre people to 
deliver the business strategy.
Payments are made at a consistent level to all UK employees, 
either into a pension plan (for example, into a defined 
contribution plan or some other arrangement which the 
Committee considers to have the same economic benefit) or 
delivered as a cash allowance of the same equivalent cost to 
the Company.
15% of salary. N/A
Benefits Provides individuals with market aligned 
benefits.
Benefits are provided on a consistent basis to all UK employees. 
Typical benefits include: private medical insurance, life 
assurance, dependants’ pension and an income protection 
scheme to cover long‑ term illness.
There is no defined maximum. The value of other benefits will vary 
year‑ on‑ year, depending on factors such as the third party 
provider charges and market conditions. They are set at a level 
the Committee considers reasonable in the context of the local 
jurisdiction and the individual’s circumstances.
N/A
Annual bonus and 
Deferred Bonus 
Plan (‘DBP’)
The annual bonus rewards corporate 
performance and the achievement of 
stretching strategic and personal objectives. 
The DBP provides a deferral element in the 
form of Jupiter shares. This provides a 
strong link to long‑ term and sustainable 
value creation and reinforces retention.
Clawback and malus provisions apply, to 
mitigate actions and behaviours outside of 
Jupiter’s risk appetite.
The Company operates a balanced scorecard approach across 
a range of metrics.
At the beginning of each performance year, the Committee 
agrees a range of targets for each metric. Multiple factors are 
considered in setting targets, including the Board approved 
budget, market expectations, prior year achievement, strategic 
focus and priorities, as well as the wider economic landscape.
During the year, the Committee monitors performance against 
these targets.
After the year end, annual bonus awards are determined based 
on actual performance against the balanced scorecard. The 
overall outcome is not formulaic; the Committee applies a level 
of judgement to ensure the pay‑ out levels reflect both individual 
performance and the experience of shareholders for the year.
50% of the non deferred bonus is delivered in shares, subject to 
a six month holding period. Under the DBP, 50% of the total 
bonus is deferred into shares, vesting annually in equal tranches 
over three years, and subject to an additional six month holding 
period. 
Individual bonus limits (inclusive of any DBP award), expressed as 
a percentage of salary, apply per role as follows:
l l 425% for the Chief Executive Officer;
l l 250% for the Chief Financial Officer; and
l l 200% for the Vice Chairman.
Measures and weightings are set by the Committee at the start 
of each performance year and will be disclosed prospectively in 
our Annual Report on Remuneration. Under the balanced 
scorecard approach, the following will also apply:
At least 75% of the annual bonus award will be based on 
corporate quantitative measures. No more than 25% of the 
annual bonus award will be based on individual and strategic 
measures.
All variable compensation is subject to a risk and compliance 
assessment, under which payments can be reduced, including to 
zero.
Actual performance, target ranges for objective measures and 
commentary for strategic and individual measures will be 
disclosed retrospectively in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
All-employee  
share plans
Jupiter encourages employee share 
ownership and operates an HMRC 
approved Sharesave plan and an HMRC 
approved Share Incentive Plan. Executive 
Directors are eligible to participate in both 
plans on the same basis as other UK 
employees.
Under the Sharesave plan, employees enter into a three or five 
year savings contract and are granted linked options over 
shares in the Company.
The Share Incentive Plan awards take the form of shares in the 
Company acquired by employees from pre‑ tax salary in 
conjunction with matching shares awarded.
Under the Sharesave and Share Incentive Plan, maximums are as 
prescribed by HMRC from time to time.

features of this plan are set out below.
At the beginning of the year, the Committee will select the 
relevant performance measures and targets, as well as the 
applicable weighting for each measure.
LTIP awards will vest a minimum of three years from the date of 
grant with performance normally measured over a period of at 
least three financial years, subject to continued employment and 
satisfaction of applicable performance conditions.
Awards will be subject to an additional two‑ year post‑ vesting 
holding period, unless the Committee determines otherwise.
Individual LTIP limits, expressed as a percentage of salary, apply 
per role in respect of any one financial year as follows:
l l 375% for the Chief Executive Officer;
l l 225% for the Chief Financial Officer; and
l l 150% for the Vice Chairman.
Performance measures (applicable to 100% of any LTIP award),

prospectively in our Annual Report on Remuneration. The 
following will also apply:
l l For each performance measure, no more than 25% of the 
maximum will vest for achievement of the ‘Threshold’ 
performance level and 100% of the maximum for achievement 
of the ‘Maximum’ performance level.
l l In exceptional circumstances, the Remuneration Committee 
retains the discretion to vary or replace a performance 
condition if an event occurs that means a performance 
condition has ceased to be appropriate, provided that any 
varied or new performance condition is, in its opinion, not 
more or less difficult to satisfy.
All variable compensation is subject to a risk and compliance 
assessment, under which payments can be reduced, including to 
zero. In addition, the LTIP is subject to an underlying business 
performance underpin. The Committee will compare the vesting 
outcome for LTIP awards against shareholder and client

LEGACY PAYMENTS 
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and/or payments for loss of office (including exercising any discretions available to it in connection with 
such payments) notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before our 2014 AGM (the date the 
Company’s first shareholder‑ approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy came into effect); (ii) before the Policy set out above came into effect, provided that the terms of the 
payment were consistent with the shareholder‑ approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy in force at the time they were agreed; or (iii) at a time when the relevant individual was 
not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company. For these 
purposes ‘payments’ includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are ‘agreed’ at the 
time the award is granted. 
COMMON AWARD TERMS 
Awards under any of the Company’s share plans referred to in this report may:
(a) be granted as conditional share awards or nil‑ cost options or in such other form that the Committee determines has the same economic effect. Alternatively, if regulations 
so require, awards may also be granted over fund units, in which case, references to Jupiter shares in this Policy would also include fund units;
(b) have any performance conditions applicable to them amended or substituted by the Committee if an event occurs which causes the Committee to determine an amended 
or substituted performance condition would be more appropriate and not materially less difficult to satisfy;
(c) incorporate the right to receive an amount (in cash or additional shares) equal to the value of dividends which would have been paid on the shares under an award that vest 
up to the time of vesting (or where the award is subject to a holding period, release). This amount may be calculated assuming that the dividends have been reinvested in the

Note that this award represents a buy‑ out award for Maarten Slendebroek for awards forfeited from a previous employer.
7   The value of the 2014 LTIP award vesting in 2017 has been restated based on a share price on the vesting date (3 April 2017) of £4.26 and vesting due to performance of 41%.

Estimated values of the 2015 LTIP award are not included for John Chatfeild‑ Roberts and Philip Johnson as neither were Executive Directors at the end of the performance

SINGLE TOTAL FIGURE CONTINUED
VARIABLE PAY AWARDS FOR 2017 
PERFORMANCE
Outline of approach 
Variable pay awards for 2017 
performance have been determined by 
the Committee using the following 
process:
l l Determine a Group‑ wide variable 
compensation pool, expressed as a 
percentage of Jupiter’s adjusted 
available profit, with appropriate 
consideration of the checkpoints 
detailed on page 89 and the 
Company’s resulting variable and total 
compensation ratios. 
l l Assess corporate and individual 
performance for the Executive 
Directors.
l l Determine bonuses and LTIP awards 
for the individual Executive Directors 
out of the pool. Bonus awards are 
determined using the balanced 
scorecard of corporate, strategic and 
individual performance measures as 
described below. LTIP awards granted 
in 2018 will be granted under the new 
remuneration policy and subject to the 
relevant performance criteria as 
described on page 83.
Determining the variable 
compensation pool 
The variable compensation pool is 
determined so that it is appropriate and 
affordable in the context of Jupiter’s 
overall performance. We aim to balance 
and align the interests of our staff and 
our shareholders. As a result, variable 
compensation is constrained on an 
aggregate basis. 
The variable compensation pool is 
determined each year by 
recommendation of the Remuneration 
Committee to the Board taking into 
account the Group’s performance. The 
pool for 2017 was first assessed as a 
proportion of adjusted available profit
1
. 
Consistent with the approach of prior 
years, the pool awarded for 2017 was 
kept below 27.5% of adjusted available 
profit. Jupiter’s adjusted available profit 
for 2017 was £275.8m, compared with an 
available profit
1
 of £277.4m (2016: 
£232.4m and £236.0m respectively). This 
meant that for 2017 the pool was kept 
below £75.9m (2016: £63.9m). 
The next step was to evaluate the pool 
in the financial reporting context. This 
considers the accounting treatment for 
the pool and resulting variable 
compensation expense to be recognised 
in 2017. As illustrated in the graphic 
below, the variable compensation 
expense is determined by the nature and 
extent of bonus awarded in 2017 as well 
as deferred awards (including LTIP) 
made in prior years. It also includes 
national insurance charges levied on 
Jupiter in relation to variable 
compensation. The national insurance 
charge relating to share based 
compensation is impacted by movements 
in the Jupiter share price. The 42% 
appreciation in the share price 
experienced in 2017 had a more 
significant impact on the national 
insurance charges than in the prior year. 
In addition, the Committee assessed the 
total compensation expense which 
includes the fixed component of 
remuneration as well as variable.
The Committee assessed whether the 
overall variable and total compensation 
ratios
1
 (as reported in the financial review 
on page 28) were within an appropriate 
range. In line with prior year disclosures, 
we expect the variable compensation 
ratio to remain at a mid to high 20% 
level over the medium term and the total 
compensation ratio to be at a low to 
mid 30% level over the medium term, 
although they may differ from these 
levels in any particular year. 
Considering these aspects together, the 
Committee determined a variable 
compensation pool for 2017 of £73.8m 
(2016: £59.3m). This resulted in a variable 
compensation expense of £82.5m (2016: 
£66.6m), a variable compensation ratio 
of 29.7% and a total compensation ratio 
of 33.4%.
The Remuneration Committee concluded 
that the increase in variable 
remuneration expense year‑ on‑ year 
remained balanced with the increase in 
the proportion paid as dividend to 
shareholders. Jupiter’s approach to the 
distribution of value is further explained 
in the Strategic Report on pages 12, 26 
and 27.
Jupiter has altered its remuneration 
structure for other employees from 2017 
onwards in line with regulatory and other 
market developments. These changes 
include increasing the proportion of 
overall variable compensation which is 
deferred, as well as altering the vesting 
profile of deferred bonuses from three 
year cliff vesting to equal tranche vesting 
over three years. Combined, these 
adjustments have various implications on 
Jupiter’s variable compensation expense 
and are explained further in the financial 
review section on page 28.
Under the new policy, in future years the 
Remuneration Committee will increase its 
focus on the variable and total 
compensation ratios in determining 
variable compensation spend.

Assessing individual performance
The following table sets out supporting commentary and information the Committee referenced in assessing individual 
performance of the Executive Directors.
Executive Director Commentary and discussion 
Maarten 
Slendebroek,
Chief Executive 
Officer
As Chief Executive Officer, Maarten led Jupiter to deliver a strong performance in 2017. He ensured the 
necessary work for Jupiter’s long‑ term success was carried out and the strength of its culture was maintained. 
The year saw excellent investment performance for clients and strong positive net sales growth, particularly 
internationally. This was in line with the corporate strategy to increase diversity of client, geography and 
product. The consequence was robust financial performance for shareholders. Strategic decisions to support 
Jupiter’s long‑ term growth were made. Changes to the pricing and the cost structure of products which will 
benefit clients were announced early in the year and the necessary work to implement these in 2018 was 
carried out. Similarly, planning for potential changes due to Brexit was undertaken. Key operational projects 
to meet regulatory change and provide scalable operational excellence were achieved as planned. Continued 
progress was made on the acquisition of talent, including fund managers and key functional roles to support 
Jupiter’s future success.
Charlotte Jones, 
Chief Financial 
Officer
In her first full year as Chief Financial Officer, Charlotte made significant steps in improving and strengthening 
Jupiter’s financial model, including a strongly led and well executed process for developing Jupiter’s 2018 
financial plan. An efficiently managed corporate budget and strong cost discipline by Charlotte in a year 
which also saw a heavy level of investment in Jupiter’s operating platform and recruitment, contributed to a 
year on year 15% increase in underlying PBT and a 16% increase in underlying EPS. Charlotte has also evolved 
Jupiter’s corporate strategic and shareholder engagement capabilities through the recruitment of a Head of 
Corporate Development and Communications.
Edward Bonham 
Carter, 
Vice Chairman
Edward has continued to provide a valuable contribution to Jupiter in his role as Vice Chairman. He has 
served as a successful and effective representative for the Company at a number of key external events, 
engaging with many industry and trade bodies helping to further promote and build Jupiter’s brand. Internally, 
Edward has lead and engaged the Board heavily in developing Jupiter’s environmental, social and 
governance agenda, as well as drawing on his experience as fund manager by contributing to the 
recruitment of talent into our front office. 77

Determining individual Executive 
Director 2017 annual bonuses
The 2017 annual bonus awards have 
been determined by the Committee 
under the framework of the existing 2017 
policy, based on a holistic assessment of 
the performance conditions outlined 
above, the shareholder and client 
experience in the year and an 
assessment of risk and compliance 
underpins. Annual bonus awards to 
Executive Directors are greater in 
absolute terms in 2017 than in 2016, 
which reflects the following:
l l Corporate quantitative and financial 
performance was significantly 
improved in 2017 relative to the prior 
year, with profits, net sales and three 
year investment outperformance all 
performing better.
l l Both shareholders and clients saw a 
positive experience for the year, 
through an increase in dividends, share 
price growth and strong levels of 
investment outperformance over the 
three year period.
l l There were no risk or regulatory 
compliance issues at a Group or 
individual level for which the 
Committee considers it appropriate to 
make any variable compensation 
adjustments.
Determining individual Executive 
Director 2018 LTIP awards
The 2018 LTIP awards for Executive 
Directors will be granted under the 
proposed new remuneration policy, 
subject to it and the new plan rules 
receiving appropriate approval from 
shareholders at the 2018 AGM. The 2018 
LTIP award values and performance 
metrics are discussed in detail on page 
83. For the CEO and CFO, the proposed 
2018 grant values are less than the 
individual maximums permissible under 
the new policy to reflect the transitional 
nature of the remuneration structure for 
2017 and 2018.

Form of variable compensation for CEO
The chart below illustrates the proportion of each element of Maarten Slendebroek’s pay over the past five years. This has 
been calculated using the remuneration amounts from the single figure table. The 2017 amount therefore includes an assumed 
value for the share price growth figure using the average share price for the fourth quarter of 2017. 
The table demonstrates an increasing proportion of Maarten’s pay being delivered as variable performance based 
remuneration, albeit he did not have any vesting LTIP in the 2013 and 2014 figures due to his recent appointment as CEO in 
March 2014. Additionally, 2017 shows a greater shift towards deferred compensation, with an increasing proportion of bonus 
deferred. For 2017, the ‘cash bonus’ element also includes the proportion deferred into shares for six months.

Significant developments in the management team include 
the successful transition and succession of senior fund 
managers and senior executives, continued deepening of the 
senior leadership team, including several promotions to the 
Executive Committee and hiring of a new Chief Financial 
Officer, Head of Global Distribution and General Counsel. 
Over the performance period there have been further 
significant hires in the distribution function (both domestic and 
internationally), product specialists in Fund Management, and 
a growing number of technical experts in support functions. 
The Company has recruited a number of fund managers to 
manage new investment strategies including Asian Income 
and Emerging Market Debt.
Our business in the UK has been restructured and despite 
enormous challenges such as RDR, Brexit and an out‑ of‑ favour equity heavy legacy product range, the launch of 
new products in the past three years has re‑ energised our 
domestic business and is now growing vigorously. The net 
effect of this turnaround on 2017 alone exceeds £1bn. The 
rejuvenated product range allowed Jupiter to make strong 
progress in the wealth management segment of the UK 
market which is a growing part of the market, whilst Jupiter 
held its position in the rapidly consolidating retail market. 
Internationally, we have grown in all regions with a singular 
focus on the wealth management market. We now have 
strong distribution partnerships with large institutions in much 
of continental Europe, where, in some cases, we did not have 
any relationship at all three years ago.
There have been no major risk or compliance issues over the 
performance period. In addition, risk and control processes 
have been significantly enhanced over the years through the 
development and implementation of an Enterprise Risk 
Framework.

GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
Implementation in 2018
The new Policy reflects changes in best practice and regulatory and investor remuneration guidelines, including the introduction 
of capped individual variable incentives and a rebasing of fixed pay. The following section provides an overview as to how 
each element of the Policy will be applied in 2018.
BASE SALARY
Salaries for Executive Directors will no longer be capped and instead will be set at a market rate which is considered 
appropriate to Jupiter’s size and the nature of each role. The salaries for Executive Directors with effect from 1 January 2018 are 
as follows: 
l l Maarten Slendebroek: £425,000 (2017: £250,000);
l l Charlotte Jones: £325,000 (2017: £250,000); and
l l Edward Bonham Carter: £160,000 (2017: £160,000).
Increases will be applied retrospectively from 1 January 2018, subject to shareholder approval of the Policy at the 2018 AGM.
ANNUAL BONUS
Annual bonuses in respect of 2018 (inclusive of any deferred bonus award) will be subject to the following individual caps as a 
percentage of base salary:
l l Maarten Slendebroek: 425%;
l l Charlotte Jones: 250%; and
l l Edward Bonham Carter: 200%.
The performance measures for the 2018 annual bonus will be set within the following balanced scorecard. 75% of these 
measures will be corporate quantitative financial measures, with clearly determined Threshold, On‑ Target and Maximum goals. 
The remaining objectives will be strategic and individual measures. Determination of bonus amounts is not formulaic; in addition 
to reviewing each of the performance measures, the Committee will take a holistic view of the overall performance of the 
Company for the year to ensure that any bonus amounts appropriately reflect the experience of stakeholders. Where 
performance measures produce an outcome which does not align with that of stakeholders, the Committee may exercise its 
discretion as it considers appropriate.

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
The determination of variable pay awards in relation to 2018 performance will continue to be assessed with the application of 
judgement, taking into account a holistic assessment of Group and individual performance. The balanced scorecard, set out in the 
table above, will allow the Committee to assess performance against key financial and strategic metrics. The Committee’s assessment 
against these metrics and the decision about any variable pay awards will be clearly disclosed to shareholders. Notwithstanding this 
structure, in line with the approach taken in 2017, for 2018 the Committee will work to ensure that the Company’s variable and total 
compensation ratios are within appropriate ranges. The Committee expects the variable compensation ratio to remain at a mid to 
high 20% level over the medium term, and the total compensation ratio to be at a low to mid 30% level over the medium‑ term, 
although they may differ from these levels in any particular years for the reasons explained on page 28. 
In addition to the performance measures outlined above, the Committee considers the ‘checkpoints’ set out on page 89 when 
exercising its judgement to determine the overall variable compensation spend for any particular year, and also considers 
individual risk behaviours when assessing individual awards.
The payment of bonuses for Executive Directors for 2018 will be as follows and is compliant with the relevant remuneration 
regulations. This is similar to the payout structure introduced for 2017 bonuses, however the 50% deferred into Jupiter shares for 
three years will now vest in equal tranches over the deferral period:
Proportion of bonus and delivery method
25%
l l Delivered as cash. 
25%
l l Delivered as deferred Jupiter shares.
l l Immediate vesting, but subject to 
subsequent six month post vesting  
holding period.
50%
l l Delivered as deferred Jupiter shares.
l l Vesting in equal tranches over three years, 
but subject to subsequent six month post 
vesting holding period.
SETTING BONUS TARGETS AND ASSESSING PERFORMANCE
Start of the year – set targets
l l The Board agrees and sets the budget and financial plan for Jupiter for the performance year ahead.
l l The Committee, in consultation with management, then sets the:
 — Metrics which will be assessed;
 — Mix between corporate quantitative (at least 75%) and corporate strategic and individual objectives (no more than 25%); and
 — Targets for each performance level (Threshold, Target and Maximum) for quantitative metrics, taking into account the level of 
stretch in the budget.
l l Annual bonus metrics and weighting will be disclosed prospectively.
During the year – monitor performance
l l Performance is monitored and evaluated against the metrics throughout the year.
l l The Committee is provided with regular updates from management on performance status and from the Chief Risk Officer on risk 
and compliance issues.
End of the year – assess performance 
l l The Committee assesses performance and determines the resulting pay‑ out in the first instance. Bonus determination is not 
formulaic and judgement is applied.
l l In reaching its decision, the Committee considers actual performance (quantitative and qualitative) against each metric and the 
target ranges set, i.e. where performance sits between the threshold, target and maximum. This is then supplemented by the 
Committee considering the following to ensure they apply appropriate judgement in deciding pay‑ outs:
 — Is the level of the overall total and variable compensation spend appropriate? This includes consideration of the checkpoints on 
page 89.
 — Control function input from the Chief Risk Officer and Compliance Director.
 — The context in which this performance was achieved, having reference to (but not limited to) shareholder and client experience 
in the year; risk and compliance underpins; and any clawback or malus events.
After the end of the year – disclosure
l l Target ranges and actual performance against objective measures will be disclosed retrospectively in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration, with clear commentary for subjective measures.
l l Commentary will also be provided on how the Committee reached its decisions, including particular challenges and any other 
factors which were taken in to account.  83

LTIP AWARDS
LTIP awards will be granted under the new remuneration policy. These awards will be granted in May 2018, subject to 
shareholder approval of the new remuneration policy and LTIP rules at the 2018 AGM. The awards will vest in late March/early 
April 2021 (the third anniversary of when the awards would ordinarily have been granted, had the grant not been delayed), 
subject to the achievement of the stretching performance conditions, as set out in the table below. The awards will also be 
subject to a two‑ year post‑ vesting holding period in line with the new remuneration policy. 
The 2018 LTIP award values will be as follows:
l l Maarten Slendebroek: £1,450,000 (341% of salary);
l l Charlotte Jones: £650,000 (200% of salary); and
l l Edward Bonham Carter: £240,000 (150% of salary)
These award values reflect the transitional nature of our remuneration structure in 2017 and 2018 and are set accordingly, for 
the CEO and CFO, below the proposed new individual LTIP award caps.
The 2018 LTIP awards will be subject to the following performance conditions:
Proportion of LTIP Performance condition Performance measure
50%
EPS Growth
Jupiter’s underlying EPS growth must 
achieve at least 20% growth over the 
performance period

(weighted by AUM) achieving above 
median performance relative to their 
peer group (retail) or above 
benchmark performance (institutional) 
weighted: 
25%

31 December preceding the 
vesting date; and
75%
 over the five year period to 
31 December preceding the 
vesting date.

percentages above
Investment outperformance is critical to Jupiter’s clients and the Company’s long‑ term success. Its importance is recognised 
through its use as a performance measure within the annual bonus scorecard and the LTIP. Given the longer time horizon over 
which LTIP assesses performance, both a three and five year outperformance measure is included. 
EPS growth is important to shareholders and is the best measure of Jupiter’s successful execution of its growth strategy. There is 
no payout under this performance condition at threshold performance, or where EPS growth is less than 20% over the period. 
The target range and vesting schedule for EPS performance between threshold and maximum has been set in line with Jupiter’s 
financial plan. 
In addition to a risk and compliance assessment, LTIP awards are subject to an underlying business performance underpin. The 
Committee will compare the vesting outcome for LTIP awards against shareholder and client experience over the same 
performance period. 84

2 Joined the Board as a Non‑ Executive Director on 10 October 2017.
3 The high percentage of shares held by Edward Bonham Carter relates to shares purchased during the period 2007‑ 2010 while Jupiter was privately owned.
There have been no changes to the above interests between the year end and 26 February 2018 (the latest practicable date 
before the printing of the Annual Report and Accounts).
The Remuneration Committee has a policy that Executive Directors should maintain a significant holding of shares in the 
Company. The policy in operation for the 2017 performance year provides that the Chief Executive should hold shares in the 
Company with a value equivalent to at least 300% of base salary, and other Executive Directors a value equivalent to at least 
200% of base salary. Maarten Slendebroek and Edward Bonham Carter both hold shares with a value in excess of 300% of 
base salary as at 31 December 2017. Following her appointment to the Board in September 2016, Charlotte Jones is expected to 
build up her shareholding within the five years following appointment. The Committee is confident that based on current 
deferred share awards that vested in January 2018 and those due to vest in future years as detailed on pages 86 to 88, 
Charlotte will meet the necessary minimum shareholding level within the expected period. 86

1 Outstanding share awards were adjusted by 3.01% as a result of the 7 April 2017 Special Dividend. See below.
2 Average closing share price from three trading days prior to date of grant.
3 Closing share price on date of exercise, 28 April 2017, was £4.75. This resulted in a value of shares on exercise of £573,795.
4 Closing share price on date of exercise, 6 June 2017, was £4.88. This resulted in a value of shares on exercise of £717,653.
Key terms:
l l no performance measures are attached to options granted under the DBP, although malus provisions may apply (see the remuneration policy table for further details);
l l no exercise price is payable on the exercise of DBP options; and
l l holders of unvested share option awards are not entitled to cash dividend payments as the holders are not the legal owners of the shares. The Remuneration Committee 
determined that it was appropriate for holders of share option awards (under both the DBP and LTIP schemes) to benefit from the 7 April 2017 Special Dividend. This took place 
by means of adjusting upwards the number of shares over which options were held by a factor of 3.01% as permitted under the rules of the plans. This factor is equivalent to 
the value the holder of a share option award would have received had they been entitled to receive the Special Dividend as a cash payment. 87

Risk and reward 
at Jupiter
DISCUSSION 
The Committee gives careful consideration 
to the linkage between risk and reward to 
ensure the desired behaviours and culture 
are being rewarded. This includes 
ensuring the reward structures are 
consistent with and promote sound and 
effective risk management, and ensuring 
remuneration out‑ turns appropriately 
reflect the risk profile and behaviours of 
the Group and each individual. This is 
demonstrated through a variety of reward 
features and processes that ensure 
alignment to risk considerations 
throughout the organisation. For example:
l l When assessing the overall variable 
compensation spend as described on 
page 82, the Committee considers a 
number of ‘checkpoints’, as described 
in the checkpoints chart on the right 
hand side of this page. 
l l Assessment of individual performance 
includes consideration of a scorecard 
of financial and non‑ financial metrics. 
This ensures that the way in which 
performance has been achieved is 
taken into account, for example, in 
terms of risk and repeatability. For all 
employees there is consideration of 
conduct, performance against risk and 
compliance criteria, ensuring there is 
risk adjustment at an individual level. 
l l All employees with bonuses of over 
£50,000 have a portion of bonus 
deferred into shares and/or fund units. 
In total approximately 25% of 
employees are subject to some kind of 
deferral, ensuring their interests are 
aligned to the long‑ term success of the 
Group and with the interest of clients. 
l l Shareholding requirements apply to 
Executive Directors and Executive 
Committee members, further enhancing 
the link to the Group’s long‑ term success.
l l For Executive Directors and Executive 
Committee members, all variable 
remuneration is subject to malus and 
clawback provisions, whereby incentive 
awards may be reduced, withheld or 
reclaimed in certain circumstances, 
including where there has been a 
material failure of risk management. 
In addition to the Compliance Director 
and the Audit and Risk Committee 
feeding into the process, the Head of 
Risk presents a report to the Committee, 
setting out thoughts and assurances 
around how the remuneration structures 
and processes support sound and 
effective risk management.
CHECKPOINTS 
Capital base and liquidity
Can Jupiter afford the proposed variable compensation spend?
l l Sufficient liquidity to make payments?
l l Consider impact on Jupiter’s capital base.
Request and consider input from the Chief Financial Officer. 
Underlying financial performance
Does Jupiter’s underlying financial performance support the proposed variable 
compensation spend?
l l Consider performance against financial KPIs listed in the Annual Report. 
l l Is there any reason to believe the financial results are not a fair reflection of underlying 
performance?
Request and consider input from the Audit and Risk Committee. 
Risk
Does Jupiter’s risk profile and risk management support the variable compensation 
spend? Are any adjustments required? 
l l Consideration of the Enterprise Risk Management report. 
l l Are all risks being suitably monitored and managed? Have there been any material 
failures of risk management (or any ‘near misses’) in the year?
l l Consider whether profit reflects current and future risks and timing and likelihood of 
future revenues.
Request and consider input from the Head of Risk and the Audit and Risk Committee. 
Compliance
Have there been any material compliance breaches in the year? 
l l Are any adjustments required?
l l Consideration of any significant compliance breaches and/or ‘near misses’. 
l l Consideration of any fines received in the year and any ongoing regulatory 
investigations.
Request and consider input from the Compliance Director.
Commercial
Are there any commercial drivers to support adjustments to the variable 
compensation spend?
l l Consider the market for talent and whether the spend would likely result in any significant 
over/underpayment against the market.
Reputational
Are there any reputational drivers to support adjustments to the variable 
compensation spend?
l l Has there been any reputational damage to the Group in the year?
l l Will the proposed variable compensation pool quantum have any adverse reputational 
impact on the Group?

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
DILUTION
Our policy regarding dilution from employee share awards is to ensure that dilution will be no more than 10% in any rolling 10 
year period and no more than 5% from employee share awards granted to Executive Directors of the Company in any rolling 
10 year period. 
As at 31 December 2017, share awards granted under the DBP, LTIP and Sharesave in the seven and a half years since Jupiter’s 
Listing were outstanding over 19.6m shares (including 2.2m granted to Executive Directors). This represented 4.3% (0.5% to 
Executive Directors) of the Company’s issued share capital. Our current intention is to settle all share awards outstanding as at 
31 December 2017 with market purchased shares and our ongoing practice is to purchase shares in the market to settle 
obligations. No new shares have been issued since Listing in 2010. Therefore, we are currently operating within the relevant 
dilution targets by a comfortable margin.
Notwithstanding the target outlined above, as a business exposed to both market shocks and critical people issues, we believe 
we should retain flexibility to act very quickly to take steps that could increase dilution up to a maximum of 15% on a 
temporary and short‑ term basis, if the Remuneration Committee and Board believe it is clearly in shareholders’ interests to do so.
If dilution were to exceed 10% in any rolling 10 year period, this would be on an exceptional basis and for a short time period. 
The Remuneration report for the relevant year would also contain the necessary justifications for such an outcome. The 
Remuneration Committee and Board would ensure that dilution levels returned to within the 10% level in any rolling 10 year 
period as soon as practicable thereafter.

APPOINTMENT AND 
REPLACEMENT OF DIRECTORS
The Company’s Articles of Association 
provide that Directors may be appointed

resolution, remove any Director from the 
Board before the expiration of his or her

his or her place. The Company’s Articles 
of Association may be amended by

The Directors are advised of their 
statutory duty to avoid conflicts of 
interest with those of the Company. All 
actual and potential conflicts are 
brought to the attention of the Board. 
The operation of the Company’s policy 
on conflicts of interest is described in the 
Governance section.
The rights and obligations attaching to

where a disabled person can adequately 
fulfil the job’s requirements. Where 
existing employees become disabled, the 
Group’s policy, wherever practicable, is

environment. The Group provides

promotion to disabled employees.
Further details of the Company’s

DIVIDENDS
Effective from 2015, the Board changed 
its approach to dividends to enable 
prompt payment alongside potential 
future special dividends, with the 
expectation that payment of dividends 
can be made in early April. Accordingly, 
the Directors have not recommended a 
final dividend but have approved a full 
year dividend in respect of 2017 of 
10.3 pence per ordinary share (2016: 
10.2 pence per ordinary share). Payment 
of this dividend is not subject to 
approval by shareholders at the AGM. 
The Directors have also declared a 
special dividend of 15.5 pence per 
ordinary share (2016: 12.5 pence per 
ordinary share). Both dividends will be 
paid on 6 April 2018, to shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 
9 March 2018.
POWERS OF THE DIRECTORS 
The Directors manage the Company 
under the powers set out in the 
Company’s Articles of Association. These 
powers include the Directors’ ability to 
issue or buy back shares. An ordinary 
resolution was passed at the AGM on 
17 May 2017, authorising the Directors to 
allot new ordinary shares up to an 
aggregate nominal amount of 
£3,051,332, representing approximately 
one‑ third of the Company’s issued share 
capital. The Directors intend to seek 
shareholders’ approval for the renewal 
of this authority at the AGM, to allot and 
grant rights to subscribe for ordinary 
shares up to an aggregate nominal 
amount of £3,051,332, representing 
approximately one‑ third of the Company’s 
issued share capital as at 26 February 
2018. If approved, this authority will expire 
on 30 June 2019 or, if earlier, at the 
conclusion of the AGM in 2019.
At the AGM in 2017, shareholders 
approved a resolution authorising the 
Company to make purchases of its own 
shares. As at 26 February 2018, the 
Directors have not used this authority. A 
special resolution will be proposed at the 
AGM to renew the Company’s limited 
authority to purchase its own ordinary 
shares. The authority will be limited to a 
maximum of 45,769,950 ordinary shares 
(approximately 10% of the Company’s 
issued share capital as at 26 February 
2018) and will set out the minimum and 
maximum prices which the Company 
may pay for any such purchase. If 
approved, this authority will expire on 
30 June 2019, or, if earlier, at the 
conclusion of the AGM in 2019.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS AND 
AUDIT INFORMATION 
PwC were re‑ appointed as external 
auditors following a tender conducted in 
2014. In accordance with the FRC’s 
recommendations as set out in the Code, 
the Audit will be retendered within 10 
years of that appointment.
GOING CONCERN 
The Strategic report discusses the 
Group’s business activities, together with 
the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position. 
In addition, it sets out the Group’s 
financial position, cash flows, liquidity 
position and borrowing facilities. The 
financial risk management note to the 
Financial Statements sets out the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for 
managing capital and its financial risk 
management objectives, together with 
details of financial instruments and 
exposure to credit and liquidity risk.
The Group has access to the financial 
resources required to run the business 
efficiently and has a strong gross cash 
position. The Group’s forecasts and 
projections, which are subject to rigorous 
sensitivity analysis, show that the Group 
will be able to operate within its 
available resources. As a consequence, 
the Directors consider it appropriate to 
prepare the annual Financial Statements 
on a going concern basis of accounting.
STATEMENT OF VIABILITY
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
Code, the Directors have assessed the 
prospects of the Group over a longer 
period than the 12 months required by 
the Going Concern provision. Details of 
the assessment can be found in the 
Financial Review section of the Strategic 
report.
CHANGE OF CONTROL
The Company does not have 
agreements with any Director or 
employee that would provide 
compensation for loss of office or 
employment resulting from a change of 
control following a takeover bid, except 
that provisions of the Company’s share 
schemes may cause options and awards 
granted under such schemes to vest in 
those circumstances.

may be renewed for further terms as 
appropriate. All appointments are 
subject to a review by the Nomination 
Committee upon the third anniversary 
and on extension a further review is 
undertaken at the sixth anniversary at 
which the Board’s succession plans and 
the need to refresh the Board’s skills and 
experiences are carefully considered.
The role and responsibilities of each 
Director are clearly set out and include 
the duties of a Director provided in the 
Act. It is made clear that these duties do 
not include any management function 
but an indication that the Director is 
expected to support and challenge 
management and help in the 
development of the Group’s strategy. 
Three months’ notice in writing is 
required to be served by either party to 
terminate the appointment.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY 
AND COMPLIANCE STATEMENTS
STATEMENTS RELATING TO THE 
PREPARATION OF THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report, the 
Remuneration Report and the Financial 
Statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law, the 
Directors have prepared the Group and 
Company Financial Statements in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as 
adopted by the European Union (“EU”), 
and related IFRS IC interpretations and 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006 (the “Act”) applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS.
THE DIRECTORS’ REVIEW OF THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors undertook a detailed 
review of the Financial Statements in 
January and February 2018. Following 
this examination, the Board was satisfied 
that the Financial Statements for 2017 
give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and the Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Group for 
that period. Before approving the 
Financial Statements, the Board satisfied 
itself that in preparing the statements:
l l suitable accounting policies had been 
selected and consistently applied;
l l the judgements and accounting 
estimates that have been made were 
reasonable, necessary and prudent; 
and
l l where applicable IFRSs, as adopted by 
the EU, have been adopted they have 
been followed and that there were no 
material departures.
The Directors consider that the Annual 
Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position and performance, business 
model and strategy.
THE DIRECTORS’ REVIEW OF 
GOING CONCERN
The Financial Statements have been 
prepared on the going concern basis, 
the Directors having determined that the 
Company is likely to continue in business 
for at least 12 months from the date of 
this report.
THE DIRECTORS’ REVIEW OF 
CURRENT POSITION, PROSPECTS 
AND PRINCIPAL RISKS
Supported by the Audit and Risk 
Committee, the Directors have completed 
a robust review and assessment of the 
principal risks in the business making use 
of the Enterprise Risk Framework which is 
now functioning in all areas of the 
Company. The framework ensures that 
the relevant risks are identified and 
managed and that information is shared 
at an appropriate level. Full details of 
these risks are provided in the ‘Risks to 
our Strategy’ pages of the Strategic 
report. The Board subjected the 
Enterprise Risk Framework to a detailed 
review in May. The Directors found it was 
an effective mechanism through which 
the principal risks and the Company’s 
risk appetite and tolerances could be 
tested and challenged.
THE DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR ACCOUNTING RECORDS
The Directors have examined the 
accounting records kept in the business 
and have determined that they are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company 
and the Group and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements and 
the Directors’ Remuneration report 
comply with the requirements of the Act 
and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and Group and for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
THE DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR THE SAFEKEEPING OF 
ASSETS
The Directors have examined the steps in 
place for ensuring the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other 
irregularities. The procedure is examined 
and tested on a regular basis. The Board 
is satisfied it is understood and is 
operated well, and accordingly that the 
assets of the Company are safeguarded 
and protected from fraud and other 
irregularities.
THE DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR INFORMATION
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ 
RESPONSIBILITIES
Each of the Directors (whose names and 
functions are listed in the Directors’ 
profiles set out in the Governance 
section) confirms that, to the best of his 
or her knowledge:
l l the Group Financial Statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit 
of the Group; 
l l the Company Financial statements, 
which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities and financial 
position and profit of the Company 
and
l l the Directors’ Report contained in the 
Annual Report and Accounts includes 
a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with a 
description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces.
In accordance with Section 418 of the 
Act, the Directors’ report includes a 
statement, in the case of each Director 
in office at the date the Directors’ report 
is approved, that:
(a)  so far as the Director is aware, 
there is no relevant audit information 
(as defined in section 418(3)) of the 
Act of which the Company’s auditors 
are unaware; and
(b)  he/she has taken all the steps that 
he/she ought to have taken as a 
Director in order to make himself/
herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of 
that information.

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
INTRODUCTION
The Group’s financial statements have been split into sections to assist with their navigation and align with the Financial Review. 
Accounting policies are contained within relevant notes and are boxed, with the basis of preparation and general policies 
collected in Section 5. An explanation of the use of alternative performance measures (APMs) is provided on page 31. 
1.1.  REVENUE
The Group’s primary source of revenue is management fees. Management fees are based on an agreed percentage of the 
assets under management (AUM). Initial charges and commissions include fees based on a set percentage of certain flows to 
our funds and profits earned on dealing within the unit trust manager’s box, known as box profits. Performance fees are earned 
from some funds when agreed performance conditions are met. Net revenue is stated after fee and commission expenses to 
intermediaries for ongoing services under distribution agreements.
Revenue
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of investment management 
services. Revenue is shown net of any value added tax, rebates and discounts. Our primary revenue components are 
accounted for as follows: 
l l management fees are recognised in the period in which the service is performed and are calculated as a percentage 
of net fund assets managed in accordance with individual management agreements;
l l initial charges and commissions on sales of unit trusts are deferred and amortised over the anticipated period of the 
provision of investment management services. Box profits, which will no longer be earned by the Group from January 2018, 
are calculated as the difference between the cost of purchasing redeemed units at cancellation prices and reselling them 
at creation prices. Such box profits are recognised when the related transaction occurs; and
l l performance fees are calculated as a percentage of the appreciation in the net asset value of a fund above a defined 
hurdle and are recognised when the fee amount can be estimated reliably and it is virtually certain that the fee will be 
received. Such fees are normally recognised at the end of the relevant reporting period of the fund.
Fee and commission expenses
These are paid to third parties for ongoing services under distribution agreements and are charged to the income  
statement over the period in which the service is expected to be provided. The services provided include the provision of 
access to a basket of fund products, information on financial products, promotional materials, ongoing services to clients 
and transaction processing.

1.2.  SEGMENTAL REPORTING
The Group offers a range of products and services through different distribution channels. All financial, business and strategic 
decisions are made centrally by the Board of Directors (the Board), which determines the key performance indicators of the 
Group. Information is reported to the chief operating decision maker, the Board, on a single segment basis. While the Group 
has the ability to analyse its underlying information in different ways, for example by product type, this information is only used 
to allocate resources and assess performance for the Group as a whole. On this basis, the Group considers itself to be a 
single‑ segment investment management business.
Management monitors operating earnings, a non‑ GAAP measure (see page 31), for the purpose of making decisions about 
resource allocation and performance assessment.

Staff costs include wages and salaries, share‑ based payments, pension costs and redundancy costs, along with associated 
social security costs, and are recognised on an accruals basis as services are provided to the Group.
Pension costs
The Group contributes to a number of defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of its employees. Contributions in 
respect of the UK employees (at the rate of 15% of gross salary) are made into the Jupiter Pension Scheme whose financial 
statements are available from the trustees at the registered office of the Company. No liability is included in the balance sheet 
as no obligations were outstanding at the balance sheet date. 
Contributions made by the Group are charged to the consolidated income statement as they become payable in accordance 
with the rules of the schemes.

Fund units
As described in Note 1.5(ii), deferred bonuses can be deferred into either options over the Company’s shares or a cash 
equivalent to units in the Group’s funds. The expense included within wages and salaries in the income statement in relation to 
fund units for the year ended 31 December 2017 was £5.2m (2016: £3.0m).
Where bonuses are deferred into fund units, the fair value of the award is spread over the vesting period and included 
within staff costs. The liability is revalued at each balance sheet date to the expected settlement amount, being the current 
market value of the underlying fund unit. Any increase or decrease in value is recognised in the income statement within 
staff costs. The liability is included in the balance sheet as part of accrued expenses within trade and other payables 
(see Note 3.9).
The Group hedges its exposure to price fluctuations in the underlying fund units by purchasing the fund units at the date of 
grant. These are included within financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) on the balance sheet. Any change 
in the fair value of the units is recognised in the income statement within other gains.
Average number of employees
The monthly average number of persons employed by the Group during the year, including Executive Directors, by activity is:
2017 2016
Fund management 72 66
Distribution and marketing 121 119

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – INCOME STATEMENT
1.5.  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Group engages in share‑ based payment transactions in respect of services receivable from certain employees by 
granting the right to either shares or options over shares, subject to certain vesting conditions and exercise prices. These 
have been accounted for as equity‑ settled share‑ based payments.
The fair value of the awards granted in the form of shares or share options is recognised as an expense over the 
appropriate performance and vesting period. The corresponding credit is recognised in retained earnings within total equity. 
The fair value of the awards is calculated using an option pricing model, the principal inputs being the market value on the 
date of award, discounted for any dividends foregone over the holding period of the award, and an adjustment for 
expected and actual levels of vesting which includes estimating the number of eligible employees leaving the Group and the 
number of employees satisfying the relevant performance conditions. These estimates are reviewed regularly and the charge 
to the income statement is adjusted appropriately (at the end of the relevant scheme as a minimum). Shares and options 
vest on the occurrence of a specified event under the rules of the relevant plan.
A summary of the charge taken to the income statement (excluding social security) for each share‑ based payment arrangement 
is shown below:

Sharesave Plan (SAYE) 0.4 0.4
Share Incentive Plan (SIP) 0.3 0.3
Total (Note 1.4) 27.0 18.1
The fair value of the services provided by employees has been calculated indirectly by reference to the fair value of the equity 
instruments granted. Fair value amounts for the options granted under the DBP, LTIP and SAYE schemes were determined using 
a Black Scholes option‑ pricing method and the following assumptions:
2017 2016
DBP 2016 LTIP 2017 SAYE 2017 DBP 2015 LTIP 2016 SAYE 2016
Weighted average share price (£) 4.21 4.22 5.37 4.10 4.11 4.54

Weighted average dividend yield (%) 3.5 3.5 3.2 3.6 3.6 3.3
Weighted average risk‑ free interest rate (%) 0.2 0.2 0.6 0.5 0.5 0.2
Expected volatility for options granted in 2017 and 2016 has been calculated using the historical volatility of the Group.
The numbers above in relation to the LTIP include Joiner Plans as both schemes have a similar structure. 
(i) Interests in options under pre-Listing Share Plan
These options were granted to certain employees prior to listing in June 2010 and allowed them to acquire shares at nominal 
value, subject to satisfying certain vesting and performance conditions. The terms of the options allowed individuals to make a 
payment to the Company entitling them to take up rights to shares between one and five years after the grant date, depending 
on the individual award. Some awards were modified in 2015, extending the vesting date by between one and three years. The 
interests in options under pre‑ Listing Share Plan were granted at the nominal price of £0.02, which gives them the characteristics 
of nil cost options and therefore the fair value of these awards is based on the market price at the date of the award. 103

option granted was £1.48.
The weighted average remaining contractual life for the share options outstanding as at 31 December 2017 is 0.8 years 
(31 December 2016: 1.7 years).
(ii) Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)
All employees of the Group who are eligible for a bonus over a certain level, as determined by the Remuneration Committee, 
are required to participate in the DBP. The DBP provides for compulsory deferral of a proportion of bonus. Deferrals can be 
made into either options over the Company’s shares or a cash amount equivalent to the value of units in the Group’s funds 
(see Note 1.4 for information on the treatment of fund units). The awards in respect of DBP are granted after the year end to 
which they relate. The awards made in 2016 and 2017 in relation to 2015 and 2016 performance were granted in the form of nil 
cost options over the Company’s shares, at a price calculated as the market price immediately prior to the date of the award. 
Awards will also be made in 2018 in relation to 2017 performance, thus a charge for these awards has been taken to the 
income statement in 2017.

(v) Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
All eligible UK employees may participate in the Group’s Share Incentive Plan, which was introduced in 2013. Under the terms of 
this plan, employees may contribute from pre‑ tax salary up to the maximum amount permitted under legislation in any tax year, 
to be used to acquire shares in the Company at the market price on the relevant date. Matching shares are then awarded by 
the Company on a one matching share for each share purchased basis. The matching shares are subject to forfeiture where 
the employee leaves employment with the Group within three years of their award.
The number of matching shares purchased under this scheme during the year was 61,975 (2016: 41,731).
(vi) International Share Award (ISA)
All non‑ UK employees may participate in the Group’s International Share Award, which was introduced in 2017 to create a 
non‑ UK plan similar to the Sharesave Plan. Under the terms of this award, international employees are offered the opportunity 
to be granted a share option which is exercisable after three years and three months. The exercise price is set at the same 
level as for the Sharesave Plan. Participants in the plan have six months from the date of vesting to exercise their option.
The number of awards made during the year was 23,133. 
1.6.  OPERATING EARNINGS
Operating earnings are defined as net revenue less administrative expenses and do not include investment income and returns, 
other gains and amortisation of intangible assets. These are items which the Group considers are not indicative of the ongoing 
income and costs of its operations. The Group believes that operating earnings, while not a GAAP measure, gives relevant 
information on the profitability of the Group and its ongoing operations (see page 31). Operating earnings may not be 
comparable with similarly‑ titled measures used by other companies.

SECTION 1: RESULTS FOR THE YEAR
NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – INCOME STATEMENT
1.10. INCOME TAX EXPENSE
The Group’s headquarters are based in the UK. The Group pays taxes according to the rates applicable in the countries in 
which it operates. Most taxes are recorded in the income statement and relate to taxes payable for the reporting period 
(current tax), but there is also a charge relating to tax payable for future periods due to income or expenses being recognised 
in a different period for tax and accounting purposes (deferred tax). Tax is charged to equity when the tax benefit exceeds the 
cumulative income statement expense on share plans. 
The Group provides for current tax according to the tax laws of each jurisdiction in which it operates using tax rates that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Management periodically evaluates positions taken 
in tax returns in respect of situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions, 
where appropriate, on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases 
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax is recognised in respect of 
all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that 
result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance 
sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised when it is considered recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the 
basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as probable that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to 
recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary 
differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date. Deferred tax that has arisen in respect of equity items such as share‑ based payments is recognised 
directly in equity and not in the income statement.

1.11. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the profit for the year by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares outstanding during the year less the weighted average number of own shares held. Own shares are shares held in an 
Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) for the benefit of employees under the vesting, lock‑ in and other incentive arrangements in place.
Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the profit for the year by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding 
during the year for the purpose of basic EPS plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on 
the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
For the purposes of calculating EPS, the share capital of the parent is calculated as the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue over the years reported. The weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the calculation of EPS is 
as follows:

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
3.1. GOODWILL
Goodwill arising on acquisitions, being the excess of the cost of a business combination over the fair value of the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, is capitalised in the consolidated balance sheet. Goodwill is carried at 
cost less provision for impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment or 
more frequently if any indicators of impairment arise. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (CGUs) for the purpose 
of impairment testing, with the allocation to those CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business 
combination in which the goodwill arose. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
Goodwill relates to the 2007 acquisition of Knightsbridge Asset Management Limited.
2017 
£m
2016
£m
Goodwill 341.2 341.2
341.2 341.2
No additional goodwill was recognised in the year (2016: £nil).
The Group has determined that it has a single CGU for the purpose of assessing the carrying value of goodwill. In performing 
the impairment test, management prepares a calculation of the recoverable amount of the goodwill and compares this to the 
carrying value.
The recoverable amount for the acquired share capital was based on the net present value of the Group’s future earnings. 
The net present value was calculated using a discounted cash flow model, with reference to the Group’s projected cash flows, 
long‑ term growth rates of 14% and a cost of capital of 18%. The projections assumed declining revenue margins of 1 ‑ 2 basis 
points a year and reductions of approximately 1% a year in the Group’s cost/income ratio. A significant headroom was noted, 
and therefore no impairment was implied. Adverse movements of 5% in growth rates and/or the cost of capital would not result 
in the recognition of impairment losses. No impairment losses have been recognised in the current or preceding years.
3.2. INTANGIBLE ASSETS
At the balance sheet date, the Group held fully amortised intangible assets still in use in respect of its 2007 acquisition of 
Knightsbridge Asset Management Limited. This acquisition gave rise to the recognition of intangible assets relating to investment 
management contracts and the trade name of the Group. The other intangible assets recognised are computer software.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are held at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any provision for 
impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount 
by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s 
fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest 
levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (CGUs).
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. 
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is the fair value as at the date of acquisition. In relation 
to the investment management contracts and the trade name, the useful lives were assessed as being finite and have been 
amortised over their useful economic lives. The useful economic lives of the trade name and individual management 
contracts acquired were assessed as a maximum of ten years and seven years, respectively. Both are now fully amortised. 
The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives has been recognised in the consolidated income statement 
on a straight line basis. 
Computer software licences acquired are capitalised at the cost incurred to bring the software into use and are amortised 
on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are estimated as being five years. Costs associated with 
developing or maintaining computer software programs that do not meet the capitalisation criteria under IAS 38 are 
recognised as an expense as incurred.
Gains and losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying value of the asset. The difference is then recognised in the income statement.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that an asset in use may be impaired. 
If any such indication exists and the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount at that time, the assets are 
written down to their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is measured as the greater of fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use. Non‑financial assets that have suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at 
each reporting date.
The Directors have reviewed the intangible assets as at 31 December 2017 and have concluded there are no indicators of 
impairment (2016: same).

3.3. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. Cost 
includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s 
carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits 
associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repair and 
maintenance expenditures are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they were incurred. 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis to allocate the cost of each asset over its estimated useful life as follows:
Leasehold improvements   19 y ears (until the end of the lease)
Office furniture and equipment  5 years
The assets’ useful economic lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial period end and adjusted if appropriate. 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected 
from its use. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal of the asset, calculated as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the item, is included in the income statement in the year the item is sold or retired.

3.4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HELD AT FAIR VALUE
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of an instrument. 
They are initially measured at fair value adjusted for transaction costs, except for financial assets classified as at fair value 
through profit or loss where transaction costs are immediately recognised in the income statement. Financial assets are 
derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or where they have been transferred and 
the Group has also transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability has been discharged, cancelled or has expired.
Financial assets
The Group’s financial assets include cash and short‑ term deposits, trade and other receivables, seed capital investments and 
derivative financial instruments. Financial assets are classified as being designated at FVTPL on initial recognition or as loans 
and receivables. The classification adopted by the Group depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were 
acquired and is determined at initial recognition.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at FVTPL include investments in open‑ ended investment companies and unit trusts which are designated 
as at FVTPL as they are managed and evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the documented strategy. 
A financial asset is classified in this category if it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. 
Financial assets at FVTPL are carried at fair value, with gains and losses recognised in the income statement within other 
gains in the period in which they arise. Assets in this category are classified as current assets. Where the Group is deemed 
to have control, the investment is consolidated. Where the Group is deemed to have significant influence, the investment 
is classified as an investment in associate. Further information is included in the basis of consolidation in Note 5.1.
Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, derivative financial instruments and the non‑ controlling 
interests in funds that have been consolidated as subsidiaries.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are carried at fair value, with gains and losses recognised in the income statement within other 
gains in the period in which they arise. Financial liabilities at FVTPL principally comprise non‑ controlling interests in 
consolidated funds which are designated as at FVTPL. Further information is provided in Note 5.1.

The other deferred tax balances at 31 December 2016 and 2017 include short ‑ term timing differences and temporary differences 
between depreciation and capital allowances. 
Changes to UK corporation tax rates were substantively enacted as part of the Finance Bill 2016 (on 6 September 2016), 
including a reduction of the main rate to 17% from 1 April 2020. Deferred taxes at the balance sheet date reflected in these 
financial statements have been measured using the relevant enacted tax rate for the year in which they are expected to be 
realised or settled.
3.6. TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment is established when there is objective 
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. 
The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future 
cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against 
trade receivables and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement. Subsequent recoveries of amounts 
previously written off are credited to the income statement.
Trade and other receivables, including loans to employees, are included in current assets except where they have maturities 
greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non ‑ current assets. 
Accrued income relates to accrued interest and accrued management, performance and registration fees. It is based on 
the latest available information and therefore involves a degree of estimation related to the valuation of underlying AUM.

short‑ term deposit rates.
Cash held by EBT and seed capital subsidiaries is not available for use by the Group.
3.8. LOANS AND BORROWINGS
The Group has access to a revolving credit facility (RCF) of £50.0m (2016: £50.0m). The facility expires in July 2019 and was 
undrawn at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2017.
Interest on the RCF is payable at a rate per annum of LIBOR plus a margin of 0.7%. A non‑ utilisation fee is payable on the 
RCF at a rate of 0.25% per annum on the undrawn balance. A utilisation fee is also payable at a rate of 0.3% per annum when 
more than 66% of the facility is drawn, and 0.1% per annum when 33% to 66% of the facility is drawn. No utilisation fee is 
payable when less than 33% of the facility is drawn. 
3.9. TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or 
premium on settlement. 
Accruals are based on the latest information and, therefore, involve a degree of estimation. The most significant accruals 
at the year end relate to bonuses. The Group recognises a provision for bonuses based on a formula that takes into 
consideration the operating profitability of the Group. At the end of each financial year, the Group recognises accrued 
expenses for bonuses accrued but not yet paid in respect of service attributable to that year. 
Deferred income relates to initial charges being spread over the expected lives of the contracts, which we estimate to be six 
years, on a straight‑ line basis.

4.2. RESERVES
(i) Own share reserve
The Group operates an EBT for the purpose of satisfying certain retention awards to employees. The holdings of this trust, 
which is funded by the Group, include shares that have not vested unconditionally to employees of the Group. These shares 
are recorded at cost and are classified as own shares. The shares are used to settle obligations that arise from the granting 
of share–based awards.
At 31 December 2017, 9.5m ordinary shares (2016: 9.5m), with a par value of £0.2m (2016: £0.2m), were held as own shares 
within the Group’s EBT for the purpose of satisfying share option obligations to employees.
(ii) Other reserve
The other reserve of £8.0m (2016: £8.0m) relates to the conversion of Tier 2 preference shares in 2010.
(iii) Foreign currency translation reserve
The foreign currency translation reserve of £2.6m (2016: £2.8m) is used to record exchange differences arising from the 
translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries. During the period, nil (2016: £5.0m) was transferred to the income 
statement following the liquidation of overseas subsidiaries.
(iv) Retained earnings
Retained earnings of £620.7m (2016: £590.6m) are the amount of earnings that are retained within the Group after dividend 
payments and other transactions with owners. 
4.3. DIVIDENDS
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised in the accounting period in which the dividends are 
paid and, in the case of full‑ year dividends, when these are approved by the Company’s shareholders.

Special dividend (12.5p per ordinary share) (2016: 10.9p per ordinary share) 56.0 49.0
132.2 116.8
Full‑ year and special dividends are paid out of profits recognised in the year prior to the year in which the dividends are 
declared and reported.
The EBT has waived its right to receive future dividends on shares held in the trust. Dividends waived on shares held in the EBT 
in 2017 were £2.8m (2016: £2.2m). 
A full‑ year dividend for 2017 of 10.3p per share (2016: 10.2p) and a special dividend of 15.5p per share (2016: 12.5p) have been 
declared by the Directors. These dividends amount to £47.1m and £70.9m respectively (before adjusting for any dividends 
waived on shares in the EBT) and will be accounted for in 2018. Including the interim dividend for 2017 of 6.8p per share (2016: 
4.5p), this gives a total dividend per share of 32.6p (2016: 27.2p).
SECTION 4: EQUITY
NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – EQUITY 118
Financial statements
5.1. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND OTHER ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
adopted by the European Union and IFRS IC Interpretations (IFRS as adopted by the EU) and with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis using the historical cost convention modified by the 
revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivatives) that have been measured at fair value. 
After reviewing the Group’s current plans and forecasts and financing arrangements, as well as the current trading activities 
of the Group, the Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue operating for a period of at least 
12 months from the balance sheet date.
Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 include the consolidated financial information 
of the Company and its subsidiaries. The accounting policies set out those policies that have been applied consistently in 
preparing the Group financial statements. No new policies have been adopted for the year ended 31 December 2017. The 
preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas 
involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the 
consolidated financial statements, are disclosed later in this note within the section Critical accounting estimates, judgements 
and assumptions.
Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are those entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an investee if the Group has all of 
the following:
l l power over the investee;
l l exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
l l the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
The Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: 
the purpose and design of an investee, relevant activities, substantive and protective rights, and voting rights and potential 
voting rights. The Group assesses whether it is acting as an agent or principal for its holdings in its seed capital investments. 
Where the Group concludes it is acting as a principal the entity is consolidated. This assessment is based on the Group’s 
total exposure. This incorporates direct holdings and income earned from management and performance fees. There is 
no fixed minimum percentage at which the Group consolidates, and each exposure is reviewed individually. The Group re–
assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts or circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of 
the three elements of control.
A list of subsidiaries can be seen in Note 6.3. Consistent accounting policies are applied across all Group companies and 
intra–group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Seed capital investments are 
accounted for as subsidiaries, associates or other financial investments depending on the holdings of the Group and on 
the level of influence and control that the Group is judged to have. The transactions and balances of subsidiaries are 
consolidated in these financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. Where 
external investors hold shares or redeemable shares in funds controlled by the Group, the portion of profit or loss and net 
assets held by these non–controlling interests is included within other gains in the consolidated income statement and as 
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss in the consolidated balance sheet respectively.

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – OTHER 119
GOVERNANCE OTHER INFORMATION
Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(ii) Associates
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the 
financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control. Generally, it is presumed that the 
Group has significant influence where it has voting rights of 20% or more, but not control of the investee. Seed capital 
investments over which the Group has significant influence, but not control, are carried in the balance sheet at fair value as 
permitted by IAS 28, Investment in Associates, with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
The fair value of investments in associates is determined by reference to the quoted price or net asset value of the 
underlying investments at the close of business on the balance sheet date. The Group has no other investments in associates 
and, therefore, no associates are currently accounted for using the equity method.
Foreign currency
(i) Functional and presentational currency
Items included in the financial information of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are 
presented in sterling, which is both the Company’s functional and presentational currency as well as the currency in which 
the majority of the Group’s revenue streams, assets and liabilities are denominated.
(ii) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates 
of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the 
translation at year‑ end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised 
in the consolidated income statement within administrative expenses.
Translation differences on non–monetary financial assets and liabilities, such as equities held at fair value through profit 
or loss, are recognised in the consolidated income statement as part of other gains. 
(iii) Group companies
The assets and liabilities of Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentational currency are 
translated at the closing rate at the balance sheet date, with income and expenses translated at average exchange rates. 
Resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of other comprehensive income and are recycled 
to the income statement on disposal or liquidation of the relevant branch or subsidiary. 120

5.1. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND OTHER ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
New standards and interpretations not applied
The International Accounting Standards Board and IFRS IC have issued a number of new accounting standards, amendments 
to existing standards and interpretations. The following new standards are not applicable to these financial statements, but 
are expected to have an impact when they become effective. The Group plans to apply these standards in the reporting 
period in which they become effective.
Endorsed by the EU Summary
Effective for 
periods beginning 
on or after
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Replacement project on financial instruments consists of three phases:
l l Phase 1: Classification and measurement of financial assets and 
financial liabilities;
l l Phase 2: Impairment methodology; and
l l Phase 3: Hedge accounting
1 January 2018
IFRS 15 Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers
Establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting 
for revenue arising from contracts with customers. It will supersede the 
current revenue standard IAS 18 Revenue
1 January 2018
IFRS 16 Leases Provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise 
assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less 
or the underlying asset has a low value. It will supersede the current 
guidance found in IAS 17 Leases 
1 January 2019
There are no other IFRSs or IFRS IC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material 
impact on the Group. The adoption of the accounting standards endorsed but not yet applied above are not expected to 
have a significant impact on the financial statements of the Group, except for IFRS 16. 
In respect of IFRS 9, the Group holds instruments such as derivatives and non–controlling interests in consolidated funds 
(NCIs) at fair value, the former held for trading and the latter designated at FVTPL. Under the new standard, derivatives will 
continue to be held for trading (and therefore at FVTPL). Similarly, the option to designate an instrument at FVTPL to avoid 
an accounting mismatch has been carried over into IFRS 9. In the case of NCIs, the liability at fair value matches the assets 
of the fund, which are required to be held at fair value (if equities or derivatives) or which we elect to hold at fair value (if 
they are hedged debt instruments).
Trade and other receivables and payables principally comprise short–term settlement accounts and accruals, neither of which 
are held for trading or meet the definition of items that could be carried at fair value. Such instruments will therefore remain 
at amortised cost.
In terms of impairment, the majority of Jupiter’s revenue comes from management fees due from the funds for which we 
provide management services. These are paid to the Group monthly, a few days in advance of the month end. Therefore, at 
each month end, receivables are low as we have already collected amounts due from the majority of our clients. Typically, 
receivables comprise unpaid sales contracts and expropriations (together, settlement accounts), which are receivables in 
transit between funds and end clients and which are required to be settled within four days. Other trade debtors comprise 
amounts due from institutional clients. Cash collateral is paid over by the Group to satisfy counterparty requirements in 
respect of open derivative positions.
It is very unusual for Jupiter to suffer any impairment in respect of trade receivables: unpaid settlements do not result in 
losses, but instead oblige the Group to purchase units in funds which are then subject to market risk until they can be sold. 
Institutional debtors rarely default, given that the Group manages assets worth many multiples of any outstanding fees on 
behalf of those clients, although it should be noted that the Group is not generally permitted to remove cash from managed 
segregated mandates in order to receive settlement. Cash held with banks or held by other companies as collateral could 
be at risk should the financial institutions holding it fail. We have not experienced and do not expect to experience credit 
losses to arise from these counterparties. 
In the Group’s consideration of the impact of IFRS 15 on its financial statements, we have employed the five step model to 
determine the timing and quantification of revenue under this new standard. Our implementation efforts included the 
identification of all material revenue sources, including management and performance fees, upfront fees and also upfront 
revenue‑ related costs. We undertook a review of customer contracts to determine our performance obligation and the 
associated recognition timing. The Group’s current accounting policies under IAS 18 Revenue meet the requirements of IFRS 
15 in respect these revenue sources. We do not therefore currently expect IFRS 15 to have a significant impact on the Group. 
We plan to adopt this standard on a retrospective basis from 1 January 2018. 
The Group expects the adoption of IFRS 16 to significantly increase the Group’s total assets and liabilities as a result of the 
requirement to capitalise both the right to use leased assets and the contractual payments to be made under lease 
obligations. As a result of the liability being calculated using discounting, the income statement charge for lease payments is 
expected to be larger in the earlier years of a lease, and smaller in the later years. In addition, the rental charge, previously 
recognised as a single administrative charge within the income statement, will be split into a depreciation charge relating to 
the capitalised asset (within administrative expenses) and a finance cost representing the unwinding of the discount. Adoption 
will also adversely impact the Group’s regulatory capital position as the capitalised asset will meet the definition of an illiquid 
asset and will therefore be deducted from the Group’s capital, thereby reducing the Group’s regulatory capital surplus. As a 
result of uncertainty around the discount rate which will be used on adoption of the standard on 1 January 2019, we cannot 
reliably quantify its financial impact, but we do not expect this to create any significant issues for the Group. 121

Critical accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions
The preparation of the financial information requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. If such estimates and 
assumptions, which are based on management’s best judgement at the date of preparation of the financial information, deviate 
from actual circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the period in which the 
circumstances change. The areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Group financial statements are 
discussed in the following notes:
1.5  Share–based payments (area of estimation)
3.1  Impairment of goodwill (area of estimation)
3.9  Deferred income (area of estimation)
5.1  Consolidation of seed capital investments (area of judgement)

The Group used the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments:
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 2: other techniques, for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, 
either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on 
observable market data (unobservable inputs). 123

Level 1 financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments that are actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to 
quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
Investments in associates and financial assets at FVTPL
These relate to seed capital investments and hedges of awards in fund units in mutual funds. Details are included in Note 5.4.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL
These relate to non–controlling interests in funds that have been consolidated as subsidiaries.
Level 2 financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments are valued based on a compilation of observable market data from readily available 
from external sources. 
Derivative financial instruments
Derivatives are held to hedge specific exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures they are hedging. 
The derivatives are held at fair value which represents the price to exit the instruments at the balance sheet date. Movements 
in the fair value are included in the income statement.
The Group enters into swap arrangements and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain of its seed capital 
investments. Gains and losses arising from fair value movements in the swap and forward contracts are recognised in the 
consolidated income statement within other gains and are settled periodically, in accordance with the terms of the contract. 
Any cash settlements due from or to the counterparty in relation to the swap arrangements, which are required to be settled 
at the end of each month, are recorded within current assets or current liabilities as trade receivables or other payables, as 
appropriate. The fair value of the foreign exchange contracts, which are required to be settled at periods other than month 
end, are recorded within financial assets or liabilities at FVTPL, as appropriate.
At 31 December 2017, the notional value of the swaps was £40.3m (2016: £39.3m) and the foreign exchange forward contracts 
was £75.6m (2016: £28.4m). The settlement amount of the swaps at 31 December 2017 was £1.4m (2016: £0.8m), which was due 
to the counterparty and is included within trade and other payables. The fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts 
is included within financial assets at FVTPL (£0.3m (2016: £nil)) and financial liabilities at FVTPL (£0.2m (2016: £0.4m)).
Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group is subject to a number of financial risks throughout its business, the principal risks being market risk (including price, 
foreign exchange and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Board is accountable for risk and is responsible for 
oversight of the risk management process. The Board has ultimate responsibility for the risk strategy of the Group, and for 
determining an appropriate risk appetite and tolerance levels within which the Group must operate. By defining these, the Board 
demonstrates that it is aware of and, where appropriate, has taken steps to mitigate the impact of risks that may have a 
material impact on the Group.
The Executive Committee reviews the key corporate risks facing the Group. The Chief Executive Officer has ultimate responsibility 
for the governance of the risk management of the firm, but delegates the risk and control framework to the Head of Risk, who 
has responsibility for the monitoring and reporting of risk and controls, and through the Risk Committee manages the ongoing 
development of the Group’s risk and control framework. Jupiter embeds risk management within the business, with independent 
oversight and challenge being provided by the risk function. 124

identified price risk as the exposure to unfavourable movements in the value of financial assets held by the Group, which would 
result in a loss recognised in the consolidated income statement. The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk.
The Group holds listed equity investments in its seed capital portfolio which are exposed to the risk of changes in equity 
markets. At 31 December 2017, the fair value, and therefore maximum exposure to listed securities, was £96.6m (2016: £58.7m).
The Group’s policy is to hedge the equity market and currency exposure of its seed capital investments depending on the fund 
mandate and whether available transactions are cost effective. As at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, the Group held 
swap instruments to act as hedges against risk exposures arising from certain holdings in seed fund investments. 
Price risk sensitivity analysis on financial assets
The Directors believe that 10% gives a reasonable measure of the Group’s sensitivity to price risk. An increase or decrease 
of 10% in equity markets would have the impact shown below on the Group’s profit before taxation. This reflects estimated 
gains and losses on the Group’s listed investments at the balance sheet date and not any likely impact on the Group’s revenue 
or costs. There is no material impact on the Group’s equity.

The analysis takes account of the relevant derivative transactions the Group has entered into to hedge against such 
movements.
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses through adverse movements in currency exchange rates. 
The Group predominantly operates in the UK, with some transactions from overseas third parties in foreign currencies, which 
create exposure to non–sterling income and expenses. The Group’s policy is to hold the minimum amount of currency required 
to cover operational needs and to convert foreign currency on receipt. Direct exposures are limited to operational cash held 
in overseas subsidiaries, short–term outstanding currency fee debts and investments in seed capital denominated in a foreign 
currency. The Group does not normally hedge this risk, other than in the case of certain seed capital investments, which are 
hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts. These contracts are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. 
Foreign currency risk is monitored closely and managed by the finance function.
Foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis
The Directors believe that 10% gives a reasonable measure of the Group’s sensitivity to foreign exchange risk. The following table 
demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible change in foreign exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s 
profit before tax. This reflects estimated gains and losses on retranslating the Group’s foreign currency assets and liabilities at 
the balance sheet date and not any likely impact on the Group’s revenue or costs. The exposure to foreign exchange risk arises 
principally through operational cash balances held in foreign currencies and seed capital investments held in non–Sterling share 
classes. There is no material impact on the Group’s equity.

The sensitivity analysis takes account of the relevant derivative transactions the Group has entered into to hedge against such 
exposures.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
market interest rates.
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the Group’s cash balances (Note 3.7). The Group manages interest 
rate risk via the finance function monitoring of the interest rate cash flow risks and returns. The Group puts cash on deposit at 
fixed rates of interest for periods of up to three months. 
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The Directors believe that a movement in interest rates of 50bps gives a reasonable measure of the Group’s sensitivity to 
interest rate risk. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible change in interest rates, with all other variables 
held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax (mainly through the impact on floating rate cash deposits). There is no material 
impact on the Group’s equity. 125

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract leading 
to a financial loss in the Group’s operating activities.
The Group is exposed to credit risk primarily from its treasury activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, 
but also from its trade receivables and, in certain circumstances, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Trade 
receivables arise principally within the Group’s investment management business and amounts are monitored regularly. 
Historically, default levels have been insignificant. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss expose the Group to credit 
risk where seed capital investments in funds are consolidated and those funds hold investments in debt instruments or derivative 
positions with a positive fair value. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is £390.4m (2016: £335.0m), represented by the 
carrying value of its non–equity financial assets at FVTPL (£50.5m (2016: £8.6m)), trade receivables (£105.7m (2016: £67.5m)) and 
cash and cash equivalents (£234.2m (2016: £258.9m)).
The fair values of the Group’s financial liabilities at FVTPL are not affected by changes in the Group’s credit risk. There is no 
difference between the carrying amount of financial liabilities at FVTPL and the amount the Group would be contractually 
required to pay at maturity.
With regard to credit risk related to financial instruments, the Group’s policy is to place deposits only with financial institutions 
which satisfy minimum ratings and other criteria set by the Counterparty Review Group (CRG). Investments of surplus funds are 
made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty. The limits are set to minimise 
the concentration of risks and thereby mitigate the possibility of financial loss through counterparty failure. The CRG monitors 
the Group’s counterparty exposures.

5.3. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may be unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due or only at a significantly 
higher cost. The Group produces cash flow forecasts to assist in the efficient management of the collection and payment of 
liquid assets and liabilities.
The Group’s objectives in respect of liquidity are:
l l ensuring both the Group as a whole and individual entities within the Group have access to sufficient liquid funds to trade 
solvently and meet trading liabilities as they fall due;
l l allowing the Group to maintain a flexible dividend policy, taking reference to prior year and prospective profitability, capital 
requirements and cash flow; and
l l providing the Group with appropriate flexibility over the transferability of its capital and cash balances.
Surplus cash held by the operating entities over and above the balances required for working capital management is held 
in interest bearing deposits of up to three months. Regulated companies ensure that sufficient capital is maintained to meet 
regulatory requirements.
The Group has access to a revolving credit facility (RCF) of £50m which was unutilised at 31 December 2017 (2016: same). The 
facility expires in 2019.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016

Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing its capital and funding structure are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, maintain appropriate financial resources, maximise shareholder value, maintain an optimal capital structure to 
reduce the cost of capital and to meet working capital requirements.

Total capital 640.3 610.4
Regulatory capital requirements
The Group considers its share capital and reserves to constitute its total capital. The subsidiaries within the Group which are 
regulated are required to maintain capital resources to comply with the regulatory capital requirements of the FCA and certain 
overseas financial regulators. All regulated entities within the Group complied with the externally‑ imposed regulatory capital 
requirements. Headroom over regulatory capital is discussed by the Balance Sheet Management Committee. Further information 
on the Balance Sheet Management Committee can be found in the Management Committees overview within the Governance 
section.
In addition to the capital held to meet the regulatory capital requirements, the Group maintains sufficient cash resources to 
meet its liabilities as and when they fall due, based on regularly produced cash forecasts, modelling both normal and stressed 
conditions. Liquidity risk is mitigated by the availability of the RCF and the high level of cash in the business. 127

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
5.4. INTERESTS IN STRUCTURED ENTITIES
IFRS 12 requires certain disclosures in respect of interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and unconsolidated 
structured entities. 
A structured entity is defined as an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor 
in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only, or when the relevant 
activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements. The Group has assessed whether the funds it manages are 
structured entities and concluded that mutual funds and investment trusts managed by the Group are structured entities unless 
substantive removal or liquidation rights exist.
The Group has interests in these funds through the receipt of management and other fees and, in certain funds, through 
ownership of fund units. The Group’s investments in these funds are subject to the terms and conditions of the respective fund’s 
offering documentation and are susceptible to market price risk. The investments are included in financial assets at fair value 
through profit or loss in the statement of financial position.
Where the Group has no equity holding in a fund it manages, the investment risk is borne by the external investors and 
therefore the Group’s maximum exposure to loss relates to future management fees and any uncollected fees at the balance 
sheet date. Where the Group does have an equity holding, the maximum exposure to loss constitutes the future and uncollected 
management fees plus the fair value of the Group’s investment in that fund.
The Group does not sponsor any of the structured entities and there are no guarantees or commitments.
Direct holdings in unconsolidated structured entities
Direct investments in unconsolidated structured entities comprise seed capital investments and hedges of awards in fund units 
in mutual funds and investment trusts, details of which are given below:

5.5. RELATED PARTIES
The Group manages a number of investment trusts, unit trusts and overseas funds and receives management and, in some 
instances, performance fees for providing this service. The precise fee arrangements are disclosed within the financial 
statements of each investment management subsidiary of the Group or within other publicly available information. By virtue of 
the investment management agreements in place between the Group and the collective investment vehicles it manages, such 
funds may be considered to be related parties. Investment management and performance fees are disclosed in Note 1.1. 
The Group acts as manager for 38 (2016: 38) authorised unit trusts. Each unit trust is jointly administered with the trustees, 
National Westminster Bank plc. The aggregate total value of transactions for the year was £3,526m (2016: £3,187m) for unit trust 
creations and £2,581m (2016: £3,616m) for unit trust redemptions. The actual aggregate amount due to the trustees at the end 
of the accounting year in respect of transactions awaiting settlement was £30.2m (2016: £11.7m). The Company also acts as the 
management company for the Jupiter Global Fund and Jupiter Merlin Fund SICAVs, made up of 22 sub funds (2016: 20) and 
four sub funds (2016: four) respectively. 
The amounts received in respect of gross management and registration charges were £343.8m (2016: £295.7m) for unit trusts, 
£131.7m (2016: £91.5m) for SICAVs, £9.4m (2016: £7.8m) for investment trusts and £18.3m (2016: £15.9m) for segregated mandates. 
At the end of the year, there was £23.4m (2016: £15.0m) accrued for annual management fees and £4.1m (2016: £3.0m) in 
respect of registration fees.
Included within the financial instruments note are seed capital investments and hedges of awards in fund units in mutual funds 
managed by the Group. At 31 December 2017, the Group had a total net investment in such funds of £105.9m (2016: £65.2m) 
and received distributions of £0.5m (2016: £0.5m). During 2017, it invested £75.4m (2016: £13.3m) in these funds and made 
disposals of £42.1m (2016: £11.6m).
Key management compensation
Transactions with key management personnel also constitute related party transactions. Key management personnel are defined 
as the Executive Directors or members of the Executive Committee. The aggregate compensation paid or payable to key 
management for employee services is shown below:

In February 2017 we announced changes to our unit trust pricing to simplify our client proposition, choosing to switch from dual 
to single pricing, removing box profits from our income during 2018. Box profits in 2017 were £13.6m (2016: £12.8m). The Group is 
also taking research costs through its income statement from the start of 2018; we expect this to increase operating expenses 
by around £5m. 131

6.1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union and IFRS IC interpretations (IFRS adopted by the EU) and with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The principal accounting policies adopted are the same as those set out in 
Sections 1 – 5 of the Group’s financial statements.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis. The Company has taken advantage of the 
exemption in section 408 of the Act not to present its own income statement. The Company’s profit for the year was £72.8m 
(2016: £251.2m). 
Investments in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are held at cost less provision for impairment.
Share-based payments
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is 
treated as a capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair 
value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to the investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a 
corresponding credit to equity in the Company financial statements.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
Opinion
In our opinion, Jupiter Fund Management plc’s Group financial 
statements and Company financial statements (the “financial 
statements”):
l l give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of 
the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the 
Group’s profit and the Group’s and the Company’s cash 
flows for the year then ended;
l l have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union and, as regards the 
Company’s financial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
l l have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 (the “Annual Report”), which 
comprise: the Consolidated and Company balance sheets as 
at 31 December 2017; the Consolidated income statement and 
the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the 
year ended 31 December 2017, the Consolidated and Company 
statement of cash flows for the year ended 31 December 2017, 
and the Consolidated and Company statement of changes in 
equity for the year ended 31 December 2017; and the notes to 
the financial statements, which include a description of the 
significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit and 
Risk Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in 
the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with 
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and 
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that 
non‑ audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
were not provided to the Group or the Company.
Other than those disclosed in note 1.3 to the financial 
statements we have provided no non‑ audit services to the 
Group or the Company in the period from 1 January 2017 to 
31 December 2017.
Our audit approach

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and 
assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the Directors 
made subjective judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently 
uncertain. 
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory 
framework applicable to the Group and the industry in which it 
operates, and considered the risk of acts by the Group which 
were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including 
fraud. We designed audit procedures at Group and significant 
component level to respond to the risk, recognising that the 
risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is 
higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, 
as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, 
forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. 
We focused on laws and regulations that could give rise to a 
material misstatement in the Group and Company financial 
statements, including but not limited to, the Companies Act 
2006 and UK tax legislation. Our tests included, but were not 
limited to, review of the financial statement disclosures to 
underlying supporting documentation, enquiries of 
management and review of minutes of meetings of those 
charged with governance for the Group and significant 
components. There are inherent limitations in the audit 
procedures described above and the further removed non‑ compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and 
transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely 
we would become aware of it. 
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to 
irregularities, including fraud. As in all of our audits, we also 
addressed the risk of management override of internal 
controls, including testing journals and evaluating whether 
there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented 
a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ 
professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit 
of the financial statements of the current period and include 
the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement 
(whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, 
including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall 
audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, 
and any comments we make on the results of our procedures 
thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our 
audit. 
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Revenue recognition 
Refer to Note 1.1. Revenue and Note 5.1. Basis of preparation 
and other accounting policies. 
Revenue is the most significant balance in the Consolidated 
income statement. Revenue is made of a number of streams 
including management fees, performance fees, initial charges 
and box profit which result from the business activities of the 
Group. 
We focused on a number of aspects of revenue as follows:
Management fees 
– Management fees consist of gross management fees from 
Unit Trusts, SICAVs and Segregated Mandates/Investment 
Trusts, less rebates. 
– The calculation of Unit Trust and SICAV gross management 
fees, which make up the majority of the revenue balance, is 
calculated as a percentage of the assets under 
management (‘AUM’) of the funds managed by the Group; 
– The revenue from Segregated Mandates/Investment Trusts is 
manually calculated as a percentage, per Investment 
Management Agreements (‘IMAs’), of the segregated 
mandates/investment trust holdings; and 
– Rebates are calculated by a combination of in‑ house 
systems and external parties mandated by the Group to sell 
units/ shares of funds it manages, with the outputs of both 
processes being monitored and stored on spreadsheets 
which increases the risk of error. 
We understood and evaluated the design and implementation 
of key controls, including relevant Information Technology 
systems and controls, in place around revenue. This included 
outsourced activities at HSBC Security Services UK Limited 
(HSBC), J.P Morgan Bank Luxembourg S.A (JP Morgan), J.P 
Morgan Chase Bank N.A (JP Morgan) and DST Financial 
Services International Limited (DST).
To obtain audit evidence over the key controls at the 
outsourced providers, we assessed the control environment in 
place to the extent that it was relevant to our audit. This 
included controls supporting the calculation of revenue. This 
involved obtaining and reading the reports issued by the 
independent service auditor of the third party providers in 
accordance with generally accepted assurance standards for 
such work. We then identified those key controls on which we 
could place reliance to provide audit evidence. Where the 
controls reports we relied on were not prepared as at 
31 December 2017, we obtained a bridging letter and assessed 
the period not covered. 
We found that the key controls on which we placed reliance 
for the purposes of our audit were designed, implemented 
and operating effectively. 140

Performance fees 
Performance fees are often one‑ off or infrequent and involve 
manual and complex calculations and this increases the risk of 
error. 
Initial charges and box profits
– Initial charges vary per different client and contractual terms 
and the calculation of these fees are thus more susceptible 
to the risk of error; and 
– Box profits vary from one transaction to another and are 
quite complex due to the various different terms and pricing 
in place and as such there is an increased risk of error. 
In addition to identifying those key controls on which we 
placed reliance, the specific audit evidence over each revenue 
stream is summarised below: 
Unit Trust and SICAV gross management fees 
– We obtained AUM and management fee evidence directly 
from JP Morgan and HSBC. We recalculated and then 
reconciled management fees to amounts included in the 
Group financial statements; 
– We reconciled a sample of management fee rates to 
supporting documentation; and
– We checked that the data received from the outsourced 
provider included all Jupiter funds.
Segregated Mandates/Investment Trusts management fees
– HSBC are appointed as the administrator for Segregated 
Mandates unless the client specifies otherwise. Investment 
Trusts are administered by JP Morgan. For those in our 
testing sample not administered by HSBC or JP Morgan, we 
obtained supporting external evidence over AUM.
– We recalculated the management fee calculation for a 
sample of invoices, agreeing a sample of the key inputs 
back to the IMA and compared to amounts included in the 
Group financial statements.
Rebates 
– We used data auditing techniques on the underlying data to 
recalculate rebates. We agreed a sample of rates to 
discount forms and reconciled the amounts back to the 
Group financial statements.
Performance fees 
– For a sample of performance fees we assessed whether the 
fee had crystallised and hence had been recognised in the 
appropriate year; 
– We recalculated the performance fees for that sample to 
check that it had been calculated in accordance with the 
signed IMAs; and 
– To test for completeness we checked, for a sample of funds 
and segregated mandates, whether a performance fee had 
been earned in the year. 
Initial charges and box profits 
– We used data auditing techniques to recompute initial 
charges and box profits calculated by DST and reconciled 
the results back to the Group financial statements; and
– Agreed the rate and terms to the discount forms for a 
sample of clients paying initial charges. 
No material misstatements were identified by our testing.  141

Share based payments expense 
Refer to the Audit and Risk Committee report, Note 1.5. Share 
based payments and Note 5.1. Basis of preparation and other 
accounting policies. 
The share based payment expense is judgemental in nature, 
including management determining the fair value of the 
awards, which involves estimating performance, service 
conditions and leaver rates. We also considered the 
interpretation of complex terms in the scheme agreements, the 
number of schemes in operation, the required record keeping 
and the manual nature of the calculations. 
In testing the share based payment expense, we performed 
the following testing to address the risks identified for each 
type of share based payment transaction: 
– Obtained the Deeds of Grant for new awards in the year. 
Tested each of the new awards in the year by checking that 
they were appropriately authorised, consistent with scheme 
plans, classified correctly as equity or cash settled and used 
an appropriate share price; 
– Tested the valuations and spreading of new schemes 
granted in the year by agreeing key inputs used to source 
documentation and independently recalculating the value of 
the award using an industry accepted pricing model; 
– Obtained details of all other outstanding awards and tested 
a sample to check that the charge was spread in 
accordance with the appropriate period of the award;
– For cash settled parts of the awards, for example, national 
insurance, we tested a sample of calculated current charges 
for the year based on year‑ end share price information; 
– We assessed the reasonableness of the key assumptions, 
leaver rate and performance conditions, by examining 
historical data and performing sensitivity analyses;
– Tested a sample of options exercised during the year to 
check they were exercised in accordance with the terms of 
the grant, recorded at the correct value and appropriately 
authorised; 
– Tested the final true‑ up adjustments for all awards vesting in 
the year to check that the total expense recognised over 
the life of the award was appropriate; and
– Assessed whether disclosures required by IFRS 2 ‘Share 
based payment’ had been made and appropriately 
reflected the scheme agreements and the calculations and 
estimates made. 
No material misstatements were identified by our testing.
Impairment of goodwill 
Refer to the Audit and Risk Committee report, Note 3.1. 
Goodwill and Note 5.1. Basis of preparation and other 
accounting policies.
Goodwill is the most significant balance in the Consolidated 
balance sheet.
Management are required by IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’ to 
perform an annual impairment review and consider if there 
are any impairment indicators in respect of the carrying value 
of goodwill.
The carrying value of the cash generating unit containing the 
goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the 
higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. 
The Group is made of one operating segment, investment 
management. As such the Group is one cash generating unit. 
Management have modelled the fair value less costs to sell 
approach under IAS 36 by using a discounted cash flow 
model. As they have not identified any impairment they have 
not considered value in use.
The impairment review requires a number of significant 
estimates to be made by management such as forecasts and 
discount rates.
We obtained management’s impairment review and checked 
that it was in compliance with the requirements of IAS 36 and 
performed the following: 
– We evaluated management’s models checking the relevant 
inputs to supporting documentation, this included challenging 
management on key assumptions within the calculations. In 
particular we compared the cash flow forecasts to the 3 
year Board approved budget; 
– We evaluated the sensitivity analysis performed and 
discussed with management the likelihood and impacts of 
such changes; 
– We determined that there was reasonable headroom in 
management’s fair value less costs to sell calculations; and 
– We also read and assessed the disclosures made in the 
financial statements. 
No material misstatements were identified by our testing.  142

Current and deferred taxes
Refer to Note 1.10. Income tax expense, Note 3.5. Deferred tax 
and Note 5.1. Basis of preparation and other accounting 
policies.
The calculation of the current and deferred tax is produced 
manually and is based on a number of supporting complex 
calculations including share based payments, deferred bonuses 
and the spreading of initial charges.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of 
the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date in the countries where the Group operates and 
generates taxable items. Management periodically evaluates 
positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which 
applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. 
Management establish provisions where appropriate on the 
basis of amounts expected to be paid to tax authorities. 
Deferred income tax is recognised on temporary differences 
arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the financial statements. 
In assessing current and deferred income tax, we: 
– Assessed whether management had reflected appropriately 
the changes in UK corporation tax in their current and 
deferred income tax calculations; 
– Obtained and read tax working papers for the Group and 
significant components and obtained supporting evidence; 
– Obtained the deferred tax calculations and assessed the 
recoverability of the deferred tax assets. We evaluated 
whether the temporary difference will reverse in the future 
and whether there is sufficient taxable profit available 
against which the temporary difference can be utilised; and 
– Assessed the tax disclosures included within the financial 
statements. 
We also evaluated whether the Group had met its compliance 
obligations for the material territories in which the Group 
operates, and as such we: 
– Assessed the conclusions reached by management in 
relation to the current transfer pricing arrangements, 
changes to the Group structure and controlled foreign 
companies’ position. 
No material misstatements were identified by our testing.
We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the Company to communicate in our report. 143

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we 
performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the 
financial statements as a whole, taking into account the 
structure of the Group and the Company, the accounting 
processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.
The Group is structured along a single business line being 
investment management. The Group is composed of the 
Company, incorporated in the United Kingdom, and subsidiary 
entities in the United Kingdom and abroad, and certain 
consolidated Jupiter funds. The Group is operated centrally 
from the UK. 
We conducted an audit of the complete financial information 
of Jupiter Asset Management Limited and Jupiter Unit Trust 
Limited because they are considered financially significant 
components, each representing more than 15% of the profit 
before tax of the Group. We also performed audit procedures 
on the Group consolidation adjustments component and the 
financial statement disclosures. Taken together, our audit work 
accounted for more than 95% of Group revenue and Group 
profit before tax. The Company financial statements were also 
in scope for our audit. 
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of 
materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for 
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, 
helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, 
timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual 
financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating 
the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate 
on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined 
materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Company financial statements
Overall materiality £9.6m (2016: £8.6m). £2.1m (2016: £1.8m).
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax. 1% of total assets.
Rationale for benchmark 
applied
We believe that profit before tax is the primary 
measure used by the shareholders in assessing the 
performance of the Group, and is a generally 
accepted auditing benchmark.
The Company’s main activity is the holding 
of investments in subsidiaries. Given this, 
consistent with the prior year, we set an 
overall Company materiality level based on 
total assets.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we 
allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group 
materiality. The range of materiality allocated across 
components was £2.9m‑ £9.5m. Certain components were 
audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less 
than our overall Group materiality.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:.
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add 
or draw attention to in respect of the Directors’ statement in 
the financial statements about whether the Directors 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the financial statements and the 
Directors’ identification of any material uncertainties to the 
Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern over a period of at least twelve months from the date 
of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the Directors’ statement relating 
to Going Concern in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the 
audit.
We have nothing to report.
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would 
report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 
£0.5m (Group audit) (2016: £0.4m) and £0.1m (Company audit) 
(2016: £0.1m) as well as misstatements below those amounts 
that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. 144

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS  
OF JUPITER FUND MANAGEMENT PLC
REPORTING ON OTHER INFORMATION 
The other information comprises all of the information in the 
Annual Report other than the financial statements and our 
auditors’ report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the 
other information. Our opinion on the financial statements 
does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do 
not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or 
material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures 
to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the 
financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We have 
nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we 
also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK 
Companies Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work 
undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 
2006, (CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain 
opinions and matters as described below (required by ISAs 
(UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of 
the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 is 
consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared 
in accordance with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and 
Company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the 
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group 
and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency 
or liquidity of the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to 
regarding:
l l The Directors’ confirmation on page 96 of the Annual 
Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity.
l l The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those 
risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
l l The Directors’ explanation on page 30 of the Annual Report 
as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, 
over what period they have done so and why they consider 
that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the 
Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and 
statement in relation to the longer‑ term viability of the Group. 
Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and 
only consisted of making inquiries and considering the 
Directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that 
the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”); and 
considering whether the statements are consistent with the 
knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company 
and their environment obtained in the course of the audit. 
(Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to 
report when: 
l l The statement given by the Directors, on page 96, that they 
consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, 
balanced and understandable, and provides the information 
necessary for the members to assess the Group’s and 
Company’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the 
Group and Company obtained in the course of performing 
our audit.
l l The section of the Annual Report on pages 52‑ 58 describing 
the work of the Audit & Risk Committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the 
Audit & Risk Committee.
l l The Directors’ statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a 
departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified, 
under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006. (CA06) 145

STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 96, the Directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in 
accordance with the applicable framework and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The Directors are 
also responsible for such internal control as they determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are 
responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial 
statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms 
part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for 
no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept 
or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it 
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent 
in writing.
OTHER REQUIRED REPORTING
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
l l we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit; or
l l adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
l l certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or
l l the Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this 
responsibility. 
Appointment
We were appointed by the Directors to audit the financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 and 
subsequent financial periods. Following a competitive tender 
process in 2014, we were reappointed as auditor of the 
Company by recommendation of the Audit and Risk 
Committee for the year ended 31 December 2015 and 
subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted 
engagement is 11 years, covering the years ended 
31 December 2007 to 31 December 2017.
