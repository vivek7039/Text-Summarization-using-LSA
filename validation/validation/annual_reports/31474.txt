Overview
Financial and operational highlights Financial performance showed progress with 
a return to organic growth. 2018 will continue 
to reflect the focus on strategic delivery underpinned 
by a focus on safety performance.
Andrew Shilston
Chairman
2017 was the second year of the three-year plan 
to reinvigorate the Company through investment 
in products, people and better operational 
processes. It was pleasing to see that financial 
performance showed some modest progress, 
particularly as the global economy started to 
show some signs of growth in the latter part of 
the year. On an organic constant-currency basis*, 
revenues increased by 1.4%, and the balance 
sheet was stronger at the end of the year due to 
better operational management and disposals 
with net debt* reducing to £181.3 million from 
£242.5 million in 2016. Despite disposals of 
mature assets with good margins the operating 
profit margin was stable with the negative effects 
of those disposals offset by operating efficiencies 
and higher revenues. The proposed dividend is 
unchanged at 1 1.0p per share.
The next year will see further progress in the 
important areas of achieving greater effectiveness 
in winning new business through training and 
key new hires, improving Leadership behaviours, 
and making the support functions as efficient 
as possible. Together with the reinvestment 
in our Centres of Excellence the Board believes 
the Group has the capability to generate organic 
growth in the future by concentrating on areas 
of the markets with needs particularly attuned 
to our capabilities.
In addition to growing the business, the right 
behaviours must be observed and all employees 
should be sure of operating in a safe environment. 
It was very disappointing to see a road accident 
in the USA which injured 19 of our employees, 
some of them seriously. Aside from this the 
accident rates in some of our other businesses 
did not improve. Performance objectives of 
top management continue to place emphasis 
on causing positive change in this area.
There has been a further change in the Board 
during the year with Rob Rowley stepping down 
as Non-executive Director and Chairman of 
the Audit Committee. I am very grateful for Rob’s 
interest in, and support for the Company during 
his tenure. I therefore welcome Jane Aikman to 
the Board as a Non-executive Director and 
Chairman of the Audit Committee. Jane is a 
highly experienced plc Finance Director from 
various businesses, and was Chairman of the 
Audit Committee of Halma plc from 2009 to 
2016.
Andrew Shilston
Chairman
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
  Annual Report 2017 Morgan Advanced Materials 09
Chairman’s statement We continue to make good progress with the 
implementation of our strategy and we have 
delivered a good set of results, growing the 
business organically and driving efficiencies to 
fund £8.5 million of incremental investment in 
R&D, sales and wider business infrastructure.
Safe and ethical working is the top priority for 
the Group. 2017 was a disappointing year from 
a safety perspective. Our lost time accident rate 
(accidents per 100,000 hours worked) increased 
from 0.27 to 0.39 in the year. In part this was 
the result of a serious road traffic accident in the 
USA when a minibus carrying members of our 
Thermal Products operations team to our plant 
was hit by another vehicle. Nineteen employees 
were injured in this incident. However, we have 
also seen increased accident rates in several 
businesses beyond this one serious accident, 
and we have further work to do to improve. 
Our ‘thinkSAFE’ programme, launched in 2015, 
is the vehicle for us to do this and we will be 
increasing the breadth and intensity of activity 
on safety further in 2018. 
We are now two years into the initial three-year 
implementation phase of our strategy. We laid 
out six execution priorities for the first three 
years and I am pleased with the progress we 
have made against those during the year. It will 
take several years to see the full benefits from 
the changes and investments that we are making, 
but we have made a good start and are starting 
to see some early successes across the business. 
The foundation for this has been our operational 
improvements. These accelerated during the 
year, and consequently we have been able to 
invest more in the business during the year in 
technology development, sales and increasing 
functional capability and depth.
 > The net debt* to EBITDA* ratio at the 
year-end improved to 1.2x (2016: 1.6x), 
following the disposal of two businesses. 
The Group remains well within its banking 
covenants and has good headroom and 
balance sheet capacity for appropriate 
future investment. 
 > On a statutory reporting basis operating 
profit improved to £158.1 million 
(2016: £107.3 million) and profit before tax 
improved to £135.8 million (2016: £87.9 
million), both of these benefited from 
year-on-year movements in exchange rates 
and specific adjusting items of £45.7 million 
(2016: £(1.7) million charge, 2015: £(16.0) 
million charge). See pages 30 to 39 for 
further details.
Group strategy
Our long-term strategy is to build a Group 
with distinctive capabilities and performance 
in three areas:
 > materials science capability and technology.
 > application engineering capability.
 > customer and end-market focus.
We have strengths in these areas today, and 
developing these capabilities further will be our 
focus in the coming years. Through the application 
of our core skills in these areas we will add value 
as a Group. 
We will apply these skills in markets that are 
growing and where we can operate at scale, 
on a global basis. We will apply these skills to 
solve difficult materials-based problems for our 
customers, ethically and safely and where they 
value our differentiated solutions. This set of 
capabilities provides a resilient and distinctive 
source of differentiation and is an enduring 
strategic goal for the Group.
2018 is the final year of our initial 
implementation phase and we will 
be investing a further £8 million in our 
capabilities, largely in technology and 
sales, funded through further operational 
improvements. These are important 
investments to build the long-term health 
of the Group and will position us for more 
resilient financial performance and faster growth 
in the years to come. 
Group results 
The trading conditions were difficult coming into 
the year with improvements evident in sentiment, 
but limited progress in our markets. Conditions 
have improved through the year with improved 
order momentum in the major industrial 
geographies from the second quarter onwards. 
With the better market conditions, and the 
impact of strategic and structural changes, 
the Group has performed well:
 > Group revenue for 2017 was £1,021.5 
million, 3.3% above 2016 at reported 
exchange rates. On an organic constant 
currency basis * Group revenue was 
higher by 1.4%. 
 > The 2017 Group headline operating profit* 
margin was 1 1.7% (2016: 1 1.8%) with the 
impacts of divestments largely offset by 
operational efficiencies and the benefit 
of higher revenue.
 > Group headline earnings per share* 
was 22.5 pence (2016: 22.7 pence).
 > Capital expenditure was £34.4 million 
(2016: £39.5 million). The Group has 
continued its investment in additional capability 
and capacity to support future growth. 
 > Operating cash generation* was good, with 
a cash flow from operations of £129.5 million, 
excluding the one-off payment to the US 
pensions scheme, (2016: £128.3 million). 
Net debt* at the year end was £181.3 million 
(2016: £242.5 million). 
Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2017 10
Chief Executive Officer’s review
Strategic Report To reach this goal we need to develop our 
capabilities further and address performance 
gaps in the business. In February 2016 we set six 
execution priorities that we are pursuing through 
to the end of 2018 to strengthen the Group and 
deliver resilient financial performance and 
faster growth:
1. Move to a global business structure.
We completed the move to a global business 
structure in March 2016. The change in structure 
has improved global co-ordination across the 
Group and has sharpened accountability within 
each of our global business units. This is an 
important change to enable the wider changes 
we need to make and we completed this without 
any loss of business momentum.
2. Improve technical leadership. 
Our objective is to strengthen our technical 
teams and increase our investment in research 
and development to around 4% of sales (from 
2.8% of sales in 2015) over the next two to 
three years. 
We have increased our investment in technology 
development by £5.1 million in 2017, to £34.3 
million, representing 3.4% of sales. We have 
expanded the technical teams in our new Carbon 
Science Centre of Excellence and in our new 
Metals and Joining Centre of Excellence. Further 
recruitment is underway in both places to expand 
the teams during 2018. We have also added 
technical resources to our Structural Ceramics 
Centre of Excellence to develop new products 
and processes for the structural ceramics 
business. It typically takes a number of years for 
these new developments to come to market, 
but in the case of our Metals and Joining Centre 
of Excellence, we have been able to accelerate 
new development of a new cored-wire alloy 
and product samples were in trials with customers 
by the end of the year. These are vital investments 
to enhance the future differentiation and growth 
of the business and we are planning to invest 
a further £5 million in technical resources and 
technology development in our Centres of 
Excellence and across the business in 2018.
3. Improve operational execution. 
Our objective is to strengthen our operational 
capabilities, reduce operational costs to fund 
reinvestment in the business, and improve 
delivery and quality performance.
We made very good progress with our 
operational improvements in 2017 with a 
net £8.5 million of savings generated to fund 
reinvestment in the business in the year (against 
our target of £6 million). These were generated 
from a wide range of improvement projects 
in every business including larger lean projects 
looking at end-to-end waste elimination, 
smaller scale continuous improvement projects, 
procurement projects and further use of 
automation. We made a number of changes 
to strengthen our operational teams and 
continuous improvement capabilities during 
the year and we are well positioned to deliver 
the further £8 million improvements we are 
targeting in 2018. 
4. Drive sales effectiveness and 
market focus. 
Our objective is to strengthen our sales capability, 
and increase the intensity of effort with new 
customers and in new markets.
We carried out five pilot projects to test 
new techniques and tools and to build our 
understanding of the best approaches for us to 
use across the Group. In our Thermal business 
in China, and in Electrical Carbon in North 
America, we assessed the segmentation of 
our customers and alignment of sales resources 
to customers, the sales process and the sales 
management tools we should use. In our 
Thermal automotive business we developed a 
new strategy for the market using new market 
assessment tools and set new product and 
market priorities and targets. In our Thermal 
business in Europe we deployed new 
segmentation and pricing tools and developed 
a standard set of approaches for use across 
the Group. Finally, in our European Seals and 
Bearings business we developed a new sales 
structure with revised key account management 
and sales responsibilities to shift the way that 
business goes to market. 
Through these pilots we delivered significant 
improvements in local capabilities and 
approaches, and we also developed our 
understanding of the tools and techniques 
we should apply across the Group. We will 
continue with that deployment during 2018. 
We also completed the design of our framework 
for sales incentive plans and prepared for the 
deployment of new sales incentives to four 
different sales teams in the first quarter of 2018.
We will test these new approaches and make 
adjustments before deploying across the key 
sales teams during 2018 and early 2019. 
5. Increase investment in people 
management and development. 
We are aiming to strengthen our leadership 
capability and deepen functional capabilities across 
the business, including in sales and engineering.
We launched our new Leadership behaviours 
to our senior leaders during the year. These are 
now built into our performance management 
process and during 2018, our leaders will be 
measured both on what they achieve and how 
they achieve it to ensure we drive the behaviours 
we need to support the delivery of our strategy. 
In addition to the work on sales incentives, we 
have also made a range of changes to incentive 
schemes for the wider leadership population 
to provide a clearer line of sight from the 
performance of the individual and the impact 
on their compensation. As part of this we have 
introduced greater balance between short-term 
(in-year) and long-term (multi-year) incentives. 
Finally, we have strengthened our leadership 
population, in particular with the introduction 
of more capability in finance, HR, operations 
and EHS functions.
6. Simplify the business.
We have completed two divestments which 
have materially simplified the Electrical Carbon 
and Technical Ceramics global business units. 
Through these divestments we have exited 
businesses where we were sub-scale and where 
there was limited synergy with the remainder of 
the Group. We have sharpened the focus on the 
core business and reduced overhead costs. 
We received proceeds of £79.5 million from the 
sales and have used that to reduce our net debt* 
position, creating funds for reinvestment in the 
business in due course. 
Looking forward
As we enter 2018, global markets are generally in 
good health with positive sentiment and growth 
expected in most large industrial geographies. 
We expect the business to grow at closer to our 
market growth rates in 2018. During 2018, we 
will be investing further in the long-term health of 
the business, and we will be investing selectively 
in capacity to support growth where we are 
capacity constrained and can see attractive 
opportunities to invest. 
Finally, I would like to thank our employees 
for their hard work and support during 2017.

Generating, capturing and sustaining value
Our business model is fundamental to our ability to create 
value and build a sustainable competitive advantage.
As the world strives to make better use of limited resources, the 
demands on our materials, and on our materials science capabilities, 
are rapidly increasing. We are producing materials that can work at 
higher temperatures, higher pressures, in more corrosive and abrasive 
applications, at more precise tolerances and in smaller form factors 
than ever before.
We use two fundamental sets of materials: Ceramics and Carbon.
How we differentiate ourselves
Ceramics 
Ceramics typically have high melting 
points and are used to make high 
performance insulation, they are 
also chemically resistant at high 
temperatures and are used to make 
valves for corrosive and abrasive 
applications. We work with both 
ceramic fibre and structural ceramics, 
exploiting the structural properties of 
ceramics, their hardness, their electrical 
properties and their resilience in hostile 
environments.
We manufacture and install a wide 
range of thermal insulation products 
that significantly reduce energy 
consumption and emissions in a 
variety of high temperature processing 
applications. Structural ceramics are 
used for implanted medical devices 
exploiting their strength, abrasion 
resistance and chemical stability, 
to make power tubes for medical 
scanners, and in the manufacture 
of semiconductors.
Carbon 
We use carbon for its electrical 
conductivity, with leading carbon grades 
for power generation, rail collector 
and wind applications. We use the inert 
and low friction properties of carbon 
to make seals and bearings used in jet 
engine seals to automotive vacuum 
pumps. We exploit the high temperature 
stability in inert atmospheres of carbon 
to produce insulation for vacuum furnaces, 
semiconductor applications and crucibles.
Further information on our technology 
can be found in ‘Our strategy in action’ 
on pages 17 to 25. To support the Group’s 
strategy and to monitor 
performance, the Board of 
Directors and the Executive 
Committee use a number of 
financial and non-financial key 
performance indicators (KPIs).
These KPIs are selected measures which are 
important to the Group. Progress is assessed 
by comparison with the Group’s strategy, its 
budget for the year and historical performance. 
Divisional and business management use a range 
of further benchmarks and other KPIs as part 
of their planning and performance review 
processes. In order to measure the organic 
performance of the business, management 
further analyse the headline KPIs to exclude 
the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange.
The KPIs are selected and reviewed to ensure 
they remain important to the success of the 
Group. Financial and non-financial performance 
is reviewed in more detail in the Corporate 
responsibility, Review of operations and 
Group financial review sections of this Report.

Our strategy in action Improve technical  
leadership
Research and development (R&D) investment 
has been increased to build Morgan’s technical 
lead and to accelerate new product development. 
The Centres of Excellence concentrate our 
development efforts in those areas that can 
deliver the greatest benefit globally to the Group.
Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2017 18
Strategic Report
Our strategy in action continued  4. The depth and the breadth of our 
understanding will be built through 
a community whose culture is 
collaborative and which develops 
deep institutional knowledge.
The Group’s commitment to technology is 
demonstrated by the Group’s total R&D spend 
in 2017 of £34.3 million (2016: £29.2 million), 
equal to 3.4% of sales (2016: 3.0%). The 
Group anticipates increasing its investment to 
around 4% of sales over the next two to three 
years (from a 2015 actuals baseline of 2.8%). 
The Group’s R&D strategy is governed 
by four key underlying principles: 
1. To be the acknowledged leader 
in materials science for our chosen 
technology families. 
2. To understand the application of our 
materials science in our customers’ 
products and processes, providing 
maximum benefit to them through 
advanced application engineering.
3. To demonstrate a clear understanding 
of where our technology competences 
are positioned today against 
competitors and emerging and 
competing technologies, forming a 
clear view of where we need to be.
Centres of Excellence
A key underpinning principle of Morgan’s 
R&D strategy is in the investment in four 
global materials Centres of Excellence (CoE): 
Insulating Fibre, Structural Ceramics, Carbon 
Science, Metals and Joining.
These four CoEs consolidate the Group’s 
R&D efforts around its core technologies, 
and provide the opportunity to create critical 
mass to increase the effectiveness of our 
R&D spend and accelerate key projects.
The CoEs focus on the strategic priorities of 
the global business units and the Group to 
help maintain Morgan’s world-leading position 
in its chosen technology areas. The global 
business units ensure the CoEs prioritise 
their efforts, and retain a strong commercial 
direction. This in turn enhances the R&D 
capability of the business by delivering 
core materials science platforms that the 
manufacturing sites transform into products.
The Insulating Fibre CoE in Bromborough, 
UK, is a state-of-the-art facility employing 25 
dedicated scientists focused on the continued 
development of Morgan’s fibre product range. 
Morgan’s market-leading low bio-persistent 
Superwool
®
 fibre technology and product 
range continue to be developed with 
patented materials science. Morgan is now 
extending the operational temperature range, 
allowing it to provide customers with superior 
insulation performance, improved fire 
protection and weight-saving opportunities in 
more applications.
There has been particular success across a 
range of end-markets such as iron and steel, 
aluminium processing, automotive and passive 
fire protection, where new products have 
been successfully launched in 2017.
The Structural Ceramics CoE in Stourport, 
UK, oversees the major advanced ceramic 
science developments for the Group. The 
facility concentrates on leading-edge ceramic 
materials developments to support both 
current and new markets. Initial focus 
has been on opportunities in the medical, 
aerospace and environmental sectors, 
whilst a focus on new emerging markets 
and technologies also ensures that the 
Group stays at the forefront of materials 
science. As part of this focus the CoE includes 
the R&D programme for Morgan’s additive 
manufacturing of ceramic materials. 
The Carbon Science CoE will support the 
Electrical Carbon and Seals and Bearings 
businesses and is located in the Innovation 
Park at Penn State University, Pennsylvania, 
USA, close to the university’s top talent and 
facilities. The partnership with Penn State will 
combine resources and experience, creating 
a synergy which will enable significant progress 
in the development of carbon materials for a 
range of sectors and applications.
Pennsylvania was seen as the ideal location 
for the new CoE due to Penn State’s 
cutting-edge academic research and proximity 
to a number of Morgan’s key manufacturing 
sites. The team has been established and 
the Centre will open formally in 2018.
The Metals and Joining CoE is located in 
Hayward, California, USA. The CoE supports 
the Technical Ceramics businesses which are 
involved in providing metallic joining solutions 
and joining ceramic and metal to metals to 
form hermetic seals. Hayward is Morgan’s 
largest facility utilising this technology and 
hence this CoE will benefit from close 
proximity to the business, production 
processes and customers. The CoE has 
already produced new patented technology 
that has led to new products starting trials 
with customers.
Morgan’s Technical Advisory Board
One of the key objectives of our R&D 
strategy is to establish a network of global 
technology partners to ensure we are 
positioned to work with the world’s best 
academics and research institutes, who 
are at the forefront of materials science. 
Morgan has established a Technology 
Advisory Board, drawn from experts based 
in Asia, Europe, North and South America. 
These experts are at the forefront of their 
academic fields in technical ceramics, carbon 
science, insulating ceramics, glass ceramics 
and composites. 
Their combined knowledge gives us the 
opportunity to accelerate key elements 
of our R&D programmes whilst assessing 
new horizon and emerging technologies.

Improve  
operational 
execution
There are a number of opportunities across the 
global business units to improve operational 
execution. Resource and capital are allocated to 
target specific improvements to efficiency and 
effectiveness on a business-by-business basis. Morgan’s operational 
efficiency focuses on:
 > global sourcing – moving from local 
to regional or global sourcing for its 
raw materials
 > lean manufacturing transformation – 
identification and elimination of waste 
within the production processes and 
the acceleration of continuous 
improvement projects
 > manufacturing strategy – improving 
global capacity management and 
planning
 > benchmarking – sharing best practice 
across divisions and global businesses 
to achieve and monitor cost savings
Procurement efficiency
In 2017 we made significant improvements 
in packaging in our Thermal Ceramics 
business. We spend around £10 million 
per year on cardboard packaging of varying 
specification and size and the Thermal 
procurement team identified this as a priority 
area for improvement. 
Through their work, they identified a range 
of changes we could make to reduce costs. 
For example, in the North American business 
we were paying twice the price for the same 
cardboard box compared to other sites.
In some sites our boxes are over specified 
in terms of thickness, material content and 
printing. Moving to a range of standard 
solutions can reduce costs considerably. 
We have also identified products where we 
don’t even need to use cardboard packaging – 
there are alternatives which are just as effective, 
lower cost and produce less waste. 
Our larger lean activities are progressing 
well. For example, in our Thermal plant in 
Augusta, USA, the lean project started with 
a focus on material storage and flow. The 
team looked at blanket warehouse utilisation 
for the site. Blanket is a lightweight-fibre-
insulation-material and as such we require 
high volume storage to hold finished goods. 
The team have redesigned the racking 
system and material and process flow and 
have eliminated the need for an offsite 
warehouse, and all the associated material 
movements and costs.

Our strategy in action continued Sales force effectiveness pilots
In our Thermal business in China, 80% 
of the revenue is derived from 15% of 
the customers. However, we were not 
necessarily focusing our time only on the 
more important customers. Our pilot 
focussed on growing existing customers 
through segmentation, determining service 
levels for each segment, and aligning our 
resources accordingly. 
Our work has provided a clear view on 
how we need to segment our customers 
and the importance of getting the right route 
to market for low volume customers. The 
China organisation has therefore made a 
transition to a model with sales, key account 
management, regional sales and new 
business development. 
The pilot also reinforced our understanding 
of our position in the market. In interviews 
customers were positive about Morgan’s 
products and service, but indicated that roles 
and responsibilities are not always clear in 
our teams. They also identified areas where 
we should be providing higher 
performance products.
Four further pilot projects were completed 
in 2017: two in our Thermal business, 
and one each in Seals and Bearings and 
Electrical Carbon. 
These looked in depth at customer 
segmentation, pricing, value selling and our 
wider sales process. Our goal is to improve 
those specific areas and build new capabilities 
for our business that we can roll out 
more broadly. 
The sales effectiveness programme 
was launched as one of our strategic 
execution priorities focused on sales 
processes, structure and efficiency; 
key account management; channel 
management; end market understanding 
and market hotspots; and conducting 
pilot improvement projects across our 
global business units. Through these pilot 
projects, we have segmented our 
customer base and aligned our resources 
to our customers. We tested tools for 
pricing and sales management and we 
designed new sales incentive plans which 
we are trialling now. We still have much 
to do, but we have a good foundation 
to build upon.

units (GBUs) and Divisions, and are quantified 
by assessing their inherent impact and mitigated 
probability to ensure that residual risk exposures 
are understood and prioritised for control 
throughout the Group.
Senior executives are responsible for the 
strategic management of the Group’s principal 
risks, including related policy, guidelines and 
process, subject to Board oversight. 
Throughout 2017, the Board reviewed the status 
of all principal risks with a significant potential 
impact at Group level. Additionally, the Audit 
Committee carried out focused risk reviews 
of each Division/GBU. These reviews included 
an analysis of both the principal risks, and the 
controls, monitoring and assurance processes 
established to mitigate those risks to acceptable 
levels. As a result of these reviews, a number 
of actions were identified to continue to improve 
internal controls and the management of risk. 
High-level guidance on the Board’s appetite 
for different risks is included again this year. 
The Group is willing to take considered risks 
to develop new technologies, applications, 
partnerships and markets for its products, and 
to meet customer needs. The Group strives 
to eliminate risks to product quality and health 
and safety, which are essential to the success 
of our products and the safety of our people 
and contractors.
The appetite for risk in the areas of legal and 
regulatory compliance is extremely low and 
the Group expects its businesses to comply 
with all laws and regulations in the countries 
where they operate. The Group has a low 
appetite for financial risk. Certain risks, such 
as pension funding, are likely to take a longer 
period to be mitigated. 
As in 2016, an indication of the Board’s 
assessment of the trend of each risk – i.e. 
whether the potential impact has increased, 
decreased or is broadly unchanged over the past 
year – is included. The Board has also identified 
new risks to the delivery of the Group’s strategy 
and these are indicated in the table below.
The following are the Group’s principal risks 
and uncertainties, representing those risks 
that the Board feels could have the most 
significant impact on achieving the Group’s 
strategy of building a sustainable business for 
the long term and delivering strong returns 
to the Group’s shareholders. 
Strategic and external risks
Risk description, assessment and trend from 2016 Mitigation
1.  Technical leadership 
The Group’s strategic success depends on maintaining and developing 
its technical leadership in materials science over its competitors.
Unforeseen/unmitigated technology obsolescence, the emergence of 
competing technologies, the loss of control of proprietary technology 
or the loss of intellectual property/know-how would impact the 
Group’s business and its ability to deliver on its strategic goals.
The advanced technological nature of the Group requires people with 
highly differentiated skillsets. Any inability to recruit, retain and develop 
the right people would negatively impact the Group’s ability to achieve 
its strategic goals.
Trend 
Unchanged 
The Group has a Chief Technology Officer and a dedicated 
technology team which monitors relevant technology and business 
developments globally using technology roadmaps linked to 20 major 
technology families to ensure it remains at the leading edge of 
development. Two global Centres of Excellence were previously 
established, with a further Centre opening in Hayward California, 
USA in 2017. A fourth Centre is being established at Penn State 
University, Pennsylvania, USA, which will formally open in 2018. 
These Centres focus Morgan’s expertise and research resources on 
core technologies. They are supported by a Technical Advisory Board 
comprising some of the world’s leading academics in relevant fields, 
who provide ongoing insight, advice and challenge to inform the 
Group’s technology plans. 
The technology team proactively manages the Group’s technology 
pipeline and R&D investment in existing technologies, as well as 
actively managing the technology lifecycle. The technology pipeline 
and key R&D projects are regularly reviewed by the Executive 
Committee and the Board.
Where Group products are designed for a specific customer, they 
are developed in partnership with the customer in order to maintain 
leading-edge differentiation. The Group seeks to secure intellectual 
property protection, where appropriate, for its existing and emerging 
portfolio of products; external advisers manage this protection globally.
The Group continued its Global Leadership Programme in conjunction 
with Cranfield University, adding an advanced programme to develop 
more high-potential commercial, functional and technical leaders. 
The Graduate Leadership Programme continued to run in 2017.

2.  Operational execution / organisational change / 
sales effectiveness 
As part of the Group’s strategy to improve the efficiency of its operations 
and organisation, various changes have been made to operational 
processes at individual sites, to the Group’s structure, and the structure 
of and incentives for our sales force. Further improvements and changes 
are planned for future years. Failure to adequately manage these changes 
could result in interruption to operations or customer service, or a failure 
to maximise the Group’s opportunities.
Trend 
New risk, no change  
Changes to operational processes are carefully considered by site, 
GBU and Divisional management before implementation. Personnel 
improvements have been made within the businesses to oversee 
operational changes, for example with a new VP of Operational 
Excellence joining the Technical Ceramics GBU in 2017.
Operational improvements and savings are monitored against budget 
by the Executive Committee to ensure that changes deliver the savings 
promised without disruption to business operations. Organisational 
changes are assessed by the CEO, the Executive Committee and 
sometimes the Board before being implemented in line with local 
employment regulations. Changes to our sales structures and 
incentives are reviewed at various levels of the organisation, before 
being launched. 
3. Portfolio management
The Group operates across a range of product and technology 
families. These are subject to long-term market trends which may lead 
to either obsolescence or opportunities to further expand the Group. 
Failure to proactively manage the Group’s portfolio of businesses in 
line with this technology profile may lead to the value of the Group’s 
businesses being eroded over time or a failure to exploit opportunities 
to acquire businesses with the capability to add further value to the 
Group.
Trend 
New risk, no change  
The Board performs regular reviews of the Group’s portfolio and has 
disposed of non-core businesses in 2017. 
4.  Macro-economic and political environment
The Group operates in a range of markets and geographies around the 
world and could be affected by political, economic, social or regulatory 
developments or instability, for example an economic slowdown or 
issues stemming from oil and natural resources price shocks. 
The UK’s exit from the EU may have an impact on the Group if 
subsequent tariff changes, or border effects, negatively impact the 
profitability of the Group’s products. The current value of Group 
UK exports to the EU is approximately £30 million, and imports 
into the UK from the EU are approximately £15 million.
Trend 
Decreased  
The Group’s broad market and geographic spread helps to mitigate 
the effects of political and economic changes.
Budgets and forecasts for Morgan’s different businesses are used to 
monitor delivery against expectations and anticipate potential external 
risks to performance. These are subject to regular review by the 
Executive Committee and Board. 
The overall macroeconomic environment has improved during 
the course of the year and the Group has delivered organic growth.
The impact of the UK’s exit from the EU could be mitigated by moving 
production to alternative sites where tariffs are not applied to products.
Operational risks
5.  Environment, health and safety (EHS) 
The Group operates a number of manufacturing facilities around the 
world. A failure in the Group’s EHS procedures could lead to 
environmental damage or to injury or death of employees or third 
parties, with a consequential impact on operations and increased risk 
of regulatory or legal action being taken against the Group. Any such 
action could result in both financial damages and damage to reputation. 
Trend 
Unchanged  
Managing its operations safely is the Group’s number one priority. The 
Group has a comprehensive EHS programme managed by the Director 
EHS, with clear EHS standards and a programme of independent audits 
to assess compliance.
The Director EHS sets annual priorities for EHS which are approved by 
the Executive Committee. These form the basis for individual sites’ own 
EHS priorities and plans, and complement the Group’s ‘thinkSAFE’ 
behavioural safety programme. 
EHS performance is monitored by the Executive Committee and the 
Board.
As at 31 December 2017 the Group was managing projects to remediate 
legacy contamination at three former sites and one operational site in 
conjunction with external specialists and relevant authorities. The 
anticipated costs of these projects are provided for in the financial 
statements.
Further detail of the EHS programme can be found on pages 46 to 51.

6.  Product quality, safety and liability 
Products used in applications for which they were not intended 
or inadequate quality control/over-commitment on customer 
specifications could result in products not meeting customer 
requirements, which could in turn lead to significant liabilities 
and reputational damage.
Some of our products are used in potentially higher risk applications 
such as in the aerospace, automotive, medical and power industries.
Trend 
Unchanged  
Many of the Group’s products are designed to customer specifications. 
Our businesses’ quality management systems and training help ensure 
that all of Morgan’s products meet or exceed customer requirements 
and national/international standards. 
The Group Legal Policy requires that contracts relating to products 
used in potential high-risk applications are subject to legal review to 
ensure that appropriate protections are in place for product 
quality risks.
The Group insurance programme includes product liability insurance; 
this Group-level insurance is reviewed annually by the Board.
7 .  IT and cyber security
Information security/cyber risks are dynamic and ever-present in 
the external environment. If the Group were to lose critical data or 
information, including proprietary technology information, through 
inadequate data management or compromised information security, 
the business would be impacted and could suffer reputational damage.
The effective management of the Group’s IT infrastructure is 
important in enabling our businesses to reliably deliver customer 
requirements. If a key business system were to fail or core systems 
implementation were ineffective, the ability of the business to deliver 
on its strategic goals might be impacted.
Trend 
Unchanged  
The Group has an Information Technology (IT) Policy and guidelines 
in place as well as Group and business IT teams to manage the Group’s 
infrastructure, IT systems and information security risks. A new IT 
Security Policy was launched in 2017 to further enhance security.
In 2018 the Group is required to comply with the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework in the USA 
and the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations. Programmes to 
deliver compliance with these requirements are well advanced.
The Group continues to deploy and upgrade enhanced enterprise 
resource planning (ERP) systems in those businesses where a need 
for improvement is identified. These deployments are managed in 
line with IT project management standards.
8.  Supply chain / business continuity
The Group has a number of potential single-point exposure risks, 
which include:
 > Single-point supplier – a significant interruption of a key internal or 
external supply could impact business continuity.
 > Single-point customer – the unmitigated loss of a major customer could 
have an impact on Group profit. The Group’s largest customer 
represents circa 2% of Group revenue.
 > Single-point site – a key site exposed to a strike, a natural catastrophe or 
serious incident, such as fire, could impact business continuity. One 
Group site, Hayward, is situated in the California earthquake zone, (USA).
Trend 
Unchanged  
The Group has a diversified manufacturing, customer and geographic base 
which provides a level of resilience against single-point exposures. Were 
any site to be unavailable, production in most cases could be switched to 
other sites.
Management of these risks also involves monitoring and reviewing supply 
chains (internal and external), dual/multiple sourcing of materials or 
strategic stock, site security and safety mechanisms, business continuity 
plans, the maintenance of product quality and strong customer 
relationships.
The Group insurance programme includes business interruption cover 
and specific cover in relation to the impact of an earthquake in California, 
USA; this Group-level insurance is reviewed annually by the Board.
Financial risks
9 .  T r ea su r y 
The Group’s global reach means that it is exposed to uncertainties in 
the financial markets, the fiscal jurisdictions where it operates, and the 
banking sector which heighten the Group’s funding, foreign exchange, 
tax, interest rate, credit and liquidity risks as well as the risk that a bank 
failure could impact the Group’s cash.
Trend 
Decreased  
The Group’s treasury function operates on a risk-averse basis. 
Required controls over selection of banks, cash management and 
other treasury practices and payments globally are documented in 
Morgan’s Treasury Policy and related procedures. The Group treasury 
team manages the Group’s funding, liquidity, cash management, interest 
rate, foreign exchange, counterparty credit and other treasury-related 
risks. Treasury matters are regularly reviewed by the Board and 
Audit Committee. 
In 2017 the Group repaid €20 million and $175 million of private 
placement debt utilising the funds raised by the 2016 US private debt 
placement.
Further detail on our Treasury Policy is set out in the Group Financial 
Review, and can be found on page 39.

1 0 .  T a x
The Group operates in many jurisdictions around the world and could 
be affected by changes in tax laws and regulations within the complex 
international tax environment.
The OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) framework 
provides additional obligations and filing requirements for the Group as 
countries implement the actions in the framework. These could have 
an impact on the tax paid by the Group.
Tax reform in the US could also impact the Group’s tax rate.
Trend 
Unchanged  
The Group’s tax function, working in conjunction with external specialists 
as required, closely monitors fiscal developments and changes such as 
BEPS and US tax reform, to ensure that the Group’s tax arrangements 
and practices continue to comply with the requirements of all relevant 
jurisdictions whilst also enabling efficient management of the tax liability. 
The Group’s Head of Tax reports periodically to the Audit Committee 
on key tax issues and initiatives.
1 1. Pension funding 
The Group sponsors several Defined Benefit pension arrangements 
whose liabilities are subject to fluctuating interest rates, investment 
values and inflation. This coupled with the increased longevity of 
members will result in increased funding burdens on the Group 
in the future.
The deficit in Morgan’s global Defined Benefit pension schemes 
calculated on the basis required for IAS19 accounting disclosures 
increased from £204 million as at 31 December 2015 to £271 million 
at 31 December 2016, reducing to £218 million at 31 December 2017.
Trend 
Decreased  
Morgan’s primary means of mitigating pensions funding risk is proactive 
management of the pension scheme assets and liabilities through an 
integrated pension strategy focusing on funding, investment and benefit 
risk. This involves both internal management within the Group and 
also externally through the scheme Trustees, corporate actuaries 
and professional advisers.
In the UK, the Morgan Senior Executive Pension and Life Assurance 
Scheme closed to future accrual in April 2016 and the Morgan Pension 
Scheme will close to future accrual in April 2018. In consultation with the 
Company, the Trustees have also adopted a pro-active approach to the 
management of risk in the Schemes’ investment portfolios, significantly 
reducing their unhedged interest and inflation rate exposure.
In the USA, in June 2016 one Defined Benefit Pension Plan completed a 
full legal termination, and for the other remaining Scheme, a formal offer 
of a present-value-equivalent, lump-sum cash payment was made to 
members. In December 2017, the Company made an additional 
contribution of $36 million to this Scheme.
Legal and Compliance Risk
12.  Contract management
As a global advanced materials business supplying components into 
critical applications, the Group may be exposed to liabilities arising 
from the use of its products. Ineffective contract risk management 
could result in significant liabilities for the Group and could damage 
customer relationships.
Trend 
Unchanged  
The Group has an in-house legal function supplemented by specialist 
external lawyers.
The Group Legal Policy requires in-house legal review of high-value or 
high-risk contracts to ensure they contain appropriate protections for the 
Group. The Policy requires CEO approval before a business can enter 
into an unlimited liability contract or one where the liability cap exceeds 
£5 million. 
During 2017 the legal function transitioned to a geographic model to 
enable closer engagement between the Group’s businesses and lawyers. 
This model is delivering improved collaboration in managing contract risks.
To the extent that risk cannot be mitigated through contractual 
arrangements, the Group has insurance cover in place, including product 
liability insurance.
1 3 .  C o m p l i a n c e
The Group’s global operations must comply with a range of national 
and international laws and regulations including those related to bribery 
and corruption, human rights, trade/export compliance and 
competition/anti-trust activities. 
A failure to comply with any applicable laws/regulations could result 
in civil or criminal liabilities and/or individual or corporate fines and 
could also result in debarment from government-related contracts or 
rejection by financial market counterparties and reputational damage.
Trend 
Unchanged 
The Group is committed to the highest standards of corporate and 
individual behaviour. This commitment is set out in the Group’s Core Values 
Statement and Ethics Policy, and is underpinned by ongoing investment 
in the in-house Responsible Business Programme (RBP). The RBP is a 
wide-ranging programme which includes policies, standards and guidance; 
training materials; the provision of an employee ethics hotline; and systems 
to support effective screening and due diligence of third parties. 
A new Director of Ethics & Compliance has been appointed who will 
be oversee further improvements to the RBP in 2018.
The Group also has an Export Compliance Director in the USA whose 
role is dedicated to ensuring compliance with export controls.
In addition to Group level compliance specialists, our businesses are 
required to establish compliance officer roles, which are responsible 
for supporting local training and monitoring. Morgan also employs 
country-specific trade and export compliance specialists in higher 
risk businesses and jurisdictions. 
Further details on the RBP can be found on page 45.

Group performance
Group revenue and operating profit
Group revenue was £1,021.5 million (2016: £989.2 
million), an increase of 3.3% on a reported basis 
compared with 2016. Improvements in the 
underlying business and benefits from the decline 
in the value of sterling against other currencies, with 
much of the Group’s business being denominated 
in non-sterling currencies, more than offset the 
impacts of disposals. On an organic constant-
currency* basis revenue increased by 1.4%.
Group headline operating profit was £1 19.7 million 
(2016: £1 16.9 million). Headline operating profit 
margin was 1 1.7%, compared to 1 1.8% for 2016. 
Operating profit improved to £158.1 million 
(2016: £107.3 million) and profit before tax 
improved to £135.8 million (2016: £87.9 million). 
Both of these included specific adjusting items of 
£45.7 million (2016: £(1.7) million), explained in 
note 6 to the financial statements on page 1 17, 
and year-on-year movements in exchange rates. 
Restructuring costs and other items
Restructuring costs and other items were 
£nil (2016: £(1.0) million). In 2016 these costs 
represent the conclusion of the significant 
rationalisation of the Carbon Materials footprint 
and corporate restructuring, partially offset by 
the gain on disposal of property within the 
Carbon business.

Priorities
The priorities for the Division reflect the six 
execution priorities of the Group. The Division 
continues to focus on utilising lean manufacturing 
techniques to drive greater efficiency and 
effectiveness in processes. 
To drive a return to organic revenue growth and 
maintain market share, the Division will continue 
to invest in both R&D and Sales force effectiveness. 
R&D spend will increase to maintain the lead in 
materials and manufacturing technology and to 
develop adjacent products utilising existing material 
technology. The technical team will provide 
applications engineering support to customers, 
channel partners and sales teams. 
Sales force effectiveness focus will be on the 
development, training and implementation 
of value selling models, restructuring the sales 
regions to optimise sales resources and ensuring 
the channel partners are supported to increase 
margins in an increasingly price sensitive market. 
Outlook
The Division’s book-to-bill ratio* was 1.06x in 
2017 (2016: 0.96x).
The Division expects a return to organic growth 
during the course of 2018. There are positive 
signs in the market with increasing levels of 
orders and enquiries, oil prices rising and a more 
positive tone coming from most major markets 
in Europe and North America. The market for 
crucibles continues to be relatively flat overall, 
with India and China growing slowly. 
Safety & efficiency
From thermally insulating heat shields 
to advanced ceramic fibre technology 
for electric vehicles, we are helping the 
automotive industry to improve vehicle 
safety, performance and energy efficiency 
to create more fuel efficient, safer vehicles.

Business description
The Carbon and Technical Ceramics Division 
comprises the Electrical Carbon, Seals and 
Bearings and Technical Ceramics global 
business units. 
Electrical Carbon uses advanced materials 
science to develop and manufacture a wide 
range of carbon brushes and collectors, brush 
holders, slip rings and linear transfer systems, 
which are used to transfer electrical current and 
data between stationary and rotating or linear 
moving parts in motor, generator, and current 
collector applications. Products are engineered 
for specific customer applications and they are 
often required to operate in harsh or extreme 
environments. Electrical Carbon’s main markets 
are rail, industrial drives, power generation, 
iron and steel, mining and wind. The business’s 
core strength is its longstanding materials and 
applications experience and its ability to engineer 
appropriate, reliable solutions for individual 
customer requirements. 
Seals and Bearings makes high-performance  
self-lubricating bearing and seal components, 
used predominantly in pumps, industrial and 
domestic, or other sealing applications. It uses 
advanced carbon/graphite, silicon carbide, 
alumina and zirconia materials to engineer 
lightweight, low-friction bearings and seals. 
These materials help solve the problems 
associated with use of lubricants in extreme 
temperatures, corrosive or hygienic 
environments and where access is restricted. 
These materials are engineered into products 
that provide customer-specific solutions. 
The business’s components often help to extend 
the operating life of customers’ equipment and 
make it more energy-efficient. The main markets 
served are specialist applications in the oil and 
gas, automotive, industrial, water pump, aerospace 
and home appliance sectors.
Technical Ceramics engineers high performance 
functional and structural ceramic materials, 
components and sub-assemblies to address 
customer-specific technical challenges. The 
business employs advanced materials science 
and applications expertise to produce parts that 
enhance reliability or improve the performance 
of its customers’ products. Much of what the 
global business unit makes is used in demanding, 
harsh or critical environments. The global 
business unit works in selected segments of 
the electronics, energy, healthcare, industrial, 
petrochemicals, security and transport markets, 
typically in close collaborative customer 
relationships. 
Footprint
As at 31 December 2017 the Carbon and 
Technical Ceramics Division comprised 50 
operating sites employing approximately 5240 
people, with manufacturing sites across the 
world. Due to the customer-specific nature of 
most of the products sold and the importance 
of staying very close to the market, most sales 
are made directly by the Division’s sales force 
and application engineers, with limited use 
being made of distributors. The global spread 
of operating sites supplemented by a 
comprehensive network of sales offices allows 
immediate access to, and facilitates direct 
working, with customers and the products’ 
end-users. 
Performance and business review 
Revenue for the Carbon and Technical 
Ceramics Division for the year was £527.4 
million, representing an increase of 5.1% 
compared with £502.0 million in 2016. On an 
organic constant-currency* basis, year-on-year 
revenue increased 6.2%.

Strategic Report
Review of operations continued Revenue for Electrical Carbon for the year was 
£157.1 million, representing an increase of 0.6% 
compared with £156.2 million in 2016. On an 
organic constant-currency* basis, year-on-year 
revenue increased by 3.1% as the rail, wind, 
mining and industrial segments all reflected 
year-on-year growth. Regionally, growth was 
primarily seen in Asia from strong sales of 
specialty graphite products, in particular due to 
sales of machined graphite in Korea supporting 
the semiconductor industry and carbon fibre felt 
materials in China for solar energy applications, 
and also the European markets. The North 
American market remained flat overall. 
Electrical Carbon EBITA* was £16.7 million 
(2016: £19.7 million) with an EBITA margin* 
of 10.6% (2016: 12.6%). Margin decline from 
the dilutive impact of the Rotary business, and 
investment in sales and technology resources 
was partially offset by operational efficiency 
improvements. 
Revenue for Seals and Bearings for the year 
was £1 13.2 million, representing an increase 
of 15.9% compared with £97.7 million in 2016. 
On an organic constant-currency* basis 
year-on-year revenue increased by 10.9%. 
Organic growth was driven by the water market 
and chemical and process industry pump seal 
and bearing demand. The business also 
experienced a stronger year for ceramic armour 
material in North America, with armour sales 
reflecting an increase of £3.6 million from 2016. 
The growth in these markets offset a decline in 
the Korean automotive market during the year. 
Seals and Bearings EBITA* was £17.5 million 
(2016: £14.2 million) with an EBITA margin* of 
15.5% (2016: 14.5%), and reflects continued 
good progress on operational improvements 
more than offsetting incremental investment 
in sales capability and R&D during the year. 
Revenue for the Technical Ceramics global 
business unit was £257.1 million, an increase 
of 3.6% compared with £248.1 million in 2016. 
On an organic constant-currency* basis, 
year-on-year revenue increased by 6.1%, 
primarily driven by demand for ceramic cores 
in the aerospace market and supply of ceramic 
parts into the semiconductor market. This 
demand offset some of the slow-down in 
the demand for ceramic cores for the industrial 
gas turbine market in the last quarter.
Technical Ceramics EBITA* was £28.3 million 
(2016: £26.6 million) with an EBITA margin* 
of 1 1.0% (2016: 10.7%). The dilutive impact of 
the divestment of the Electro-ceramics business 
was offset by operational efficiency improvements 
and streamlining of overheads following the 
divestment. 
Priorities 
The priorities of the Carbon and Technical 
Ceramics Division, and of the three global 
business units of which it comprises, reflect the 
six execution priorities of the Group set out in 
early 2016. The Division remains focused on 
delivering operational efficiencies and investing 
savings in product development and sales 
effectiveness to realise the growth in our 
selected markets and drive margin expansion.
Carbon and Technical Ceramics has two global 
Centres of Excellence – Carbon Science and 
Metals and Joining. Investment in these Centres 
will be increased in 2018. Their focus will be on 
ensuring a strong pipeline of innovation for the 
businesses within the Carbon and Technical 
Ceramics Division. 
The focus on operating costs is reflected in the 
Division’s results, most notably in the improved 
EBITA margins*. Plant-specific initiatives include 
a focus on reducing scrap and improving yields, 
which when combined with the benefits of 
global footprint management, and the increased 
use of low-cost manufacturing operations, 
underpin the reductions in the operational cost 
base of the business. A significant part of the 
Division’s capital expenditure is on investments 
which will improve the operational efficiency of 
the Division. 
In line with the Group priorities, the Division is 
improving the capabilities of its sales force and the 
supporting processes, and has commenced an 
assessment of current structure and capabilities.
Outlook
The Division’s book-to-bill ratio* was 1.10x for 
2017 (2016: 1.02x). 
The Division’s focus will be on ensuring that 
operational efficiencies are delivered and that 
the savings from these are appropriately invested 
in technology, product development and sales 
effectiveness to maximise opportunity in the 
prevailing market conditions.
High performance
Designed to perform in the low humidity 
and hostile conditions that exist in high 
altitude operating environments, our carbon 
brushes are used in starters, alternators, 
auxiliary power units, generators, motors 
and fuel pump applications within the 
aerospace industry.

million), reflecting a 30.9% decrease 
compared to 2016. EBITA margin* 
was (5.2)% (2016: 3.6%) 
Business description
The Composites and Defence Systems global 
business unit develops high-strength, lightweight, 
fatigue-resistant products using advanced 
composite materials to provide customers 
with solutions for unusually demanding or 
critical applications.
With its materials technology and advanced 
capability in manufacturing and systems 
integration, Composites and Defence Systems 
is able to solve complex engineering problems 
for the defence and commercial markets.
The business’s products are used for specialist 
applications in the security, medical, transport 
and aerospace markets. Its core strength is its 
capability for full engineering engagement from

tooling design and precision manufacturing, 
to scalable production and lifecycle support.
Footprint
As at 31 December 2017 Composites and 
Defence Systems employed approximately 
160 people at its two operating sites in the 
UK and Canada.
Performance and business review
Revenue for Composites and Defence Systems 
for the year was £21.0 million, representing a 
decrease of 30.9% compared with £30.4 million 
in 2016, on a reported basis, driven by a reduction 
in vehicle programme activity with the UK 
MoD and the completion of the Danish 
vehicle programmes. 
EBITA* for Composites and Defence Systems 
was £(1.1) million (2016: £1.1 million) with EBITA 
margin* of (5.2)% (2016: 3.6%). The EBITA* 
decline reflects the decline in revenue.
Priorities
Composites and Defence Systems continues 
to seek to capitalise on its product leadership in 
personal protection and armour, and to broaden 
its customer base. 
Outlook
The business expects demand levels to remain 
subdued in 2018 as further actions will be taken 
to streamline the cost base and drive operational 
improvements.

Amortisation of intangible assets
The Group amortisation charge was £7.3 million 
(2016: £7.9 million).
Finance costs
The net finance charge was £22.5 million 
(2016: £20.0 million), primarily comprising 
of net bank interest and similar charges of 
£15.8 million (2016: £13.2 million), gain from 
financial instruments of £0.2 million 
(2016: £0.3 million) and the finance charge 
under IAS 19 (revised), being the interest charge 
on pension scheme net liabilities, which was 
£6.9 million (2016: £7.1 million). The impact 
of potential changes in interest rates on profit 
or loss are stated in note 20 to the financial 
statements on pages 131 to 139.
Taxation
The Group tax charge, excluding specific 
adjusting items, was £26.9 million (2016: 
£26.6 million). The effective tax rate, excluding 
specific adjusting items, was 29.9% (2016: 29.7%). 
Note 8 to the financial statements, on pages 
1 18 to 1 19, provides additional information 
on the Group’s tax charge.
Earnings per share
Headline earnings per share* was 22.5 pence 
(2016: 22.7 pence), and basic earnings per share 
was 37.8 pence (2016: 18.4 pence). Details of 
these calculations can be found in note 9 to 
the financial statements on page 120. Headline 
earnings per share* is a non-GAAP measure. 
A reconciliation from IFRS profit to the profit 
used to calculate headline earnings per share 
is included in note 9 to the financial statements

Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend, 
subject to shareholder approval, of 7.0 pence 
per share on the Ordinary share capital of the 
Group, payable on 25 May 2018 to Ordinary 
shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 4 May 2018. Together with the 
interim dividend of 4.0 pence per share paid 
on 24 November 2017, this final dividend, if 
approved by shareholders, brings the total 
distribution for the year to 1 1.0 pence per 
share (2016: 1 1.0 pence). A total dividend 
of 1 1.0 pence per share represents a dividend 
cover of headline EPS* 2.0x in 2017 (2016: 2.1x).
The Board has held the dividend flat during 2017 
as it looks to rebuild dividend cover in the medium 
to long term. Note 39 to the financial statements, 
on page 167 , provides additional information on 
the Company’s distributable reserves. 
Cash flow
Cash flow from operations was £101.5 million 
(2016: £128.3 million), lower than 2016 due 
to the additional US pension payment of 
£28.0 million. Free cash flow before acquisitions 
and dividends was £26.0 million (2016:

Pensions
The Group operates a number of pension 
schemes throughout the world, the majority 
of which are of a funded defined benefit type.

The Group pension deficit has decreased 
by £53.1 million since last year end to £218.0 million 
on an IAS 19 (revised basis) due to a significant 
increase in Company contributions and investment 
returns being higher than expected. 
 > The UK schemes deficit decreased by £14.5 
million to £166.0 million (2016: increase of 
£63.1 million), as employer contributions and 
investment returns more than offset changes 
in assumptions (including a fall in the discount 
rate from 2.62% to 2.38%).
 > The USA schemes deficit decreased by 
£37.9 million to £1 1.1 million (2016: decrease 
of £6.1 million), primarily as a result of an 
additional, accelerated employer contribution 
in December 2017 of £28.0 million (more 
than offsetting a fall in the discount rate from 
4.16% to 3.65%).
 > The European schemes deficit decreased by 
£0.8 million to £36.7 million (2016: increase 
of £9.2 million), largely due to the disposal 
of the Rotary Business of Morgan Rekofa, 
principally in Germany (the discount rate 
remained constant at 1.60%).
 > The Rest of World schemes deficit increased 
by £0.1 million to £4.2 million (2016: increase 
of £2.4 million), resulting from the increase 
in the discount rate from 2.90% to 3.20%.

Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2017 38
Strategic Report
Review of operations continued Treasury policies
The following policies were implemented and 
in place across the Group throughout the year. 
The manager of each global business unit is 
required to confirm compliance as part of the 
year-end process.
Financial Risk Management 
and Treasury Policy
Group Treasury works within a framework 
of policies and procedures approved by the 
Audit Committee. It acts as a service to Morgan 
Advanced Materials’ businesses, not as a profit 
centre, and manages and controls risk in the 
treasury environment through the establishment 
of such procedures. Group Treasury seeks to 
align treasury goals, objectives and philosophy 
to those of the Group. It is responsible for all of 
the Group’s funding, liquidity, cash management, 
interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and other 
treasury business. As part of the policies and 
procedures, there is strict control over the 
use of financial instruments to hedge foreign 
currencies and interest rates. Speculative trading 
in derivatives and other financial instruments is 
not permitted.
Foreign exchange risks
Due to the international reach of the Group, 
currency transaction exposures exist. The Group 
has a policy in place to hedge all material firm 
commitments and a large proportion of highly 
probable forecast foreign currency exposures in 
respect of sales and purchases over the following 
12 months, and achieves this through the use of 
the forward foreign exchange markets. A 
significant proportion of the forward exchange 
contracts have maturities of less than one year 
after the balance sheet date. The Group 
continues its practice of not hedging income 
statement translation exposure.
There are exchange control restrictions which 
affect the ability of a small number of the Group’s 
subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Group. The 
Group does not believe such restrictions have 
had or will have any material adverse impact on 
the Group as a whole or the ability of the Group 
to meet its cash flow requirements.
Currency translation risks are controlled 
centrally. To defend against the impact of 
a permanent reduction in the value of its 
overseas net assets through currency 
depreciation, the Group seeks to match the 
currency of financial liabilities with the currency 
in which the net assets are denominated. This is 
achieved by raising funds in different currencies 
and through the use of hedging instruments such 
as swaps, and is implemented only to the extent 
that the Group’s gearing covenant under the 
terms of its loan documents, as well as its facility 
headroom, are likely to remain comfortably 
within limits. In this way, the currencies of 
the Group’s financial liabilities become more 
aligned to the currencies of the trading cash 
flows which service them.
Interest rate risk
The Group seeks to reduce the volatility in 
its interest charge caused by rate fluctuations. 
This is achieved through a combination of 
fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps. The 
proportions of fixed and floating rate debt are 
determined having regard to a number of 
factors, including prevailing market conditions, 
interest rate cycle, the Group’s interest cover 
and leverage position and any perceived 
correlation between business performance 
and rates.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the 
Group if a customer or counterparty to a 
financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations. The Group is exposed to credit risk 
on financial instruments such as liquid assets, 
derivative assets and trade receivables. 
Cash balances held by companies representing 
over 75% of the Group’s revenue are managed 
centrally through a number of pooling 
arrangements. Credit risk is managed by 
investing liquid assets and acquiring derivatives 
in a diversified way from high-credit-quality 
financial institutions. Counterparties are 
reviewed through the use of rating agencies, 
systemic risk considerations, and through regular 
review of the financial press. Credit risk is further 
discussed in note 20 to the financial statements 
on pages 131 to 139.
Capital investment
The Group has well-established formal 
procedures for the approval of investment in 
new businesses and for capital expenditure to 
ensure appropriate senior management review 
and sign-off.
Borrowing facilities and liquidity
All of the Group’s borrowing facilities are 
arranged by Group Treasury with Morgan 
Advanced Materials plc as the principal obligor. 
In a few cases operating subsidiaries have 
external borrowings but these are supervised 
and controlled centrally. Group Treasury seeks 
to obtain certainty of access to funding in the 
amounts, diversity of maturities and diversity 
of counterparties as required to support the 
Group’s medium-term financing requirements 
and to minimise the impact of poor credit 
market conditions.
The Group’s debt and maturity profile is 
provided in notes 19 and 20 to the financial 
statements on pages 130 to 139.
Tax risks
The Group follows a tax policy to fulfil local 
and international tax requirements, maintaining 
accurate and timely tax compliance whilst 
seeking to maximise long-term shareholder 
value. The Group adopts an open and 
transparent approach to relationships with 
tax authorities and continues to monitor and 
adopt new reporting requirements arising from 
the implementation of the OECD action plan on 
Base Erosion and Profit Shifting proposals within 
tax legislation across various jurisdictions. 
The tax strategy is aligned to the Group’s business 
strategy and ensures that tax affairs have strong 
commercial substance. Tax risks are set out in 
the Risk Management section on page 29.
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
  Annual Report 2017 Morgan Advanced Materials 39 Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position are set 
out in the Strategic Report on pages 10 to 53. 
The financial position of the Group, its cash 
flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities, 
are described earlier in this Financial Review. 
In addition, note 20 to the financial statements, 
includes the Group’s policies and processes 
for managing financial risk; details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities; and details 
of its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital 
requirements through local banking arrangements 
underpinned by the Group’s £200 million 
unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility 
maturing October 2019. The Group’s forecasts 
and projections, taking account of reasonably 
possible changes in trading performance and 
exchange rates, show the Group operating 
comfortably within its debt financial covenants 
for the next 12 months.
The current economic climate continues to 
have an impact on the Group, its customers 
and its suppliers. The Board fully recognises 
the challenges that lie ahead but, after making 
enquiries, and in the absence of any material 
uncertainties, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the 
Group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for a period of 
18 months from the date of signing of this 
Annual Report and Accounts. Accordingly, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the directors 
have assessed the viability of the Group over 
a three-year period, taking into account the 
Group’s current position and the potential 
impact of the principal risks documented on 
pages 26 to 29 of the Annual Report. Based on 
this assessment, the directors confirm that they 
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period to 31 December 2020.
The Directors have determined that a 
three-year period to 31 December 2020 is an 
appropriate period over which to provide its 
viability statement. This is the period reviewed 
by the Board in our strategic planning process 
and is considered to be appropriate given the 
dynamics in the markets in which we operate. 
To allow the Directors the make this assessment, 
a business base case has been built up, initially 
using a detailed bottom up approach and then 
applying what the Directors consider to be an 
appropriate set of assumptions in respect of 
growth, margins, working capital flows, capital 
expenditure, dividends and all other matters that 
could have a significant impact on the financial 
performance and liquidity of the Group. The 
resulting base case provides the Directors with 
an EBITDA* , debt and finance charge headroom 
relative to current bank covenants.
The Directors have made a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group and their 
potential impact and the adequacy of the 
headroom relative to a severe but plausible 
combination of these risks. While the review has 
considered all the principal risks identified by the 
Group, including the impacts of re-financing in 
2019, the following were focussed on for enhanced 
stress testing: technological obsolescence; single 
point exposure, trade compliance and pension 
funding. The geographical and product 
diversification of the Group’s operations helps 
minimise the risk of serious business interruption 
or a catastrophic damage to our reputation. 
Furthermore, the spread of the Group’s 
end-markets is such that it is not reliant on 
one particular group of clients or sector. 
Whilst this review does not consider all of the 
possible risks that the Group could face, the 
Directors consider that the approach adopted 
and the work performed is reasonable in the 
circumstances of the inherent uncertainty involved 
and that it allows the Board to confirm that they 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the period to 
31 December 2020. In reaching this assessment 
the Board have assessed that the existing 
indebtedness can be successfully refinanced 
within the Viability statement’s timeframe.

Strategic Report
Directors’ statements Reference is made to the following non-GAAP measures throughout this Strategic Report. These measures are shown because the Directors consider 
they provide useful information to shareholders, including additional insight into ongoing trading and year-on-year comparisons. These non-GAAP 
measures should be viewed as complementary to, not replacements for, the comparable GAAP measures.
Headline profit and earnings measures
Group headline operating profit is stated before specific adjusting items and amortisation of intangible assets. Specific adjusting items are excluded on 
the basis that they distort trading performance. Amortisation is excluded as the charge arises primarily on externally acquired intangible assets since 
the adoption of IFRS and does not therefore reflect all intangible assets consistently. 
Earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) is stated before specific adjusting items, amortisation of intangible assets, restructuring costs 
and other items. Segment EBITA is stated before unallocated corporate costs.

Group EBITDA is defined as operating profit 
before specific adjusting items, restructuring 
costs, other items, depreciation and 
amortisation of intangible assets. 
The Group uses this measure as it is a key 
metric in covenants over debt facilities.

Cash flow from operations and 
free cash flow before acquisitions 
and dividends
Cash flow from operations excludes the cash 
flows associated with restructuring activities and 
is shown because it illustrates the timing of the 
outflows relating to restructuring charges that 
may be incurred over more than one 
reporting period.
Free cash flow before acquisitions is defined as 
cash generated from operations less net capital 
expenditure, net interest paid and tax paid. 
The Group discloses free cash flow before 
acquisitions and disposals as this provides 
readers of the financial statements with a 
measure of the cash flows from the business 
before corporate-level cash flows (acquisitions 
and dividends).

metric as it is a key metric in covenants over 
debt facilities.

Constant-currency revenue and Group 
headline operating profit
Constant-currency revenue and Group headline 
operating profit are derived by translating the prior 
year results at current-year average exchange rates. 
These measures are used as they allow revenue to 
be compared excluding the impact of foreign 
exchange rates.
Page 37 provides further information on the 
principal foreign exchange rates used in the 
translation of the Group’s results to constant-
currency at average exchange rates. The potential 
impact of foreign exchange movements is provided 
in note 20 to the financial statements on pages 
131 to 139.
Return on invested capital
Return on invested capital (ROIC) is defined 
as Group headline operating profit (operating 
profit excluding specific adjusting items and 
amortisation of intangible assets) divided by 
the 12-month average adjusted net assets 
(third-party working capital, property, plant and 
equipment, land and buildings, intangible assets 
and other balance sheet items). 
Since 1 January 2016 ROIC has been used by 
the Group instead of ROCE to assess the return 
obtained from the Group’s asset base.

Headline earnings per share
Headline earnings per share is defined as 
operating profit adjusted to exclude specific 
adjusting items and amortisation of intangible 
assets, plus share of profit of associate less 
net financing costs, income tax expense 
and non-controlling interests, divided by the 
weighted average number of Ordinary shares 
during the period. This measure of earnings 
is shown because the Directors consider 
it provides a better indication of headline 
performance. 
Whilst amortisation of intangible assets is 
a recurring charge it is excluded from these 
measures on the basis that it primarily arises 
on externally acquired intangible assets and 
therefore does not reflect consistently the 
benefit that all of Morgan’s businesses realise 
from their intangible assets, which may not 
be recognised separately. 
Further information on earnings per share 
can be found in note 9 to the financial 
statements on page 120.
Book-to-bill ratio
The book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders 
received to sales in the period.

Strategic Report
Definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP 
measures to GAAP measures continued Corporate responsibility is 
integral to the Morgan Group; 
it means a commitment to 
behaving with integrity and 
having a positive impact on 
employees, stakeholders 
and the communities in 
which it works. 
Morgan strategy
This firm commitment to doing business in the 
right way is integral to the Group in continuing to 
be one of the world’s very best advanced materials 
companies, where corporate responsibility is a 
differentiator. The Group’s Responsible Business 
Programme (RBP), Environment, health and safety 
(EHS) programme and the approach to Morgan’s 
people, all support the aim of creating long-term 
sustainable shareholder value.
Tone from the top
The Board is ultimately accountable for 
corporate responsibility and receives regular 
reports on the RBP, the EHS programme 
and global talent management initiatives. 
The senior management team recognises the need 
to lead by example. The Executive Committee 
takes the lead on doing business in the right way. 
It is supported by the Divisional and global business 
unit executive teams together with functional heads 
with specific responsibility for environment, health 
and safety, legal compliance and human resources. 
Tone from the top has been central to the 
message across the Group in the year, through 
the implementation of strategy, its ethical and 
safe business approach, leadership briefings 
on RBP and EHS, as well as regular training 
sessions across the Group.
The Responsible Business Programme: 
doing business the right way
At Morgan we understand that our reputation 
and name are key assets which take a long time 
to build but could be quickly lost through corrupt 
or unethical behaviour. The RBP is the Group-
wide ethics and compliance programme in place 
to protect the Group, providing a framework 
underpinning the Group’s commitment to doing 
business in the right way. The core elements of 
the RBP are policies and guidance, training and 
education, risk assessments and due diligence, 
and monitoring and assurance delivered 
through certifications, internal audit and site 
compliance visits.
Policies
RBP policies are available to all employees in key 
languages, together with related manuals and 
guidelines. These require employees to operate 
in accordance not only with applicable laws and 
regulations, but also in line with internal rules 
and reporting requirements relating to areas 
such as ethical business behaviour, trade 
compliance, hospitality, gifts, donations and 
sponsorships. These policies also apply, to the 
extent appropriate, to Morgan’s business 
partners including agents, joint venture partners 
and third-party representatives. 
Training and education
Raising awareness of, and educating employees on, 
Group compliance policies and the applicable laws 
and regulations is a fundamental part of the RBP . 
Group-wide induction training is given to all 
employees in management positions or who 
interact with third parties (‘relevant employees’) 
and includes e-learning modules on human rights, 
anti-bribery and corruption, anti-competitive 
practice and contract risk awareness. Additional 
annual training in 2017 included face-to-face training 
by Group compliance staff at selected sites. 
Risk assessments & due diligence
Annual risk assessments across the Group help 
to identify those businesses which have a higher 
risk of a compliance breach, often associated 
with the geographic territories they operate in. 
These businesses receive additional focus and 
support as necessary. 
At Morgan we are mindful that organisations 
may be held liable for acts of corruption by 
their third-party intermediaries (including agents, 
distributors, customs agents, freight forwarders, 
freight companies). To address and mitigate 
this potential exposure, during 2017 the Group 
completed due diligence reviews of all of its third 
party intermediaries. These took the form of 
online reviews as well as questionnaires and 
associated documentation requests with higher 
levels of diligence geared to those with increased 
levels of corruption risk.
Monitoring and assurance
Divisional and global business unit Presidents 
and all functional heads are required on an 
annual basis to certify that the businesses/
functions they are responsible for have 
implemented and complied in full with Group 
policies or declared any exceptions. This 
certification forms an integral part of the Group’s 
system of internal controls. No material 
exceptions were declared in respect of 2017. 
Morgan’s internal audit function monitors 
adherence to key RBP processes including 
completion of induction training and compliance 
with key policies. Internal audit also ensures that 
the ethics hotline and its availability are 
adequately promoted at site level.
In 2017, Group compliance staff visited a number 
of sites and met with management and local 
employees to discuss and assess compliance 
processes and issues.
Ethics hotline 
The ethics hotline, operated by the independent 
third-party company Expolink, enables employees 
and others who are aware of, or suspect, 
misconduct, illegal activities, fraud, abuse of Group 
assets or violations of any Group policy to report 
these confidentially without fear of retribution 
should they feel they cannot use a local channel. 
The hotline includes local free-phone numbers in 
each of the countries in which the Group operates, 
with real-time translators available as necessary. 
Issues raised through the ethics hotline, or via 
other channels, are followed up by the internal 
audit, Group compliance, and human resources 
functions, or members of senior management 
teams as appropriate. Further investigation may 
be conducted through internal audit. The Audit 
Committee monitors and reviews a summary 
of the results generated. 
Human rights
As an international business, the Group supports 
the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, and the Group’s Human Rights Policy 
applies to all our businesses worldwide. The 
Policy is available on our website and covers 
child labour, forced labour, health and safety, 
freedom of association, discrimination, discipline, 
working hours and compensation. The Group’s 
Modern Slavery Act Transparency Statement, 
which is published annually on our website, 
details action taken to support the elimination 
of modern slavery and human trafficking. 
Group compliance plans for 2018 
During 2018, the Group plans to introduce a 
Code of Business Conduct to strengthen the 
framework for its stated Leadership behaviour 
of ‘working ethically and safely’. This will be 
supported by an updated training programme, 
both online and face to face as needed, to assist 
in the transition to the Code, and we will pay 
particular attention to assisting local compliance 
officers in their delivery of efficient and effective 
site-level processes and controls. 
Over the coming year the Group will also 
continue to review the effectiveness of the ethics 
hotline, to ensure it is fully achieving its objectives, 
update its Modern Slavery Act Transparency 
Statement, and publish detailed plans to further 
improve its assurance of compliance.

Corporate responsibility Environment, health 
and safety
Morgan is committed to 
protecting the health and 
safety of employees and 
others affected by its 
operations. It seeks to 
minimise the environmental 
impacts of its activities and 
maximise the positive effects 
of its products and services 
through its environmental, 
health and safety (EHS) 
programmes. 
Morgan is committed to operating in a manner 
that achieves high standards of health and safety 
for employees and others affected by its 
operations.
This commitment is reflected in the Group’s 
core health and safety values set out below 
and which are available in 17 languages across 
the Group:
 > We are committed to creating a culture 
and environment that is ‘zero harm’ with 
no accidents or illness due to our activities.
 > We encourage and expect our employees 
and contractors to be passionate 
about safety.
 > We are dedicated to creating a positive safety 
culture based on openness, transparency 
and responsibility.
 > We support a safe working culture through 
investment and training.
 > We engage with our people to continuously 
improve safety knowledge, reporting and 
performance through our commitment to 
Morgan’s ‘thinkSAFE’ programme. 
The Group is also committed to minimising the 
impact of its business on the environment and 
maximising the positive environmental benefits 
of its products. Examples of Morgan’s products 
which help enhance the environmental 
performance and efficiency of the Group’s 
customers are included in pages 18 to 19 
of this Report.
Under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013, 
the Group is required to report its annual 
greenhouse gas emissions for the year in its 
Directors’ Report. This information is shown 
on page 51 and includes CO 2 emissions due to 
energy use, which are further analysed in this 
section, together with other sources of 
greenhouse gases emissions.
2017 highlights
 > In 2017 the total number of accidents 
was 678, (2016: 767), however a higher 
proportion of these were lost-time cases than 
in 2016. (LTA 2017: 75, 2016: 53, 2015: 91)
 > Environmental performance was mixed in 
the year. Whilst the Group exceeded its 
water intensity and recycling targets it did not 
achieve its waste intensity or its CO 2e
1
 and 
energy intensity targets. The Group achieved 
a 4.9% reduction in water use intensity and a 
0.9% reduction in waste intensity with 
absolute reductions off-set by lower revenue 
at constant-currency. The proportion of total 
waste recycled improved by 1 1%. CO 2e 
intensity increased by 1.6% and energy 
intensity by 2.3%.
 > Morgan ‘thinkSAFE’, the Group’s safety 
performance improvement programme, 
focused on machine guarding, ‘Take 5 for 
Safety’ (5S), Bright, clean and ‘thinkSAFE’ 
and industrial vehicle safety.
 > At the end of 2017 the Group adopted a 
new, Board approved safety improvement 
plan for 2018 and beyond which looks to 
refresh ‘thinkSAFE’ and strengthen Group 
safety capabilities.
 > Morgan participated in the Carbon 
Disclosure Project (CDP) 2017 and achieved 
a score of B which places the Group in the 
top third of the CDP’s FTSE 350 Industrial 
sector. This ranking testifies to the Group’s 
climate change and energy related disclosure 
and performance.

regularly reviewed and is communicated across 
all sites within the Group. The Policy applies to 
all businesses worldwide and is published on the 
Group’s website and in the annual EHS Report. 
It forms the basis for Executive Committee and 
management oversight of the implementation 
of the Group’s EHS programmes.
EHS Policy governance 
Governance of Morgan’s EHS Policy is achieved 
through performance monitoring, risk assessment 
and the management and mitigation of identified 
risks to help provide continuous improvement 
in EHS performance in support of the Group’s 
strategic priorities.
The Group is committed to providing effective 
leadership in pursuit of an injury-free and 
environmentally responsible work place. 
The Chief Executive Officer and the operational 
management team are responsible for EHS 
performance. The Group’s Director, 
Environment, Health and Safety is responsible 
for Group direction and the oversight of the 
Group’s EHS programmes. There are EHS 
leaders in each of the global business units, 
and each site has a single point of accountability. 
These global specialists reports to their 
respective management team and are 
responsible for improving the standards of 
EHS management and performance across 
the Group’s businesses.
Morgan’s Group level EHS management 
processes include:
 > Monthly review of performance and 
progress in the implementation of our 
improvement plans by the Executive 
Committee and business leaders. 
 > Regular review of EHS performance by 
the Board. 
 > The EHS Compliance Audit Programme 
conducted against the Morgan EHS 
Framework with a focus on high-risk items. 
The programme also covers the EHS 
management systems and the EHS KPIs 
reported by each site and helps ensure 
compliance with local regulations and good 
management practice. All the Group’s 
manufacturing facilities are reviewed on a 
three-year rolling cycle. Accordingly, 24 sites 
were audited during 2017. The audit reports 
are reviewed by the Director, Environment, 
Health and Safety and by members of the 
Executive Committee and Divisional 
Executive teams. Action items are tracked 
through a formal follow-up process.
 > Formal training is an integral part of the 
implementation of the Group’s EHS Policy. 
This is undertaken at a regional level and 
tailored to business-specific risks and 
opportunities, with Group-level support 
and oversight.
 > External assurance of selected EHS data by 
ERM Certification and Verification Services 
(ERM CVS). The Assurance Report from 
ERM CVS is on page 50.
Taking site openings and closures into account, in 
2017 environmental management systems were 
in place at 90 sites worldwide, including 38 sites 
certified to ISO 14001. Worldwide, 102 sites 
have health and safety management systems 
in place, with 15 sites certified to, or working 
towards, OHSAS 18001.
EHS Policy effectiveness 
The Group monitors the effectiveness of its EHS 
Policy through its external EHS compliance audit 
programme, its internal EHS audit programme, 
review of performance against a series of 
Group-wide KPIs, its external assurance 
programme and by participating in a number 
of external initiatives.
The charts on pages 47 to 51 represent 
the Group’s EHS performance, covering all 
production sites during the year. 
The independent external assurance performed 
by ERM CVS covered the Group’s lost-time 
accident frequency rate, CO 2e intensity, energy 
intensity, waste intensity, water intensity and 
the waste recycling rate. The Assurance Report 
from ERM CVS is set out on page 50.
The Group also participates in external initiatives 
that help to benchmark the effectiveness of and 
progress against its EHS Policy. These include 
the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) in respect 
of the Group’s climate-change-related strategies, 
risks, management and performance. In 2017, 
Morgan achieved a score of B placing it in the 
top third of the CDP’s FTSE 350 Industrial 
sector. This reflects the Group’s performance, 
and the depth and quality of climate-change data 
disclosed to investors and the global marketplace 
through the CDP.
The Group has also made filings in respect of 
the Group’s UK facilities under the UK 
government’s Carbon Reduction Commitment 
(Energy Efficiency) Scheme.

  Annual Report 2017 Morgan Advanced Materials 47 Environmental 
performance 
The Group is committed to environmental 
responsibility and works to minimise the impact 
of its business on the environment and to maximise 
the positive environmental benefit of its products.
The Group monitors the material impacts of its 
operations on the environment as measured by 
its Scope 1 CO 2e and Scope 2 CO 2 emissions, its 
energy, waste and water intensity per £ million of 
revenue and the proportion of total waste which 
is recycled.
Morgan sets Group-wide targets for improvement 
in environmental performance, and each 
production site also sets specific internal targets 
which are reviewed as part of the annual budget 
process to ensure they are aligned with and 
contribute to the Group’s targets. Further details 
of the Group’s EHS targets and objectives for the 
coming year will be included in our 2017 EHS 
Report which is scheduled for publication on 
the Group website in mid-2018.
Throughout 2017, the Group undertook 
a series of projects and environmental 
programmes focused on those sites identified 
as having the greatest environmental impact. 
These are subject to regular review and 
follow-up by the Executive Committee 
to ensure key opportunities and risks are 
addressed. In addition, Divisional programmes 
covering topics such as energy awareness help 
to enhance business and environmental 
performance and competitiveness.
These programmes helped the Group to 
achieve its targets to reduce water and waste 
intensity and to increase recycling in the year. 
In absolute terms, the 2017 CO 2e emissions due 
to energy use were 332,600 tonnes, in line with 
2016. Absolute energy use in 2017 was also 
similar to 2016. Based on revenue at constant-
currency CO 2e intensity increased by 1.6% 
compared to prior year. Energy intensity in 2017 
increased by 2.3% compared to the prior year.
The five-year performance charts reflect 
reductions in energy and CO 2e intensity 
from 2013. The Group continues to work on 
a number of production improvement projects 
which include energy-efficiency programmes. 
These are aimed at driving year-on-year 
performance improvement in energy and 
CO 2e intensity. 
In 2017 total waste reported was 45,500 tonnes, 
a decrease of 2.2% compared to 2016. Waste 
intensity reduced by 0.9% compared to 2016. 
Morgan did not achieve its 2.5% waste intensity 
reduction target for the year.
The proportion of total waste which was recycled 
in 2017 was 56%, an improvement of 1 1% 
compared to 2016. Morgan exceeded its target 
to increase the proportion of total waste which is 
recycled by 1% year-on-year. A significant part of 
the improvement was due to the identification of 
additional opportunities for third parties to re-use 
waste streams at the Group’s site in Augusta, 
Georgia, USA. 
Total water use in 2017 was 2.32 million m
3
, 
a reduction of 4.9% compared to 2016. Water 
use intensity at constant-currency reduced by 
3.4% compared with 2016, exceeding the target 
to reduce water intensity by 2.5% in the year. 
Many sites around the world and particularly in 
Asia, where water is a limited resource, continued 
to deliver strong improvements in water use over 
the period.
2018 priorities for environmental 
performance: 
 > Explore opportunities to further the Group 
environmental strategy through the 
development of a ‘Morgan thinkGREEN’ 
programme.
 > Continue the focus on environmental 
improvement projects at sites with the 
biggest environmental impact.
 > Extend the benchmarking of sites with similar 
production technologies to encourage 
implementation of best practice and 
improvement plans.
 > Focus on robust ownership and delivery of 
environmental targets at site, business and 
Divisional levels.
 > Review and develop opportunities to 
increase the use of renewable energy.
 > Report Morgan’s carbon footprint on the 
basis of market and location-based methods 
to further reflect efforts to de-carbonise 
our business.

Strategic Report
Corporate responsibility continued Health and safety 
performance 
With the long-term aim of an injury-free 
workplace, Morgan is committed to its health 
and safety core values and to conducting all 
its activities in a manner that achieves high 
standards of health and safety for all employees 
and stakeholders. The Group’s long-term 
objective is ‘zero harm’. We aim to deliver 
year-on-year improvements in performance 
as we progress towards this objective.
The Group’s health and safety policies are clear 
and communicated throughout the Group. 
Health and safety metrics receive a high degree 
of focus at all levels of the business. Policy 
statements are supported by site-level 
assessment and monitoring of risks.
In 2017, the Group’s accident prevention 
and training programmes focused on reducing 
accident occurrence through an emphasis on 
leading indicators supported by behavioural 
safety initiatives and training as part of the 
‘thinkSAFE’ programme. The five-year health 
and safety charts and the performance review 
in this report cover the Group’s 2017 health 
and safety performance. 
The Group’s health and safety KPIs include 
accident frequencies, causes and related lost 
working time. These are reviewed monthly to 
monitor the effectiveness of the Group’s health 
and safety policies and related systems. The 
independent external assurance performed 
by ERM CVS covered the Group’s lost-time 
accident (LTA) frequency rate. 
Aggregating manufacturing sites and sales offices, 
the Group has over 130 locations worldwide, 
70% reported no LTAs during the year, with 
other sites improving on their accident 
frequency rates from 2016.
The Group’s total accident frequency per 
100,000 working hours was 3.49, a reduction 
of 10.4% on 2016, LTA frequency was 0.39 per 
100,000 working hours (2016: 0.27, 2015: 0.45) 
with a total of 75 LTAs reported (2016: 53, 
2015: 91). 
Whilst total accident frequency decreased 
compared to the prior year the Group’s overall 
2017 LTA performance was behind that achieved 
in 2016. In the first quarter 19 Morgan employees 
from around the world were involved in a road 
traffic accident while travelling to a management 
meeting at the Thermal Ceramics site in Augusta, 
GA, USA.
The vehicles in which the Morgan employees 
were travelling were stationary whilst at a red 
traffic light when they were struck from behind 
by a third-party travelling at speed. Eighteen 
Morgan employees were injured with 1 1 
suffering lost-time accidents, which resulted 
in 532 working days lost in the year. 
Reported lost time due to accidents and 
work-related illnesses as a percentage of 
working time increased to 0.13% in 2017 
(2016: 0.06%; 2015: 0.08%). The number of 
days lost during 2017 was 3,040 (2016: 1,422, 
2015: 2,135). The average number of days lost 
in 2017 per LTA reported in the year increased 
to 40.5 days (2016: 26.8; 2015: 23.5). 
In the fourth quarter of the year the Board 
approved a new safety improvement plan and 
strategy. The programme will see the refresh of 
the Morgan ‘thinkSAFE’ standard with additional 
training, further employee engagement on safety 
and clearer local communication of progress. 
The improvement plan will be reinforced with 
a review of leading and lagging indicators and 
improved incident management combined with 
a review of skills, competencies and resources.
2018 priorities for health and safety:
 > Implement the new safety improvement plan 
and strategy for 2018 onwards. 
 > Strengthen and refresh ‘thinkSAFE’ as the 
platform for safety performance improvement 
Group-wide with a particular focus on 
employee engagement and interaction 
through each site’s safety corner.
 > Drive a consistent approach to safety at all 
sites through ‘thinkSAFE’.
 > Update the Group’s safety framework 
to ensure compliance and to focus on key 
risk identification and management taking 
account of scale and opportunities for 
simplification. 
 > Increase the use of safety data and 
information to support performance 
improvement, to inform decision-making 
and to ensure accountability.
 > Develop a Safety Technical Leadership 
Committee to help implement safety 
strategy and to provide tactical support 
to site management to embed the culture 
of zero-harm.
 > Focus on reducing the time lost by each 
lost-time accident through appropriate 
return-to-work initiatives.

Assurance 
standard
ERM CVS’ assurance methodology, based on the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 
ISAE 3000 (Revised).
Assurance level Limited assurance. 
Respective 
responsibilities
Morgan is responsible for preparing the data and for its correct presentation in reporting to third parties, 
including disclosure of the reporting criteria and boundary. 
ERM CVS’s responsibility is to provide conclusions on the agreed scope based on the assurance activities performed 
and exercising our professional judgement. 
Our conclusions
Based on our activities, nothing has come to our 
attention to indicate that the EHS performance 
data for year ended 31 December 2017, as listed 
above, are not fairly presented, in all material 
respects, with the reporting criteria.
Our assurance activities 
Our objective was to assess whether the 
selected data are reported in accordance with 
the principles of completeness, comparability 
(across the organisation) and accuracy 
(including calculations, use of appropriate 
conversion factors and consolidation). We 
planned and performed our work to obtain 
all the information and explanations that we 
believe were necessary to provide a basis 
for our assurance conclusions. 
A multi-disciplinary team of EHS and assurance 
specialists performed the following activities: 
 > Interviewed relevant staff to understand and 
evaluate the data management systems and 
processes (including IT systems and internal 
review processes) used for collecting and 
reporting the selected data.
 > Reviewed of the internal indicator definitions 
and conversion factors.
 > Visited four sites (USA, India, China and 
Germany) to review local reporting 
processes and consistency of reported 
annual data with selected underlying source 
data for each indicator. We interviewed 
relevant staff, reviewed site data capture 
and reporting methods, checked calculations 
and assessed the local internal quality and 
assurance processes. 
 > An analytical review of the data from all sites 
and a check on the completeness and 
accuracy of the corporate data consolidation. 
 > Year-end assurance activities at corporate 
level including the results of internal review 
procedures and the accuracy of the 
consolidation of the data for the selected 
indicators from the site data.
The limitations of our engagement
The reliability of the assured data is subject 
to inherent uncertainties, given the available 
methods for determining, calculating or 
estimating the underlying information. 
It is important to understand our assurance 
conclusions in this context.

Strategic Report
Independent assurance report Greenhouse gas emissions
Under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013 
(‘the Regulations’) the Group is required to 
report its annual greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent 
(CO 2e) in its Directors’ Report.
Morgan has published information on its 
emissions due to the combustion of fossil fuels 
and the electricity purchased by the Company 
for its own use in its annual EHS Report since 
2004 and in its Annual Report since 2005. 
Since 201 1 the Group’s CO 2e emissions due 
to energy consumption have been externally 
assured (see the 2017 Assurance Report from 
ERM CVS on page 50). The Group has 
participated in the Carbon Disclosure Project 
(CDP) since 2006 and in 2017 achieved a score 
of B, reflecting the Group’s performance and 
the depth and quality of climate change data that 
Morgan has disclosed to investors and the global 
marketplace through the CDP.
The Regulations require the Group to disclose 
its emissions due to the combustion of biomass 
and due to process and fugitive emissions which 
are in addition to the emissions due to energy 
use reported on page 47 of this Annual Report. 
In the table below CO 2e is a standard unit for 
measuring the amount of CO 2 and the amount 
of non-CO 2 GHG with the equivalent global 
warming potential. Data is rounded to the 
nearest 100 tonnes of CO 2e.
As required under the Regulations, the above 
Report includes the material emission sources 
from the operations and activities covered by 
the Group’s financial statements. As noted, 
the Report exclude emissions from Company-
owned and leased vehicles and emissions 
relating to steam supplied by third parties to 
two sites in China and one in Europe, which 
are in total estimated to account for less than 
1% of total emissions. The Directors consider 
that these sources of emissions are not material 
to the total of the Group’s emissions.
The Group’s reporting methodology is based on 
the internationally-recognised Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol. It uses emission factors for standard 
grid electricity by country and year from the 
International Energy Agency together with other 
factors published by the UK Department for 
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to calculate 
the CO 2e emissions included in this Report.

Morgan Advanced Materials plc has circa 8,800 
employees, working across the globe in all major 
markets and regions. The Group’s employees 
are critical to its success and the workforce is 
built upon people with highly unique skills and 
abilities. Set out below are the Group’s people 
policies, how they have been implemented, 
together with a review of their effectiveness.
People Policies and their 
implementation
The Group supports the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, and the Group’s Human Rights 
Policy commits the Group to protect the rights 
of everyone who works for it and all those who 
have dealings with it. The principles of the Policy 
cover child labour, forced labour, health and 
safety, freedom of association, discrimination, 
discipline, working hours and compensation and 
the Policy is published on the Group’s website. 
Morgan Advanced Materials plc does not unfairly 
discriminate and respects human rights. Our 
employee policies are set locally to comply with 
local law within the overall Group framework. 
The Morgan Advanced Materials plc Ethics 
Hotline enables employees who are aware 
of or suspect issues under the Group’s Human 
Rights Policy to report these confidentially.
The Company promotes equal opportunities for 
all employees and job applicants and does not 
unlawfully discriminate on the grounds of their 
sex, pregnancy/maternity leave, marriage/civil 
partnership status, gender reassignment, race, 
disability, sexual orientation, age, religion or belief.
The Company will make reasonable adjustments 
to accommodate any employees who have a 
disability within the meaning of the Equality 
Act 2010 where the Company is aware of 
such disability. 
Investment in people 
One of the Group’s six execution priorities 
in 2017, which will continue into 2018, is to 
increase investment in people development 
including key functional and technical skills 
and the development of future leaders. 
There was significant investment and progress 
on this execution priority in 2017. Building on 
work from previous years and the reorganisation 
to a Divisional and global business unit structure, 
the focus has been to continue the assessment 
of existing capability and close gaps through 
recruitment and development. 
Setting clear expectations is a critical 
requirement to ensure the recruitment, 
development and performance of leaders is 
aligned to strategic requirements. The launch 
of the Leadership behaviours at the 2017 senior 
leader conference provided that clarity. The 
behaviours focus on our ambition for the future, 
how we build strong teams and being relentless 
in driving performance.
These three areas support the change in the 
culture required to successfully deliver our 
strategy. In 2017 we have focused on supporting 
our employees to understand the behaviours 
and begin to demonstrate them.
In 2018 our top 300 leaders will participate in 
a globally consistent performance management 
process which measures what is achieved and 
how it is achieved, through the integration of 
our leadership behaviours. This will reinforce 
the importance of role modelling our expected 
behaviours.
Functional projects have been continued 
and commenced for sales and technology 
respectively. The sales assessment enabled 
detailed planning to define future role 
requirements and competencies. A similar 
assessment was conducted with the technology 
population, which has informed future 
capability needs.
Our leadership and functional expectations 
have been applied to new role specifications, 
recruitment and development activities. In 2017, 
new roles have been created, with a number 
of external hires and internal promotions across 
our senior leader population, strengthening 
our leadership and functional capability. Sales 
requirements have enabled the alignment of 
our sales employees to roles where they can 
leverage their strengths and add greater value. 
Following our global reorganisation and the 
strengthening of our senior leadership team 
we have started team development activities. 
This is centred around team understanding of 
style and capability to enable more effective 
working practices. This initiative will continue in 
2018 as we work to enable not only individuals, 
but teams to sustain Morgan as a high 
performing, healthy company.
Our focus on leadership development has 
continued though, for example in the Thermal 
Products Division, the Ascend and Velocity 
leadership development programmes. In 2018 
a review of our leadership programmes will be 
undertaken to drive greater global consistency 
and alignment to our future capability needs 
and leadership behaviours.

Strategic Report
Corporate responsibility continued We have also introduced a global e-learning 
platform to provide easily accessible business 
skills based training across all locations. This 
has been used initially to support our revised 
performance management approach.
Assessment of our sales population has identified 
that we have gaps, and we have started the 
definition of training requirements, with training 
to be designed and deployed in 2018. Similar 
assessment of our technology population has 
identified areas of focus for 2018. 
The Group graduate development programme 
aims to empower these individuals to drive 
their own growth and career development in 
Morgan, so they can become Morgan’s future 
functional and business leaders. 
Over a period of 2.5 years, participants 
are provided with a blend of development 
opportunities including:
 > International and regional training covering 
business, technical and leadership skills 
 > Exposure to and networking with senior 
leaders 
 > Mentoring, feedback, and regular coaching 
conversations related to career aspirations 
 > Learning on the job through a wide variety 
of cross functional, high responsibility 
projects, international collaboration 
and exposure to a variety of roles.
Communications
During a period of increased change, it 
is important to increase communications. 
The introduction of quarterly calls for our 
top 100 leaders has enabled a greater two-way 
connection. Feedback indicates greater levels of 
engagement and improved awareness of Group 
messaging and initiatives. In addition to our 
annual senior leader conference, the technology 
function ran a conference focused on innovation, 
collaboration and an external mind-set. 
In May 2017 we held our annual European 
Employee Forum meeting inviting site 
representatives to meet with senior leaders 
and engage in discussion on important topics.
Reward, recognition and awards
The Group recognises the accomplishments of 
its people individually and as teams, and makes 
awards to acknowledge achievement, loyalty, 
and innovation. Recognition awards continue 
to be made across local businesses as well 
as to senior management, with awards linked 
to business performance. 
The principle of pay for performance underpins 
the Group’s compensation approach and the 
Company sets compensation levels using external 
benchmarking and relevant commercial 
considerations that are both competitive in the 
countries in which they operate and affordable. 
Morgan offers short-term performance incentives 
globally to managers, technical and functional 
experts. The Executive Committee and senior 
management also have long-term incentives tied 
to personal and commercial performance. At 
plant level, most sites offer incentives to their 
workforce that result in payments based on 
meeting locally-set performance targets.
Morgan regularly reviews bonus arrangements 
and benefits to ensure they encourage and 
reward commercial and personal performance.
During 2017 the Group introduced a new reward 
and recognition scheme, the Chairman’s Awards. 
This is an annual awards scheme to reward 
distinctive contributions made by Morgan 
employees. There were six categories where 
we recognised and rewarded achievements; 
Material Science, Application Engineering, 
Customer Focus, Functional Excellence, Ethical 
and Safe Working. The Executive Committee 
selected one winner per category, and the 
Chairman and the CEO awarded prizes.

Corporate governance
Governance Dear Shareholder
This year the Board has continued to evolve with a further change to 
its membership and the continuing development of the non-executive 
Directors who joined the Board in 2016. These appointments have 
brought additional focus to the execution of the Company’s strategic 
priorities and to its governance needs. 
I am pleased to report to you on the Board’s development and activities 
and on some of the significant governance matters that the Board has 
considered during the year: 
 > Core focus continues to be on safety, environment and health matters, 
including the objectives and targets for this key area. The Board 
received regular updates on safety and environmental operational 
performance and on initiatives undertaken to raise and renew 
awareness of safety and improve our safety culture globally. 
 > The Board continues to support the Executive Committee on the 
implementation of the execution priorities arising from the strategic 
review concluded in 2016, including receiving specific strategy updates 
on each of the global business units, presented by the respective 
Divisional and global business unit management, and agenda items 
on talent, technology and sales effectiveness.
 > In February 2017, the Board approved the sale of the global Rotary 
Transfer Systems business to Moog Inc. for €40 million and the sale 
of its UK Electro-ceramics business to CeramTec for £47 million. 
Both divestments were completed in April 2017 and form part of 
the strategy for the Company to simplify its portfolio and reinvest 
the proceeds from the sales into the core businesses.
 > In May 2017, the Board reviewed and approved its Modern Slavery 
Act Transparency Statement, and in doing so considered how it could 
enhance the steps the Company already takes to prevent any form of 
modern slavery. A copy of the statement is available on our website. 
 > In March 2017, the Board approved changes to the schedule of matters 
reserved for the Board, which included new matters for Board 
approval resulting from new legislative requirements and changes to 
the UK Corporate Governance Code. These included risk appetite, 
tax strategy and the Modern Slavery Act Transparency Statement, 
as well as ensuring the Board focuses on those areas which matter 
most to support the Group in developing a sustainable business. 
 > The Board selected and appointed Jane Aikman as non-executive 
Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
 > The Board oversaw the induction of Jane Aikman, with a focus on 
increasing her knowledge of the Group and its associated markets 
in a structured and accessible way, enabling Jane to quickly make an 
informed and effective contribution to the Board and to participate 
fully in Board discussions.
 > Board visits were organised to a number of sites, which afforded 
Directors a better insight into our businesses and enabled them to 
meet local management and to hear more on safety performance 
and initiatives, market trends, product development, innovation and 
operations. In September 2017, the Board visited a site in Italy relating 
to the Company’s Thermal Ceramics business, and the Board meeting 
in November 2017 was held at the Electrical Carbon site in Swansea, 
Wales, and included a tour of the site operations. 
 > The Board reviewed the outputs from the internal Board performance 
evaluation which provided further insight into the Board and its 
Committees on potential areas for consideration during the next 
12 months. These are explained further below under the heading 
‘Performance evaluation’.
 > The Board supported the Audit Committee in its continued rigorous 
review of internal controls and risk management processes, which 
is described in more detail in the Report of the Audit Committee. 
During 2018 the Board will look at how it can further improve its 
governance framework and performance and continue to drive the 
strategic aspirations of the Group.

Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
  Annual Report 2017 Morgan Advanced Materials 57 Statement of compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code
The main principles of the Code focus on Leadership, Effectiveness, 
Accountability, Remuneration and Relations with Shareholders. This 
statement describes how the Company has applied the main principles 
of the Code. It should be read in conjunction with the Strategic Report 
on pages 10 to 53 and the other sections of the Directors’ Report 
on pages 54 to 93.
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2017 the Company has been 
in compliance with the relevant provisions of the April 2016 edition of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) which applies to the 2017 
financial year. 
The Code is published by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) and 
is available on its website www.frc.org.uk.
Leadership
The role of the Board
The Board is collectively responsible to the Company’s shareholders 
for the long-term success of the Company. The Board is satisfied it has 
met the Code’s requirements for its effective operation. Following the 
conclusion of the strategic review and the setting of execution priorities in 
2016, the Board has reviewed delivery against these priorities during the 
year. The Board ensures that there is a robust framework of prudent and 
effective controls, which enables risks to be assessed and managed. The 
Board sets the Company’s values and standards, which are contained in 
the Core Values Statement and Ethics Policy, and which are referred to on 
pages 45 to 53 of the Corporate responsibility section of this Report.
Matters reserved
There is a schedule of matters specifically reserved for the Board, which 
was updated during the year to reflect the latest Code and other legislative 
changes, which includes: setting the Group’s strategic aims and objectives; 
approving significant contractual commitments (including the acquisition or 
disposal of companies/businesses, and treasury and intellectual property 
transactions); and the review of the effectiveness of risk management 
processes, major capital expenditure and corporate responsibility. 
The schedule of matters reserved for the Board is available to view 
on the Company’s website. The Board also regularly reviews the 
limitations of authority within the Group to ensure they remain 
appropriate.
Delegation of authority
The Board has delegated authority for specific matters to three principal 
Committees, namely the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees. The memberships, roles and activities of the principal 
Committees are described in their respective reports: the Report of 
the Audit Committee is set out on pages 64 to 67; the Report 
of the Nomination Committee is set out on pages 68 and 69; and 
the Report of the Remuneration Committee is set out on pages 70 to 89. 
The full terms of reference of these principal Committees are available on 
the Company’s website.
The Board delegates the day-to-day management of the Group and 
operational matters to the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial 
Officer. The two executive Directors together with the Group Human 
Resources Director, the Group General Counsel, the Chief Technology 
Officer, and the Divisional or global business unit Presidents, form the 
Executive Committee.
The Board has delegated authority for certain other matters including 
routine approvals to a General Purposes Committee at which a non-
executive Director must be present. The Committee meets as required. 
The Disclosure Committee met on an ad-hoc basis during the year to 
assess whether information which directly concerns the Group is inside 
information and to discharge other responsibilities relating to the control 
and disclosure of inside information. The membership of the Disclosure 
Committee comprises all the Directors and the Company Secretary.
Board meetings
In 2017, the Board met formally on eight occasions. A summary of the 
matters addressed at these meetings is set out below. 
During the year, there have been several dedicated agenda items on 
implementation of the Group strategy, with the Board monitoring the 
progress made by the Company in delivering the agreed execution 
priorities. The Board reviewed the pace of change and noted the key 
actions required to overcome the capacity and capability barriers 
identified, such as the streamlining of organisation structures and increasing 
the resources committed to key priorities, with all actions being under the 
close and regular scrutiny of the Executive Committee. The Board 
received presentations on the strategic plan for each of the Divisions 
including the global business units and separate reviews on talent, 
technology and innovation.

  Annual Report 2017 Morgan Advanced Materials 59 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separate, 
clearly established, set out in writing and agreed by the Board. 
The Chairman is responsible for the leadership and effectiveness of 
the Board, in order to ensure effective stewardship is exercised over 
the Group’s activities, including: setting the Board’s agenda and ensuring 
sufficient time is available for all agenda items, particularly regarding 
strategic issues; promoting a culture of open debate and constructive 
challenge resulting in sound decision-making; facilitating effective 
contributions by the non-executive Directors; and ensuring constructive 
relationships between executive and non-executive Directors. The Chief 
Executive Officer is responsible for the management of the Group, 
including the delivery of the Group’s business plan, the formulation 
and implementation of strategy, chairing the meetings of the Executive 
Committee and ensuring the implementation of the Group’s policies, 
all within the authorities delegated by the Board. The Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer maintain a strong working relationship and 
open dialogue, thus ensuring coherent leadership of the Group.
Chairman
On appointment as Chairman on 1 August 2012, Andrew Shilston 
met the independence criteria set out in the Code.
Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors are appointed for a term of three years, subject 
to annual re-election in accordance with the Code. The independence, 
commitment and effectiveness of any non-executive Director who has 
served for two three-year terms is subject to rigorous review prior to 
reappointment for a final three-year term. Further information on the 
non-executive Directors can be found in their biographies on pages 56 
and 57 and on how the Board monitors its own performance on pages 62 
and 63.
Jane Aikman was appointed to the Board on 31 July 2017 and became 
Chairman of the Audit Committee replacing Rob Rowley, who stepped 
down from the Board on the same date following three years’ service.
On 8 December 2017, Laurence Mulliez was appointed Senior Independent 
Director in place of Douglas Caster who continues to serve as a non-
executive Director and as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
The Chairman and the non-executive Directors met without the executive 
Directors present on a number of occasions during the year. In addition, 
the Senior Independent Director and the other non-executive Directors 
met without the Chairman present.
Effectiveness
Board balance and independence
Following the appointment of Jane Aikman and the resignation of Rob 
Rowley, the Board continued to comprise five non-executive Directors 
and two executive Directors. This is considered to be the appropriate 
number of members of the Board, given the scale of the Group’s 
operations at this time. Biographies of the Directors in post at the date 
of this Report, including details of their skills, career and experience 
and other main commitments, are set out on pages 56 and 57. 
The size, structure and composition of the Board were reviewed during 
the year, taking into account succession planning and the need to 
progressively refresh the membership and update the knowledge and 
range of skills and experience of the Board, which are continuously 
monitored. The Board wishes to ensure that it maintains a good blend 
of views and skills as well as a cohesive and informed decision-making 
process. The Board comprises members with a breadth and depth of 
professional and sector experience with varied and relevant backgrounds; 
it has Directors with skills in strategy, finance and technology, as well as 
global commercial experience, and working knowledge of other Boards 
or executive roles. Our new non-executive Director, Jane Aikman, has 
recent and relevant experience for her position as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee as she is currently the Chief Financial Officer of another listed 
entity and previously held several senior financial executive roles during 
which she has gained significant knowledge of growing manufacturing 
and technology businesses. 
Further information on the recruitment process to appoint Jane Aikman 
is included in the Report of the Nomination Committee on pages 68 
and 69.
Throughout the year, the Company complied with the requirement of 
the Code that at least half the Board, excluding the Chairman, should 
comprise non-executive Directors determined by the Board to be 
independent. In addition to considering the factors set out in the Code, 
the Board’s assessment of a non-executive Director’s independence 
and effectiveness covers their total number of commitments, and any 
relationships with major suppliers or with charities receiving material 
support from the Company.

in developing a tailored induction programme. Jane Aikman received 
a structured and detailed induction which included an information pack 
of pertinent documents and a meeting with the external auditor with the 
departing Chairman of the Audit Committee in attendance. Jane also met 
with relevant external advisers and other senior executives and functional 
heads on governance, responsible business, key risks, human resources and 
environment, health and safety. She attended planned visits to operational 
sites in the UK and overseas and held meetings with Divisional, business 
unit and operational management and personnel during those site visits.
All non-executive Directors have access to management and employees 
at all levels and are encouraged to visit operational sites. Each year at least 
one Board meeting is held at an operating facility. In 2017, Board visits 
were made to the Thermal Ceramics site in Casalpusterlengo, Italy, 
and to the Electrical Carbon site in Swansea, Wales.
The Chairman considers the individual training and development needs 
of each Director. The Company Secretary keeps the suitability of external 
courses under review and facilitates the ongoing training and development 
of all Directors as necessary.

  Annual Report 2017 Morgan Advanced Materials 61 Performance evaluation
Following the externally facilitated review conducted in 2015, the Board 
conducted an internal Board performance evaluation in 2016 and again 
in 2017, both led by the Chairman, with the aim of identifying ways to 
improve effectiveness. 
In 2017, the process for the evaluation of the Board and its Committees 
was as follows:
 > All Board members completed questionnaires, similar to those 
undertaken in 2016.
 > A report was produced summarising the results of the questionnaires 
and highlighting any significant changes from last year.
 > The findings were presented to the Chairman. 
 > The Chairman met with each Board member to discuss the outputs 
from the report. 
 > The report was circulated to the Board, which had a full discussion on 
the results and comments at its November meeting and subsequently 
agreed an action plan.
The Board continuously monitors its own performance to ensure that 
it provides the Group with the right blend of leadership and strategic 
oversight, enabling it to carry out its duties effectively. The Board believes 
that there is scope for further development and improvement to oversee 
the delivery of the Group’s strategy and to ensure that the Board operates 
effectively and in a timely manner during a period of change. Proposed 
actions include the following:
 > Consider the skills mix on the Board, and specifically geographical 
representation, should the need arise to recruit an additional 
non-executive Director.
 > Continued focus on succession planning and the development of 
leaders, building on the work of the two previous years, and 
monitoring initiatives implemented by executive management.
 > Recognising the amount of organisational change within the business, 
provide more opportunities for interaction with the senior 
management team.
 > Continue to review the information provided to the Board to assess 
the Group’s risk profile.
 > Communicate the views of the major shareholders to the Board. 
Actions were taken during the year to implement the recommendations 
made following the 2016 internal Board performance review and in the 
case of execution of the strategic priorities and focus on business leadership, 
the work is ongoing. The next independent external review is due in 2018.
Recommendations from the 2016 Board performance review and actions implemented during 2017 
Recommendations from 2016 Action taken/progress made during 2017
Quality of Board papers and Group financial reporting. Noting 
progress made in this area, further work to be undertaken to ensure 
inputs to the Board are suitably succinct and clearly focused. 
Improvements have been made to Board papers, for example the three 
year strategic plans for each global business unit, presented to the Board 
in June 2017, followed a standard format, including market and competitive 
environment, selection of growth building blocks and the strategy and 
resourcing required to pursue them. 
Succession planning and business leadership. Continued focus on 
talent management and development, one of the Group’s strategic 
priorities. 
The Board reviewed the Group’s leadership capability and succession 
planning arrangements in September 2017, including key initiatives 
designed to develop leadership and manage future talent. 
A number of senior appointments were made in 2017.
Morgan’s leadership framework, including the Leadership behaviours, 
was rolled out in the year.
Non-executive Director time together and induction of those 
recently appointed
Site visits in September and November 2017 increased the time that 
non-executive Directors spent together and their knowledge of Morgan’s 
businesses, products, operations, risks and environment, health and safety 
performance.
The induction pack for new Directors is continuously reviewed to ensure 
it remains relevant.
Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2017 62
Governance
Corporate governance continued The non-executive Directors, led by Douglas Caster, the Senior 
Independent Director at the time, met without the Chairman present to 
evaluate the Chairman’s performance during the year, taking into account 
the views of the executive Directors. 
Conflicts of interest
The Board has procedures in place to address the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 concerning the duty of the Directors to avoid 
conflicts of interest. Accordingly, the Directors are required to: 
 > Disclose proposed outside commitments before they are accepted in 
order to enable a prior assessment of any actual or potential conflict. 
 > Disclose without delay any situation which gives rise to an actual or 
potential conflict.
The Board reviews the outside interests of the Directors annually, 
including any disclosed conflicts and authorisations. Should an actual or 
potential conflict be identified, the Board considers whether to authorise 
the situation in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and, 
if so, the terms of any authorisation. In the event of an actual conflict 
arising, the Director concerned is to notify the Chairman (the Chairman 
would notify the Senior Independent Director) and the Director would 
be denied access to the relevant information and excluded from any 
associated debate and decision. 
Following the 2017 review of any conflicts, no potential or actual conflicts 
were confirmed as having taken place during the year under review. 
Neither of the current executive Directors holds any external non-
executive directorships of other publicly-quoted companies.
Accountability
Financial reporting
A summary of the statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of 
the Annual Report and the financial statements is set out on pages 100 
to 104 and the going concern and viability statements are set out in 
the Strategic Report on page 40.
Business model and strategy
Details of the Group’s business model, how it is working to generate and 
sustain long-term value and details of the Board’s strategy for ensuring the 
Group meets its objectives are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 
12 to 13.
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining a 
sound system of internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investment 
and the Group’s assets and for reviewing the effectiveness of this system. 
The system of internal control, and the role of the Audit Committee in 
ensuring its effectiveness, are set out in the Report of the Audit 
Committee on pages 64 to 67. 
Relations with shareholders
During 2017, the Chairman and other non-executive Directors attended 
the full and half-year results presentations so that they were available to 
respond to any specific shareholder queries. 
Following the announcement of the Group’s results and after other 
significant statements and presentations, investor opinion is canvassed 
and any feedback is made available to the Board. In addition, the Board 
is provided with brokers’ reports and feedback from any shareholder 
meetings on a regular basis.
To help facilitate dialogue with shareholders, the Investors section of 
the Company’s website includes details of Regulatory News Service 
announcements, press releases, presentations, webcasts and other 
relevant Company and shareholder information.
Constructive use of the Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting (AGM) is usually attended by all members 
of the Board and by a representative of the external auditor. At the AGM 
held in May 2017, the Chief Executive Officer made a short business 
presentation. Shareholders were invited to ask questions during the 
meeting and had the opportunity to meet the Directors and other 
members of senior management before and after the formal meeting. 
The results of the proxy voting on all resolutions were released to the 
London Stock Exchange and published on the Group’s website as soon 
as practicable after the meeting.

Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
  Annual Report 2017 Morgan Advanced Materials 63 Chairman’s introduction
I am pleased to present my first Report of the Audit Committee for Morgan 
Advanced Materials plc, having joined the Company on 31 July 2017 when 
Rob Rowley stepped down from the Board. During the year the Committee 
has carried out its primary function of ensuring the integrity of the financial 
reporting and audit processes and the maintenance of sound internal control 
and risk management processes. The Committee continues to address 
changes in governance and reporting requirements and to respond to the 
ongoing challenges of ensuring consistent and robust financial controls across 
a global business which is going through a process of change as it executes its 
strategic priorities. 
I would like to highlight a number of key areas of focus for the Committee 
in 2017:
 > Continued to oversee the internal audit function, including the scope, 
purpose and resource of the function, its programme of work and the 
status of actions arising from audit findings, including their relative risk 
and progress in resolving them. At its meeting in June, the Committee 
approved a new Audit Charter which sets out the scope and role of 
the function, the implementation of which has led to greater clarity 
over the sources of assurance available to the Board and Committee. 
We also endorsed a further improvement to the internal audit 
function’s processes in the year, in the implementation of a revised 
audit methodology, which has led to more consistent and effective 
delivery of audits.
 > Continued to closely monitor our internal controls and received a 
presentation from each Division (including, in December, from each 
of the three separate business units within the Carbon and Technical 
Ceramics Division) on their internal controls and risk management. 
The presentations were delivered by Divisional and business unit 
management, as appropriate, which gave the Committee the 
opportunity to ask questions face to face and gain a real insight into 
the internal control environment and risk management approach of 
our businesses. Where issues were reported, the Committee gave 
full consideration to the cause, potential or actual impact and response 
by management.
 > Approved the appointment of a new Director of Ethics & Compliance, 
to develop and implement a strategy to drive forward our approach 
to ethical business conduct, as well as to provide strategic oversight, 
management and regulatory guidance to ensure the Group’s 
operations are conducted in compliance with global and local 
regulations (see page 40 of the Strategic Report for further 
information).
 > Reviewed the Group’s tax strategy prior to approval by the Board, 
as published on the Company’s website from December 2017.
 > Reviewed preparations and the action plan for the implementation of 
a number of the OECD’s proposed action points on Base Erosion and 
Profit Shifting (BEPS), noting in particular key impact items and potential 
impact items (see page 29 for further information on tax risk) reviewed 
the key accounting judgements made by executive management, taking 
into account the views of the external auditor. The key areas of significant 
judgement in relation to the 2017 financial statements were in respect 
of specific adjusting items, intangible asset impairment testing, provisions 
and contingent liabilities and tax balances and these are set out in detail 
on page 66 within this Committee Report.
 > Reviewed and updated the Audit Committee’s terms of reference to 
bring them up to date with recent changes in legislation and best practice.
From my first impressions including meetings with management and the 
external auditor, and with additional insight from the recent Board and 
Committee performance review, I am satisfied that the Committee is 
continuing to work well, is contributing effectively to the governance 
framework and is fully discharging its responsibilities.

Report of the Audit Committee Meetings
At the end of most meetings, the non-executive Directors who are 
members of the Committee also meet the external auditor, the Head 
of Internal Audit and the Director of Ethics & Compliance, without the 
executive Directors or other members of management present. Between 
meetings, the Chairman of the Audit Committee keeps in contact with 
the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial 
Officer, the Group Financial Controller, the external auditor, the Head 
of Internal Audit and the Director of Ethics & Compliance as necessary.

Group General Counsel and the Director of Ethics & Compliance and 
senior representatives of the external auditor attend meetings by invitation.
The Committee identifies and ensures that it receives the information 
it needs to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities. Training and development 
information is made available to the members of the Audit Committee 
as appropriate.
Audit Committee terms of reference

are wholly compliant with the April 2016 version of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code which applied to the 2017 financial year and consistent 
with the FRC’s revised Guidance on Audit Committees, also published 
in April 2016, as well as with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency

and making recommendations as to the steps to be taken.
The Committee has the authority, in accordance with its terms of reference, 
to investigate any matters and may obtain external advice at the cost of the 
Company, but did not seek or require any such advice during the year. 
Main areas of work in 2017
During 2017, in addition to the areas of work outlined in the Chairman’s 
letter above, the Committee:
 > Reviewed the Group’s half-year and full-year statements prior to Board 
approval.
 > Made a recommendation to the Board that it is appropriate to prepare 
the accounts for the year on a going concern basis.

affecting the financial viability of the Company over that timeframe, 
all for recommendation to the Board.

Public reporting
The Committee, as requested by the Board, considered the Code 
requirement for the Board to make a statement on whether the 
Annual Report and Accounts taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable. The Committee approached this as follows, and:
 > Considered the questions which need to be answered in order to 
evaluate whether the Annual Report and Accounts meets the fair, 
balanced and understandable test.
 > Reviewed the methodology used to construct the narrative sections 
of the Annual Report.
 > Reviewed the disclosure judgements made by the authors of each 
section and considered the overall balance and consistency in the 
Annual Report.
 > Received confirmation from external advisers that all regulatory 
requirements are satisfied.
 > Received confirmation of verification of content from the authors 
of each section.
 > Received confirmation from the Chief Financial Officer that the 
narrative reports and financial statements are consistent.
 > Made a recommendation to the Board to assist it in determining 
whether it is able to make the statement that the Annual Report 
and Accounts taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable.
The significant areas of judgement considered by the Committee in 
relation to the 2017 financial statements, and how these were addressed, 
were as follows: 
 > Specific adjusting items  
In the consolidated income statement, the Group has presented specific 
adjusting items separately in order to provide the best indication of the 
underlying performance of the Group, and details of the nature and 
quantum of the individual items are provided in note 6 to the financial 
statements. These comprise the disposal on 31 March 2017 of the 
UK Electro-ceramics business and the global Rotary Transfer Systems 
business, together with the partial disposal on 30 June 2017 of the 
Diamond Crucible Company Limited to Morgan Crucible India Limited 
in relation to the consolidation of two sites. The Committee fully 
considered the principle of disclosure for specific adjusting items and 
the individual items. Taking into account guidelines issued by the FRC 
and peer group disclosure of similar items, the Committee concluded 
that it is the best way to present the Group’s results.
 > Intangible asset impairment testing 
The latest financial projections and other assumptions support the 
valuation of the intangible assets of the Group. Further information 
on the goodwill generally and the sensitivities associated with the 
impairment calculations are given in note 1 1 to the financial statements.
 > Provisions and contingent liabilities  
The level of provisioning for known and contingent liabilities, including 
those arising from trading, environmental issues and litigation, is an 
issue where management and third-party judgements are important. 
These are addressed by the Committee and the Board discussing with 
various members of senior management the key judgements made, 
supported, where appropriate, by relevant external advice. KPMG LLP 
also reports regularly on all material provisions and contingent liabilities. 
During the year the Group recorded redundancy and restructuring 
provisions in the ordinary course of business totalling £9.5 million, 
which are disclosed separately in note 22 to the financial statements 
to provide investors with additional information to assist in their 
assessment of the Group’s performance. 
 > Tax balances  
Accounting for current and deferred tax involves a range of judgements. 
The Committee and the Board address these issues through reporting 
from the Chief Financial Officer and the Director of Group Tax, 
supported as necessary by external professional advice. 
The Committee reviewed the content of the Annual Report and Accounts 
and advised the Board that, taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy.
Internal financial control and risk management systems
The Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities relating 
to the adequacy and effectiveness of the control environment and risk 
management systems. The Group’s system of internal control has been 
in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of the 
Annual Report.
Through the Audit Committee, the Board reviews the effectiveness 
of the internal control system annually and did so during the year under 
review. This system is consistent with the FRC’s guidance on the internal 
control requirements of the Code. This review covered all material 
controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls, and 
risk management systems. The Audit Committee and Board receive 
regular risk management reports and together they ensure that there are 
adequate internal controls in place and that they are functioning effectively.
The Directors believe that the Group’s system of internal financial controls 
provides reasonable, but not absolute, assurance in the following areas: 
that the assets of the Group are safeguarded; that transactions are 
authorised and recorded in a correct and timely manner; and that such 
controls would prevent and detect, within a timely period, material errors 
or irregularities. The system is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, 
risk and to address key business and financial risks. 
The main features of the Group’s systems for internal control and for 
assessing the potential risks to which the Group is exposed are 
summarised as follows:
 > Control environment  
The Group’s control environment is underpinned by the Group’s 
policy set. This covers financial procedures, environmental, health and 
safety practice, compliance (eg anti-bribery and corruption, and trade 
compliance) and other areas such as IT and HR. There is a Limit of 
Authorities Policy which describes the matters reserved for the Board 
and the delegations granted to the Chief Executive Officer and other 
executives. The Group operates various programmes to continuously 
improve the control environment and management of risk. These

Governance
Report of the Audit Committee continued include the Group’s Responsible Business Programme, which includes 
relevant training, the provision of systems to help businesses manage 
risk consistently, and reporting processes. The external ethics hotline 
is available to employees to raise concerns and all reports made to the 
ethics hotline are investigated by senior management. The Divisional 
and business unit Presidents and other senior operational and functional 
management make an annual statement of compliance to the Board 
confirming that, for each of the businesses for which they are responsible, 
the financial statements are fairly presented in all material respects, 
appropriate systems of internal controls have been developed and 
maintained, and the businesses comply with Group policies and 
procedures or have escalated known exceptions to an appropriate level 
of management. In addition, the Audit Committee receives an annual 
presentation on business risk and internal controls from both Divisions.
 > Financial reporting  
Risk management systems and internal controls are in place in relation 
to the Group’s financial reporting processes and the process for preparing 
consolidated accounts. These include policies and procedures which 
require the maintenance of records which accurately and fairly reflect 
transactions and disposal of assets, provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to allow the preparation of 
financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS), and the review and reconciliation of reported data. 
Representatives of the businesses are required to certify that their 
reported information gives a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the business and its results for the period. The Audit Committee 
is responsible for monitoring these risk management systems and 
internal controls.
 > Performance monitoring  
There are regular meetings of the Board and of the Executive 
Committee. A comparison of forecast and actual results is considered, 
including cash flows and comparisons against budget and the prior year. 
Divisional management teams also meet regularly to review performance. 
The members of the Executive Committee also visit sites regularly.
 > Risk management  
The Board has undertaken a robust annual assessment of the Group’s 
principal risks. The identification, assessment and reporting of risks 
is an ongoing process carried out in conjunction with operational 
management and steps are taken to mitigate and manage all material 
risks including those relating to the Group’s business model, solvency 
and liquidity. The Board, either directly or through the Audit 
Committee, receives updates on risks, internal controls and future 
actions from both Divisional and Group perspectives. The Executive 
Committee collectively reviews risk management and internal controls 
for all principal Group risks. The Group’s risk management system, 
as set out in the Risk management section on pages 26 to 29, supports 
the going concern statement and the viability statement on page 40.
 > Risk factors 
The Group’s businesses are affected by a number of factors, many 
of which are influenced by macro-economic trends and are therefore 
outside the Company’s immediate control, although, as described 
above and in the Strategic Report, the identification and management 
of such risks is carried out systematically. These are further discussed 
in the Risk management section on pages 26 to 29.
 > Internal audit  
The Group’s internal audit function reviews internal control and risk 
management processes. The Audit Committee approves the annual 
internal audit plan and receives regular reports showing the results of 
the audits. Actions arising from internal audit reviews are agreed with 
management and the Audit Committee monitors progress of any 
outstanding actions. The Head of Internal Audit has direct access to 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee and meets separately with the 
Audit Committee without executive management at least twice a year.
External auditor, including non-audit services policy
The external auditor, KPMG LLP, has processes in place to safeguard 
its independence and objectivity, including specific safeguards where it 
is providing permissible non-audit services, and has confirmed in writing to 
the Audit Committee that, in its opinion, it is independent. After considering 
such procedures, the opinion of the Audit Committee was that the auditor’s 
objectivity and independence were safeguarded despite the provision of a 
limited number of non-audit services by KPMG LLP (see below).
In 2016, following the implementation of the EU Audit Regulation and 
Directive, the Committee approved a revised policy on the provision of 
non-audit services which applied for the 2017 financial year onwards. The 
changes to the policy further reduced the scope of non-audit services the 
external auditor may provide, for example in relation to certain tax matters 
and internal accounting and risk management control reviews relating to 
the preparation and control of financial information. The changes also 
enhanced the process for approval of other permissible services provided 
by the external auditor.
The revised policy on the provision of non-audit services by the external 
auditor is summarised below: 
 > Certain non-audit services may not be provided. The external auditor 
may not: review their own work; make any management decisions; 
create a mutuality of interest; and/or put themselves in the position 
of advocate.
 > Any permissible non-audit work proposed to be placed with the external 
auditor with a total fee between £50,000 and £200,000 must be 
approved in advance by the Chairman of the Audit Committee. Projects 
in excess of £200,000 must be approved in advance by the Audit 
Committee. All permissible non-audit work, regardless of value, must 
be approved by the Group Financial Controller. Work which includes 
multiple phases is treated as a single project for approval purposes.
 > The prior approval of the Audit Committee is required for any non-audit 
work which, when added to the fees paid for other non-audit work, 
would total more than 60% (previously 80%) of the audit fee.
 > The value of non-audit fees must not under any circumstances exceed 
70% of the average Group statutory audit fee incurred in the last three 
consecutive financial years.
In 2017, the proportion of the auditor’s fees for non-audit work relative 
to the audit fee was 8% (2016: 8.0%).
The Committee’s policy is to undertake an annual review of the effectiveness 
of the audit process and of all aspects of the external auditor’s performance 
and independence before determining whether to undertake a formal 
review of the auditor, including a re-tender presentation, or whether 
to put the Group’s audit work out to full third-party tender. 
The Group last changed its auditor in late 2001. The external auditor 
rotated the partner responsible for the Group’s audit work in 2008 and 
2013 and the audit for the 2017 financial year is the last for the current 
partner. Having reviewed the effectiveness of the audit process, and all 
aspects of the service provided by the external auditor, and taking account 
of the assurance given by the external auditor as to its independence, 
the Committee recommended to the Board that a third-party tender 
of the external audit work in 2018 was not desirable. The position would 
be reviewed at least annually, and the Committee anticipated that the 
retender would take place from 2020 onwards, noting that the financial 
year ending 2023 was the last audit KPMG LLP would be permitted to 
perform under the Companies Act 2006. The Company has complied 
with the provisions of the Competition and Markets Authority’s Order 
on statutory audit services.
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
  Annual Report 2017 Morgan Advanced Materials 67 Chairman’s introduction
We announced on 28 April 2017 that Jane Aikman would be joining as 
a non-executive Director on 31 July 2017 when Rob Rowley would step 
down from the Board. 
In relation to this Board change, the Committee evaluated the Board’s 
succession needs, noting Rob Rowley was Chairman of the Audit 
Committee, and also taking into account the challenges and opportunities 
facing the Company as it continues to implement its strategic priorities. 
The Committee worked closely with executive search agents to evaluate 
the skills and experience required to balance the Board and to meet the 
needs of the Company, and additionally noted the requirements of the 
Code and Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules in terms of the 
competence in accounting or auditing and the recent financial experience 
required by at least one member of the Audit Committee. 
Following the creation of a candidate specification, the Committee 
reviewed a list of candidates proposed by the external search agents and 
subsequently conducted a number of interviews with shortlisted candidates. 
The Nomination Committee reviews annually the Board’s size and 
composition in terms of the balance of skills, experience, independence, 
diversity and knowledge considered desirable to oversee the Company’s 
long-term strategy, and remains mindful of the need for proactive and 
long-term succession planning. During the year, the Board discussed the 
Group’s approach to talent management and succession planning at senior 
levels as part of its review of progress on the execution priorities.
There is a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for appointments 
to the Board, which is described in more detail below. Appointments 
are made on merit and against objective criteria, having due regard for 
diversity, including gender. As a Board we value a diversity of outlook, 
approach and style and believe that a balanced Board is better equipped 
to consider matters from a broader perspective. We regard the Board 
performance review as an important means of monitoring our progress 
in the areas covered by this Report and discussed relevant matters 
highlighted during the 2017 evaluation process (see page 62 for full details).

Report of the Nomination Committee Meetings
The Committee met formally twice during 2017. In addition, members 
of the Committee met between scheduled meetings to progress the 
recruitment of the new non-executive Director.
Information and support
The Committee may request the attendance of any other Director or 
member of management, for all or part of any meeting, as it considers 
appropriate.
Nomination Committee terms of reference
The Committee’s terms of reference were reviewed during the year with 
no changes proposed. The terms of reference are available to view on the 
Company’s website.
Main areas of work during 2017
The Nomination Committee regularly reviews the balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience on the Board, succession planning and the 
leadership needs of the Group. The work of the Committee in discharging 
those responsibilities in respect of 2017 included:
 > Reviewing the executive and non-executive leadership needs of 
the Company.
 > Instigating and overseeing the search and selection process in relation 
to the appointment of Jane Aikman as a non-executive Director and 
Chairman of the Audit Committee, including recommending her 
appointment to the Board. 
 > Recommending for approval by the Board, the appointment of 
Laurence Mulliez as Senior Independent Director to replace Douglas 
Caster who stepped down from this role in December 2017.
 > Ensuring, by means of talent discussions at Board meetings, further 
development of management succession and development plans for 
the Executive Committee and senior executives.
 > Considering the Directors’ annual re-election at the 2017 AGM. 
 > Reviewing, for recommendation to the Board, the Board’s policy 
on diversity (see below).
In 2018, the Committee will continue to review succession plans for the Board 
and keep under review relevant development initiatives for the Directors.
Appointments to the Board
Spencer Stuart was retained for the external search for the non-executive 
Director. Spencer Stuart has signed up to the voluntary code of conduct for 
executive search firms, which includes provisions on diversity. Spencer Stuart 
has no other connection with the Company, other than in the search for and 
assessment of candidates for a limited number of senior roles in 2017.
The process for appointing Jane Aikman as a non-executive Director is 
described below:
 > The Committee formulated a candidate specification for the role taking 
into account the balance of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity 
on the Board, and noting that it required a suitable successor to Rob 
Rowley with the requisite skills, experience and background to chair 
the Audit Committee, as well as bring an appropriate level of support 
and challenge to the Board. 
 > The external search agents produced a long-list of candidates for the role.
 > Interviews with members of the Nomination Committee were held 
with shortlisted candidates.
 > The Committee subsequently selected Jane Aikman as its preferred 
candidate based on objective criteria and recommended her 
appointment to the Board. The Board approved the appointment of 
Jane Aikman and confirmed a commencement date of 31 July 2017. 
Rob Rowley stepped down from the Board on the same day.
The terms and conditions of appointment of non-executive Directors are 
available for inspection. Non-executive Directors, including the Chairman, 
are asked to confirm that they will allocate sufficient time to meet their 
commitments to the Company and that their other appointments and 
significant time obligations are disclosed to the Board prior to appointment, 
with an indication of the level of time commitment involved. The Board is 
informed of any subsequent changes with additional commitments 
disclosed before they are accepted. 
Senior leadership and succession planning
One of the Company’s strategic execution priorities, which remains 
a key area of focus, is to increase investment in people management 
and development. The Board discussed the Group’s approach to talent 
management and succession planning at senior levels in September 2017 
as part of its review of progress on the strategic execution priorities. 
The rollout of a new leadership framework in 2017 aimed to ensure the 
right talent and associated processes were in place to execute the strategy 
successfully and to further the development of current and future potential 
leaders (see the Increasing investment in people management and 
development section of the Strategic Report on pages 24 to 25 and pages 
52 to 53). The Board noted a number of actions and initiatives introduced 
to help build stronger and more capable leaders, including defining 
behavioural expectations through identified leadership behaviours, 
modifying the approach to senior recruitment and improving linkage of 
reward and performance. The Board also noted progress to date in 
creating an enhanced performance culture and addressing the succession 
pipeline, including the promotion of diversity. 
Board Diversity Policy 
The Board recognises the importance of diversity at all levels of the 
Company. As reflected in recent appointments, a considerable number 
of factors are taken into consideration in the recruitment process for 
the Board, including international, industrial and professional experience, 
diversity of perspective, including background, nationality, outlook, 
approach and gender, and the blend of skills around the Board table. 
During the selection process for new non-executive Directors, the 
Committee uses a search agent who has signed up to the voluntary 
code of conduct for executive search firms, which ensures that diversity 
is considered when developing a candidate pool. 
The Board monitors closely whether it is taking diversity in its broadest 
sense into account when planning executive succession and appointing 
new Board members, and the Board performance review process 
considers diversity.
When monitoring the development of leadership and considering the 
succession planning for executive management, the Board will take into 
account diversity as well as the need for talented leaders with the skills to 
both lead a global company with a presence in the key world economies 
and manage the associated macro-economic challenges.
In terms of progress in promoting diversity in the year, and without setting 
any targets, three of the seven Board Directors are female (up from two 
in 2016) equating to 43% female representation on the Board and over 
half of the non-executive Directors. Of these, one is Senior Independent 
Director and one is Chairman of the Audit Committee. These appointments 
demonstrate the Board’s commitment to greater diversity. At 31 December 
2017 , 15% (2016: 14% and 2015: 13%) of senior managers are female. At the 
graduate recruitment level, the Group successfully attracts a diverse group of 
good candidates. In 2017 , 32% (2016: 37% and 2015: 41%) of the graduate 
intake were female and the 2017 cohort was represented by 10 nationalities 
(2016: 8 and 2015: 5). 
The Committee takes diversity into account in broader discussions on 
succession planning and talent development and supports management 
in their wider commitment to promoting diversity. 
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
  Annual Report 2017 Morgan Advanced Materials 69 I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for the year ended 
31 December 2017. 
2017 has seen significant progress in the implementation of the Group’s 
new strategy, with Morgan investing in sustainable, long-term growth as 
well as implementing portfolio re-shaping as first outlined by Pete Raby 
in February 2016. The Remuneration Committee has kept the 
Remuneration Policy under review, to ensure it remains fit for purpose 
and continues to support strategy development and execution and to 
maximise returns to shareholders. The Remuneration Committee 
concluded that our incentives continue to achieve this aim, whilst also 
ensuring the continued focus on the quality of performance across the 
year as well as the year end result. 
In summary, the main developments in terms of how we have 
implemented our Remuneration Policy in 2017 are as follows:
 > Implementation of a holding period following vesting of the Long-Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP) for executive Directors.
 > Implementation of a deferred bonus plan whereby 67% of the annual 
bonus result is paid in cash and the balance is deferred into shares held 
for a further three years.
Details of the introduction of these measures were provided in the 2016 
Remuneration Report. 
No change is proposed to our approach to implementing our Policy in 2018. 
In reviewing performance in 2017, 71% of maximum bonus will be paid. 
The 2015 LTIP award partially vested, resulting in a 15.4% achievement 
of the maximum.
The Remuneration Committee decided that, taking into account the 
performance of the Group in 2017, labour market conditions and the 
below-median recruitment salary of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), 
the appropriate level of salary increase for the CEO would be 5.05% and 
for the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) it would be 2.00%. There will also be 
an increase to the fees for the Chairman and non-executive Directors of 
2% for 2018.
We have considered performance measures and incentive targets to ensure 
they align with our strategic aims, motivate and reward management for 
delivering sustainable above-peer performance, and support retention.
For the 2018 LTIP cycle, it is proposed to retain the ROIC * measure, first 
introduced in 2017. This measure includes total intangible assets in the 
definition of capital employed. This is felt to be a more complete measure 
of the return on capital employed and so will incentivise better capital 
management across the Group. The range being applied to the ROIC * 
measure remains unchanged at 16%-19%. The relative TSR element 
of the LTIP remains split equally between two comparator benchmarks: 
the constituents of the FTSE All-Share Industrials Index, and a tailored 
group of international sector comparators. The constituents of this sector 
benchmark are shown on page 84 of this Remuneration Report. The EPS 
performance range against multiple relevant reference points (including the 
Group’s strategic plan, external market factors and broker forecasts), 
remains 4%-1 1% pa. 
During the year, the Committee met four times, and its activities included:
 > A review of the Group’s Remuneration Policy and how its 
implementation can best support the Group’s business strategy.
 > A review of external benchmarking of executive remuneration 
packages.
 > Determination of the remuneration packages for the executive 
Directors and other Group executives.
 > A review of whether the measures for the bonus and share incentive 
schemes remain appropriate.
 > Determination of appropriate performance targets for bonus and share 
incentive schemes.
 > Determination of whether 2017 targets for the bonus and share 
incentive schemes were achieved.
This Report is consistent with the current reporting regulations for 
executive remuneration. In addition, we have introduced an ‘At a glance’ 
section to the Report, providing a summary of the key elements of 
executive Director remuneration. I hope we have been successful in 
continuing to achieve the clarity and transparency that will be of help 
to our shareholders.

This Report covers the period 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017 and provides details of the Remuneration Committee and Remuneration Policy 
of Morgan Advanced Materials plc, and how that Policy has been implemented for the year under review and will be implemented for the coming year. 
During the year under review, the Company has complied with the principles and provisions relating to Directors’ remuneration in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and this Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Large & Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. This includes the malus and clawback provisions for short- and long-term incentives 
granted since 2016, as detailed in last year’s Remuneration Report. In accordance with Section 439A of the Companies Act an advisory resolution to 
approve the Annual Report on Remuneration will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 1 1 May 2018.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee determines and agrees with the Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration, including pension rights 
and any compensation payments, of the Group’s executive Directors and the Chairman. The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
Group’s website.
The Remuneration Committee consults the CEO and invites him to attend meetings when appropriate. The Group Human Resources Director attends 
meetings of the Committee by invitation. The Committee also had access to advice from the CFO. The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the 
Committee. No executive Director or other attendee is present when his or her own remuneration is being discussed.
Membership of the Committee is shown on page 79.
1. Policy report
Key principles of the executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that all the remuneration packages offered by Morgan are competitive and designed to promote the 
long-term success of the Company by ensuring that we are able to attract, retain and motivate executive Directors and senior executives of the right 
calibre to create value for shareholders. 
The policy of the Committee is to ensure that a significant proportion of the total remuneration opportunity is performance-related, with an appropriate 
balance between short- and long-term performance, and is based on the achievement of measurable targets that are relevant to, and support the 
business strategy. 
The Remuneration Committee will keep the Remuneration Policy under periodic review to ensure it remains aligned with the Group’s strategy, and in 
line with the principles set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code in relation to Directors’ remuneration. This includes ensuring that performance-
related elements are transparent, stretching and rigorously applied, as well as reflecting the guidance of institutional investors and their representative 
bodies.
Summary of Morgan Advanced Materials plc’s Remuneration Policy for executive Directors
This section of the Report sets out the current Remuneration Policy for executive Directors and non-executive Directors. This Policy remains unchanged 
from that which was approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM and which is effective for a period of up to three years from that date. The only 
amendments to the Policy Report published in the 2016 annual report are:
 > To update the data used in the pay-for-performance scenario analysis to provide figures for 2018.
 > To remove references to pension arrangements for executive Directors who joined before 1 August 201 1 (as both executive Directors joined after 
this date).
 > To remove references to the move from ROCE* to ROIC* in the LTIP from 2017 onwards.
 > To update page references.

Base salary
Provides the fixed

remuneration 
package. Set at 
competitive levels 
against the market.
Base salaries are generally reviewed each 
January, with reference to the salary levels 
at companies of similar sector, size and 
complexity. The Committee also 
considers individual contribution and the 
range of salary increases applying across 
the Group when determining increases.
Base salary increases are applied in line 
with the outcome of the annual review. 
Salaries in respect of the year under 
review (and for the following year) 
are disclosed in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
Salary increases for executive Directors 
will normally be within the range of 
increases for the general employee 
population over the period of this Policy. 
Where increases are awarded in excess of 
those for the wider employee population, 
for example in instances of sustained 
strong individual performance, if there 
is a material change in the responsibility, 
size or complexity of the role, or if an 
individual was intentionally appointed on a 
below-market salary, the Committee will 
provide the rationale in the relevant year’s 
Annual Report on Remuneration.

Benefits values vary by role and are 
reviewed periodically relative to market.
It is not anticipated that the cost of 
benefits provided will change materially 
year on year over the period for which 
this Policy will apply.
The Committee retains the discretion 
to approve a higher cost in exceptional

criteria have been met, up to 67% of the 
resulting annual bonus is paid in cash. The 
remaining balance is deferred into shares 
and released after a further period of 
three years, subject to continued 
employment only.
Cash and deferred share bonuses 
awarded for performance in 2016 
onwards will be subject to malus and 
clawback. Further details of our Malus and 
Clawback Policy are set out at the end of

Long-Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Aligns the interests 
of executives and 
shareholders by 
delivering shares to 
executive Directors 
and other senior 
executives as a 
reward for 
outstanding long-term 
performance.
The Remuneration Committee has the 
authority each year to grant an award 
under the LTIP.
The award levels and performance 
conditions on which vesting depends are 
reviewed prior to the start of each award 
cycle to ensure they remain appropriate.
For awards made in 2016 onwards, 
vested shares may be subject to a 
post-vesting holding period. Details of 
any such holding period will be disclosed 
in the Annual Report on Remuneration 
for the year in which the relevant award 
is made.
Awards are subject to malus and/or 
clawback for a period of five years from 
the date of grant. Further details of our 
Malus and Clawback Policy are set out 
at the end of this table.
The LTIP provides for a conditional award 
of shares up to an annual limit of 250% 
of salary.
25% of an award vests for achievement 
of the threshold level of performance.
The vesting of awards is usually 
subject to continued employment 
and the Group’s performance over a 
three-year performance period. This 
is currently based on a combination 
of TSR, EPS and ROIC* measures.
The Committee has discretion to 
extend the performance period and 
adjust the measures, their weighting, 
and performance targets prior to the 
start of each cycle to ensure they 
continue to align with the Group’s 
strategy.
Further details of the measures 
attached to the LTIP awarded in the 
year under review (and the coming 
year) are set out in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration on pages 
70 to 89.

Governance
Remuneration report continued Malus and Clawback Policy
Malus and clawback will apply on the annual bonus and LTIP (as set out on page 74) in cases of misconduct or material misstatement in the published 
results of the Group or where, as a result of an appropriate review of accountability, a participant has been deemed to have caused in full or in part 
a material loss for the Group as a result of reckless, negligent or wilful actions or inappropriate values or behaviour. Cash bonuses will be subject 
to clawback, with deferred shares subject to malus over the deferral period. LTIP awards are subject to malus over the vesting period and clawback 
from the vesting date to the fifth anniversary of grant.
Payments under existing awards
The Company will honour any commitment entered into, and Directors will be eligible to receive payment from any award granted, prior to the approval 
and implementation of the current Remuneration Policy detailed in this Report (ie before 6 May 2016), even if these commitments and/or awards fall 
outside the above Policy. The Company will also honour any commitment entered into at a time prior to an individual becoming a Director if, in the 
opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company. Details of these awards are, 
and will be, disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Difference in policy between executive Directors and other employees
The Remuneration Policy for other employees is based on principles broadly consistent with those described in this Report for the executive Directors. 
Annual salary reviews across the Group take into account business performance, local pay and market conditions, and salary levels for similar roles in 
comparable companies. All executives are eligible to participate in an annual bonus scheme. Opportunities and performance measures vary by organisational 
level, geographical region and an individual’s role. Other senior executives participate in the LTIP on similar terms to the executive Directors, although award 
sizes and performance measures may vary according to each individual, and by organisational level. Below this level, executives are eligible to participate in 
the LTIP and other share-based incentives by annual invitation. 
Use of discretion
To ensure fairness and align executive Director remuneration with underlying individual and Group performance, the Committee may exercise its 
discretion to adjust, upwards or downwards, the outcome of any short- or long-term incentive plan payment (within the limits of the relevant Plan Rules) 
for corporate or exceptional events including, but not limited to: corporate transactions, changes in the Group’s accounting policies, minor or 
administrative matters, internal promotions, external recruitment, terminations, etc. Any adjustments in light of corporate events will be made 
on a neutral basis, to not be to the benefit or detriment of participants.
Any use of discretion by the Committee during the financial year under review will be detailed in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration.
Performance measure selection
The Committee considers carefully the selection of performance measures at the start of each performance cycle, taking into consideration the 
macro-economic environment as well as specific Group strategic objectives. 
Annual bonus measures are selected to closely reinforce the Group’s short-term KPIs. Because these can change from year to year (in line with 
the Remuneration Policy), information on the rationale for the selection of bonus measures for each year has been moved to the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
LTIP performance measures are reviewed periodically to ensure they continue to align with the Company’s strategy, as well as provide an appropriate 
balance between growth and returns, internal and external performance, and absolute and relative performance.
For 2018 awards, the TSR element of the LTIP award will continue to comprise two parts. One half of the TSR element will vest subject to the Group’s 
performance relative to a TSR benchmark comprising the 109 constituents of the FTSE All-Share Industrials Index. This benchmark is robust to merger 
and acquisition activity and comprises companies that are subject to the same market influences as Morgan Advanced Materials plc. The remaining half of 
the TSR element will vest subject to Morgan’s performance relative to a TSR benchmark comprising 16 listed international carbon, ceramics and other 
materials companies. This benchmark was selected to complement the FTSE All-Share Industrials Index with a group of companies that better reflect 
Morgan’s business, the markets in which Morgan operates and the geographical footprint of the Group. For each part of the TSR award, the vesting 
performance range is calibrated to be stretching and in line with common market practice for FTSE TSR-based long-term incentives.
EPS targets are set taking account of multiple relevant reference points, including internal forecasts, external expectations for future EPS performance 
at both Morgan Advanced Materials plc and its closest sector peers, and typical EPS performance ranges at other FTSE 350 companies. LTIP EPS 
performance ranges are set to represent demanding and challenging performance targets over the three-year performance period.
For 2018, it is proposed to continue to use ROIC* (first introduced to the 2017 LTIP cycle). The Board considers ROIC* to be the most appropriate 
measure of value creation because it measures the efficiency of Morgan’s total capital base. For the 2018 LTIP cycle, ROIC* will continue to be calculated 
as follows:
EBITA * pre-specific adjusting items
12-month average (third-party working capital + total fixed assets + total intangible fixed assets)
ROIC * targets are set using a similar approach to the EPS targets, after consideration of external reference points and reflecting the returns required to 
meet and exceed the Group’s internal strategic plan.
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
  Annual Report 2017 Morgan Advanced Materials 75 Share ownership guidelines
In order to encourage alignment with shareholders, individual shareholding guidelines are operated for executive Directors. Under such guidelines, 
executive Directors are encouraged to build and maintain over time a shareholding in the Company equivalent to at least 200% of basic salary.
Current executive Director shareholdings are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 86. 
External appointments
With the approval of the Board in each case, and subject to the overriding requirements of the Group, executive Directors may accept external 
appointments as non-executive Directors of other companies and retain any fees received. Details of external directorships held by executive Directors 
along with fees retained are provided on page 83.

Peter Turner (CFO)
Potential reward opportunities illustrated above are based on the Policy, which was approved at the 2016 AGM, applied to the annual base salary in effect 
at 1 January 2018. For the annual bonus, the amounts illustrated are those potentially receivable in respect of performance for 2018 (before mandatory 
deferral into shares). The LTIP is based on the face value of awards to be granted in 2018 (150% of salary). It should be noted that any awards granted 
under the LTIP in a year do not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant. This illustration is intended to provide further information 
to shareholders on the relationship between executive pay and performance. The value of the LTIP assumes no increase in the underlying value of the 
shares, and actual amounts delivered will be further influenced by changes in factors such as the Company’s share price and the value of dividends paid. 
The following assumptions have been made in compiling the above charts:
Scenario Annual bonus LTIP Fixed pay
Stretch Maximum annual bonus. Performance warrants full vesting 
(100% of the award).
Latest disclosed base salary, 
pension and benefits.
Target On-target annual bonus. Performance warrants threshold 
vesting (25% of the award).
Below threshold No annual bonus payable. Nil vesting.
Details of executive Directors’ service contracts
The executive Directors are employed under contracts of employment with Morgan Advanced Materials plc. Contracts may be terminated on 
12 months’ notice given by the Company or on six months’ notice given by the executive Director concerned. The following table shows the date

Governance
Remuneration report continued Exit Payments Policy
The Group’s policy on exit payments is to limit severance payments on termination to pre-established contractual arrangements comprising base salary 
and any other statutory payments only. In the event that the employment of an executive Director is terminated, any compensation payable will be 
determined in accordance with the terms of the service contract between the Company and the employee, as well as the rules of any incentive plans.
The Group may terminate the employment of an executive Director by making a payment in lieu of notice equal to base salary, together with the fair 
value of any other benefits to which the executive is contractually entitled under his or her service agreement, for the duration of the notice period.
The Remuneration Committee will exercise discretion in making appropriate payments in the context of outplacement, settling legal claims or potential 
legal claims by the departing executive Director, including any other amounts reasonably due to the executive Director, for example, to meet the legal 
fees incurred by the executive Director in connection with the termination of employment, where the Company wishes to enter into a settlement 
agreement and the individual must seek independent legal advice.
On termination of an executive Director’s service contract, the Remuneration Committee will consider the departing Director’s duty to mitigate his 
or her loss when determining the timing of when any payment in lieu of notice will be made. There is no automatic entitlement to bonus or the vesting 
of long-term incentives on termination. However, the table that follows summarises the Policy on how awards under the annual bonus and LTIP will 
normally be treated in specific circumstances, with the final treatment remaining subject to Committee discretion:
Treatment of awards on cessation of employment and a change of control
Reason for cessation Calculation of vesting/payment Time of vesting
Annual bonus
All reasons The Committee may determine that a bonus is payable on cessation of 
employment, and the Committee retains discretion to determine that the 
bonus should be paid wholly in cash. The amount of bonus payable will be 
determined in the context of the time served during the performance year, 
the performance of the Group and of the individual over the relevant 
period, and the circumstances of the Director’s loss of office. If Group or 
individual performance has been poor, or if the individual’s employment 
has been terminated in circumstances amounting to misconduct, no bonus 
will be payable.
 
Mandatory deferred bonus share awards
Injury, disability, death, redundancy, 
retirement, or other such event as 
the Committee determines
Awards will normally vest in full (ie not pro-rated for time). At the normal vesting date, 
unless the Committee decides 
that awards should vest earlier 
(eg in the event of death).
Change of control Awards will normally vest in full (ie not pro-rated for time). Awards may 
alternatively be exchanged for equivalent replacement awards, where 
appropriate.
On change of control.
All other reasons Awards normally lapse. Not applicable.
LTIP awards 
Injury, disability, death, redundancy, 
retirement, or other such event as 
the Committee determines
Awards will normally be pro-rated for time and will vest based on 
performance over the original performance period (unless the Committee 
decides to measure performance to the date of cessation).
At the normal vesting date, 
unless the Committee decides 
that awards should vest earlier 
(eg in the event of death).
Change of control LTIP awards will be pro-rated for time and will vest subject to performance 
over the performance period to the change of control. 
LTIP awards may alternatively be exchanged for equivalent replacement 
awards, where appropriate.
On change of control.
All other reasons Awards normally lapse. Not applicable.
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion, where permitted by the scheme rules, to alter these default provisions on a case-by-case basis, 
following a review of circumstances and to ensure fairness for both shareholders and participants.

Consideration of employment conditions
The Group seeks to promote and maintain good relations with employee representative bodies – including trade unions and works councils – as part 
of its broader employee engagement strategy, and consults on matters affecting employees and business performance as required in each case by law 
and regulation in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. In making remuneration decisions, the Remuneration Committee also considers the 
pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group, but the Committee does not currently consult with employees specifically on the executive 
Remuneration Policy and framework. Prior to the annual salary review, the Remuneration Committee is briefed by the Director of Group Human 
Resources about pay increase data that individual business units will consider when deciding local pay awards for their specific businesses and countries. 
This also forms part of the considerations for determining executive Director remuneration. 
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee considers shareholder views received during the year and at the AGM each year, as well as guidance from investor representative bodies 
more broadly, in shaping its Remuneration Policy. The Committee keeps the Remuneration Policy under regular review, to ensure it continues to 
reinforce the Group’s long-term strategy, and aligns executive Directors’ interests with those of shareholders. It is the Remuneration Committee’s policy 
to consult with major shareholders prior to any major changes to its executive Remuneration Policy.
2. Annual report on remuneration
The following section provides details of how the Remuneration Policy was implemented during the year.
Remuneration Committee membership in 2017
The Remuneration Committee is currently composed of five non-executive Directors. Each of the non-executive Directors is regarded by the Board 
as independent, except the Chairman of the Company who was considered independent upon appointment. The Remuneration Committee met four 
times during the year. Attendance at meetings by individual members is detailed in the Corporate Governance Report on page 59.

The figures have been calculated as follows:
1.   Base salary: amount earned for the year. The 2016 remuneration figure for Peter Turner reflects the amount earned from when he joined the Group 
on 1 1 April 2016.
2.  Benefits: the taxable value of benefits received in the year. Includes private medical insurance and a company car (or car allowance).
3.   Annual bonus: the total bonus earned on performance during the year. 
4.   LTIP: the estimated value on 31 December 2017 of 2015 LTIP shares vesting in 2018 subject to performance over the three-year period ended 
31 December 2017. Figure based on the average share price for the three months to 31 December 2017 of 319.29p. Peter Turner did not participate 
in the 2015 LTIP as he joined the Group in 2016.
5.   Pension: the figure is a cash allowance of 20% of base pay in lieu of pension. 
6.   Other: for Pete Raby comprises the value of Sharesave options granted in the year, based on the embedded value at grant (20% of the grant-date 
share price multiplied by the number of options granted). Full details of executive Director Sharesave options are available on pages 87 to 88 of the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
Incentive outcomes for the year ended 31 December 2017
Annual bonus in respect of 2017 performance
Targets for the annual bonus are set by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the short- and long-term requirements of the Group. 
Challenging goals are set, which must be met before any bonus is paid. This approach is intended to align executive reward with shareholder return 
by rewarding the achievement of ‘stretch’ targets.
For 2017, the bonus targets for the executive Directors were split between Group EBITA* before restructuring (weighted 40%), cash generation* 
(weighted 40%) and individual strategic personal objectives (weighted 20%). The targets were set to incentivise the executive Directors to deliver 
stretching profit and cash performance for the Group. 
In addition to the achievement of the targets set, in considering any awards to be made, the Committee also takes into account the quality of the overall 
performance of the Group.
The table that follows sets out retrospectively the assessment of performance relative to the 2017 bonus targets for the executive Directors. Actual bonus 
payments are shown in the single total figure of remuneration table above.

1.   For both the EBITA* and cash generation* metrics, there was a straight-line payout between the threshold and maximum figures and all figures were calculated using 
2017 budgeted exchange rates.
2.   Not withstanding the excellent performance as a whole for cash generation*, three of the quarterly cash targets, introduced in 2017, were missed. As a result, pay out 
of this element was reduced from 100% to 70%.
Pete Raby’s personal objectives were based on seven main priorities: (1) drive improvement in the safety culture and behaviours for the Group, 
(2) talent management, (3) review the top level structure of the business, (4) technology priorities and performance, (5) sales effectiveness, (6) portfolio 
management and (7) operational improvements. Payout of this element was adjudicated at 76.7% of the maximum, reflecting that Pete delivered against 
the majority of these priorities during 2017. This notably included the development of the talent pool, the delivery of operational improvements across 
the Group and the review and development of the top level structure of the Group and wider organisation to support strategy execution, optimise 
capability levels and enhance growth.
Peter Turner’s personal objectives were based on six main priorities: (1) drive improvement in the safety culture and behaviours for the Group, (2) strengthen 
financial controls (3) support operational improvement, (4) execute pension strategy, (5) develop the finance team and (6) improve cash management. 
Payout of this element was adjudicated at 76.7% of the maximum, reflecting that Peter delivered against the majority of these objectives. This notably included 
the strengthening of financial controls across the Group and the execution of the pension strategy. Further, Peter Turner supported the continued development 
of the Group corporate strategy and execution against that, partnering with the CEO. 
2015 LTIP award vesting 
Awards granted to executive Directors in 2015 were subject to relative TSR performance, EPS growth and Group ROCE* over a three-year period 
ended 31 December 2017. The EPS target (applying to one-third of each award) required three-year EPS growth of 6% per annum for 30% of that 
element to vest, rising to full vesting for EPS growth of 15% pa or higher. Over the period Morgan Advanced Materials plc’s actual EPS growth was 
below threshold and accordingly none of the EPS element of the award will vest under this criterion.
The TSR target (applying to one-third of each award) required Morgan Advanced Materials plc’s three-year TSR performance to rank at median against 
constituents of the FTSE All-Share Industrials Index for 30% of that element to vest, rising to full vesting if Morgan Advanced Materials plc’s TSR ranked 
at or above the upper quartile against this Index. Morgan Advanced Materials plc’s TSR was 23.6%, which was at the 37th percentile versus the FTSE 
All-Share Industrials Index. Accordingly, none of the TSR element of the award will vest under this criterion. 
The Group ROCE* target (applying to the remaining one-third of each award) required three-year Group ROCE* of 27% for 30% of that element to 
vest, rising to full vesting for Group ROCE* of 33% or higher. Morgan Advanced Materials plc’s Group ROCE* was 28.4%, which resulted in 46.3% of 
this element vesting. 
This combined performance resulted in a partial vesting of the 2015 awards based on 15.4% achievement of maximum.

2015 recruitment award to Pete Raby
As disclosed in the 2015 Remuneration Report, an award of 1 14,351 Ordinary shares in the Company (valued on the date of award at £400,000, 
calculated using the share price on 3 August 2015 of £3.4980) was made to Pete Raby on 3 August 2015 in connection with his recruitment. This award 
was granted in accordance with the Recruitment Policy, and was made in recognition of the fair value of incentive awards which he forfeited on leaving 
his former employer. The second tranche of this award (comprising 57,175 shares) vested on 31 December 2017. There were no performance conditions 
attached to this award, reflecting the structure of the award forfeited by Pete Raby on joining Morgan.

Governance
Remuneration report continued The Committee discusses and reviews the performance criteria for new three-year LTIP awards before they are granted. For the awards granted in 2017, 
the Committee considered the balance of measures in light of the Group’s business plan and shareholder feedback, and decided to maintain the equal 
(one-third) weighting of the three performance criteria. 
For the 2017 LTIP award, the TSR element was split into two parts. One-half of this element will vest based on Morgan’s TSR performance relative to 
the constituents of the FTSE All-Share Industrial Index (comprising 1 15 companies) and one-half will vest based on Morgan’s TSR performance relative 
to a tailored comparator group of 16 industry comparators. 
The table below sets out the targets attaching to the 2017 LTIP awards:
TSR vs FTSE All-Share 
Industrials Index

For executive Directors, a two-year holding period was introduced in relation to the 2017 LTIP. Dividends accrue over the vesting period and are paid on 
any shares that vest.
2017 Deferred Bonus Plan awards
In 2017, 33% of the annual bonus results for Pete Raby and Peter Turner (for performance in the 2016 financial year) were deferred into shares under the 
Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP), in line with Morgan’s Remuneration Policy. The following DBP awards were granted:

The auditor is required to report on this information.
No exit payments were made to executive Directors during the 2017 financial year.
Payments to past Directors
The auditor is required to report on this information.
As disclosed in the 2016 Remuneration Report, Kevin Dangerfield was eligible for a time pro-rated cash bonus for the period 1 January to 31 March 2016. 
The resulting bonus was paid on 28 February 2017.
External appointments 
No external appointments were held by either executive Director in the 2017 financial year.
Implementation of Remuneration Policy for 2018
Base salary
In line with the Remuneration Policy, executive Directors’ salaries were reviewed by the Committee and increased for 2018. The table below shows the 
base salaries in 2017, and those that took effect from 1 January 2018: 
Executive Director Position
Base salary at:
Increase
1 January 
2018

2017
Pete Raby CEO £520,000 £495,000 5.05%
Peter Turner CFO £400,600 £392,700 2.00%
The increase awarded to Pete Raby reflects the Committee’s policy to bring Pete’s salary into line with market over time, reflecting his continued strong 
performance in the role. Future above-inflation increases will continue to be based on Pete Raby’s performance in the role and the performance of the 
Group. The rationale for any future increases will be disclosed in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration.
In agreeing the increase awarded to Peter Turner, the Committee has been mindful of the range of increases to be awarded across the Group  
of 2% – 2.5% on average in 2018, as well as Peter Turner’s strong performance in the role.
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
  Annual Report 2017 Morgan Advanced Materials 83 Pension
Pete Raby and Peter Turner will continue to receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension worth 20% of salary.
Annual bonus in respect of 2018 performance
The maximum bonus opportunity remains at 150% of salary with 33% of any bonus result deferred into shares for a further three-year period. 
The performance measures attached to the annual bonus remain unchanged from 2017, as follows:
EBITA* – 40%
Cash generation* – 40% (measured against quarterly cumulative targets as well as over the complete financial year. For every quarterly target that 
is missed, the payout warranted for full-year performance under this element will be reduced by 10%)
Strategic personal objectives – 20% 
The actual performance targets set at the beginning of the performance period are not disclosed as they are considered commercially sensitive at this 
time, given the close link between performance measures and the Group’s longer-term strategy. This is particularly relevant in the context of some of 
the Group’s close and unlisted competitors who are not required to disclose such information, and for whom the assumptions in our targets would 
provide valuable information in the current trading year. We will disclose these targets retrospectively, at such time as these targets have become less 
commercially sensitive, and within three years of the end of the performance year.
2018 LTIP awards 
In March 2018, Pete Raby and Peter Turner will be granted awards under the 2018 LTIP with face value of 150% of their respective base salaries for 
2018. The three-year performance period over which performance will be measured began on 1 January 2018 and will end on 31 December 2020. 
Further details of the awards will be disclosed in next year’s Report. 
The performance measures are detailed below:
 > The relative TSR element of the LTIP will remain equally split between two comparator benchmarks to ensure the relevance and robustness of the 
TSR element. The two comparator benchmarks are the constituents of the FTSE All-Share Industrials Index and the following tailored group of 
international sector comparators: BASF, Carborundum, Ibiden, Imerys, Krosaki Harima, LyondellBasell, Magnesita, Mersen, Minerals Technologies, 
RHI, SGL Carbon, Sumitomo Chemical, Toyo Tanso, Vesuvius, Victrex and Worley Parsons. 
 > Each TSR element will operate independently, with vesting determined based on Morgan’s TSR rank relative to constituents of each TSR benchmark. 
The performance range for each element will remain median to upper quartile.
 > The EPS and ROIC* performance ranges will remain unchanged, at 4%-1 1% p.a. for EPS and 16%-19% for ROIC*. The Committee believes these 
ranges appropriately support the Group’s strategy for sustainable long-term growth over the next three years whilst continuing to represent suitably 
demanding targets. 
 > For all three measures, awards will continue to vest on a straight-line basis between threshold and maximum, with 25% of each element vesting 
at threshold.
 > For the 2018 LTIP cycle, and in response to shareholder feedback, executive Directors will be required to hold any vested 2018 LTIP awards for an 
additional two-year period. Vested awards that are subject to the holding period will remain subject to clawback in line with our Policy, but will not 
be forfeitable on cessation of employment.
Chairman and non-executive Director fees 
The Chairman’s and non-executive Directors’ fees were reviewed in December 2017. The following fees will apply in 2018:
Role 2017 fee pa 2018 fee pa Increase
Chairman £182,100 £185,750 2.0%
Non-executive Director £47,940 £48,900 2.0%

Remuneration report continued Percentage change in CEO remuneration
The table below shows the percentage change in CEO remuneration (from 2016 to 2017) compared to the average percentage change in remuneration 
for other UK-based employees over the same period. The UK employee workforce was chosen as a suitable comparator group as the CEO is based 
in the UK (albeit with a global role and responsibilities) and pay changes across the Group vary widely depending on local market conditions. Although 
similar remuneration principles apply across the wider Group, pay decisions for this subset are impacted by similar external market forces (eg wage 
inflation, local practice with respect to the provision of benefits, etc.).

Advisers
Kepler was appointed by the Committee in 2010 as its executive remuneration adviser and was retained during the most recent financial year. In 2017, 
Kepler (now branded Mercer Kepler), provided independent advice on performance measurement, the setting of incentive targets, TSR analysis and the 
structure of long-term incentives, and provided market data in respect of senior executive remuneration and non-executive Director fees. Kepler reports 
directly to the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and does not provide any other material non remuneration-related services to the Group (nor 
does Kepler’s parent company, Mercer), and is considered to be independent. 
Kepler is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group’s voluntary Code of Conduct.

Plan Details
2015, 2016, 2017
2015 awards granted to executive Directors are subject to relative TSR, EPS and ROCE*. The EPS target (applying to a third of 
each award) requires three-year EPS growth above a threshold of 6% pa of that element to vest, commencing at 30% vesting 
for that element, and rising to full vesting for EPS growth of 15% pa or higher. The TSR target (applying to another third of each 
award) requires Morgan Advanced Materials’ three-year TSR performance to rank at median against the FTSE All-Share 
Industrials Index for 30% of that element to vest, rising to full vesting if Morgan Advanced Materials’ TSR ranks at or above the 
upper quartile against the companies in this Index. The ROCE* element was set at a 27%-33% range, vesting on a straight-line 
basis, with 30% of the measure vesting at the 27% threshold. ROCE* is measured in the final year of the performance period. 
The 2016 awards were on the same basis as the 2015 awards described above, except that the EPS target range was 4%–1 1% pa. 
The ROCE* target remained at 27%–33%. Also the vesting at threshold for each element reduced from 30% to 25%. The TSR 
element was extended to include two comparator groups as detailed earlier in this Report with vesting at threshold also reduced 
to 25% of that element.
The 2017 awards were on the same basis as the 2016 awards except that the ROCE* measure was replaced by ROIC*, 
as detailed earlier in this Report. The ROIC* range for 2017 was 16%-19%.

Plan Details
LTIP – CSOP
LTIP 2015: The CEO’s award was structured as an Approved Performance Share Plan (APSP) and comprised three elements: 
(i) HMRC-approved options (CSOP) over shares to the value of up to £30,000 with an exercise price of 345 pence per share; 
(ii) an LTIP award in the form of a conditional award of free shares to the value of the remainder of the award above this limit; 
and (iii) a funding award, also in the form of a conditional award of free shares, over such numbers of shares whose value at 
exercise at the approved option equals up to £30,000. 
The provisions of these CSOP options, funding awards and LTIP awards was linked so that the maximum aggregate number

Statutory disclosures 
Amendment of the Articles of Association
The Company’s constitution, known as the Articles of Association 
(the ‘Articles’), is essentially a contract between the Company and 
its shareholders, governing many aspects of the management of the 
Company. It deals with matters such as the rights of shareholders, 
the appointment and removal of Directors, the conduct of the Board 
and general meetings and communications by the Company. 
The Articles may be amended by special resolution of the Company’s 
shareholders and are available on the Company’s website at  
www.morganadvancedmaterials.com.
Appointment and replacement of Directors
The Articles provide that the Company may by ordinary resolution at a 
general meeting appoint any person to act as a Director, provided that 
notice is given of the resolution identifying the proposed person by name 
and that the Company receives written confirmation of that person’s 
willingness to act as Director if he or she has not been recommended by 
the Board. The Articles also empower the Board to appoint as a Director 
any person who is willing to act as such. The maximum possible number 
of Directors under the Articles is 15. The Articles provide that the 
Company may by special resolution, or by ordinary resolution of which 
special notice is given, remove any Director before the expiration of his or 
her period of office. The Articles also set out the circumstances in which 
a Director shall vacate office. The Articles require that at each AGM any 
Director who was appointed after the previous AGM must be proposed 
for election by the shareholders. Additionally, any other Director who 
has not been elected or re-elected at one of the previous two AGMs must 
be proposed for re-election by the shareholders. The Articles also allow 
the Board to select any other Director to be proposed for re-election. 
In each case, the rules apply to Directors who were acting as Directors 
on a specific date selected by the Board. This is a date not more than 
14 days before, and no later than, the date of the Notice of AGM.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the Articles, all the Directors will 
stand for election or re-election on an annual basis in compliance with the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’). Details of 
the skills, experience and career history of Directors in post as at the date 
of this Report, and the Board Committees on which they serve, can be 
found on pages 56 and 57.

declared; to receive the Company’s reports and accounts; to attend and 
speak at general meetings of the Company; to appoint proxies; and to 
exercise voting rights.
Details of the structure of the Company’s Preference share capital and 
the rights attaching to the Company’s Preference shares are set out in 
note 18 on pages 128 to 129. 
No person holds securities in the Company carrying special rights with 
regard to control of the Company. The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between holders of securities that may result in restrictions 
on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
Share allotment and repurchase authorities
The Directors were granted authority at the 2017 AGM to allot shares in 
the Company and to grant rights to subscribe for or convert any securities 
into shares in the Company up to (a) a nominal amount of £23,780,832 
and (b) a nominal amount of £47,561,664 in connection with a rights issue 
(such amount to be reduced by any shares allotted under (a)). This authority 
is due to lapse at the 2018 AGM. At the 2018 AGM, shareholders will be 
asked to grant a similar allotment authority.
Two separate special resolutions will also be proposed to renew the 
Directors’ powers to make non-pre-emptive issues for cash up to an 
aggregate nominal amount representing approximately 5% of the issued 
share capital as at the last practicable date before the publication of the 
2018 Notice of AGM, and an additional 5% of the issued share capital 
which would be for use only in connection with acquisitions and specified 
capital investments.
The Directors sought authority at the 2017 AGM to repurchase shares 
in the capital of the Company up to a maximum aggregate number of 
Ordinary shares of 28,536,998. The Directors will seek to renew this 
authority at the 2018 AGM. 
Employee share and share option schemes

Matching Plan and 416 employees participate in the Company’s UK 
Sharesave scheme. Details of outstanding share awards and share options 
are given in note 21 on page 140 to 151.
All the Company’s share schemes contain provisions relating to a change 
of control. Outstanding options and awards would normally vest and 
become exercisable on a change of control, subject to being pro-rated 
for time and to the satisfaction of any performance conditions at that time.
The Trustees of The Morgan General Employee Benefit Trust (‘the Trust’) 
have absolute and unfettered discretion in relation to voting any shares 
held in the Trust at any general meeting. Their policy is not to vote the 
shares. If any offer is made to shareholders to acquire their shares, the 
Trustees will have absolute and unfettered discretion on whether to accept 
or reject the offer in respect of any shares held by them.

Significant agreements – change of control
The Group has a number of borrowing facilities provided by various 
financial institutions. The facility agreements generally include change 
of control provisions which, in the event of a change in ownership of 
the Company, could result in their renegotiation or withdrawal.
The most significant of such agreements are the UK five-year  
£200 million multi-currency revolving facility agreement, which was 
signed on 17 October 2014, and the privately placed Note Purchase 
and Guarantee Agreements signed on 15 December 2007 and 
27 October 2016, for which the aggregate outstanding loan amounts 
are US$187 million and €60 million.
There are a number of other agreements that would take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover 
bid, such as commercial contracts and joint venture agreements. No such 
individual contract is considered to be significant in terms of its potential 
impact on the business of the Group as a whole.
Post-balance sheet events
There have been no material events since the year end.
Reporting, accountability and audit
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group and parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent 
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law 
they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Accounting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and 
applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice or UK GAAP). 
A new UK GAAP accounting framework introduced by the Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC) became mandatorily effective for the financial 
statements of UK companies in 2015. Under this framework, the 
Company is required to prepare its parent Company financial statements 
on one of the bases permitted by the FRC.
As previously notified, the Company has chosen to adopt FRS 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework, which enables the Company to take advantage of 
the permitted election to utilise the disclosure exemptions allowed under 
FRS 101. The consolidated financial statements of the Group on pages 
100 to 154 are prepared in accordance with EU-adopted IFRSs and 
are unaffected by this accounting framework. The Company proposes to 
continue to adopt the reduced disclosure framework of FRS 101 in its future 
financial statements.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and parent Company financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
 > select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.
 > make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
 > for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU.
 > for the parent Company financial statements, state whether applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the parent Company financial 
statements.
 > prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the parent Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the parent Company and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to 
safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible 
for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, Remuneration Report 
and Corporate Governance Statement that comply with that law and 
those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
In its reporting to shareholders, the Board is satisfied that the Annual 
Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy as required by the Code. 
The Directors as at the date of this Report, whose names and functions 
are set out on pages 56 to 57, confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
 > the Group’s financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and
 > the management report (comprising the Directors’ Report and the 
Strategic Report) includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Group, together 
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware, and that he 
or she has taken all steps that he or she ought to have taken as a Director

Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
  Annual Report 2017 Morgan Advanced Materials 93 1. Our opinion is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Morgan Advanced Materials 
plc (‘the Company’) for the year ended 31 December 2017 which 
comprise the Consolidated income statement, Consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income, Consolidated and company balance sheets, 
Consolidated and company statements of changes in equity, Consolidated 
statement of cash flows, and the related notes, including the accounting 
policies in note 1. 
In our opinion: 
 > the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
 > the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union; 
 > the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with UK accounting standards, including FRS 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework; and 
 > the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK) (‘ISAs (UK)’) and applicable law. Our responsibilities are 
described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion 
is consistent with our report to the audit committee. 
We were appointed as auditor by the directors on 4 October 2001. 
The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the 17 financial years 
ended 31 December 2017. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities 
under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK 
ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed 
public interest entities. No non-audit services prohibited by that standard 
were provided. 
Key audit matters: our assessment of risks 
of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, 
were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and 
include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement 
(whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had 
the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources 
in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. We 
summarise below the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit 
significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with our key 
audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for public 
interest entities, our results from those procedures. These matters were 
addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the 
context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and 
consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters. 
Tax provisioning (£23.0 million (2016: £16.6 million))
Refer to page 66 Audit Committee report, pages 1 18 to 1 19 and 125 to 
126 accounting policy note and financial disclosures.
The risk
Subjective estimate
Accounting for tax contingencies require the directors to make judgements 
and estimates in relation to tax issues and exposures given that the group 
operates in a number of tax jurisdictions, the complexities of transfer 
pricing and other international tax legislation and the time taken for tax 
matters to be agreed with the tax authorities. 
Our response – Our procedures included:
Our tax expertise
Use of our own tax specialists to assess the group’s tax positions, its 
correspondence with the relevant tax authorities, and to analyse and 
challenge the assumptions used to determine the level of tax provisions 
using our knowledge and experiences of the application of the international 
and local legislation by the relevant authorities and courts; and 
Assessing transparency
Assessing whether the Group’s tax disclosures are appropriate and in 
accordance with relevant accounting standards.
Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2017 94
Governance
Independent auditor’s report to the members 
of Morgan Advanced Materials plc Our results
We considered the level of provisioning to be acceptable.
Environmental and other provisions and contingent liabilities 
(£5.0 million (2016: £5.6 million))
Refer to page 66 Audit Committee report, pages 151 and 152 accounting 
policy note and financial disclosures.
Subjective estimate
The amounts involved are potentially significant, and the application of 
accounting standards to determine the amount, if any, to be provided 
as a liability is inherently subjective.
Our response – our procedures included:
Enquiry of lawyers and experts
On all significant legal cases, assessment of correspondence with the 
Group’s external counsel accompanied by formal confirmations from that 
counsel. We assessed the extent to which the Group’s judgements as to 
whether provisions should be recorded and estimates of the amounts are 
a balanced assessment of the latest available information and the accuracy 
and reliability of the sources of that information. 
We challenged judgements made in respect of environmental 
contingencies through discussions with the environmental experts engaged 
by the Group. 
Assessing transparency
Assessing whether the Group’s disclosures about provisions and contingent 
liabilities and the treatment of movements on provisions in the income 
statement for the year were appropriate. 
Our results: We found the liabilities recognised, and the contingent liability 
disclosures made, to be acceptable.
UK Defined Benefit pension obligation (Group: £593.7 million; 2016: 
£588.7 million. Parent Company: £194.6 million; 2016: £194.4 million)
Refer to page 66 Audit Committee report, pages 140 to 149 accounting 
policy note and financial disclosures.
The risk
Subjective valuation
Small changes in the assumptions and estimates used to value the 
UK pension obligation (before deducting scheme assets) would have a 
significant effect on the Group’s and parent company’s net pension deficit.
Our response – Our procedures included:
Benchmarking assumptions
Challenging, with the support of our own actuarial specialists, the key 
assumptions applied, being the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality/
life expectancy against externally derived data; and
Assessing transparency
Considering the adequacy of the Group’s and parent company’s 
disclosures in respect of the sensitivity of the deficit to these assumptions. 
Our results 
We found the valuation of the pension obligation to be acceptable.
We continue to perform procedures over the valuation of acquired 
customer relationship intangible assets. However, following the detailed 
impairment review performed in the prior year and considering 
performance of the GBU during 2017, we have not assessed this as one 
of the most significant risks in our current year audit and, therefore, it is 
not separately identified in our report this year. Likewise, we continue 
to perform procedures over the presentation of specific adjusting items. 
However, following an assessment of the nature of items included in this 
category for 2017, we have not assessed this as one of the most significant 
risks in our current year audit and, therefore, it is not separately identified 
in our report this year. As a result of these changes, the audit procedures 
over the valuation of the UK Defined Benefit pension obligation increased 
in relative significance to our overall audit approach.
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
  Annual Report 2017 Morgan Advanced Materials 95 Our application of materiality and an overview 
of the scope of our audit
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set 
at £3.5 million (2016: £3.5 million), determined with reference to a 
benchmark of group profit before tax, normalised to exclude this year’s 
specific adjusting items as disclosed in note 6, of which it represents 3.9% 
(2016: 3.9%). 
Materiality for the parent company financial statements as a whole was 
set at £3.325 million (2016: £3.5 million), determined with reference 
to a benchmark of Company total assets and chosen to be lower than 
materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole. It represents 
0.3% (2016: 0.4%) of total assets.
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected 
identified misstatements exceeding £0.175 million, in addition to other 
identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
Of the Group’s 1 15 (2016: 1 10) reporting components, we subjected 
25 (2016: 26) to full scope audits for Group purposes and 1 1 (2016: 1 1) 
to specified risk-focused audit procedures, including over revenue, 
inventories, trade and other receivables, employee benefit obligations, 
provisions and taxation. The latter were not individually financially 
significant enough to require a full scope audit for group purposes, 
but did present specific individual risks that needed to be addressed. 
The components within the scope of our work accounted for the following 
percentages of the Group’s results:

The remaining 21% of total group revenue, 26% of Group profit 
before tax and 18% of total group assets is represented by 79 of reporting 
components, none of which individually represented more than 5% of 
any of total group revenue, Group profit before tax or total Group assets. 
For these residual components, we performed analysis at an aggregated 
group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant 
risks of material misstatement within these. 
The Group team instructed component auditors as to the significant 
areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and 
the information to be reported back. The Group team approved the 
component materialities, which ranged from £0.1 million to £2 million, 
having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the 
components. The work on 35 of the 36 components (2016: 36 of the 
37 components) was performed by component auditors and the rest, 
including the audit of the parent company, was performed by the Group 
team. The Group team performed procedures on the items excluded 
from normalised Group profit before tax.
The Group team visited 1 (2016: 4) component locations in the USA 
(2016: UK, USA, Italy and Brazil) to assess the audit risk and strategy. 
Telephone conference meetings were also held with these component 
auditors and all of the other locations that were not physically visited. 
At these visits and meetings, the findings reported to the Group team 
were discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the 
Group team was then performed by the component auditor. 
Our audit of the parent company was undertaken to the materiality level 
specified above and was all performed at the Company’s head office in 
Windsor, UK.

Governance
Independent auditor’s report to the members 
of Morgan Advanced Materials plc continued We have nothing to report on going concern 
We are required to report to you if:
 > we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to 
the directors’ statement in note 1 to the financial statements on the use 
of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties 
that may cast significant doubt over the Group and Company’s use 
of that basis for a period of at least twelve months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements; or 
 > the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 40 
is materially inconsistent with our audit knowledge. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
2. We have nothing to report on the other information 
in the Annual Report 
The directors are responsible for the other information presented in the 
Annual Report together with the financial statements. Our opinion on the 
financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, 
we do not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, the 
information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the financial 
statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work we have 
not identified material misstatements in the other information. 
Strategic report and directors’ report 
Based solely on our work on the other information: 
 > we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report 
and the directors’ report; 
 > in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial 
year is consistent with the financial statements; and 
 > in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006. 
Directors’ remuneration report 
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006. 
Disclosures of principal risks and longer-term viability 
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our financial statements 
audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
 > the directors’ confirmation within the Viability statement that they have 
carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency and liquidity; 
 > the Principal Risks disclosures describing these risks and explaining how 
they are being managed and mitigated; and 
 > the directors’ explanation in the Viability statement of how they have 
assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done 
so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their 
statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or 
assumptions. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Viability statement. 
We have nothing to report in this respect. 
Corporate governance disclosures 
We are required to report to you if: 
 > we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge 
we acquired during our financial statements audit and the directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual report and financial 
statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy; or 
 > the section of the annual report describing the work of the Audit 
Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated 
by us to the Audit Committee.
We are required to report to you if the Corporate Governance Statement 
does not properly disclose a departure from the eleven provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code specified by the Listing Rules for our 
review. 
We have nothing to report in these respects.

  Annual Report 2017 Morgan Advanced Materials 97 We have nothing to report on the other matters on which 
we are required to report by exception 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion: 
 > adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or 
 > the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or 
 > certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or 
 > we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
3. Respective responsibilities 
Directors’ responsibilities 
As explained more fully in their statement set out on pages 92 to 93, the 
Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements 
including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal 
control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and parent Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to 
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud, other irregularities, or error, and to issue our 
opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud, other irregularities or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of the financial statements. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud or other irregularities is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as they may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control and may 
involve any area of law and regulation not just those directly affecting the 
financial statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website 
at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
Irregularities – ability to detect
We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be 
expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from 
our sector experience, through discussion with the directors and 
other management (as required by auditing standards). 
We had regard to laws and regulations in areas that directly affect the 
financial statements including financial reporting (including related company 
legislation) and taxation legislation. We considered the extent of compliance 
with those laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related 
financial statement items.
In addition we considered the impact of laws and regulations in the specific 
area of environmental legislation, recognising the nature of the group’s 
operations. With the exception of any known or possible non-compliance, 
and as required by auditing standards, our work in respect of these was 
limited to enquiry of directors and other management and inspection 
of regulatory and legal correspondence. We considered the effect of 
any known or possible non-compliance in these areas as part of our 
procedures on the related financial statement items. Further detail in 
respect of environmental legislation is set out in the key audit matter 
disclosures in section 2 of this report.
We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team 
and remained alert to any indicators of non-compliance throughout the 
audit. This included communication from the group to component audit 
teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at a group level, with 
a request to report on any indicators of potential existence of non-
compliance with relevant laws and regulations (irregularities) in these 
areas, or other areas directly identified by the component team. 
As with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of 
irregularities, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
or the override of internal controls.
4. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe 
our responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, 
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

  Annual Report 2017 Morgan Advanced Materials 105
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1. Accounting policies, estimates and judgments
Accounting policies
Morgan Advanced Materials plc (the ‘Company’) is a company incorporated in the UK under the Companies Act. The address of the registered office 
is given in ‘Shareholder information’ on page 176. The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries and the nature of the Group’s operations 
are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 10 to 53.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’), and include the Group’s 
interest in associates. The parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group. 
These consolidated financial statements have been drawn up to 31 December 2017. The Group maintains a 12-month calendar fiscal year ending on 
31 December. 
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the EU (‘adopted IFRSs’). The Company has elected to prepare its parent Company financial statements in accordance with Financial 
Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; these are presented on pages 155 to 172.
Where possible the Group has set out individual accounting policies in the note to the consolidated financial statements most relevant to that accounting 
policy, including for property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and specific adjusting items.
Except for the changes set out in the Adoption of new and revised Standards section, the accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently 
to all periods presented in these Group financial statements.
(a) Measurement convention
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative 
financial instruments and financial instruments available-for-sale. 
(b) Functional and presentation currency
The Group financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Company’s functional currency.
(c) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its 
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries 
are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.
(ii) Acquisitions
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the 
Group. The Group measures goodwill as the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred, including the amount of any non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree, less the net of the acquisition-date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent 
liabilities as required by IFRS 3.
Consideration transferred includes the fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the Group to the previous owners of the acquiree, equity 
interests issued by the Group, contingent consideration, and share-based payment awards of the acquiree that are replaced in the business combination. 
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration 
that is not classified as equity is recognised in the income statement. 
Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination, such as finder’s fees, legal fees, due diligence fees and other 
professional and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.
(iii) Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Company has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence 
is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity. Associates are accounted for using the equity 
method and are initially recognised at cost.
(iv) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the 
consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the 
Group’s interest in the associate. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence 
of impairment.  Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2017 106

(d) Foreign currency
(i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to pounds sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign 
exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to pounds sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was 
determined.
(ii) Financial statements of foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to pounds sterling at 
foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to pounds sterling at an average 
rate for the period where this approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange differences arising on 
retranslation since the adoption of IFRS are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. 
(e) Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, other than deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated (see (i) below).
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment 
losses are recognised in the income statement. 
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-
generating units (group of units) and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro-rata basis. 
When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset has been recognised directly in other comprehensive income and there is objective 
evidence that the asset is permanently impaired, the cumulative loss that had been recognised directly in other comprehensive income is recognised in 
profit or loss. A significant or prolonged decline in an available-for-sale financial asset’s fair value below its cost is objective evidence of impairment. The 
amount of the cumulative loss that is recognised in profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost and current fair value, less any impairment 
loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss.
(i) Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of the Group’s investments in receivables carried at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash 
flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate (ie the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition of these financial assets). Receivables 
with a short duration are not discounted. The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In 
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the 
recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
(ii) Reversals of impairment
An impairment loss in respect of a receivable carried at amortised cost and other assets not listed below is reversed if the subsequent increase in 
recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. 
An impairment loss in respect of an investment in an equity instrument classified as available-for-sale is not reversed through profit or loss. If the fair value 
of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss 
was recognised in profit or loss, the impairment loss will be reversed, with the amount of the reversal recognised in profit or loss.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. 
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

1. Accounting policies, estimates and judgments continued
(f) Revenue
Revenue from the sale of goods in the course of ordinary activities is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, 
trade discounts and volume rebates. Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, 
recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management 
involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. If it is probable that discounts will be granted and the amount can be 
measured reliably, then the discount is recognised as a reduction of revenue as the sales are recognised.
(g) Dividends
Dividends payable are recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are declared and approved. 
Dividends declared after the Balance sheet date are not recognised as there is no present obligation at that the Balance sheet date. 
(h) Research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the 
income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved 
products and processes, is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete 
development, use and sale of products or processes. The majority of the expenditure that the Group classifies as research and development relates to 
a gradual evolution of materials, products and processes over time through the activities of the Group’s technology and application engineering teams, 
and can be characterised as incremental in nature, and is therefore not capitalised. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour 
and an appropriate proportion of overheads. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Use of judgements and estimates 
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of 
the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively.
Judgements
Information about judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognised in the consolidated 
financial statements is included in the following notes: 
Note 6: Specific adjusting items
The Group separately presents specific adjusting items in the consolidated income statement which, in the Directors’ judgment, need to be disclosed 
separately by virtue of their size and incidence in order for users of the consolidated financial statements to obtain a proper understanding of the financial 
information and the underlying performance of the business. These include the financial effect of items which occur infrequently, such as major individual 
restructuring projects. Determining whether an item is part of specific adjusting items requires judgment as to whether it meets the Group’s definition 
as detailed in the accounting policy.
Assumptions and estimates
Assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the year ending 31 December 2018 is included in the following notes: 
Note 21: Employee benefits: key actuarial assumptions 
The principal actuarial assumptions applied to pensions are shown in note 21, including a sensitivity analysis. The actuarial evaluation of pension assets and 
liabilities is based on assumptions in respect of inflation, future salary increases, discount rates, returns on investments and mortality rates. Relatively small 
changes in the assumptions underlying the actuarial valuations of pension schemes can have a significant impact on the net pension liability included in the 
balance sheet. Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2017 108

Financial Statements
1. Accounting policies, estimates and judgments continued
Other assumptions and estimates which are not considered to have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities within the next 12 months include:
Taxation
The level of current tax and deferred tax recognised is dependent on the tax rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and on subjective judgments as to 
the outcome of decisions to be made by the tax authorities in the various tax jurisdictions around the world in which the Group operates. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised based on management’s assessment of the extent to which they are recoverable.
The Group periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years open to audit based on the latest information available. The Group records 
its best estimate of these tax liabilities, including related interest charges. Whilst management believes it has adequately provided for the probable outcome 
of these matters, future results may include adjustments to these estimated tax liabilities and the final outcome of tax examinations may result in a 
materially different outcome than that assumed in the tax liabilities. Provisions are made against individual exposures taking into account the specific 
circumstances of each case, including the strengths of technical arguments, past experience with tax authorities, recent case law or rulings on similar 
issues and external advice received.
Note 22: Provisions
Note 22 contains information about provisions. Provisions for closure and restructuring costs, environmental issues and settlement of litigation are 
judgemental by their nature. Amounts provided are the Group’s best estimate of exposure based on currently available information.
Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. This process relies on the use of estimates of the future profitability and cash 
flows of its cash-generating units which may differ from the actual results delivered. In addition, the Group reviews whether identified intangible assets 
have suffered any impairment. Note 1 1 contains information about the assumptions relating to goodwill impairment tests, including a sensitivity analysis.
Credit risk
Note 20 contains information about the Group’s exposure to credit risk, including a sensitivity analysis. The Group establishes both specific and general 
allowances for impairment losses against receivables. The general loss allowance is estimated based on historical data of payment statistics for similar 
financial assets.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic 
Report on pages 10 to 53. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities, are described earlier in the Group 
Financial Review. In addition, note 20 includes the Group’s policies and processes for managing financial risk; details of its financial instruments and hedging 
activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through local banking arrangements underpinned by the Group’s £200 million unsecured 
multi-currency revolving credit facility maturing October 2019. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in 
trading performance and exchange rates, show the Group operating comfortably within its debt financial covenants for the next 12 months.
The current economic climate continues to have an impact on the Group, its customers and its suppliers. The Board fully recognises the challenges 
that lie ahead but, after making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report 
and Accounts.

Adoption of new and revised Standards
The Group did not adopt any new and revised Standards during the year ended 31 December 2017. Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
  Annual Report 2017 Morgan Advanced Materials 109
1. Accounting policies, estimates and judgments continued
New standards and interpretations 
A number of new Standards, amendments to Standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective, and have not been applied in 
preparing the Group’s financial statements. Those which may be relevant to the Group are set out below. The Group has not applied these Standards 
early.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and introduces a new revenue recognition 
model that requires the transaction price receivable from customers to be allocated between the Group’s performance obligations under contracts 
on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. 
The Group has systematically reviewed its customer contracts and its data capture systems capability across the six global business units to assess the 
impact of the new Standard and ensure compliance.
Based on the Group’s review, it is anticipated that there are no significant impacts to the Group as a result of the new Standard. Under IFRS 15 certain 
arrangements will be presented as reductions in revenue or certain reimbursements from customers currently presented in cost of sales will be presented 
as revenue. There will be some changes in timing of recognition, however these are not expected to materially impact the profits of the Group. The 
Group has chosen to apply the Retrospective method to the adoption of the new standard. 
The impacts at the Group level based on our preliminary assessment are presented below:

Operating profit 61.6 58.1 119.7 61.2 58.5 119.7
IFRS 16 Leases is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and introduces a single, on-balance sheet accounting model that is similar 
to current finance lease accounting. Under the new standard, a lessee is required to recognise all lease assets and liabilities (including those currently 
classified as operating leases) on the statement of financial position at the present value of the unavoidable lease payments and an amortisation charge 
on the leased assets and an interest charge on the leased liabilities.
Although the Group is still evaluating the potential impact of IFRS 16 on the financial statements and performance measures, including an assessment of 
whether any arrangements the Group enters into will be considered a lease under IFRS 16, it is expected IFRS 16 will increase the Group’s recognised 
assets and liabilities and affect the presentation and timing of related depreciation and interest charges in the consolidated statement of income. Upon 
adoption of IFRS 16, the most significant impact is likely to be the present value of the operating lease commitments currently disclosed in note 23 being 
shown as a liability on the statement of financial position together with an asset representing the right of use.
IFRIC 14 Pension Accounting proposed amendments – IFRIC 14 governs the ability of companies to show a surplus relating to the pension scheme on their 
balance sheet. The amendment is intended to address the lack of clarity regarding remeasurement on a Plan amendment, curtailment or settlement and 
the availability of a refund from a Defined Benefit Plan. We anticipate limited impact to the Group.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and reduces the number of primary measurement categories for 
financial assets to two: amortised cost and fair value. 
We anticipate limited impact to the Group.
IFRIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance considerations – the standard is effective for annual reporting periods on or after January 1 2018, 
and will clarify the accounting for transactions that include the receipt or payment of advance considerations in a foreign currency.
We anticipate limited impact to the Group. Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2017 110

1. Accounting policies, estimates and judgments continued
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments – the standard is effective for annual reporting periods on or after January 1 2019, and will clarify 
the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes. The interpretation is to be applied to the determination of taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused 
tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments under IAS 12.
We anticipate limited impact to the Group.
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment in relation to the classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions. The amendments to the standard 
are intended to eliminate diversity in practice in three main areas: the effects of vesting conditions on the measurement of a cash-settled share-based 
payment transaction; the classification of a share-based payment transaction with net settlement features for withholding tax obligations; the accounting 
where a modification to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment transaction changes its classification from cash-settled to equity-settled.
We anticipate limited impact to the Group.
2. Acquisitions and disposals
2017
Electro–ceramics:
On 31 March 2017, the Group completed the sale of its UK Electro-ceramics business, comprising the two sites at Ruabon and Southampton.
The transaction was structured as a sale of the business, assets and goodwill for a consideration of £47 million on a cash-free, debt-free basis, paid in cash 
on completion and subject to customary working capital adjustments. 
In the year ended 31 December 2016, UK Electro-ceramics generated an operating profit of £6.2 million on revenues of £22.7 million. Gross assets at 
31 December 2016 were £6.7 million.    
The Group also announced the closure of its US Electro-ceramics business, which formed the remainder of the Group’s Electro-ceramics business, costs 
associated with the closure of the site have been provided for in the year, and are included in ‘Transactions costs associated with disposal’ in the table 
below.     
The disposal and closure of the electro-ceramics business reduced the Group’s assets and liabilities as follows:

Global Rotary Transfer Systems Business
On 31 March 2017, the Group completed the sale of its global Rotary Transfer Systems. The business is principally located at two manufacturing sites: 
Antweiler, Germany and Chalon, France. 
The sale valued the business at ¤40.0 million on a cash-free, debt-free basis, with consideration paid in cash on completion, subject to customary closing 
working capital adjustments. 
In the year to 31 December 2016, the Rotary business generated £3.2 million of operating profit on £15.5 million of sales. Gross assets at 31 December 
2016 were £5.9 million.
The disposal and closure of the Rotary Transfer Systems business reduced the Group’s assets and liabilities as follows: 
31 December 
2017
£m
Trading net assets of disposal group 3.5
Goodwill of disposal group 7.1
Transaction costs associated with the disposal 3.1

The disposal group was included in the Electrical Carbon operating segment.
2016
During 2016 the Group disposed of its remaining 28.77% shareholding in Assam Carbon Products Limited for nil consideration. This shareholding was 
held at nil value and, as a result, there is no profit or loss on disposal. There were no other acquisitions or disposals during 2016. Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2017 112

6. Specific adjusting items
Accounting policies
In the consolidated income statement the Group presents specific adjusting items separately. In the judgment of the Directors, due to the nature and 
value of these items they should be disclosed separately from the underlying results of the Group to allow the reader to obtain a proper understanding 
of the financial information and the best indication of underlying performance of the Group.

2017
Net profit on disposal of business
On 31 March 2017, the Group completed the sale of its UK Electro-ceramics business, comprising the two sites at Ruabon and Southampton. 
The Group also announced the closure of its US Electro-ceramics business, which formed the remainder of the Group’s Electro-ceramics business. 
The Group reflected a profit on disposal of £26.8 million associated with this transaction. A deferred tax asset of £1.5 million was recognised in 
connection with the closure of the US business. 
On 31 March 2017, the Group completed the sale of its global Rotary Transfer Systems. The business is principally located at two manufacturing sites; 
Antweiler, Germany and Chalon, France.
The Group reflected a profit on disposal of £18.9 million associated with this transaction. An income tax charge of £0.6 million was recognized in respect 
of this disposal.
US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
As a consequence of the enactment of H.R.1 commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the US a credit of £4.1 million was recognised. 
This comprised of the revaluation of tax balances to reflect the reduction in the federal tax rates offset by an income tax charge for mandatory repatriation 
charge for overseas subsidiaries of US companies.
2016 
Net pension settlement credit 
The Group has completed the final termination and payment of all earned benefits for one of its North American defined benefit plans. 
The Group has also completed a one-time lump-sum cash out payment to certain former, deferred and vested employees of the Morgan US Employees’ 
Retirement Plan in settlement of the benefits promised by the Group. 
As a result of these changes the Group has recognised a net pension settlement credit of £6.8 million, after deduction of transaction costs. An income 
tax charge of £2.8 million was recognised in respect of the net pension settlement credit.
Impairment of intangible assets 
As a result of the continued reduction in demand in the defence market, a review of the carrying value of the remaining intangible assets of Composites 
and Defence Systems resulted in an impairment charge of £8.5 million, relating to a full impairment of the Composites and Defence Systems technology 
intangible asset. This impairment was calculated by looking at the fair value of the assets less cost of disposal. Refer to note 1 1 for more details of the 
impairment charge.  Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2017 118

7 . Net finance income and expense
Accounting policies
Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate method, interest receivable on funds invested, 
gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement, net interest on IAS 19 pension assets and interest on IAS 19 
obligations. Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method. 
Borrowing costs (interest and other costs) are capitalised when they are incurred on raising specific funds to finance a major capital project which will 
be a significant productive asset, or to the extent that funds borrowed generally are used for the purposes of obtaining a qualifying asset.

8. T axation – income tax expense
Accounting policies
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, 
and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial 
recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments 
in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected 
manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

The effective rate of tax before specific adjusting items is 29.9% (2016: 29.7%).
The prior year adjustments in 2016 principally relate to the true-up of tax provisions to tax returns and includes the release of a tax provision.
The Group operates in many jurisdictions around the world and is subject to factors that may impact future tax charges including the recently enacted US 
tax reform, implementation of the OECD’s BEPS actions, tax rate and legislation changes, expiry of the statute of limitations and resolution of tax audits 
and disputes.
The Group has completed its review of the new US tax reform legislation, as enacted, including the reduction of the US federal tax rate from 35% to 
21%, which came into effect on 1 January 2018, and which gave rise to a deferred tax credit of £5.3 million. Offsetting this benefit, is a one-off charge 
in respect of the mandatory repatriation provisions of £1.2 million. It should be noted that parts of the new legislation are subject to questions of 
interpretation and, therefore, further regulations may be issued in future periods which may impact future tax rates. Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2017 120

9. Earnings per share
The calculation of basic/diluted earnings per share from continuing operations at 31 December 2017 was based on the net profit attributable to equity 
shareholders of £107.6 million (2016: £52.3 million, 2015: £33.9 million), and a weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year of 
285.0 million (2016: 284.9 million, 2015: 285.1 million). The calculation of the weighted average number of shares excludes the shares held by 
The Morgan General Employee Benefit Trust, on which the dividends are waived.
Headline earnings per ordinary share* is defined as operating profit adjusted to exclude specific adjusting items and amortisation of intangible assets, plus 
share of profit of associate less net financing costs, income tax expense and non-controlling interests, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares during the period. This measure of earnings is shown because the Directors consider that it gives a better indication of headline performance.
The diluted earnings per share calculation takes into account the dilutive effect of share incentives. The diluted, weighted average number of shares is 
286.7 million (2016: 285.1 million, 2015: 285.5 million). Diluted earnings per share is 37.5 pence (2016: 18.3 pence, 2015: 1 1.9 pence).

10. Property, plant and equipment
Accounting policies
(i) Owned assets
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, or at deemed cost, less accumulated depreciation (see below) and impairment losses. 
The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour, and an appropriate proportion of production overheads. 
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and 
equipment.
Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of 
the asset. Gains and losses on the disposal of property are recognised in ‘Restructuring costs and other items’ in the income statement. Gains and losses 
on the disposal of plant and equipment are recognised in ‘Operating costs before restructuring costs, other items and amortisation of intangible assets’ in 
the income statement.
(ii) Leased assets
Leases under the terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Leased assets 
acquired by way of a finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments 
at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 
(iii) Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and 
equipment. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date. The estimated 
useful lives are as follows:

1 1. Intangible assets
Accounting policies
(i) Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition 
and the fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is tested annually for impairment.
(ii) Research and development
See note 1.
(iii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation (see below) and impairment losses.
(iv) Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. 
Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. Other intangible assets are 
amortised from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
 Capitalised development costs 3 years
 Computer software  3-10 years
 Customer relationships  15-20 years

Impairment test for cash-generating units containing goodwill
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the business combination that gave rise to the goodwill.
Goodwill is attributed to each cash-generating unit as follows:
2017
£m 
2016
£m
Thermal Ceramics 85.4 94.8 
Molten Metal Systems 9.1 10.1 
Electrical Carbon 29.6 32.9 
Seals and Bearings 15.0 16.5 
Technical Ceramics 36.5 39.9 
Composites and Defence Systems – – 
175.6 194.2 
Each cash-generating unit is assessed for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment. 
As part of the annual impairment test review the carrying value of goodwill has been assessed with reference to its value in use, reflecting the projected 
discounted cash flows of each cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated.
The key assumptions used in determining value in use relate to growth rates and discount rates.
The cash flow projections in year one are based on budgeted operating cash flow projections in year one. The key assumptions that underpin these cash 
flow projections relate to sales and operating margins, which are based on past experience, taking into account the effect of known or likely changes in 
market or operating conditions.
Growth rates for the period not covered by budgets are 2019: 2.2% and 2020: 2.2%. A 2.2% growth rate has been used to calculate a terminal value. 
These growth rates reflect the products, industries and countries in which the operating segments operate. These medium- to long-term growth rates 
have been reviewed by management during 2017 and are considered to be appropriate.
In 2017, the Group has used the following pre-tax discount rates for calculating the terminal value of each of the cash-generating units: Thermal Ceramics: 
12.4%, Molten Metal Systems: 12.3%, Electrical Carbon: 12.5%, Seals and Bearings: 12.5%, Technical Ceramics 12.9%.

1 1. Intangible assets continued
The Directors have considered the following individual sensitivities and are confident that no impairment would arise for each of the Thermal Ceramics, 
Molten Metal Systems, Electrical Carbon, Seals and Bearings and Technical Ceramics cash-generating units in any one of the following three 
circumstances:
 if the pre-tax discount rate was increased to 15%; or
 if no growth was assumed for years two to five and in the calculation of terminal value; or
 if the cash flow projections of all businesses were reduced by 25%.
During 2016 the Group recognised an impairment loss of £8.5 million on technology and trademark intangible assets in relation to the Composites and 
Defence Systems cash-generating unit, as a result of the continued reduction in demand in the defence market. 
1 2. Investments
Accounting policies
Investments in debt and equity securities
Investments in debt and equity securities held by the Group are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or 
loss being recognised directly in other comprehensive income (in the fair value reserve), except for impairment losses and, in the case of monetary items 
such as debt securities, foreign exchange gains and losses. When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised 
directly in equity is recognised in profit or loss. Where these investments are interest-bearing, interest calculated using the effective interest method is 
recognised in profit or loss.

14. Inventories
Accounting policies
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, 
less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. 
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in-first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their 
existing location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on 
normal operating capacity.

Accounting policies
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Short-term deposits include demand deposits and short–term highly liquid 
investments with maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk 
of changes in value. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a 
component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Group statement of cash flows.

18. Capital and reserves
Accounting policies
(i) Ordinary share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
(ii) Preference share capital
Preference share capital is classified as equity if it is non-redeemable and any dividends are discretionary, or is redeemable but only at the Company’s 
option. Dividends on Preference share capital classified as equity are recognised as distributions within equity.
(iii) Repurchase of share capital and own shares held by The Morgan General Employee Benefit Trust (‘the Trust’)
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, is net of any 
tax effects, and is recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares and the purchase of own shares by the Trust are presented as a deduction 
from total equity.
Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations, as well as 
from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Company’s net investment in a foreign subsidiary and forward contracts used for net investment hedging.
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged 
transactions that have not yet occurred.
Fair value reserve
The fair value reserve includes the cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale investments until the investment is derecognised.
Capital redemption reserve
The capital redemption reserve arose when the Company redeemed Preference shares wholly out of distributable profits.
Other reserves
The other reserves include the £10.8 million increase in the year ended 3 January 2010 in the fair value of the Group’s original 49% interest in 
Clearpower Limited from the date of its original acquisition to 5 January 2009 excluding goodwill and to the extent not previously recognised as the 
Group’s share of the results of Clearpower Limited. 
Retained earnings
The Company has acquired own shares to satisfy the requirements of the various share option incentive schemes. At 31 December 2017 216,456 shares 
were held by The Morgan General Employee Benefit Trust and are treated as a deduction from equity (2016: 623,127). Nil treasury shares were held by 
the Company (2016: nil). All rights conferred by those shares are suspended until they are reissued.

The 5.5% Cumulative First Preference shares of £1 each and the 5.0% Cumulative Second Preference shares of £1 each confer on the holders thereof 
the right to receive a cumulative preferential dividend at the rate of 5.5% and 5.0% respectively, calculated up to 30 June and 31 December respectively 
in every year. The First and Second Cumulative Preference shares shall not entitle the holders thereof to attend or vote at any general meeting unless 
either:
(i)  the meeting is convened to consider any resolutions for reducing the capital, or authorising any issue of debentures or debenture stock, or increasing 
the borrowing powers of the Board under the Articles of Association of the Company, or winding up, or sanctioning a sale of the undertaking, or 
altering the Articles in any manner affecting their respective interests, or any other resolutions directly altering their respective rights and privileges; or
(ii)   at the date of the notice convening the general meeting the Preference dividend is upwards of one month in arrears from the payment date of any 
half-yearly instalment.
On a return of capital on a winding-up the assets of the Company available for distribution shall be applied:
First, in payment to the holders of the First Preference shares of the amounts paid up on such shares, together with interest at the rate of 5.5% pa.
Second, in payment to the holders of the Second Preference shares of the amounts paid up on such shares, together with interest at the rate of 5.0% pa.
Third, in repaying the capital paid up or credited as paid up on the Ordinary shares.
Fourth, any surplus shall be distributed rateably amongst the holders of the Ordinary shares in proportion to the nominal amount paid up on their 
respective holdings of shares in the Company. Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2017 130

19. Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
This note provides information about the contractual terms of the Group’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings which are measured at amortised cost. 
For more information about the Group’s exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, see note 20. 
Accounting policies
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-
bearing loans and borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income 
statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Finance lease payments
Leases where the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases as if the asset had been purchased 
outright. Assets acquired under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group and the capital elements of the leasing commitments are shown as 
obligations in creditors. Depreciation is charged on a basis consistent with similar owned assets or over the lease term if shorter. Minimum lease payments 
are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease 
term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Borrowing facilities and liquidity
All of the Group’s borrowing facilities are arranged by Group Treasury with Morgan Advanced Materials plc as the principal obligor. In a few cases 
operating subsidiaries have external borrowings but these are supervised and controlled centrally. Group Treasury seeks to obtain certainty of access to 
funding in the amounts, diversity of maturities and diversity of counterparties as required to support the Group’s medium-term financing requirements 
and to minimise the impact of poor credit market conditions.

20. Financial risk management
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to a variety of financial risks: credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, and the Group’s 
management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
Accounting policies
Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity (i.e. forming part of shareholders’ funds) only to the extent that they meet the following 
two conditions:
(i)  they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with 
another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group; and
(ii)  where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to 
deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company exchanging a fixed amount 
of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form 
of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called-up share capital and share premium account exclude 
amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses. Finance payments associated with financial instruments that 
are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.
Financial risk management and Treasury Policy
Group Treasury works within a framework of policies and procedures approved by the Audit Committee. It acts as a service to Morgan Advanced 
Materials’ businesses, not as a profit centre, and manages and controls risk in the treasury environment through the establishment of such procedures. 
Group Treasury seeks to align treasury goals, objectives and philosophy to those of the Group. It is responsible for all of the Group’s funding, liquidity, 
cash management, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and other treasury business. As part of the policies and procedures, there is strict control over 
the use of financial instruments to hedge foreign currencies and interest rates. Speculative trading in derivatives and other financial instruments is not 
permitted.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. 
The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial instruments such as liquid assets, derivative assets and trade receivables. 
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was:

Cash and cash equivalents 50.4 122.4 
Derivatives 1.0 2.1 
227.0 309.5 
Available-for-sale financial assets
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a sound credit rating. Given these 
high credit ratings, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations. Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2017 132

20. Financial risk management continued
Trade and other receivables
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the Group’s customer 
base, including the default risk of the industries and countries in which customers operate, has less influence on credit risk.
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Credit evaluations are performed on all 
customers requiring credit over a certain amount. The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
The Group serves thousands of customers. Many of these have purchased the same product for several years and in some cases decades. Others have 
modified and enhanced designs or adopted the same components into new products, extending the lifecycle of the components that the Group supplies. 
The Group’s level of customer retention is very high, particularly with its major accounts, and, although the top 20 ranking will alter from year to year, 
many of the names remain consistent over time.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.
The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was:

Past due more than 90 days 15.6 (11.9) 18.4 (13.7)
187.5 (12.8) 200.0 (15.5)
The only movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables was a decrease of £2.7 million (2016: increase of £2.1 million).
A specific impairment allowance may be created in respect of an individual trade receivable for which full recovery is doubtful. As at 31 December 2017 
and 31 December 2016 there were no specific impairment allowances that were significant to the Group.
The allowances in the accounts in respect of trade receivables are used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of the 
amount owing is possible; at the point the amount is considered irrecoverable it is written off against the financial asset directly.
Cash, cash equivalents and derivatives
Cash balances held by companies representing over 75% of the Group’s revenue are managed centrally through a number of pooling arrangements. 
Credit risk is managed by investing liquid assets and acquiring derivatives in a diversified way from high-credit-quality financial institutions. Counterparties 
are reviewed through the use of rating agencies, systemic risk considerations and through regular review of the financial press. 
Liquidity and funding risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by cash. 
The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, 
under both normal and stressed conditions.
The Group seeks a balance between certainty of funding and a flexible, cost-effective borrowing structure. The policy is to ensure that the Group has 
sufficient borrowings and committed facilities to meet its medium-term financing requirements. Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices, will affect the Group’s income or the 
value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable 
parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Group buys and sells derivatives in the ordinary course of business for hedging purposes, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage 
market risks. All such transactions are carried out in accordance with the Treasury Policy, which has been approved by the Audit Committee. Generally 
the Group seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to manage volatility in profit or loss.
Interest rate risk
The Group seeks to reduce the volatility in its interest charge caused by rate fluctuations. This is achieved through a combination of fixed rate debt and 
interest rate swaps. The proportions of fixed and floating rate debt are determined having regard to a number of factors, including prevailing market 
conditions, interest rate cycle, the Group’s interest cover and leverage position and any perceived correlation between business performance and rates.
At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments was:

Financial liabilities (193.2) (413.6) (38.5) (0.8)
(193.2) (413.6) 11.9 163.3 
The fixed rate financial liabilities predominantly comprise the currency equivalent of £192.3 million (2016: £362.7 million) of Senior Notes. The average 
cost of the Group’s fixed rate instruments is 3.67% (2016: 4.1%).
An increase of 100 basis points in interest rates on the variable element of the Group’s net debt* at the reporting date would have increased profit by 
£0.3 million (2016: £1.6 million). A decrease of 100 basis points would have decreased profit by £0.2 million (2016: increase £0.7 million). This analysis 
assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant. Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
  Annual Report 2017 Morgan Advanced Materials 135
20. Financial risk management continued
Foreign currency risk
Due to the international reach of the Group, currency transaction exposures exist. The Group has a policy in place to hedge all material firm 
commitments and a large proportion of highly probable forecast foreign currency exposures in respect of sales and purchases over the following 
12 months, and achieves this through the use of the forward foreign exchange markets. A significant proportion of the forward exchange contracts have 
maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date. The Group continues its practice of not hedging income statement translation exposure.
There are exchange control restrictions which affect the ability of a small number of the Group’s subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Group. The Group 
does not believe such restrictions have had or will have any material adverse impact on the Group as a whole or the ability of the Group to meet its cash 
flow requirements.
The table below shows the Group’s currency exposures, being exposures on currency transactions that give rise to net currency gains and losses 
recognised in the income statement. Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional 
currency of the operating company involved, other than certain non-GBP borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas entities.

Net balance sheet exposure 0.7 0.2 2.9 0.6 2.3 (1.0)
The amounts shown in the table take into account the effect of the forward contracts entered into to manage these currency exposures.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies other than the currency of the reporting unit, the Group ensures that the net 
exposure is kept to an acceptable level, by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates where necessary to address short-term imbalances.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value. The fair value of 
forward exchange contracts used as hedges of forecasted transactions at 31 December 2017 was an asset of £0.5 million (2016: liability of £3.3 million).
The contractual cash flows associated with the forward exchange contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges are shown in the section on liquidity 
risk. The impact on profit or loss is expected to occur at the same time as the associated cash flows.
Currency translation risks are controlled centrally. To defend against the impact of a permanent reduction in the value of its overseas net assets through 
currency depreciation, the Group seeks to match the currency of financial liabilities with the currency in which the net assets are denominated. This is 
achieved by raising funds in different currencies and through the use of hedging instruments such as swaps, and is implemented only to the extent that the 
Group’s gearing covenant under the terms of its loan documents, as well as its facility headroom, are likely to remain comfortably within limits. In this way, 
the currency of the Group’s financial liabilities becomes more aligned to the currency of the trading cash flows that service them.

The Group’s sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates on financial assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2017 is as follows:
Based upon the currency profile of the Group’s net financial assets and liabilities, if GBP had strengthened by 10%, reported net financial liabilities would 
have decreased by £13.0 million (2016: decrease of £28.5 million). Conversely, if GBP had weakened by 10%, reported net financial liabilities would have 
increased by £15.6 million (2016: increase of £34.1 million). Assuming the change occurred on the balance sheet date, there would be no impact on 
reported profit, as either the net financial liabilities are in the same currency as that of the respective Group entity, or the change would be offset by 
an equal and opposite change in the foreign currency monetary items in the Group’s holding company.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur. 
Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to developments. The impact of a weakening in GBP on the Group’s 
financial assets and liabilities would be more than offset in equity and income by its impact on the Group’s overseas net assets and earnings respectively.

Other market price risk
Equity price risk arises from available-for-sale equity securities held for meeting partially the unfunded portion of the Group’s defined benefit pension 
obligations. The primary goal of the Group’s investment strategy is to maximise returns in order to meet partially the Group’s unfunded defined benefit 
obligations.
Capital management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base (total equity) so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future 
development of the business. The Board uses a number of measures, identified as key performance indicators (KPIs), to ensure the continued success 
of the Group. 
The Board encourages employees of the Group to hold the Company’s Ordinary shares. The Group operates a number of employee share and share 
option schemes. From time to time the Company purchases its own shares on the market; the timing of these purchases depends on market prices. 
Primarily the shares are intended to be used for issuing shares under the Group’s various share option incentive schemes.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position, and the higher returns that might be 
possible with higher levels of borrowings. Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the preceding table.
Equity securities
Fair value is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
Derivatives
Forward exchange contracts are marked to market either using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price and deducting the 
current spot rate. 
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows. The interest rates used to determine the fair value of loans 
and borrowings are 1.6-4.2% (2016: 1.1-4.2%) and finance leases 4.2% (2016: 4.1%).
Finance lease liabilities
The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements. 
The estimated fair values reflect changes in interest rates. Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
  Annual Report 2017 Morgan Advanced Materials 139
20. Financial risk management continued
Trade and other receivables/payables
For receivables/payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value. All other receivables/payables 
are discounted to determine the fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables and loans and receivables
The Group has disclosed the fair value of cash and cash equivalents, current loans and receivables and current payables at their carrying amount,

Fair value hierarchy
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:
 Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
 Level 2:  inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly 
(i.e. derived from prices)
 Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

21. Employee benefits
Accounting policies
(i) Defined contribution plans
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to either publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans, and the Group has 
no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised 
as an expense in the income statement as incurred. 
(ii) Defined benefit plans
A defined benefit plan is any retirement plan which is not a defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of retirement 
benefit that an employee will receive, usually depending on one or more factors such as age, years of service and earnings. 
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit 
that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and 
the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA-credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates 
approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. 
When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the total of the present value of economic benefits available in the 
form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable 
during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities. Remeasurement gains and losses, differences between the interest income and actual 
returns on assets, and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in other comprehensive income in the year in which they arise.
(iii) Long-term service benefits
The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than pension plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned 
in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method, or similar approximation, 
and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on 
AA-credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations. 
(iv) Share-based payment transactions
The grant date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, 
over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the 
actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market performance conditions are met, such that the amount ultimately recognised 
as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
Employee benefits – pensions
The Group operates a number of defined benefit arrangements as well as defined contribution plans. The defined benefit plans are primarily in the UK, 
USA and Europe and predominantly provide pensions based on service and career-average pay. In addition post-retirement medical plans are operated 
in the USA.
The Group has considered third-party powers and does not believe the Trustees have any powers that would prevent the Group obtaining a refund of 
any surplus on wind-up of the Scheme following gradual settlement of the plan obligations. As such the Group’s interpretation is that the current version 
of IFRIC 14 does not have an impact and, as a result, any IAS 19 surplus can be recognised as an asset and it is not necessary to recognise additional 
liabilities in respect of contribution agreements reached with the pension scheme Trustees, managers or any third party. Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
  Annual Report 2017 Morgan Advanced Materials 141
21. Employee benefits continued
UK Schemes
In the UK, the Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes, the Morgan Pension Scheme and the Morgan Group Senior Staff Pension and Life 
Assurance Scheme (‘the UK Schemes’). The two UK Schemes provide a benefit based upon an employee’s total service, and their career average 
earnings (including allowance for consumer price inflation), although historically benefits were based upon an employee’s final salary. Once in payment, 
pensions receive increases as set out in the rules, at either a fixed level, or in line with the Retail Price Index. The overall duration of the UK Schemes is 
around 18 years.
The UK Schemes’ assets are held in trustee-administered funds which are governed by UK regulations, as is the nature of the relationship between the 
Group and the Trustees. Responsibility for the governance of the UK Schemes – including investment decisions and contribution schedules – lies with 
the Board of Trustees which must consult with the Company on such matters. The Board of Trustees must be composed of representatives of the 
Company, plan participants and an independent trustee, in accordance with the UK Schemes governing documents. 
Funding legislation in the UK requires that schemes are fully funded on a scheme-specific basis as measured, and this must be assessed at least every 
three years. To the extent that there is a deficit against this measure, a payment schedule must be agreed such that the deficit is removed over a 
reasonable period of time, typically around 10 years.
The most recent full actuarial valuations of the UK Schemes were undertaken as at March 2016 and resulted in combined assessed deficits of 
£132 million. On the basis of these full valuations, the Trustees of the UK Schemes, having consulted with the Group, agreed past service deficit recovery 
payments totalling £12 million a year from April 2017, increasing by 2.75% pa until 2025, with further payments to Morgan Pension Scheme for 2026 and 
2027 and contributions in respect of future service as accrued. New full valuations are due with effective dates of March 2019 and the outcome of those 
consultations will determine the Group’s future contribution requirements, with any new deficit arising needing to be met through the payment of 
additional contributions.
The UK Schemes were closed to new entrants on 1 August 201 1, with any new employees receiving benefits through the Morgan Group Personal 
Pension Plan, a defined contribution arrangement. The Morgan Group Senior Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme was closed to the future accrual 
of benefits on and with effect from 6 April 2016. Employees active in the Scheme as at that date were enrolled in The Morgan Group Personal Pension 
Plan, with the option to opt out under relevant UK legislation. Following a consultation exercise with the remaining active members of the Morgan 
Pension Scheme in May and June 2017, the Trustee of the Scheme agreed to a Company proposal to close the Scheme to the future accrual of benefits 
with effect from 6 April 2018. Again employees active in the Scheme at that date will be auto-enrolled into The Morgan Group Personal Pension Plan for 
their future pension benefits.
US schemes
The Group operates a tax qualified defined benefit pension scheme in the US (‘MUSE DB Scheme’), and a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan 
(‘SERP’) which is not tax approved. The MUSE Scheme is frozen, and therefore employees accrue benefits within a 401k arrangement. 
The US Schemes provide a benefit based upon an employee’s service and earnings. The benefits are level both prior to, and whilst in, payment. 
Overall, the US Schemes’ duration is around 1 1 years. 
The qualified US Schemes’ assets are held in a trust separately from the Group’s assets. For the SERP the Group holds an asset to meet the obligations 
however, due to its nature this is accounted for as a Group asset, rather than an asset of the SERP. Responsibility for the governance of the US Schemes, 
including investment decisions and contribution schedules, lies with a management committee, all of whose members are appointed by the Group. 
The funding requirements in the USA, ERISA, require schemes to be fully funded at all times, and if not to target full funding within a period of 
seven years.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the US MUSE DB Scheme was undertaken as at 1 January 2017 and the deficit on this funding basis totalled 
£4.5 million. On the more stringent DBO (Defined Benefit Obligation) basis used for IAS19 purposes, the deficit as at 31 December 2016 totalled  
£41 million. The Group made contributions totalling £36 million ($46 million) in 2017, including an additional accelerated payment in December 2017  
of £28 million ($36 million). As a result of this contribution and positive asset performance over the year, the Scheme is now close to being fully funded 
on a DBO basis and no further significant contributions to the Scheme are anticipated in the medium term. Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2017 142

European schemes
In Europe, the Group operates a number of retirement schemes, with the bulk of the obligations relating to arrangements for employees in Germany. 
In line with local practice these arrangements are not funded in advance, with benefits being met by the Group as they fall due.

The assumptions used are best estimate assumptions chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which may not be borne out in practice. 
The principal assumptions are the discount rate and inflation assumptions which are long-term and measured on external factors, based upon each plan’s 
duration. In addition to these, the mortality assumption in the UK and USA is material to the cost of the promised benefits. In both the UK and Europe, 
the assumed increases in salaries and pensions in payment are derived from assumed future inflation. Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2017 144

The rates shown below are single equivalents for the obligations as a whole derived from discounting along the yield curve. In line with IAS 19, in 
determining the value of the annuity contract held in the UK we have reflected the same methodology as used to value the corresponding obligations, 
reflecting the actual cashflow profile and duration of the insured obligations, rather than those of the Schemes as a whole.

1. Pension increases in the UK reflect both fixed rate and RPI related increases to different elements of members’ pensions.
The actual liability in respect of global employee benefits will not be known until the last payments have been made. In placing a current estimate on the 
Group’s past service benefit obligations, a number of assumptions about the future are required. For defined benefit schemes, the Directors make annual 
estimates and assumptions in respect of discount rates, future changes in salaries, employee turnover, inflation rates and life expectancy. In making these 
estimates and assumptions, the Directors consider advice provided by external advisers, such as actuaries.
The accounting assumptions noted above are used to calculate the year-end net pension liability in accordance with the relevant accounting Standard,  
IAS 19 (revised) Employee Benefits. Changes in these assumptions have no impact on the Group’s cash payments to their arrangements. The payments 
due are calculated based on local funding requirements, or in the case of the Group’s unfunded arrangements on the incidence of benefit payments 
falling due.
The sensitivities of the Group’s net balance sheet to the principal assumptions are:

Exchange rates GBP weakens against USD by 10% 1.2 5.4 
GBP weakens against EUR by 10% 4.1 4.2 
These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the net balance sheet in isolation, and assuming no other changes in market conditions 
at the accounting date. This is unlikely in practice – for example, a change in discount rate is unlikely to occur without any movement in the value of the 
assets held by the Group’s Schemes. Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

Defined contribution plans
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension plans. The total expense relating to these plans in the current year was £9.5 million  
(2016: £8.7 million). The Group expects to contribute £10.7 million to these arrangements in 2018 (£10.0 million excluding contributions arising from 
salary sacrifice by employees in the UK).

Risks
Through its defined benefit pension schemes, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:
The balance sheet net pension liability is a snapshot view which can be significantly influenced by short-term market factors.
The calculation of the surplus or deficit depends, therefore, on factors which are beyond the control of the Group – principally the value at the balance 
sheet date of equity shares in which the Scheme has invested and long-term interest rates which are used to discount future liabilities. The funding of 
the Scheme is based on long-term trends and assumptions relating to market growth, as advised by qualified actuaries and investment advisers.
Investment returns:  The Group’s net balance sheet and contribution requirements are heavily dependent upon the return on the assets invested in by 
the schemes.
Longevity:   The cost to the Group of the pensions promised to members is dependent upon the expected term of these payments. To the 
extent that members live longer than expected this will increase the cost of these arrangements.
Inflation rate risk:  In the UK, the pension promises are, in the main, linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The above risks have been mitigated for a large proportion of the UK Schemes’ pensioner population through the purchase of an insurance policy, 
the payments from which exactly match the promises made to employees. Remaining investment risks have also been mitigated to some extent by 
diversification of the return-seeking assets and backing uninsured pensioner liabilities by bonds and swaps.
In addition, the IAS 19 defined benefit obligation is linked to yields on AA-rated corporate bonds; however the majority of the Group’s arrangements 
invest in a number of other assets which will move in a different manner from these bonds. Therefore, changes in market conditions may lead to volatility 
in the net pension liability on the Group’s balance sheet and in other comprehensive income, and to a lesser extent in the IAS 19 pension expense in the 
Group’s income statement.  Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

Share-based payments
The Group operates various share option programmes that allow Group employees to acquire shares in the Company. During 2017, awards were made 
to Executives under the Morgan Advanced Materials plc Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) and for the first time under the Morgan Advanced Materials 
Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DBP’). No awards were made under The Morgan Advanced Materials Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan (‘BDSMP’), although 
awards remained outstanding from prior years. The Company also maintains a UK all-employee Sharesave scheme (‘Employee Sharesave Scheme 
2004’). The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over 
the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual 
number of share options for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are met.
The fair values of the options and awards under each scheme have been measured using the following models:
LTIP and BDSMP Monte Carlo model
Restricted Share Award Monte Carlo model
Employee Sharesave Scheme 2004 Modified binomial model
DBP Monte Carlo model

Performance metrics for LTIP and BDSMP
The key performance metrics used in the plans are:
Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) – the return (expressed as a percentage) on a notional investment in one share in the Company expressed as follows:
(a)  the average share price over the last three months of the performance period; plus (b) the net dividends per share paid during the performance 
period reinvested in Company shares at the ex-dividend date; divided by (c) the average share price over the three months preceding the 
performance period.
Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’) – (for the LTIP and BDSMP) profit before taxation less the charge for non-controlling interests in any financial year of the 
Group, adjusted by the Remuneration Committee to exclude the effect of amortisation of intangible assets, charges related to IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and the effect of any other special items which the Remuneration Committee does not, in its discretion, 
consider to reflect underlying operating performance, divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the relevant financial years 
(defined on a pre-taxation basis).
Group headline operating profit* – operating profit before specific adjusting items and amortisation of intangible assets. The Remuneration Committee 
may also make further adjustments to exclude items which it does not, in its discretion, consider to reflect the underlying operating performance of the 
Group during the relevant financial years.
Group Return on Capital Employed (‘ROCE’)* – Group headline operating profit*, divided by the working capital and the net book value of property, 
plant and equipment, and land and buildings at the end of the relevant financial years. Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2017 148

Group average Return on Invested Capital Employed (‘ROIC’)* – Group headline operating profit* (operating profit excluding specific adjusting items 
and amortisation of intangible assets) divided by the 12-month average adjusted net assets (third-party working capital, property, plant and equipment, 
land and buildings, intangible assets and other balance sheet items), at the end of the relevant financial years. 
For the TSR elements of the plans, for performance between median and upper quartile, awards are made on a straight-line, pro-rata basis. Similarly 
for EPS, Group headline operating profit* and Group average ROCE* for performance between the identified trigger points, awards are made on a 
straight-line, pro-rata basis.

Performance metrics for LTIP 
The performance metrics for LTIP awards are set annually. The Company has given an undertaking to shareholders that awards will only vest if there is 
also an improvement in underlying financial performance. Awards will only vest therefore if the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the Group’s 
underlying financial performance over the performance period justifies vesting.
2014 LTIP awards
For LTIP awards granted to all participants in 2014, the extent to which 33% of the awards vest depends on the Company’s TSR ranking against an 
appropriate comparator group over the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016. The extent to which 33% of these awards vest depends 
on the growth in the Company’s EPS between the 2013 base financial year and the 2016 financial year. The extent to which 33% vest depends on the 
Group’s ROCE* for the financial year ending 31 December 2016:

the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019. The extent to which 33% of these awards vest depends on the growth in the Company’s EPS 
between the 2016 base financial year and the 2019 financial year. The extent to which 33% vest depends on the Group’s ROIC* for the financial year 
ending 31 December 2019:

Performance metrics for the BDSMP
The BDSMP was introduced following shareholder approval in 2008. 
Under the plan rules, participants may be offered the opportunity to defer up to 75% of their annual bonus on a pre- or post-tax basis into Company 
shares. Participants must hold the deferred shares for three years to be eligible for a matching award based on the pre-tax value of their deferred shares. 
Matching shares may be earned at the end of three years in the event that stretching performance metrics have been met. The performance metrics for 
the BDSMP are set annually.
Under the 2014 and 2015 grants participants were given the opportunity to defer up to 50% of their bonus under the BDSMP and the performance 
metrics are based on EPS growth targets relative to the 201 1, 2012, 2013 and 2014 base years respectively:

20% pa 3x match
16% pa 2x match
12% pa 1x match
8% pa Nil
< 8% pa Nil
The BDSMP is no longer offered and therefore no awards were made under the BDSMP in 2016 or 2017.
Restricted Share Award
On 3 August 2015, an award over 1 14,351 ordinary 25 pence shares in the Company was made to Pete Raby, Chief Executive Officer. This award was 
granted in accordance with Listing Rule 9.4.2(2) and was made in recognition of the loss of incentive awards which he forfeited on leaving his former 
employer. Vesting is subject to Pete Raby not having resigned or been dismissed in specified circumstances. There are no performance conditions 
attached to this award.
The first tranche of 57,176 shares vested on 31 December 2016. The second tranche of 57,175 shares vested on 29 December 2017. No shares remain 
outstanding under this award.
2017 DBP
The first awards under the DBP were made in 2017. 
Participants defer an element of their earned annual bonus into Company shares. Participants receive conditional awards over shares that vest three years 
from the award date.
The awards carry the right to individual reinvestment. There are no performance conditions attached.

22. Provisions and contingent liabilities
Accounting policies
A provision is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result 
of a past event, and there is probable outflow of resources which that can be reliably measured and will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions 
are recognised at an amount equal to the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Group’s liability, if the effect is material, provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate reflective of the current markets assessments of the time value of money, 
and where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. 
A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of the obligation will only be confirmed by future events or where the amount of the obligation 
cannot be measured with reasonable reliability. A contingent liability is not disclosed if the likelihood of a material outflow in excess of any amounts 
provided is considered remote. Contingent assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefit is probable. Obligations 
arising from restructuring plans are recognised when detailed formal plans have been established and when there is a valid expectation that such a plan 
will be carried out. 
The Group’s contingent liabilities are reviewed on a regular basis. The Board is of the opinion that in respect of the Group’s contingent liabilities, where 
it is possible to form a view, that they will not have a material impact on the Group’s financial position. 
In a number of jurisdictions companies have a constructive obligation to remedy any known environmental problems. Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2017 152

9.5 3.8 1.2 14.5
Closure and Restructuring Provisions
Closure and restructuring provisions are based on the Group’s restructuring programmes and represent committed expenditure at the balance sheet 
date. The amounts provided are based on the costs of terminating relevant contracts, under the contract terms, and management’s best estimate of 
other associated restructuring costs including professional fees, most of which are expected to be incurred over the next year. Due to the nature of the 
provision for closure and restructuring provisions, the timing of any future potential future outflows in respect of these liabilities is uncertain until the 
restructuring programme is completed.
Legal and other provisions
Legal and other provisions mainly comprise amounts provided against open legal and contractual disputes arising in the normal course of business and 
long-service costs. 
The Company has on occasion been required to take legal or other actions to protect its intellectual property rights, to enforce commercial contracts 
or otherwise and similarly to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties. Provisions are made for the expected costs associated with such 
matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent management’s 
best estimate of the most likely outcome. The timing of utilisation of these provisions is frequently uncertain, reflecting the complexity of issues and the 
outcome of various court proceedings and associated negotiations. 
Other provisions represent the Directors’ best estimate of the cost of settling current obligations although there is a higher degree of judgement involved. 
Unless specific evidence exists to the contrary, these provisions are shown as current. 
Where obligations are not capable of being reliably estimated, or if a material outflow of economic resources is considered remote, it is classified as a 
contingent liability. The Directors are of the opinion that any associated claims that might be brought can be defeated successfully and, therefore, the 
possibility of any material outflow in settlement is assessed as remote.
Subsidiary undertakings within the Group have given unsecured guarantees of £1 1.2 million (2016: £13.2 million) in the ordinary course of business.
Environmental provisions
The Group’s operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the Group is in material compliance with those laws and regulations. 
Environmental provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount is capable of being reliably estimated. These provisions are adjusted as 
new information develops or circumstances change. If such an obligation is not capable of being reliably estimated, or if a material outflow of economic 
resources is considered remote, it is classified as a contingent liability. Any potential liability is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s financial position.
Tax contingent liabilities
The Group is subject to periodic tax audits by various fiscal authorities covering corporate, employee and sales taxes in the various jurisdictions in which it 
operates, estimates of likely exposures are in Notes 8 and 13. 
Future changes in legislation, regulation or interpretation could increase the Group’s taxes and have an adverse effect of the Group’s operating results and 
financial condition. Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

Company Statement of Changes in Equity
for the year ended 31 December 2017 27 . Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (‘FRS 101’).
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’), but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.
Under Section 408(4) of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:
 a cash flow statement and related notes
 comparative period reconciliations for share capital, tangible fixed assets and intangible assets
 transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries
 the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs
 the compensation of key management personnel
 capital management
As the consolidated financial statements of Morgan Advanced Materials plc include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the 
exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures:
 IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments in respect of Group-settled share-based payments; and
 the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Disclosures.
The Company proposes to continue to adopt the reduced disclosure framework of FRS 101 in its next financial statements.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to the period presented in these financial statements.
Measurement convention
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value – financial 
instruments classified as fair value through the profit or loss.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets that are acquired by the Company are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. 
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. Other intangible assets are 
amortised from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
 software: 3-7 years
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of tangible fixed assets. 
Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
 plant, equipment and fixtures: 3-20 years
 buildings: 50 years
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the Company’s functional currencies at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign 
exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement except for differences arising 
on the retranslation of qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are 
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the 
dates the fair value was determined.

Expenses
Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives 
received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates 
to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts 
used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or 
liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the 
extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation 
or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference 
can be utilised.
Classification of financial instruments issued by the Company
Financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions:
(a)   they include no contractual obligations upon the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities 
with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company; and
(b)   where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to 
deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company’s exchanging a fixed amount 
of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified takes the legal 
form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called-up share capital and share premium account exclude 
amounts in relation to those shares.
Non-derivative financial instruments 
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other debtors, cash and cash equivalents, loans and 
borrowings, and trade and other creditors.
Trade and other debtors
Trade and other debtors are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less any impairment losses.
Trade and other creditors
Trade and other creditors are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Investments in debt and equity securities
Investments in debt and equity securities held by the Company are classified as being available for sale and are stated at fair value, with any resultant 
gain or loss being recognised directly in equity (in the fair value reserve), except for impairment losses and, in the case of monetary items such as debt 
securities, foreign exchange gains and losses. When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised directly in 
equity is recognised in profit or loss. Where these investments are interest-bearing, interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised 
in profit or loss. Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings (which include amounts owed to/by Group undertakings) are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.

Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or 
loss. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged 
(see below).
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable 
forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve. Any ineffective 
portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Fair value hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm 
commitment, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised immediately in the income statement. The carrying value of the hedged item 
is adjusted by the change in fair value that is attributable to the risk being hedged (even if it is normally carried at cost or amortised cost) and any gains or 
losses on remeasurement are recognised immediately in the income statement (even if those gains would normally be recognised directly in reserves).
Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no 
legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense 
in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
Defined benefit plans
A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Company’s net obligation in respect of defined 
benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees 
have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value 
of any plan assets (at bid price) and any unrecognised past service costs are deducted. The liability discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date 
on AA-credit-rated bonds denominated in the currency of, and having maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Company’s obligations. 
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Company, 
the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of benefits available in the form of any future 
refunds from the plan, reductions in future contributions to the plan or on settlement of the plan and takes into account the adverse effect of any 
minimum funding requirements.
Actuarial gains and losses that have arisen since the adoption of FRS 101 are recognised in the period that they occur directly into equity through the 
statement of comprehensive income.
The Company is the sponsoring and principal employer of two UK defined benefit pension Schemes, the Morgan Pension Scheme and the Morgan 
Group Senior Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme (‘the UK Schemes’). The Company also guarantees certain obligations and liabilities to the 
employees that currently participate in the two UK Schemes. 
During 2016 the Company adopted a new policy to allocate costs associated with the UK pension schemes between itself, as Principal Employer, and the 
various Participating Employers, based on an evaluation of each entity’s share of overall Scheme liabilities. This ensures that the pension liability is reflected 
in the entity that employed the participant. This resulted in a reallocation of £151.5 million of the Schemes’ net liabilities to the Participating Employers. 
Previously all of the Scheme assets and liabilities were recognised on the balance sheet of the Company only. Further details are provided in note 36.
Share-based payment transactions
Share-based payment arrangements in which the Company receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments are accounted for 
as equity-settled share-based payment transactions, regardless of how the equity instruments are obtained by the Company.
The grant date fair value of share-based payments awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase 
in equity, over the period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards. The fair value of the awards granted is measured using 
an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were granted. The amount recognised as an expense 
is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the 
amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions 
at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to 
reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
Overview Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
  Annual Report 2017 Morgan Advanced Materials 159 27 . Accounting policies continued
Share-based payment transactions in which the Company receives goods or services by incurring a liability to transfer cash or other assets that is based 
on the price of the Company’s equity instruments are accounted for as cash-settled share-based payments. The fair value of the amount payable to 
employees is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period in which the employees become unconditionally 
entitled to payment. The liability is remeasured at each balance sheet date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability are 
recognised as personnel expense in profit or loss.
Own shares held by The Morgan General Employee Benefit Trust
Transactions of the Group-sponsored Morgan General Employee Benefit Trust are treated as being those of the Company and are therefore reflected 
in the Company’s financial statements. In particular, the Trust’s purchases and sales of shares in the Company are debited and credited to equity.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event that can 
be reliably measured, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined 
by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings, associates and joint ventures are stated at cost less amounts written off unless they are designated as a hedged 
item in a fair value hedge of foreign currency risk. In this case they are accounted for at historical cost plus a hedging adjustment recognised in profit or 
loss for the changes in their fair value attributable to the foreign currency exposure from the date the hedge is designated.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Immediately after issue, debt is stated at the fair value of the consideration received. Immediately after issue capital instruments are stated after deduction 
of issue costs. The finance cost of the debt is allocated to periods over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Dividends on shares presented within shareholders’ funds
Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately approved and are 
no longer at the discretion of the Company. Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
Financial guarantee contracts
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company 
considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent 
liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee, at which point a liability would 
be recognised.

The Morgan Pension Scheme and the Morgan Group Senior Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme
The Company participates in two defined benefit schemes in the UK. The assets of these schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds, 
The Morgan Pension Scheme and the Morgan Group Senior Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme. These schemes were closed to new entrants 
on 1 August 201 1, with any new employees receiving benefits through the Morgan Group Personal Pension Plan, a defined contribution arrangement. 
The Morgan Group Senior Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme was closed to the future accrual of benefits on and with effect from 6 April 2016. 
Employees active in the Scheme as at that date were enrolled in the Morgan Group Personal Pension Plan, with the option to opt out under relevant 
UK legislation. Following a consultation exercise with the remaining active members of the Morgan Pension Scheme in May and June 2017, the Trustee 
of the Scheme agreed to a Company proposal to close the Scheme to the future accrual of benefits with effect from 6 April 2018. Again employees active 
in the Scheme at that date will be auto-enrolled into the Morgan Group Personal Pension Plan for their future pension benefits.

36. Employee benefits: pensions continued
During 2016 the Company adopted a new policy to allocate costs associated with the UK pension schemes between itself, as Principal Employer, and the 
various Participating Employers, based on an evaluation of each entity’s share of overall Scheme liabilities. This ensures that the pension liability is reflected 
in the entity that employed the participant. This resulted in a reallocation of £151.5 million of the Schemes’ net liabilities to the Participating Employers. 
Previously all of the Scheme assets and liabilities were recognised on the balance sheet of the Company only.

The assumptions used are best estimate assumptions chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which may not be borne out in practice. 
The principal assumptions are the discount rate and inflation assumptions which are long-term and measured on external factors, based upon each plan’s 
duration. In addition to these, the mortality assumption in the UK is material to the cost of the promised benefits. The assumed increases in salaries and 
pensions in payment are derived from assumed future inflation.

Deficit (46.1) (51.0)
Funding
The most recent full actuarial valuations of the UK Schemes were undertaken as at March 2016 and resulted in combined assessed deficits of £132 million. 
On the basis of these full valuations, the Trustees of the UK Schemes, having consulted with the Group, agreed past service deficit recovery payments 
totalling £12 million a year from April 2017 (Company: £3.6 million in 2017), increasing by 2.75% pa until 2025, with further payments to the Morgan 
Pension Scheme for 2026 and 2027 and contributions in respect of future service as accrued. New full valuations are due with effective dates of March 
2019 and the outcome of those consultations will determine the Group’s future contribution requirements, with any new deficit arising needing to be 
met through the payment of additional contributions.
Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivities of the Company’s net balance sheet to the principal assumptions are:
Change in assumption
2017 
Increase effect 
£m
2016 
Increase effect 
£m
Discount rate Decrease by 0.1% 2.4 2.4 
Inflation Increase by 0.1% 1.1 1.1 
Mortality – post-retirement Pensioners live 1 year longer 4.7 5.1 
These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the net balance sheet in isolation, and assuming no other changes in market conditions 
at the accounting date (except where a fully matching insurance policy is held where this asset is assumed to change in value to match the change in 
obligations). This is unlikely in practice, for example, a change in discount rate is unlikely to occur without any movement in the value of the assets held 
by the Company’s schemes.
Defined contribution plans
The Group operates a defined contribution pension plan (‘the Morgan Group Personal Pension Plan’). The total Company expense relating to this plan 
in 2017 was £0.1 million (2016: £0.1 million). Morgan Advanced Materials Annual Report 2017 166

Dilapidation provisions are based on the Company’s commitments at the balance sheet date.
Other provisions relate to legal claims and are based on the Company’s assessment of the probable cost of these activities.
Contingent liabilities
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company 
considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent 
liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee, at which point a liability would 
be recognised. 
The Group has been subject to legal claims in a number of countries. In some cases it will not be possible to form a view, either because the facts are 
unclear or because further time is needed to properly assess the merits of the case, and no provisions are held against such cases. The Board, having 
taken legal advice, is of the opinion that the remainder of these actions will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position. 
There are no other contingent liabilities in the Company as at 31 December 2017.

Derivative financial liabilities
Forward foreign exchange contracts non-designated (2.2) (12.1)
Fair values are measured using a hierarchy where the inputs are:
 Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly;
 Level 3 – inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The derivative financial assets and liabilities are all measured using Level 2 inputs. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is estimated by 
discounting the future cash flows using appropriate market-sourced data at the balance sheet date.

in their name on the shareholder register, perhaps because the name or the address appears on each account
