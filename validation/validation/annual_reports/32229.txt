Highlights
Our AUM increased 27% over the year in Sterling terms and 12% in Dollar terms. The increase in 
AUM was due entirely to market and currency movement as it was another year of net outflows 
from our funds. The level of net outflows of £230m was however markedly lower than last year 
and over the second half of the year we returned to net inflows. Strategic Report

Tom Bartlam
Chairman
Chairman’s Statement
Our Assets Under Management (AUM) increased 27% 
over the year in Sterling terms from £7.3bn to £9.3bn 
and 12% in Dollar terms from $10.4bn to $11.6bn. The 
increase in AUM was due entirely to market and currency 
movement as it was another year of net outflows from our 
funds. The level of net outflows of £230m was however 
markedly lower than last year and over the second half of 
the year we returned to net inflows.
Stock markets around the world were surprisingly buoyant 
over the period although this was not reflected in flows 
into active equity funds as it was another challenging year 
for the industry with passive products continuing to take 
market share. Across Europe active equity funds suffered 
net outflows of €60bn and in the UK it was the worst year 
for retail fund flows for over 20 years!
In this context our reducing levels of net outflows provide 
grounds for encouragement.
Funds and Performance
Despite the very challenging industry conditions eight 
of our twelve strategies recorded positive net inflows 
over the financial year. The four strategies that suffered 
outflows were Japan, GEMS and North America on the 
long-only side and European Long/Short on the absolute 
return side.
Although the main Japan UCITS fund experienced 
further substantial outflows, it is pleasing to see a sharp 
improvement in the fund’s performance over the last 
twelve months as the team’s style has returned to favour. 
We again suffered redemptions from our GEMS funds 
following a sustained period of lacklustre performance 
although the longer-term performance of the GEMS 
Income fund remains impressive. The outflows on our 
North America fund were due to short-term client tactical 
allocation decisions away from the US market rather than 
relating to fund performance, which continues to be 
strong and well ahead of benchmark over most periods 
and since launch.
On the alternatives side we have continued to see 
redemptions on our European Long/Short products in 
reaction to several years of below target returns. The 
team’s fundamental bottom up value style has been 
challenged over recent years and the distortions in the 
European market as a result of the ECB’s extensive QE 
program have certainly proved unhelpful. However, there 
are signs that market conditions are ‘normalising’ and 
the team’s flagship Forager fund has rebounded sharply 
through the end of May, giving us encouragement that 
the worst may well be behind the team and their funds. 
Of the eight strategies that experienced net inflows we 
saw particularly good interest in Technology, Healthcare, 
Financials and European Income (ex UK) on the long-only 
side and on the alternative side Global Convertibles and 
UK Absolute had meaningful inflows.
In the March quarter of the year inflows were helped 
further by the successful launch of our long-only UK 
Value Opportunities UCITS fund managed by Georgina 
Hamilton which raised over £100m at launch. George 
Godber was able to join us in April and be reunited with 
Georgina as co-manager on the fund and momentum 
has continued to be strong with assets at the end of  
May over £256m.
The poor performance of active managers in general 
against their benchmarks in 2016 and that of many of 
our own managers too, is reflected in the low level of 
performance fees we received last year which came in 
well below our expectations. This was though the 16th 
successive year of earning performance fees.
Results
Pre-tax profits fell to £20.4m from £23.6m in the prior 
year. Core pre-tax profits fell from £23.6m to £21.8m and 
net performance fees decreased from £3.0m to £1.2m.
Adjusted diluted earnings per ordinary share fell from 
22.0p to 20.4p.
Our balance sheet remains strong with net assets of 
£70.7m (2016: £75.7m) including net cash of £58.5m 
(2016: £48.8m). Strategic Report
 Polar Capital Holdings plc 06
Market Background
‘Markets climb a wall of worry’ goes the old adage and 
surely that has never been truer than last year. First we 
had the run up to the Brexit vote in June which created 
a degree of uncertainty in the UK and then the vote 
itself which proved a surprise to many and certainly 
to most stock market investors. Worries over the 
implications for the UK economy were quickly followed 
by worries over the US presidential election which 
produced another result to confound the pollsters, 
political commentators and most investors.
The European political situation has been another area of 
constant worry as has been North Korea, the Middle East 
and the South China Sea where tensions between China 
and many of its neighbours over rights and claims continue 
to simmer. Investors even had to contend with a rise in US 
interest rates – the first increase since the financial crisis 
of 2008. Despite all these worries returns on major stock 
markets around the world proved remarkably strong and 
particularly so for the sterling based investor.
The global economy proved itself oblivious to all the 
political turmoil growing steadily through calendar 2016 
and through the opening months of 2017. Even Europe 
is showing signs of a broad based improvement in 
economic activity. Earnings at many companies have thus 
proved remarkably resilient in the face of all the political 
drama and with many corporates awash with cash, 
corporate takeover activity has continued at a high level. 
The overall earnings outlook has been further boosted by 
improvement in the outlook for financials, commodities 
and energy – all important sectors that have experienced 
their challenges over recent years. 
In the UK, the FTSE 100 Index returned 23.3% over 
the year with many of the large companies in the Index 
benefitting from a weak pound boosting their overseas 
earnings. The broader based FTSE All Share Index still 
managed a healthy return of 22% even though many 
of the smaller companies within the Index were initially 
most impacted by the Brexit vote and the implications for 
the UK economy. 
The strong consensus of economists and politicians 
and indeed many investors post the Brexit result was 
for an immediate and sharp slowdown in the domestic 
economy. The reality so far has rather confounded the 
consensus. Nevertheless the Brexit negotiations are an 
immense challenge and will create much uncertainty in 
the coming months and years.
Outside of the UK, returns around the world were also 
strong with the S&P500 Index in the US up 17% and the 
NASDAQ up 23% – for the Sterling investor these translated 
into even greater returns of 34% and 41% respectively. 
The EURO STOXX 50 posted a 21% return in Euros but in 
sterling this was nearly 31% and whilst the Japanese Topix 
returned a rather pedestrian 15% by comparison, translated 
into sterling this became a heady 33%. 
Awards
A good number of our funds and fund managers 
received awards again this year with the Insurance 
fund, part of our Financials team, receiving a total of 
six awards. There were multiple awards also for our 
Technology and Healthcare teams as well awards for 
the Japan and North America teams.
At a company level we received awards from Investment 
Week at their Specialist Awards 2016 and from 
International Adviser for product and service.
Dividend
As previously stated the Board believes that the level of 
dividend should reflect the Company’s trading results, its 
cash resources and also its future prospects.
With the outlook improving as we enter the new financial 
year and supported by our very strong balance sheet, the 
Board has decided to once again pay an uncovered dividend 
and to maintain the second interim dividend at 19.5p.

Leadership Changes
On behalf of the other Board members and the entire staff 
at Polar, I would like to thank Tim Woolley, co-founder of 
the business, who will be standing down as Chief Executive 
in July, for his leadership in so successfully guiding us 
through many challenges over the past seven and a half 
years. Since Tim has been CEO, the Group has added 
eight new investment teams, head count has increased 
from 52 to 114, and AUM has increased from $1.9bn to 
$12.6bn. This has been a tremendous achievement not only 
when considered against the back drop of seismic changes 
in geopolitics and regulation, market crises, and shifting 
trends in the asset management industry that have occurred 
during his tenure, but also when one considers that growth 
and success have come whilst retaining the entrepreneurial, 
collegiate and transparent environment that Polar offers 
its fund managers and staff. Fortunately our association 
will continue as Tim will be staying on as a non-executive 
member of the Board.
I am looking forward to welcoming Gavin Rochussen on 
board as our new Chief Executive in July. Gavin has an 
exceptional record as a CEO in the asset management 
industry and has a proven record in developing an 
institutional business and building a significant presence 
in North America. 
We look forward to a bright future under his proven  
and dynamic leadership.
Annual General Meeting
Once again our AGM will be held at our offices at  
16 Palace Street, London, SW1E 5JD. The meeting will be  
on the 26 July 2017 commencing at 2:30pm. Although we 
do not give a trading update at the meeting, I encourage 
shareholders to attend so that they can meet the Directors 
after the meeting.
Outlook
Whilst political uncertainty and market-volatility appear 
to be our constant travelling companions these days, 
we enter the new fiscal year with a good degree of 
momentum in terms of fund performance, fund flows 
and asset growth. 
Despite ongoing regulatory headwinds within the 
industry, we believe we are well positioned to return 
to earnings growth in the new financial year subject to 
there being no major correction in markets.

Chief Executive’s Report
For the year ended 31 March 2017
Tim Woolley
Chief Executive Officer and Founder
Our Chairman referred in his Statement to the fact that last year was a disappointing year for active managers and that 
indeed many of our funds failed to beat their benchmarks. Whilst disappointing one should never read too much into a 
single year – our history has shown that backing a good active manager over the long-term delivers better returns net  
of all costs than betting on a passive benchmark product.
Many clients would agree that the US market is regarded as the most efficient and most difficult in which to beat 
the benchmark, yet if you had invested $10,000 in our North America UCITS fund over 1, 3, 5 years or since launch, 
your returns would be comfortably ahead of the benchmark return net of all costs in every one of those periods, as 
indicated below.

On the absolute return side we have also achieved some 
impressive returns particularly on our two absolute UCITS 
products GCB and UK Absolute over recent years. The 
GCB fund was launched in September 2013 and has 
delivered a return of 19.50% against an index return of 
11.49% and carries an attractive ongoing yield for clients, 
4.2% as at the end of April 2017.
The UK Absolute fund is turning into a star performer 
up 58% since the launch in September 2014 and one 
of the very few UK funds to be up over Brexit. The 
performance has not gone unnoticed and the fund size 
is now over £150m which should increase further once 
the crucial three year anniversary is reached, assuming 
performance is maintained.
We are justifiably proud of the above record and it 
demonstrates our commitment to being investment 
rather than marketing led in the teams we attract and  
the funds we launch. The simple lesson would seem to 
be that clients should back all our funds at launch and  
sit back and enjoy the long-term ride! 
I am excited at the prospect of handing over leadership 
of the Company to Gavin Rochussen over the coming 
weeks. His record of success at J O Hambro was 
exceptional and we are delighted that he has chosen 
Polar for the next chapter in his career.
Gavin’s success at J O Hambro was built around the 
same philosophy and values that we have at Polar and 
this together with his record of execution gives me great 
encouragement for the future of the Company. The 
focus will continue to be investment led with high alpha 
differentiated active product serving the needs of our 
clients, with capacity limits on funds appropriate to the 
underlying liquidity of the strategy.
There are undoubtedly challenges ahead for us as a 
Company and the industry in general but I believe 
significant opportunities too especially if one looks 
beyond the UK to the global wealth management 
industry. Gavin’s arrival is timely in that respect given 
his expertise in overseas business development and this 
will no doubt play a key role in our future growth in the 
coming years.
I would like to thank our many loyal clients and 
shareholders for their support during my tenure as CEO 
and to thank all our talented and dedicated employees 
who have delivered so much during the last seven and 
half of years. 
Whilst my involvement in the day-to-day operations 
of Polar is coming to an end I am very much looking 
forward to my continued association with the Company 
as non-executive Board member and major shareholder.

Financial Review
Introduction
Commentary on the results for the year follows in the 
sections below. Adjustments have been made to the 
2016 comparatives following reclassification of the seed 
capital investments and are explained under the heading 
'Prior year restatement' later in this report and in Note 
2.8. The net effect to the current year results has been 
that £0.5m of unrealised foreign exchange translation 
gains have been posted to other comprehensive income 
rather than profit and loss.
Results for the Year – Revenues
The quantum of management fees earned by the Group 
is a function of the AUM managed by the firm and the 
fee rate charged. This year there was an exceptional third 
material factor, the devaluation of Sterling. While the firm’s 
revenues are all recorded in Sterling the majority of the 
firm’s AUM are not sterling denominated, with dollar assets 
being the dominant constituent. 
At 31 March 2017 the value of the firm’s AUM was, in 
both Dollar and Sterling terms, higher than 12 months 
earlier. But the average AUM over the past 12 months was 
in Dollar terms lower compared to the previous year, in fact 
10% lower. The fact that management fee revenues only 
fell 3.4% compared to last year was a product of Sterling’s 
weakness post the BREXIT referendum.
The firm has a policy to hedge 50% of its non-Sterling 
revenues which has resulted in an overall dampening of 
the benefit of Sterling’s weakness and accounts for the 
£2.4m loss on forward currency hedging contracts.
The largest swing factor in the Group’s revenues was 
the year on year reduction in the performance fees 
generated, from £7.2m to £2.7m. The fall was a product 
of the generally disappointing performance delivered  
by our funds in calendar year 2016, a phenomenon  
that affected many active managers in the year.

Results for the Year – Costs
Total operating costs fell to £45.2m from £49.9m last year. 
The small increase in salaries, bonuses and other staff costs 
was a product of a small increase in head count in the firm 
as average staff numbers increased from 110 to 114.
The decrease in core distributions was a function of the 
fall in management fee revenues and the management 
fee profitability of the firm as well as the impact of 
implementing the Group’s Deferred Remuneration Plan 
(DRP) which came into effect during the year. For the year 
ending 31 March 2017 bonuses amounting to £1.7m have 
been deferred over a period of 3 years. Further details are 
provided in the Remuneration Report on pages 27 to 33 
and Note 3.5.
The National Insurance cost on share options is a product 
of and varies accordingly to the Company’s share price. 
The reduction in the provision is a product of the fall in 
the Company’s share price over the year.
The increase in other operating costs is a product of mainly 
two factors. The first is an increase, in Sterling terms, in 
Bloomberg cost which is US dollar based as the value of 
Sterling fell over the year. The second component is an 
increase in irrecoverable VAT costs as a result of the change 
in product mix impacting the Group’s recovery rate.
The fall in performance fee interests to £1.5m from  
£4.2m last year is directly correlated to the reduction  
in performance fee revenues.

Results for the Year – Profits
The headline profit before tax for the year has decreased to 
£20.4m from last year’s £23.6m (Restated – See Note 2.8).
The Group believes that the best measure of the Group’s 
profitability is the profit before share-based payments and 
tax. The reason for excluding the share-based payments 
charge is that the cost is dominated by the existence of the 
Group’s preference shares which as an instrument deliver, 
when they vest, an uplift to EPS and are not a detractor. 
On this basis the Group has delivered a fall in profits to 
£24.5m compared to last year’s £26.9m. The analysis of 
the different components of profits shows that:
 • Core operating profits 
the decrease in profits reflects the reduction in 
management fee revenues driven by the decrease  
in average value of assets managed over the year.
 • Performance fee profits 
weaker performance across the product range 
compared to last year has resulted in the reduction  
in performance fee profits.
 • Other income 
the increase in contribution is a product of the good 
performance of the seed investments held on the 
balance sheet.

*  Certain amounts shown here do not correspond to the 2016 annual

Preference Shares
A separate class of preference share can be issued by 
Polar Capital Partners Limited for purchase by each 
new team of fund managers on their arrival at the firm. 
These shares provide each manager with an economic 
interest in the funds that they run and ultimately enable 
the manager to convert their interest in the revenues 
generated from their funds into equity in Polar Capital 
Holdings plc. The equity is awarded in return for the 
forfeiture of their current core economic interest and 
vests over three years with the full quantum of the 
dilution being reflected in the diluted share count (and so 
diluted EPS) from the point of conversion. The event has 
been designed to be, at both the actual and the diluted 
levels, earnings enhancing to shareholders.
In the year to 31 March 2017 (as was also the case in the 
year to March 2016) there were no new conversions of 
preference shares into Polar Capital Holdings equity. 
As at 31 March 2017 three sets of preference shares 
have the ability to call for a conversion. The call has to be 
made on or before 30 November 2017 if any conversion 
is to take place with effect from 31 March 2017. It is the 
relative success and profitability of the funds represented 
by these three sets of preference share that accounts for 
the increased cost attributed to preference shares that has 
been identified above (2017: £3.2m versus 2016: £2.4m).
Balance Sheet and Cash
At the year end the cash balances of the Group were 
£58.5m (2016: £48.9m). The increase was mainly a 
product of the reduction, over the year, in the Group’s 
portfolio of seed investments. 
At the balance sheet date the Group held £22.1m of 
investments in its funds (2016: £40.1m). 
Capital Management
The Group believes in retaining a strong balance sheet. 
The capital that is retained in the business is used to 
either seed new investment products or if not so required 
is invested into the Group’s absolute return funds as 
investment capital. As at March 2017 there were £9.5m 
of investments and £12.6m of the Group’s balance sheet 
was invested to seed fledgling funds. 
The Group’s dividend policy is to distribute the majority  
of its earnings. 
Prior Year Restatement
The most significant accounting change has been the 
reclassification of our seed capital investment in the 
European Income Fund. On initial seeding in 2015 the 
Group planned to actively reduce its investment in 
this fund and it was expected that control would be 
relinquished within 12 months. Therefore the investment 
was initially classified as an asset held-for-sale. In 2016 
it was determined that the investment met the relevant 
criteria for continued classification as held-for-sale because 
the period to complete the loss of control had been 
delayed by events beyond the Group’s control and the 
Group remained committed to the original plan. 
During 2017 the seed investment in the European Income 
fund was still controlled by the Group and therefore 
ceased to meet the criteria for it to be continued to be 
accounted for as held-for-sale. 
Financial Review continued Strategic Report Overview Governance Financial Statements
13 Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2017
In accordance with the requirements of IFRS 5 the holding 
has been reclassified retrospectively and accounted for as 
a subsidiary consolidated on a line-by-line basis. 
Although the impact of the restatement, on a net basis, 
is immaterial to the face of the balance sheet (see Note 
2.8), the change from reporting the holding under the 
single line item of assets held-for-sale to line-by-line 
consolidation has necessitated some restatement of prior 
year numbers whereby the gross assets of the fund are 
now included in current assets as investment securities and 
the interest held by third parties are included in current 
liabilities as liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. 
The primary impact on the consolidated profit and loss 
account of restating the investment in the European 
Income fund, as a subsidiary, has been that foreign 
currency gains and losses on retranslating the Group’s 
investment in this Euro denominated fund are now 
recorded in equity, until such time as the investment is 
disposed. This has resulted in £0.5m of unrealised foreign 
currency translation gains in 2017 (2016: £0.6m) having  
to be excluded from the consolidated profit and loss 
account and posted to other comprehensive income  
(see Note 2.8).
Business Risk
There are a range of risks and uncertainties faced by the 
Group which are more fully described in the Strategic 
Report. Amongst the major risks to the business strategy 
is the loss of Assets Under Management due to markets 
falling, poor investment performance or the loss of key 
investment personnel. These events will not only have 
an immediate impact on the management fees earned 
by the Group but also deprive the Group of possible 
performance fees.
The Board having considered the impact on the business 
of the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union believe 
that Brexit should have little impact on the operations 
of the Group. The biggest unknown will be the 
impact on the US Dollar/Sterling exchange rates as the 
negotiations progress.
Going Concern
The Financial Reporting Council has determined that all 
companies should carry out a rigorous assessment of all 
the factors affecting the business in deciding to adopt a 
going concern basis for the preparation of the accounts.
The Directors have reviewed and examined the financial 
and other processes embedded in the business, in 
particular the annual budget process and the financial 
stress testing inherent in the Internal Capital Adequacy 
Assessment Process ('ICAAP'). On the basis of such 
review and the significant liquid assets underpinning 
the balance sheet relative to the Group’s predictable 
operating cost profile, the Directors consider that the 
adoption of a going concern basis, covering a period  
of at least 12 months from the date of this report,  
is appropriate.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The Group, as any business operating in the financial services sector, faces a number of challenges to 
its successful operation and development. The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are 
addressed through a risk management framework that provides a structured process for identifying, 
assessing and managing risks associated with the Group’s business objectives and strategy.
Risks arise from external sources as well as those which are inherent commercial risks in the market place and business, 
as well as operational risks contained in the systems and processes employed within the business.
The principal risks inherent in the Group’s business are economic and market, portfolio, key staff retention, regulatory 
and operational. These risks have been explained in further detail below.
Risk Category Description Mitigation
Economic and  
market risk
Economic risks arise from the concept, design and implementation of the Group’s business 
model. The Group operates in a highly competitive industry and if it is unable to compete 
effectively with its competitors its business could be adversely affected. Polar Capital’s key 
areas for competition include historical investment performance, its ability to attract and 
retain the best investment professionals and quality of service.
The Board reviews the business strategy periodically and considers financial, fund performance and operational 
information regularly. The Group’s reputation is one of its most important assets since it operates in an industry 
where integrity, customer trust and confidence are paramount. The Group’s in-house compliance and risk teams 
provide a system of internal controls which seek to ensure that events which could damage or call into question  
the reputation of the Group, its products or staff are prevented.
Portfolio risk Poor fund performance or adverse market conditions could lead to outflows of AUM and 
consequent damage to the financial position of the Group.
The Group has a formal Risk Committee that convenes monthly and is chaired by the Group’s Chief Risk Officer 
(‘CRO’) and comprises the Chief Executive, the Chief Operating Officer, the Global Head of Distribution and Mr 
Ashford-Russell. The Committee reviews all the portfolios managed by the Group and has presented to it analysis 
produced by the CRO relating to portfolio structure, exposure, concentration, returns, liquidity and risk. Portfolio 
managers present to this Committee on a regular basis or when requested.
Regular contact is maintained with all clients and fund investors and the strategy of the Group is to diversify its 
earnings streams to be less susceptible to such events.
The Group is also subject to the effects of exchange rate fluctuations as Sterling is the Group’s 
reporting currency but the Group’s business is often transacted in jurisdictions which generate 
revenue, expenses and liabilities in other currencies. A summary of the Group’s foreign 
currency exposures as at 31 March 2017 can be seen in Note 4.3(c) to the accounts.
The Group looks to hedge an appropriate element of its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
Key staff risk The Group has a number of key fund managers the loss of which could result in significant 
investor redemptions from the funds they manage and loss of revenue to the Group.
Through the Group culture, team support and providing each team with an economic interest in the success of 
their funds and the overall business the Group offers a highly attractive environment for investment professionals.
Regulatory risk Failure to comply with regulations, particularly those issued by the Financial Conduct 
Authority or the London Stock Exchange, could result in the Group losing the ability to 
operate as a regulated financial services business or its AIM quotation being suspended  
or withdrawn.
The Group’s investment activities are regulated primarily by the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK and the 
Group is also subject to regulation in the various other jurisdictions in which it operates. In the context of the 
current regulatory environment, the Board believes its regulated business has sufficient resources for compliance 
monitoring and to take corrective action when warranted.
The Group seeks to operate within applicable Financial Conduct Authority Principles, Rules and Regulations and 
those issued by the London Stock Exchange to govern the trading of the Company’s shares on AIM.
The Board through the work of the Audit Committee receives and reviews regular reports on the compliance 
controls in place to prevent or detect any non-compliance of the Group with rules and regulations.
The Audit Committee Report on pages 24 to 26 provides further details on the work undertaken.
Operational risk Operational risk arises from potentially inadequate or failed processes, from people and 
also from external events. Operational risk has financial and non-financial impacts and 
the Group’s objective is to manage and mitigate risk exposure by ensuring operational risk 
policies are developed and applied consistently and effectively throughout the Group.
If any of the Group’s financial, accounting or other data processing systems do not operate 
properly or are disabled or, if there are other failures in the Group’s internal processes, 
people or systems, the Group could suffer financial loss, business disruption, liability to 
clients, regulatory problems or damage to its reputation.
The Group also relies, through its outsourcing arrangements, on a number of third-party 
providers of administration and other back office functions which expose the Group to the 
risk of failure of a key third party supplier.
The Group’s core businesses have in place disaster recovery plans covering current business requirements, which 
are tested annually to ensure an appropriate level of resilience in the day to day operations and minimise the risk  
of severe disruption occurring.
The Group is satisfied that the recovery capability remains appropriate. Furthermore, the Group also looks to 
ensure that its suppliers of administration and IT services and other back office functions have disaster recovery 
plans and business continuity plans. 
The Board regularly reviews statements on internal controls and procedures and has on an annual basis subjected 
the Group to an annual internal control audit carried out in accordance with ISAE 3402 – Assurance Reports on 
Controls at a Service Organisation. Strategic Report Overview Governance Financial Statements

Corporate Governance
The Board of Directors recognises the importance of good corporate governance and intends that best practice is 
adopted and applied in so far as it is appropriate for a company and group of its size and stage of development. As 
an AIM traded Company the UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) does 
not apply, however the Board intends to comply with the requirements of the Corporate Governance guidelines 
published by the Quoted Companies Alliance (the ‘QCA Guidelines’) for AIM companies and with certain of the 
principal requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code. This report describes how the Company has applied 
the principles of good corporate governance throughout the year and steps which are being taken to develop the 
corporate policies. Governance

The Board
Composition
With the exception of Win Robbins, who joined the Board on 22 June 2017, the Directors who served during the year 
are listed on pages 16 and 17 together with their individual biographies. 
At the date of this report the Board comprises of two executive Directors, Tim Woolley and John Mansell and seven 
Non-executive Directors. As previously announced Gavin Rochussen is joining the Company on 17 July 2017 as Chief 
Executive and will be appointed a Director. Tim Woolley will relinquish his executive duties on that date and continue 
as a non-executive Director.
In assessing the independence of non-executive Directors at the date of this report, the Board took account of their 
experience, character and judgment, and their dependence on, or relationships with the Group. In all cases the Board 
felt the Directors were independent in character and judgment, however the guidance issued on independence by 
both the QCA and the UK Corporate Governance Code, generally used to assess independence, consider the holding 
of a previous executive position within the Group, or a material business relationship with the Group including 
shareholdings, to impair the perceived independence of the non-executive Director. In light of this the Board has 
decided that Brian Ashford-Russell should not be considered independent as he previously held an executive position 
with the Group and that Jamie Cayzer-Colvin and George Bumeder should not be considered to be independent due 
to the fact that the companies that employ them have sizeable shareholdings and investments in the Group. Tom 
Bartlam, Hugh Aldous, Win Robbins and Michael Thomas are considered independent non-executive Directors and 
are free from any associations or relationships with the Group or its investment funds except for the fees they receive 
as Directors and any shares they may hold in the Group.
Tim Woolley will not be considered as an independent director when he assumes a non-executive role.
Role and responsibilities
The Board as a whole is responsible for the Group’s objectives and policies and the proper governance of the 
Company. The Board has a formal agenda of items for consideration at each scheduled meeting but it may also meet 
at additional times when required.
The Board provides overall strategic direction to the executive management by monitoring the operating and financial 
results against plans and budgets; reviewing the performance of management; assessing the adequacy of risk 
management systems and monitoring their application; setting the Company’s values and standards; and ensuring that 
the Company’s obligations to its shareholders and others are understood and met. The posts of Chairman and Chief 
Executive are held by different Directors.
The Chairman’s primary role is to ensure that the Board and individual Directors are able to operate efficiently by 
setting the agenda, style and tone of Board discussions to promote constructive debate and effective decision making.
The Chairman carries out a review of the Board and each Director’s performance and reports to the Board his findings. 
The role of the Chairman is appraised by Brian Ashford-Russell and reported to the Board.
Tim Woolley in his capacity as Chief Executive has led the executive management team which met regularly and is primarily 
responsible for the implementation of the Board’s policies and strategies, effective communication with shareholders, 
ensuring that all Board members develop an understanding of the views of investors and for managing the activities of the 
Company other than in relation to those matters specifically reserved to the Board or delegated to its committees.
The role of the non-executive Directors is to challenge constructively, and contribute to, the development of strategy; 
to scrutinise the performance of management in meeting agreed goals and objectives, monitor their performance; 
and, through the various committees, to satisfy themselves that financial information is accurate and that financial 
controls and systems of risk management are robust and defensible.
All Directors receive appropriate and timely information to ensure that they are properly briefed in advance of 
Board meetings and have unlimited access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and other senior 
management should further information be required. The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Chairman 
and the Board on governance matters.
A procedure has been established for non-executive Directors to have access to independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense where they judge it necessary to discharge their responsibilities as Directors.
The Group maintains Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, which is reviewed annually to ensure that cover is held 
at an appropriate level. Strategic Report Overview Governance Financial Statements
21 Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2017
The Board has established guidelines requiring specific matters to be decided by the full Board of Directors, including 
material acquisitions and disposals, investments and capital projects. Matters that are reserved for the Board are 
generally forwarded to the Board for consideration with a recommendation from the executive management or 
appropriate committee.
Conflicts of Interests
The Companies Act 2006 (‘the Act’) imposes a duty on Directors to avoid a situation in which they have or could have 
a conflict of interest or possible conflict with the interests of the Company.
Only Directors not involved in the conflict or potential conflict participate in the authorisation process. Directors, in 
deciding whether to authorise a situation, take into account their duty to promote the Company’s success. The Board 
as part of its year-end has considered the register of conflicts, any conditions imposed on such conflicts or potential 
conflicts and the operation of the notification and authorisation process. They concluded that the process has 
operated effectively during the period and no changes were required.
Directors’ appointment, induction and training 
In accordance with the Articles of Association, all new Directors appointed by the Board are required to seek election 
by shareholders at the next general meeting of the Company following their appointment and subsequently all 
Directors are required to retire by rotation.
On appointment, new Directors are offered induction and training considered appropriate by the Board and 
subsequently as necessary.
Details of the Directors retiring at the Annual General Meeting are given in the separate Notice of Meeting. 
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control including financial operational 
compliance and risk management controls.
The Group’s fund management activity is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom (FCA), the 
Jersey Financial Services Commision (JFSC) and the Securities Exchange Commission of the USA (SEC) and the Board has 
adopted procedures and controls designed to ensure its obligations under UK and EU legislation, the FCA Rules and the 
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 as well as the SEC Rules and the Investment Advisors Act are met.
The Group’s system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives. It is recognised that such a system can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Audit Committee, as part of its role, has reviewed and monitored the effectiveness of the internal controls for 
the year ended 31 March 2017 and concluded that there was a satisfactory process in place to identify and manage 
such risks.
Board meetings
The Board meets regularly and as required. There have been seven Board meetings held in the year. All the Directors 
attended all Board meetings with one exception when Jamie Cayzer-Colvin, who was abroad, and was unable to 
connect by telephone but conferred with the Chairman shortly afterwards.
Board Committees
The Board has created and delegated certain specific areas of responsibility to a number of standing committees. 
The Board sees minutes of all committee meetings and the chairman of the committee reports to the Board on any 
significant matters. The Board also receives copies of all minutes from subsidiary companies for information.
Allotment Committee
This committee which is comprised of any two Directors was created to allot and issue shares arising from the exercise 
of Board approved share awards or shares arising from previously Board approved crystallisations of fund manager 
preference share arrangements. Governance

Directors of the Company together with evaluation of Directors’ performance and effectiveness.
The Nomination Committee met twice to consider management succession and oversee the selection of  
Gavin Rochussen and Win Robbins as Directors. 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Michael Thomas and other members of the Committee are Jamie Cayzer-
Colvin, Tom Bartlam and George Bumeder. The Committee has general oversight of all remuneration arrangements for 
executive Directors and senior managers and it considers all material elements of remuneration policy, remuneration 
and incentives with reference to independent remuneration research and professional advice. Recommendations are 
made to the Board on the framework for executive remuneration including the design and implementation of equity 
based incentive schemes.
The Remuneration Committee met twice to consider the remuneration for Gavin Rochussen, as well as bonus, salary, share 
option awards and deferment arrangements for staff and the remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors.
Information on the Directors’ Remuneration is provided on pages 27 to 33.
Relations with Shareholders
The Company welcomes dialogue with institutional shareholders in order to achieve a mutual understanding of 
objectives. The Chief Executive and the Finance Director seek meetings with larger institutional shareholders and 
private client stockbrokers after the announcement of year end and half year results. The AGM also provides a forum 
for investors to meet the Directors, both formally and informally. The Chairmen of the Board’s Committees will usually 
be available to answer questions at the AGM of the Company.
The Group’s website (www.polarcapital.co.uk) contains regularly updated information regarding the Group’s funds, 
and is where all announcements and shareholder reports are published.

Corporate Social Responsibility
The Board recognises that it should take account of the needs of society and the environment and maintain high 
ethical standards. It takes collective responsibility for Corporate Social Responsibility (‘CSR’) policy and has focused on: 
staff welfare; respecting the environment; and treating customers fairly. The extent to which individual principles have 
been formalised is appropriate to the size of the organisation and these are documented in both the staff handbook 
and the compliance manual. Appropriate steps have been taken in relation to the anti bribery act and modern slavery 
act and a statement is available on the Company’s website. The Company also has a whistleblowing policy and has 
appointed Mr Aldous as a whistleblower’s champion.
Staff welfare and gender diversity
The Group’s success is largely dependent on recruiting, retaining, and developing the best financial services 
professionals. To achieve this the Group seeks to ensure that working conditions are of a high standard and has in 
place good and effective management and staff communications, with the ability for staff to engage in decisions. The 
Group also encourages participation in the success of the business through share options and has a range of benefits 
to support staff, including ill health protection and life cover. The Group is committed to equal opportunities and 
diversity in staff selection and opportunities for promotion, with appropriate consideration being given to applications 
for employment from disabled persons.
The Group aims to remunerate staff in line with market practice, to provide development opportunities and to 
encourage staff motivation and retention.
The environment
The Group has implemented processes to manage environmental risks so as to reduce, reuse and recycle, wherever 
possible, waste materials within its place of business.

Audit Committee Report
The constitution and composition of the Audit Committee is given below. There have been no changes over the 
financial year to 31 March 2017.
The Committee is chaired by Mr Aldous and comprises, Mr Cayzer-Colvin and Mr Thomas. Mr Bartlam is also a member 
of the Committee in his role as Chairman of the Board not only due to his experience but also to enable him to be kept 
fully informed of any issues as they arise. The Board is satisfied that the Committee has sufficient recent and relevant 
financial experience in the sector in which the company operates to discharge its function effectively. The experience of 
the members of the Committee can be assessed from the Director’s biographies set out on pages 16 and 17.
During the year the Committee met three times, with all members attending each meeting, and considered the 
following issues:
 • the appropriateness and any changes to the accounting policies of the Group including any judgements required  
by such policies and the reasonableness of such;
 • the scope of the annual audit and agreement with the external auditor of the key areas of focus;
 • the reports from the external auditor concerning their audit of the annual financial statements of the Group;
 • the report from the external auditor concerning their review of the description and suitability of the Group’s 
internal controls in accordance with ISAE 3402;
 • the financial disclosures contained in the annual and interim reports to shareholders;
 • reports from management and the auditor on the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal financial control 
including the Risk Map and ICAAP requirements;
 • the independence and objectivity of the external auditor and the level and nature of non-audit services provided 
by them;
 • the performance of the external auditor and the level of fees charged for their services;
 • the policy for non-audit services which may be provided by the auditor; and
 • a presentation from the executive management on the ability of the Group to continue operations for the 
foreseeable future and allow the Board to form an opinion on Going Concern.
Efficacy of Audit Process
The Committee monitored and evaluated the effectiveness of the auditor and any changes in the terms of their 
appointment based on an assessment of their performance, qualification, knowledge, expertise and resources. 
Audit independence was also considered along with other factors such as audit planning and accounting standards 
interpretations. This evaluation has been carried out throughout the year by meetings held with the auditor, review  
of the audit process and comments from management and others involved in the audit process.
The auditor is provided with an opportunity to address the Committee without the executive management present 
to raise any concerns or discuss any matters relating to the audit work and the cooperation of the management in 
providing any information and the quality of that information including the timeliness in responding to audit requests.
Consideration of the Annual Report and Financial Statements
The Committee performed its role through monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Group and the 
system of accounting to ensure compliance with relevant and appropriate accounting standards. The scope of the audit 
was agreed in advance with a focus on areas of audit risk and the appropriate level of audit materiality. The auditor 
reported on the results of the audit work to the Committee and highlighted any issue which the audit work had 
discovered or the Committee had previously identified as significant or material in context of the financial statements.
Consideration of the Semi-annual Report and Financial Statements
The Committee considered and reviewed the semi-annual report and financial statements which were not  
audited or reviewed by the external auditor to ensure consistency with the accounting policies used in the  
annual financial statements. Strategic Report Overview Governance Financial Statements
25 Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2017
Non-audit Work
During the year the Committee established a policy for non-audit services supplied by the Group’s auditor.  
The policy has been established to safeguard the independence and objectivity of the Group’s external auditor.  
The policy provides that certain non-audit services are not permitted under any circumstances and that the committee 
will be required to consider and pre-approve any non-audit services before the external auditor is engaged.
The Committee has discussed the specific non-audit activities provided by the auditor to ensure that none of these 
services would put the auditor in the position of auditing their own work. The Committee has also carried out a 
review of the non-audit services to satisfy itself that these are provided within the policy and have been delivered in 
an efficient and cost effective way. The Audit Committee believes the objectivity and independence of the auditor is 
maintained, notwithstanding that non-audit work may be undertaken.
Overview of Risk
The Committee has responsibility to assist the Board in maintaining an effective internal control environment and to 
that end examines and receives reports on the Group’s regulatory capital adequacy requirements, compliance, and 
control procedures and systems for managing risks arising from the operation of the business, its financial position or 
the regulatory environment which governs it.
Risk is managed throughout the business and the Group has established a Risk Map which seeks to identify, quantify, 
measure and mitigate as far as possible those risks through a Risk Monitoring Programme (‘RMP’).
The Chief Compliance Officer (‘CCO’) manages the overall RMP and risk maps of all business areas. The RMP sets the 
framework under which risks are managed and controlled in adherence with the risk strategy outlined by the Board. 
To capture all risks to the Group, four business areas (Fund Management, Sales & Marketing, Overseas Offices and 
Infrastructure) are assessed against eight macro control objectives The CCO reports the outcome of the RMP to the 
Group’s Audit Committee as part of the ICAAP.
The Chief Risk Officer monitors risk and chairs the Internal Investment Risk Committee which sits on a monthly 
basis to review individual fund and group level risks and ensures that fund managers do not exceed the risk and 
investment parameters.
The Chief Operating Officer (‘COO’) has responsibility for operational risk. Risks are identified, assessed and monitored. 
The COO chairs the Operational Risk Committee which sits on a monthly basis.
Appointment of Auditor and Tenure
The Committee also considers by way of meetings and reports, the appointment, remuneration and work of the auditor.
Ernst & Young LLP have provided audit services to the Group from 2002 and these have continued through the period 
from its initial public offering in February 2007 to date. The Committee has considered the need for the rotation of the 
audit firm and is satisfied with the performance of the auditor and does not consider it necessary to put the external 
audit out to tender.
There are no contractual obligations restricting the choice of external auditor.
The Committee having considered the above factors consider it appropriate to recommend to the Board and 
shareholders that Ernst & Young LLP be reappointed as auditor at the AGM.
Ernst & Young LLP have agreed to offer themselves for reappointment as auditor of the Group in accordance with 
section 487(2) of the Companies Act 2006 and a resolution requesting approval of their reappointment and to 
authorise the Directors to determine their remuneration will be presented at the AGM. Governance
 Polar Capital Holdings plc 26
Significant Issues in Relation to the Financial Statements
The Committee held discussions with Group management and the auditor with regards to:
 • the significant judgments and estimation uncertainties described in Note 2.4.
Following these discussions and its review of the treatments applied and associated financial statement disclosures,  
the Committee was satisfied that these matters had been appropriately addressed.
Conclusions in Respect of the Annual Report and Financial Statements
The production and the audit of the Group’s Annual Report and Financial Statements is a comprehensive process 
requiring input from a number of different contributors. In order to reach a conclusion that the Annual Report is fair, 
balanced and understandable, the Board has requested that the Committee advise on whether it considers these 
criteria satisfied. In so doing the Committee has given consideration to the following:
 • the comprehensive control framework over the production of the Annual Report, including the verification 
processes in place to deal with the factual content;
 • the extensive levels of review are undertaken in the production process, by the management and the Committee; and
 • a clean ISAE 3402 report confirming the effectiveness of internal control.
As a result of the work performed, the Committee has concluded that the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 
2017, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy, and has reported on these findings to the Board.

27 Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2017
The constitution and composition of the Remuneration Committee is given on page 22. 
The Company is not subject to the large and Medium Sized Companies and Group (Accounts and Reports) 
(amendment) Regulations 2013 as it is not a company which is listed on a regulated market. Although the 
Company does not have to prepare a Policy Report or Implementation Report the Committee wishes to ensure that 
shareholders have a clear understanding of the remuneration paid by the Company and how the Committee has 
discharged it obligations. The Board has also decided to submit this report for shareholders approval at the AGM 
as a mechanism for shareholders to indicate their views on these arrangements. The Company will engage with 
shareholders if there is significant dissent shown over the remuneration paid.
I am pleased to take this opportunity to summarise the Company’s remuneration strategy and the way it has been 
implemented during year under review.
Remuneration Committee Activities During the Year
The Remuneration Committee met twice over the past year and discussed the following:
 • consideration of the package for the new CEO, Gavin Rochussen;
 • a review of executive remuneration and, consistent with good practice, has implemented a more performance-
based reward system in which the new CEO will participate;
 • the remuneration of the Executive Directors of the Group, including bonuses for the year;
 • recommendations from the executive management for remuneration packages for existing and new fund managers
 • recommended salary levels for 2017 and bonus payments for 2016/17 across the Group; and
 • the requirements for deferment and the method to be used.
Remuneration Payable for the Year Under Review
When setting Executive Director remuneration the Committee considers a range of factors including strategic goals, 
the Group’s overall success as well as personal performance. Despite the challenging market conditions, the year saw 
good progress against strategic objectives including the hiring of the UK Value Opportunities team and the successful 
launch of their first fund, a continuing pipeline of recruitment activity and a strong overall financial position for the 
Group. These factors are reflected in the Executive Director remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2017 as set  
out in the Remuneration Implementation Report.
Implementation of the Group Deferred Remuneration Plan
During the year the Group implemented its Deferred Remuneration Plan (DRP) which all Group employees eligible 
for a bonus over a certain level, as determined by the Remuneration Committee, are required to participate in. The 
DRP provides for compulsory deferral of a proportion of bonus over a three year vesting period. The introduction of 
the DRP will ensure variable compensation is better linked to long-term performance and bring the Group closer to 
impending regulatory requirements around deferral arrangements.
Appointment of new Chief Executive and Review of Executive Remuneration
As announced in January 2017, Gavin Rochussen will be joining Polar as Chief Executive in July 2017. Gavin brings a 
wealth of experience to the team and will be fundamental to achieving the ambitious growth plans of the business. 
His starting annual base salary has been set at £350,000. On appointment, Gavin will be awarded a deferred interest 
in three million pounds value of ordinary shares in Polar Capital Holdings plc.
The Remuneration Committee also carried out a review of executive remuneration and, consistent with good practice, 
has implemented a more performance-based reward system in which the new CEO will participate. The incentive 
plan will ensure there is greater alignment between executive pay and Company performance. Under the plan and 
consistent with typical practice in the asset management industry, the variable remuneration for the CEO and other 
Executive Directors will be based on a share of an executive variable pay pool, with the pool determined as a specified 
proportion of the Group’s pre-tax and pre-executive variable pay profits. 
Remuneration Committee Report Governance
 Polar Capital Holdings plc 28
This executive variable pay pool will be used to deliver both annual bonuses and performance-based long-term incentives. 
 • Up to 200% of salary will be put towards an annual bonus. The actual amount payable will be based on 
performance against criteria and targets that are designed and agreed by the Remuneration Committee at the 
start of each year, with a portion of the bonus being delivered in shares which vest over 3 years and are subject 
to forfeiture provisions. 
 • The remaining balance (less 200% of salary put towards the annual bonus) will be delivered in the form of performance 
shares (face value of award and structured as nil cost options) which will vest depending on performance over a  
three-year performance period. Vested awards will vest in equal tranches over 3, 4 and 5 years. 
It is expected that Gavin Rochussen’s first share award under this arrangement will be granted in July 2018 and will 
be subject to an Adjusted EPS growth measure, with demanding EPS hurdles requiring a minimum growth in EPS 
of 15%p.a. and full vesting set at 25%p.a. or higher. The Committee believes that this represents a very demanding 
target and therefore provides strong alignment with the interests of shareholders, reflecting the Company’s desire to 
grow the business over the medium-term.
This review has coincided with the expiry of the existing Equity Incentive Plan (EIP). A new Executive Incentive Plan 
was approved by the Board in December 2016 which renewed the share option plan as well as providing for a Long-
Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). The LTIP will facilitate the implementation of the above structure and includes recovery and 
withholding provisions.
Approach to Remuneration in 2017/18
 • The general salary increase across the group will be 4% to take effect from 1 April 2017. Salaries for the Executive 
Directors remain unchanged.
 • An award of share options to selected staff will be made at market price.
 • The all-employee Save As You Earn scheme will continue with an invitation to all employees in 2017, the scheme 
having been renewed at last year’s AGM.
The Committee believes that the remuneration approach will both support and motivate our senior team whilst 
aligning them both to the Company’s strategic objectives and to achieving long-term growth for our shareholders.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy Summary
The overall aim of our remuneration strategy is to provide appropriate incentives that reflect the Group’s high 
performance culture and values. In summary, we aim to:
 • attract, retain and motivate high calibre, high performing employees; and
 • encourage strong performance and engagement, both in the short and the long-term, to enable the Group to 
achieve its strategic objectives.
The total remuneration package is structured so that a significant proportion is linked to performance conditions 
measured over both the short-term and longer-term. 
When setting the levels of short-term and long-term variable remuneration and the balance of equity and cash within 
the package, consideration is given to obtaining the appropriate balance so as not to encourage unnecessary risk-
taking, whilst ensuring that performance hurdles are suitably challenging. 
The table below summarises the key aspects of the Company’s remuneration policy: 
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation
Base salary To attract and retain executives 
of a suitable calibre for the 
duties required by being 
market competitive.
Reviewed annually by the Committee, taking account of Company 
performance, individual performance, changes in responsibility 
and levels of increase for the broader staff population.
The Committee considers the impact of any basic salary increase  
on the total remuneration package.
Benefits To provide market  
competitive benefits.
The Company typically provides the following:
 • Private medical cover
 • Life Insurance
 • Income protection scheme to cover long-term illness.
Pension To provide market  
competitive benefits. 
Defined contribution or cash in lieu of pension equal to 10%  
of base salary. 
Variable Pay
Annual  
bonus
To drive and reward 
performance against annual 
objectives which are consistent 
with the strategy and aligns 
to shareholder interests.
An executive variable pay pool is formed based on 12% of the pre-
tax and executive variable compensation profits. The Committee 
determines an individual’s allocation of the variable compensation pool.
Of this allocation, up to 200% of salary may be earned as annual 
bonus. The actual bonus paid is dependent on the overall success 
of the Company (financial and non-financial) and personal 
contribution.
No less than 60%of the bonus amount is delivered in the form 
of a deferred bonus award. Awards under the deferred bonus 
award take the form of shares or nil cost options over Polar Capital 
Holdings plc shares.
Long-term 
incentives 
(‘LTIP’)
To encourage and reward 
delivery of the Company’s 
long-term strategic objectives 
and provide alignment with 
shareholders.
The remaining balance of an individual’s share of the variable pay 
pool (less the potential to earn 200% of salary in annual bonus) 
will be granted in the form of LTIP awards. The LTIP awards are 
structured as nil cost options and will vest subject to performance 
and continued employment. 
Vesting of LTIP awards is determined by reference to performance 
assessed over a period of at least three years, typically based on EPS 
growth targets.
Prior to each grant, the Committee may determine that alternative 
measures apply as long as they are aligned with the company’s 
strategic objectives and long-term shareholder value. Governance
 Polar Capital Holdings plc 30
Remuneration Committee Report continued
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation
Deferred 
Remuneration 
Plan (DRP)
The DRP provides a 
deferral element to variable 
compensation above a certain 
level to ensure there is a link to 
the longer-term performance 
of the Company.
All Group employees, including Executive Directors, eligible for 
a bonus over a certain level, as determined by the Remuneration 
Committee, are required to participate in the DRP. The plan provides 
for compulsory deferral of a proportion of bonus over a 3 year 
deferral period. Deferrals can be made either into shares in the 
Company, units in the Group’s funds or left as cash.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to increase the extent 
to which variable compensation is deferred, if required to satisfy 
future regulatory requirements.
Non-Executive Director fees
Fee paid  
in cash
To attract and retain a high-
calibre Chairman and Non-
Executive Directors by offering 
a market competitive fee level.
The Chairman is paid a single fee for all his responsibilities. The 
Non-Executives are paid a basic fee assessed on their contribution, 
links to substantial investors and level of responsibilities.
The level of these fees is reviewed periodically by the Committee and 
Chief Executive for the Chairman and by the Chairman and Executive 
Directors for the Non-Executive Directors, with reference to market 
levels and a recommendation is then made to the Board.
The Committee in reviewing these fees considers the extra work 
undertaken by the Chairmen of the Board Committees and may pay 
an additional fee to reflect these responsibilities if felt appropriate. Strategic Report Overview Governance Financial Statements

Service Contracts & Payments for Loss of Office
The Remuneration Committee reviews the contractual terms for new Executive Directors to ensure that these reflect 
best practice. 
Service contracts normally continue until the Director’s agreed retirement date or such other date as the parties agree. 
The service contracts contain provision for early termination. Notice periods given by the employing company are 
limited to 12 months or less.
A Director’s service contract may be terminated without notice and without any further payment or compensation, 
except for sums accrued up to the date of termination, on the occurrence of certain events such as gross misconduct. 
If the employing company terminates the employment of an Executive Director in other circumstances, compensation 
is limited to salary due for any unexpired notice period and any amount assessed by the Remuneration Committee as 
representing the value of other contractual benefits (including pension) which would have been received during the 
period. Payments in lieu of notice are not pensionable. In the event of a change of control of the Company there is no 
enhancement to contractual terms. 
The Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment, setting out the terms and conditions of their appointment 
and their expected time commitment. It is the Company’s policy that Non-Executive Directors should be appointed for 
an initial period of three years (from the next general meeting following their initial appointment in the case of new 
Non-Executive Directors) and that they may be re-appointed for further terms of three years each. Re-appointment at 
the end of such periods should not be considered automatic and each Director’s contribution will be carefully assessed. 
The letters of appointment provide for termination of the Director’s appointment under certain circumstances and in 
all cases without any compensation. 
None of the Non-Executive Directors have any ongoing direct financial or contractual interests in the Company other 
than their fees and shareholdings as disclosed in this report.

Conditions of Option awards
The options granted to Tim Woolley and John Mansell are subject to the requirement that in order to exercise the 
option the option holder must be employed by, or be an officer of, the Company on the relevant vesting date subject 
to certain defined ‘good leaver’ situations. The options have been issued in accordance with the rules of the Polar 
Capital Equity Incentive Plan, by the use of the provisions relating to Equity Settled Share Appreciation Rights (‘ESARS’). 
The use of the ESARS provisions allows the Company to issue to the option holder only the number of shares that 
would equate to the number of shares over which the option becomes exercisable less the number of shares that 
would have needed to be sold to fund the purchase of that number of shares on the exercise date.  Strategic Report Overview Governance Financial Statements

The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the Group financial statements in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom law and those International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the 
European Union and for preparing the parent company financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting 
Standard 102 (FRS 102).
The Directors are required to prepare financial statements for each financial year which present a true and fair view of 
the financial position of the Group and parent company and the financial performance and cash flows of the Group 
for that period. In preparing those financial statements the Directors are required to:
 • select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 • present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
 • provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS and FRS 102 respectively is 
insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the 
Group’s and parent company’s financial position and financial performance; and
 • state that the Group and parent company have complied with IFRS and FRS 102, respectively, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Disclosure of Information to the Auditor
Each of the Directors at the date of approval of this report confirms that so far as the Director is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information, being information needed by the auditor in connection with preparing its report, of which 
the Group’s auditor is unaware. Having made enquiries of fellow Directors and the Group’s auditor, each Director has 
taken all the steps that he is obliged to have taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group’s auditor is aware of the information.
Going Concern
The Board with guidance from the Audit Committee has made an assessment of the Group’s position as at 31 March 
2017 and the factors impacting the forthcoming year are set out in the Strategic Report and in the Directors’ Report 
which incorporates the corporate governance statements.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, and its liquidity position are described in the Financial Review on 
pages 10 to 13. Note 4.3 to the financial statements include the Group’s policies and process for managing its capital; 
its financial risk management objectives; details of financial instruments; and hedging activities. Exposure to credit risk 
and liquidity risk are also disclosed.
The Group has considerable financial resources and after making enquiries the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future 
despite the continued uncertain economic outlook. Accordingly the Directors continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.

Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the Audit of the Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud  
or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the  
parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness  
of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of 
performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider  
the implications for our report.
Opinion on Financial Statements
In our opinion:
 • the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent Company’s  
affairs as at 31 March 2017 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
 • the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the  
European Union; 
 • the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom General Accepted Accounting Practice), including FRS 102 ‘The Financial 
Reporting Standard applicable to the UK and Republic of Ireland’; and
 • the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on Other Matter Prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 • based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit
 • the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
 • the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements.

 • certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 • we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Section 2: Basis of Preparation and Other Significant Policies
This section provides additional information about the overall basis of preparation that the Directors consider is  
useful and relevant in understanding these consolidated financial statements:
 • Summary of other significant accounting policies affecting the results and financial position of the Group, including 
changes in accounting policies and disclosures during the year.
 • Standards that have been issued but not yet adopted by the Group.
2.1. Basis of preparation
The consolidated Group financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified by the 
measurement at fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments. The consolidated 
financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000), except when 
otherwise stated. Financial Statements

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 March 2017
2.2. Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group comprise the financial statements of the Company and its 
subsidiaries as at 31 March 2017. Subsidiaries are those entities over which the Group has control. The Group  
controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has:
 • power over the investee; 
 • exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
 • the ability to use its power over the investee to affect returns.
The Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including 
the purpose and design of an investee, relevant activities, substantive and protective rights, voting rights and potential 
voting rights.
Seed capital investments in funds that the Group manages are accounted for as subsidiaries, associates or financial 
assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) depending on the holdings of the Group, on the level of influence 
and control that the Group is judged to have and whether the Group assesses it is acting as an agent or principal for its 
holdings in the seed capital investments. There is no fixed minimum percentage at which the Group consolidates, and 
each exposure is reviewed individually.
Where the Group concludes it is acting as a principal the entity is consolidated. This assessment is based on the 
Group’s total exposure. This incorporates direct holdings, income earned from management and performance fees  
and the assessed strength of third-party kick-out rights.
The Group concludes that it acts as an agent when the power it has over the fund is deemed to be exercised for the 
benefit of third-party investors.
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes 
to one or more of the three elements of control. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the Group 
obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date when such control ceases.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company and 
where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of the subsidiaries to bring their accounting  
policies in line with those of the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated  
on consolidation.
Where external investors hold redeemable shares in funds controlled by the Group, the portion of profit or loss and net 
assets held by these third-party interests is included within other income in the consolidated statement of profit or loss 
and as financial liabilities at FVTPL in the consolidated balance sheet respectively.
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the related assets, liabilities, third-party interest and 
other components of equity, while any resultant gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any investment retained is 
recognised at fair value.
Net cashflows on initial consolidation or deconsolidation are presented as investing activities within the consolidated 
cashflow statement. Cashflows from third-party interests into consolidated funds are presented as financing activities.
2.3. Investment in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate 
in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control over those policies.
Generally, it is presumed that the Group has significant influence where it has voting rights of 20% or more, but not 
control of an investee.
Seed capital investments over which the Group has significant influence, but not control, are carried in the balance 
sheet as assets at FVTPL as permitted by IAS 28: Investment in Associates, with changes in fair value recognised in 
the consolidated statement profit or loss. The fair value of investments in associates is determined by reference to the 
quoted price or net asset value of the underlying investments at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
The Group has no other investments in associates and, therefore, no associates are currently accounted for using the 
equity method. Strategic Report Overview Governance Financial Statements

2.4. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make critical accounting 
estimates and assumptions. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s 
accounting policies. The Group bases its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the consolidated 
financial statements were prepared. Where circumstances and parameters change, the original estimates and assumptions 
are modified in the period in which the change occurs. The areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the 
Group’s consolidated financial statements are set out in the following notes:
 • Share-based payments (Note 3.6);
 • Deferred tax (Note 4.2); and
 • Consolidation of seed capital investments (Note 2.2).
2.5. Foreign currency
(i) Functional and presentational currency
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling which is also the functional currency for the 
Company. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of 
each entity are measured using that functional currency.
(ii) Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group entities at their respective functional currency rates 
prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated 
at the functional currency spot rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date. Non-monetary items, such as plant and 
equipment, that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at 
the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items, such as investments in equity instruments, measured at fair value 
in a foreign currency are translated using exchange rates at the date fair value is determined. All exchange differences are 
recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss within operating costs.
(iii) Consolidation
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas subsidiaries whose functional currency is not Sterling are 
translated at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated at average exchange 
rates for the accounting period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and are 
reclassified to the consolidated statement of profit or loss on disposal of the relevant overseas subsidiary.
2.6. Fair value of financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets at each reporting date is determined by reference 
to quoted market prices or dealer price quotation (bid price for long positions and ask price for short positions), without 
any deduction for transaction costs. For financial instruments not traded in an active market, such as forward exchange 
contracts, the fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques that take into account the terms and 
conditions of the contracts and utilise observable market data, such as spot and forward rates, as inputs.
2.7. New standards and amendments not yet effective
The following new standards and amendments to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for  
the Group’s accounting periods beginning after 1 January 2018 or later periods, but the Group has decided not to early 
adopt them:

2.8. Restatement of comparatives
(a)  During the year the Group ceased to classify its seed capital investment in the European Income fund as held for 
sale as the criteria for such recognition were no longer met. The Group has determined that it controls the fund 
under IFRS 10 and it is deemed to be a subsidiary of the Group. As a result, the comparatives have been amended 
retrospectively as though the fund had never qualified as held for sale, as required by IFRS 5, and the Group had 
consolidated the fund on a line by line basis from the date of initial investment.
(b)  During the year the group has determined that it controls the Group Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) and it is deemed 
to be a subsidiary. As a result, the consolidated financial statements have been restated at 1 April 2015 to reflect 
cash held by the EBT of £114,000, expenses of £19,000 and a corresponding credit to reserves of £132,000.
The restatements have been made to each of the affected financial statement line items for prior periods, as follows:

Section 3: Detailed Information on Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Consolidated 
Statement of Other Comprehensive Income Items
This section provides additional information about individual line items in the statement of profit or loss and statement 
of comprehensive income, including the relevant accounting policies.
3.1. Revenue
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents fees receivable (excluding value added tax) during the period for discretionary investment 
management services. 
Management fees are based on a percentage of assets under management as set out in the relevant investment 
management agreements. The fees are recognised in the period in which the service is provided and it is probable 
that the fee will be received.
Performance fees are based on a percentage of investment performance achieved relative to predefined 
benchmarks as set out in the relevant investment management agreements. The fees are recognised at the end 
of the period over which the performance is measured, when a reliable estimate of the fee can be made and it is 
almost certain that the fee will be received.
Interest receivable and similar income
Interest receivable is recognised on an accruals basis using the effective interest method. 
Commissions and fees payable
Commissions and distribution fees payable to third parties are in respect of the management of investment 
management contracts. Commissions and distribution fees payable to third parties are recognised over the  
period for which the service is provided.

Net gains and losses on forward currency contracts used to hedge management fees derived from non-Sterling based 
AUM (see Note 4.3 (b) and (c)) are included within revenue. This presentation better reflects the substance of these 
transactions and provides more relevant information about the Group's revenue.
3.2. Operating segments
The Group is a specialist investment management group offering professional and institutional investors a range of 
geographical and sector investment opportunities. The Group’s assets under management are separated into products and 
services but as the strategic and financial management decisions are determined centrally, by the Board, the Group only has 
one class of business, being the provision of investment management and advisory services. The Group’s revenue generating 
operations are in London, with small offices in Tokyo, Jersey, Connecticut and Geneva that do not generate any revenue.
The financial information provided to the chief operating decision maker, the Board of Directors (the 'Board') is on an 
aggregated basis. Strategic and financial management decisions are determined centrally and, on this basis, the Group is 
a single segment investment management business. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued

3.5. Staff costs and average number of staff
Pensions
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme covering the majority of its staff. The costs of the 
pension scheme are charged to the statement of profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
(a) Group staff costs were as follows:
31 March 2017 
£’000

Share-based payments (Note 3.6) 4,095 3,290
35,994 39,951
Pension costs outstanding at the year-end amounted to nil (2016: nil).
(b) Deferred remuneration
Where variable compensation is deferred, the cost of the award is spread over the vesting period and included within 
staff costs. The liability is revalued at each balance sheet date to the expected settlement amount, being the current 
market value of the underlying fund unit. Any increase or decrease in value is recognised in the income statement within 
staff costs. The liability is included in the balance sheet as part of accrued expenses within trade and other payables.
Where deferrals are made into Company shares or fund units the Group hedges its exposure to price fluctuations by 
purchasing the Company shares or fund units at the date of grant. Company shares held are shown as a deduction 
from equity and accounted for as a share based payment. Fund units are included within financial assets at FVTPL on 
the balance sheet. Any change in the fair value of the units is recognised in the income statement within staff costs.
During the year the Group implemented its Deferred Remuneration Plan (DRP) which all Group employees eligible for 
a bonus over a certain level, as determined by the Remuneration Committee, are required to participate in. The DRP 
provides for compulsory deferral of a proportion of bonus over a specified vesting period. Deferrals can be made either 
into shares in the Company, units in the Group’s funds or as cash.

Preference shares 3,206 2,371
Equity Incentive Plans 889 919
4,095 3,290
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton 
option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.  
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the years ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016.
31 March 2017 31 March 2016 
Dividend yield (%) 7.82 5.79

The share price volatility was calculated by reference to the Company’s historic share price.
No other features of options granted were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
(a) Manager and team preference shares (‘Preference Shares’)
Certain employees of the Group and partners of Polar Capital LLP hold Manager Preference Shares or Manager Team 
Member Preference Shares (together ‘Preference Shares’) in Polar Capital Partners Limited, a group company. 
The preference shares are designed to incentivise and retain the Group’s fund management teams. These shares 
provide each manager with an economic interest in the funds that they run and ultimately enable the manager, at their 
option and at a future date, to convert their interest in the revenues generated from their funds to a value that may (at 
the discretion of the parent undertaking, Polar Capital Holdings plc) be satisfied by the issue of ordinary shares in Polar 
Capital Holdings plc. Such conversion takes place according to a pre-defined conversion formula that considers the 
relative contribution of the manager to the Group as a whole. The equity is awarded in return for the forfeiture of a 
manager’s current core economic interest and is issued over three years from the date of conversion. 
The issue of the Preference Shares constitutes a share-based payment under IFRS 2 and the cost is the estimated 
fair value, at the date of issue of the preference shares, of the effective entitlement to the ordinary shares. At each 
reporting date the estimated number of ordinary shares to be ultimately issued upon conversion will vary and the 
holder, initially, and the Group, ultimately, determines the start of the three year period (‘Crystallisation’) over which 
the ordinary shares are awarded following conversion. The start of this period will always be at least three years after 
the end of the financial accounting period in which the preference shares are issued.
At 31 March 2017 three sets of preference share have the right to call for conversion.
The Group enters into share-based payment transactions in respect of services receivable from certain employees 
by granting options over shares subject to certain vesting options and exercise prices. These are accounted for as 
equity-settled share based payments.
The cost of the awards is determined by the fair value of the share options at the date of grant, using an option 
pricing model, the key inputs to which are disclosed in the note below, and is recognised as an expense over the 
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. These estimates 
are reviewed regularly and the charge to the consolidated statement of profit or loss is adjusted accordingly. The 
corresponding credit is recognised in retained earnings within total equity.
Where an award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any cost not yet 
recognised is charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.

remaining tranche of 0.41m shares issued during the year ended 31 March 2016.
(b) Group equity incentive plans
As part of an ongoing program to retain and incentivise employees, the Group issues share options under the 
following schemes:
(i) Save as you Earn scheme
Share options in Polar Capital Holdings plc are granted to employees under a HMRC tax-advantaged Save as You Earn 
scheme. These shares have a vesting period of five to seven years, and the exercise price for each option is the market 
value of the shares on the date the option was granted, subject to a discount of up to 20%. The scheme is linked to a 
SAYE savings contract. 
(ii) Company share option scheme
Share options in Polar Capital Holdings plc are granted to employees under a HMRC tax-advantaged arrangement up 
to a value at the date of grant of £30,000. These shares have a vesting period of either three or four years from the 
date of grant, and the exercise price for each option is the market value of the shares on the date it was granted.
(iii) Unapproved share option scheme
In cases where the terms of the schemes above cannot be met, unapproved share options are granted, under the 
terms of the Group’s Equity Incentive Plan or 2016 Executive Incentive Plan. These options vest in either four to five 
years, and are granted at a price agreed by the Directors of the Group.
The contractual term of all company share options, except for those issued under the SAYE scheme, is 10 years.

options during the year. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued

The tax expense represents the sum of the tax payable for the reporting period (current tax) and a charge relating to 
tax payable for future periods due to income or expenses being recognised in different periods for tax and accounting 
purposes (deferred tax).
With effect from 1 April 2015, the UK corporation tax rate changed from 21% to 20%.
The major components of Corporation tax for the years ended 31 March 2017 and 2016 are:

Total tax recognised in consolidated statement of profit or loss 4,394 5,423
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported 
in the statement of profit or loss because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in 
other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Tax relating 
to items charged or credited directly to equity is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for 
using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited to the statement of profit or 
loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in 
which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in the statement of other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued

Section 4: Detailed Information on Consolidated Balance Sheet Items
This section provides additional information about individual line items in the balance sheet, including the relevant 
accounting policies.
4.1. Property and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less depreciation and accumulated impairment provisions. 
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of each asset over its expected useful economic 
life. The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is assessed annually and any impairment is charged to the 
statement of profit or loss.
Depreciation is charged from the date that the asset is brought into use on a straight line basis as follows:

4.2. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
Deferred tax is recognised based on differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for accounting 
purposes and their tax values (See Note 3.7).
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are only 
recognised to the extent that the Group considers them to be recoverable; which is determined by reference to 
estimates that future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is 
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the 
Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
The Finance (No. 2) Act 2015 in the UK reduced the main rate of Corporation taxation to 19% with effect from 
1 April 2017 and as part of the Finance Act 2016, a further reduction to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020 was 
substantially enacted on 6 September 2016. The effect of these reductions is reflected in the Group’s deferred tax 
balances as the rate was substantively enacted before 31 March 2017. An analysis of the Group’s deferred tax assets 
and liabilities is as follows:

4.3. Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value
Financial instruments 
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or 
equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s consolidated 
balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets 
are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or where they have been 
transferred and the Group has also transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities 
are derecognised when the obligation under the liability has been discharged, cancelled or has expired.
Financial assets
The Group’s financial assets include seed capital investments, trade and other receivables, cash and equivalents 
and derivative financial instruments. The classification adopted by the Group depends on the purpose for which 
the financial assets were acquired and is determined at initial recognition.
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value, being the consideration given, plus, any directly attributable 
transaction costs, except in the case of financial assets recorded at fair value through profit or loss where 
transaction costs are immediately recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. 
Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised at trade date, being the date when the Group commits to 
purchase or sell the asset.
Investment securities
Investment securities represent securities, other than derivatives, held by consolidated funds. These securities are 
designated as FVTPL and are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognised through the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at FVTPL include financial assets held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial 
recognition at FVTPL. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of 
selling or repurchasing in the near term. The Group’s investments in the funds that it manages, but does not 
control, are classified as financial assets at FVTPL. Such assets are subsequently carried at fair value, with any gains 
or losses arising from changes in fair value being recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. 
Assets held-for-sale
The Group classifies assets as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale, 
which is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale, rather than through continuing use. Such 
assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Costs to sell 
are the incremental costs directly attributable to the sale.
Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, derivative financial instruments and third-party 
interests in funds that have been consolidated as subsidiaries. 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are carried at fair value, with gains and losses recognised in the consolidated income 
statement within other income in the period in which they arise. Financial liabilities at FVTPL relate to third-party 
interests in consolidated funds which are designated as at FVTPL. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued

4.3. Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value
(a) Seed capital investments
The Group ordinarily provides seed capital in order to provide initial scale and facilitate marketing of new funds to 
third-party investors.
(i) Assets held-for-sale
Where the Group invests seed capital into funds that it controls and the Group is actively seeking to reduce its 
investment and it is considered highly probable that it will relinquish control within a year, the interests in the funds  
are treated as held-for-sale and are recognised as financial assets and financial liabilities held-for-sale.
Investments cease to be classified as held-for-sale when they are no longer controlled by the Group. A loss of control 
may happen either through sale of the investment and/or dilution of the Group’s holding. When investments cease to 
be classified as held-for-sale they are classified as financial assets designated as FVTPL. No such funds were transferred 
to the FVTPL category during the year (2016: one fund was transferred to the FVTPL category after the Group reduced 
its interests following investment inflows from third parties).

The Group’s financial assets at FVTPL include seed capital investments in funds that it manages but does not control. 
This includes seed capital investments in funds that are classed as associates (see Note 2.3) where the Group has 
significant influence but does not control the fund. At 31 March 2017 there were no funds classed as associates (2016: 
2 funds). During the year the Group redeemed its seed capital investments from 3 funds classed as assets at FVTPL 
(2016: no seed capital investments were redeemed) for a total cash consideration of £30 million. The fair values of 
such financial assets are derived from quoted market prices in active markets.
(iii) Consolidated funds
As at 31 March 2017 the Group has consolidated 2 funds (2016: 1 fund) over which it is deemed to have control 
(See Note 2.2). Consolidated funds represent seed capital investments where the Group has held its position for a 
period greater than one year and/or its interest represents a controlling stake in the fund in accordance with IFRS 10. 
Consolidated fund assets and liabilities are presented line by line after intercompany eliminations.

(b) Derivatives
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses forward currency contracts to hedge the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. Such 
derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract 
is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are classified as 
financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Forward currency contracts used for currency hedging purposes are treated as cash flow hedges and the effective 
portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income, while the 
ineffective portion is taken to the statement of profit or loss. Amounts recognised as other comprehensive income 
are transferred to the consolidated statement of profit or loss when the hedged items affect profit or loss.
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship 
to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for 
undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item 
or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the effectiveness of changes in 
the hedging instrument’s fair value in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash 
flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be effective in achieving offsetting changes in 
fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been effective 
throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated.

Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments reflect the changes in fair values of foreign currency exchange 
forward contracts and short positions of securities that are not designated in hedge relationships, but are, nevertheless 
intended to reduce the level of foreign currency and price risk, respectively, on the Group’s seed investments as 
described in Note 4.3c.
Derivatives designated as hedging instruments reflect the changes in fair values of foreign exchange forward contracts 
designated as cash flow hedges to hedge highly probable forecast revenue in US dollars (USD) and Japanese Yen (JPY) 
as described in Note 4.3c.
(c) Financial instruments risk management objectives and policies
The main areas of risk arising from the Group’s financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and 
capital risk. Each of these risks is discussed in detail below. The Group monitors financial risks on a consolidated basis 
and intra-Group balances are settled when it is deemed appropriate for both parties to the transaction. The Company 
is not exposed to material financial risk and separate disclosures for the Company have not been included. The Group 
has designed a framework to manage the risks of its business and to ensure that the Directors have in place risk 
management practices appropriate for a listed company. The management of risk within the Group is governed by  
the Board and overseen by the Audit Committee.
(i) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to settle its debt to the Group.
Fees due from funds managed by the Group are invoiced monthly or quarterly and are settled within 30 days of the 
invoice date. No trade receivables at year end are impaired and to date there have been no settlement issues with any 
funds. The risk is therefore regarded as low.
Amounts placed on deposit are invested according to a treasury policy that is designed to reduce concentration and 
counterparty risk. Investments in assets at FVTPL are monitored regularly. The carrying value of the Group’s financial 
assets represents its maximum exposure to credit risk at the year end. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued

4.3. Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value continued 
(ii) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may be unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due. The Group 
maintains significant liquid resources in the form of cash or cash deposits in order to meet working capital and 
regulatory needs. The Group’s treasury policy is designed to align the duration period of the cash deposits to the 
working capital requirements of the Group with no deposits being placed for a period of more than three months.
The Group’s financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables, derivative instruments and third-party interests in 
funds that have been consolidated as subsidiaries. The maturity dates for all financial liabilities fall within either one 
year or are repayable on demand.
(iii) Price risk
Price risk is the risk that changes in market prices will affect the Group’s income or value of its investments.
The Group holds financial assets at fair value through profit or loss consisting of seed investments in funds that it 
manages as well as investment securities held by consolidated funds, which are sensitive to movements in market 
equity prices. 
Should the market move by +/ – 10%, and all the funds (and hence the Group’s investments) move by this same 
amount, it would result in a change to the carrying value of the assets of +/ – £2m (2016: £4m). 
This movement would be recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
(iv) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or cash flows related to financial instruments will fluctuate because of 
changes to market interest rates. 
The Group’s cash and short-term deposits earn nominal amounts of interest at a floating rate and any change in 
market interest rates would result in negligible change to profit before tax. The Group has no borrowings. 
(v) Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates will cause the Group to suffer losses.
Although the majority of management fees are received in Sterling, a certain amount of those fees are generated from 
assets based in other countries, in particular US dollar-based assets and a smaller amount of Yen based assets.
In order to hedge the risk associated with the management fees receivable in the next reporting period, the Group 
enters into a number of forward foreign currency contracts over a period of 12 months. At year end, the Group had 
five (2016: four) open contracts to sell US dollars totalling USD $20,900,000 (2016: USD $23,250,000), for a total of 
£15,526,331 (2016: £15,337,156). There was one open Sterling/ Yen contract to sell a total of ¥57,000,000 (2016: 
¥78,000,000), for a total of £356,607 (2016: £427,046).
The Group also holds assets at FVTPL consisting of investments in its own funds. Where such investments are made 
in assets denominated in a currency other than the Group’s functional currency, Sterling, the Group is exposed to 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
At the year end there are two (2016: four) investments in a non-hedged product and the Group has therefore hedged 
against the risk of exposure to changes in the foreign currency exchange rates caused by the underlying US Dollar/Euro 
assets within these investments. The Group has one further (2016: three) forward currency contract for the sale of USD 
$4,900,000 (2016: USD $18,000,000) to purchase £3,886,113 (2016: £12,604,089) and one forward currency contract 
for the sale of €6,700,000 (2016: €6,000,000) to purchase £5,713,311 (2016: £4,592,400).
The Group’s hedging policy serves to substantially mitigate its exposure to foreign currency risk on its revenue and 
balance sheet investments. Any changes in foreign exchange rates will have an equal and opposite effect on the 
hedged items and open forward currency contracts. Strategic Report Overview Governance Financial Statements
59 Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2017
(vi) Capital management
All companies within the Group are managed as going concerns and have sufficient capital to meet their day-to-day 
needs and to fulfil any externally imposed capital requirements. The capital of the Group and the Company consists of 
equity attributable to equity holders of the parent company, comprising issued share capital, share premium, reserves 
and retained earnings as disclosed in Note 4.9.
The Group is supervised by the Financial Conduct Authority and submits appropriate returns on the capital adequacy 
of both the Group and the regulated entity, Polar Capital LLP. Throughout the year the Group and Polar Capital LLP 
held surplus capital over the regulated requirement. 
(vii) Fair value hierarchy
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by 
valuation technique:
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, 
either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on 
observable market data.
The fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities which are carried at fair value of year end is as follows:

During the reporting period there were no transfers between levels in fair value measurements. 
4.4. Interests in Structured Entities
The Group acts as fund manager to investment funds that are considered to be structured entities. These structured 
entities typically consist of unitised vehicles such as open-ended Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable 
Securities (UCITS) funds, closed-ended investment trusts and alternative funds which entitle investors to a percentage 
of the vehicle’s net asset value.
(a) Interests arising from managing client assets
The Group has an interest in funds that it manages as a result of the management of assets on behalf of its clients  
and this interest is reflected in the Group’s AUM. The main risk the Group faces from its interest in AUM managed  
on behalf of clients is the loss of fee income as a result of the withdrawal of funds by clients. 
A reconciliation of AUM reported by the Group within unconsolidated structured entities is shown below:

Where the Group has an equity holding in a fund it manages, the maximum exposure to loss constitutes the future 
and uncollected management fees plus the fair value of the Group’s investment in that fund. The table below shows 
the carrying values of the Group’s interests in unconsolidated structured entities, recognised in the Group balance 
sheet, which are equal to the Group’s maximum exposure to loss from those interests.

Seed capital investments 9,623 33,293
Management fees receivable at year-end 7,905 6,410
4.5. Trade and Other Receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value, and are subsequently carried at the lower of original fair value 
and their recoverable amount. A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the 
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. When a trade 
receivable is uncollectable, it is written off against trade receivables and the amount of the loss is recognised in the 
statement of profit or loss.

4.6. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at banks and in hand, deposits and other short-term highly liquid 
investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value. For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of 
cash and cash equivalents as defined above. Strategic Report Overview Governance Financial Statements

event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The expense relating to a

 • current and deferred tax that arise on share-based payments;
 • movements in the fair value of other financial assets arising on Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts classified  
as cash flow hedges; and
 • exchange differences arising on translation of foreign operations.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares 
are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.
Own shares held
The Group operates, and funds by way of loan, an employee benefit trust for the purpose of satisfying certain 
share awards to employees. Own shares held are equity shares of the Company acquired and held by this trust. 
Such shares are recognised at cost and are presented in the Group balance sheet as a deduction from equity. 
No gain or loss is recognised on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own shares. Strategic Report Overview Governance Financial Statements

Section 5: Notes to the Company Financial Statements 
5.1. Basis of preparation
The Company financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with FRS 102.  
No profit or loss account is presented for the Company as permitted under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. 
The Company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and are presented in Sterling 
and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000) except when otherwise stated.
The accounting policies for the Company are the same as those for the Group except where specifically stated in  
the following notes.
5.2. Prior period restatement
The Company accounts have been restated to record share based payments for awards granted to employees of subsidiary 
entities where the Company is the grantor of the awards or settles them with its own equity. FRS 102.26 1A requires the 
Company to recognise the arrangement as an equity-settled share-based payment when it has an obligation to settle a 
share-based payment transaction where another entity in the same group receives goods or services.
The Company accounts have also been restated for intra-group recharges for share awards and accounted for as a return 
of capital contribution. Amounts paid in excess of the original contribution recorded by the Company is treated as a 
distribution. As part of this restatement for intra-group recharges, other reserves of £562,000 have been transferred to 
retained earnings.
The prior year’s financial statements have been restated to reflect the cumulative increase in retained earnings as of 1 April 
2015 of £7,088,000 with a further credit to retained earnings for the year to 31 March 2016 of £3,269,000  
and a corresponding debit to investment in subsidiaries.
5.3. Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are held at the lower of cost and recoverable amount. The carrying value is reviewed for 
impairment when there is an indication that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The investment is the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary Polar Capital Partners Limited.
