PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
2017 WAS ANOTHER YEAR OF SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT FOR FRESNILLO.  
WE INCREASED PRODUCTION, MANAGED COSTS AND EXPANDED OUR PIPELINE, 
ONCE AGAIN UNDERLINING OUR LONG-ESTABLISHED COMMITMENT TO CREATE 
VALUE THROUGH GROWTH AND RETURNS.

OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
• Annual silver production up 16.6%  
in line with guidance, driven by the  
first complete year of San Julián  
phase I operating at full capacity  
and the start-up of operations at  
San Julián phase II, now operating  
at nameplate capacity.
• Gold production exceeded guidance 
principally as a result of the full year  
of operations at San Julián phase I, 
although it reduced by 2.6% year-on-
year due to the expected reduction of 
gold inventories at Herradura.
• Gold resources remained stable and 
gold reserves increased 22.7%. Silver 
resources increased 6.9% while silver 
reserves decreased 5.4%.
• One fatality occurred in early 2017.
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
• Adjusted revenue 
1
 of US$2,233.2 
million, up 9.2% over 2016 due to 
higher silver and zinc volumes sold 
and increased gold, lead and zinc 
metal prices.
• Gross profit and EBITDA up 4.9%  
and 2.7%, to US$925.4 million and 
US$1,060.1 million respectively.
• Profit from continuing operations  
of US$709.3 million, up 4.9%.
• Capex of US$604.8 million, up 39.3% 
and US$236.6 million of dividends  
paid, up 168.2%.
• Healthy balance sheet and low 
leverage ratio; cash and other liquid 
funds 
2
 of US$896.0 million, down 1.8%.

The Company considers this a useful additional 
measure to help understand underlying factors 
driving revenue in terms of volumes sold and 
realised prices.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
TEN YEARS OF CREATING VALUE 
THROUGH GROWTH AND RETURNS
Although the Group has a history 
stretching back over a century, Fresnillo 
only became a listed company in 2008. 
Today, as we stand on the brink of our 
second decade, we can look back on 
our achievements with justifiable pride. 
Despite a changing market environment 
and pressures affecting the mining 
industry as a whole, we are delivering 
on our long-term commitments  
and continuing to create value  
through growth and returns for our 
stakeholders. Over the last decade,  
we have paid close to US$2.5 billion in 
dividends, invested over US$4 billion to 
sustain and expand our operations and 
develop new projects, and increased 
attributable silver and gold production 
by over 55% and 245%, respectively.
FOR MORE DETAILS ON OUR 
ACHIEVEMENTS – IN BOTH FINANCIAL  
AND NON-FINANCIAL TERMS – SINCE  
THE IPO IN 2008 
SEE PAGES 12, 26, 52, 72
While we remain confident about our 
future and growth potential, we do  
not ignore the challenges faced by the 
mining industry. These include lower 
grades, access to land, environmental 
demands, social pressures and 
growing complexities in the permitting 
processes, among others. Managing 
these pressures requires increased 
focus and expertise to avoid excessive 
delays to projects and to maintain our 
social licence to operate.

2017: A YEAR OF PROGRESS
2017 has again proved the importance 
of a consistent, conservative long-term 
strategy based primarily on organic 
growth, developed and implemented  
by a committed professional team  
and fully supported by the Board. This 
provided the foundation for another 
year of record silver production and 
stable gold production. The commitment 
to exploration across precious metals 
price cycles continues to be the  
key to our success, growth and 
long-term prospects. 
WE END OUR FIRST DECADE OF OPERATIONS AS WE STARTED IT –  
FIRM IN OUR COMMITMENT TO GROWTH AND RETURNS, ENERGISED  
BY THE SUCCESS OF OUR STRATEGY AND CONFIDENT ABOUT  
OUR FUTURE PROSPECTS.

we have delivered sound financial results. 
The Group generated over US$2,230

a rise of 9.2% over the prior year,  
with a 32.0% increase in profit for the 
period. Cash and other liquid funds

CONSISTENT DIVIDEND POLICY
Fresnillo plc’s dividend policy is  
closely aligned with our focus on 
creating value through growth and 
returns, and is based on paying out 
33-50% of profit after tax each year, 
with certain adjustments made to 
exclude non-cash effects in the income 
statement. Dividends are paid in the 
approximate proportions of one-third  
as an interim dividend, with the balance 
as a final dividend. 
Before declaring a dividend, the Board 
carries out detailed analysis of the 
profitability of the business, underlying 
earnings, capital requirements and cash 
flows. Our aim is to maintain sufficient 
flexibility to respond to movements in 
precious metals prices and other factors 
that could impact our business. 
We declared an interim dividend of 
10.6 US cents per share, with a final 
dividend of 29.8 US cents per share, 
bringing the total for the year to 
US$297.7 million. 
MEETING OUR OPERATIONAL GOALS
At the time of the IPO, we set ourselves 
two demanding targets for our first 
decade of operations. Our target for 
gold production of 750 koz was reached 
in 2015, three years ahead of plan, 
while the 65 moz objective for silver  
is on track to be achieved in 2018. 
There were a number of key 
operational developments during the 
year, but here I would like to focus on 
two in particular . Firstly, the second 
phase of our silver-gold San Julián 
project was commissioned. This new 
mine, discovered by our exploration 
team, is a cornerstone of our future 
prospects and opens a promising, 
remote district to further growth. 
Several Board members visited the  
site during 2017 and saw at first-hand 
how the plans of the Board and 
management have become reality.
Secondly, despite falling short of our 
expectations due to several operational 
issues, performance at the Fresnillo 
mine continued to improve. We have 
taken a number of corrective steps  
to address these issues, including: 
strengthening our operational leadership 
team; improving contractor efficiency; 
and eliminating bottlenecks caused by 
inefficient working practices. 
We expect the construction of the  
new Pyrites plant to significantly 
advance towards commissioning in 
2018, improving the gold and silver 
recovery from the tailings at both  
the Fresnillo and Saucito mines. In 
addition, we started construction of the 
second line at the Dynamic Leaching 
Plant at Herradura, which will improve 
gold recovery, particularly as we 
encounter increasing quantities of 
higher sulphide grade ore. The Board 
expects to approve the development  
of our joint venture with Mag Silver at 
Juanicipio in the first half of 2018, and 
we anticipate the start-up of production 
in the first half of 2020. Juanicipio is 
the next major project for Fresnillo and 
management is committed to ensuring 
that the mine fulfils its true potential.
We have a well-established record of 
replenishing reserves and resources, 
and 2017 again saw good progress in 
this respect. Exploration results for the 
year were positive. Overall, our resource 
base has expanded significantly. Silver 
resources have grown from 2,171 moz  
in 2016 to 2,320 moz in 2017, while gold 
resources remained stable at 38.5 moz. 
Gold reserves increased by 22.7%, 
mainly due to the Herradura mine,  
while silver reserves showed a decrease 
of 5.4%, with an increase at Saucito 
offset by falls at Fresnillo and Ciénega. 
Exploration remains a key pillar of our 
Company as we move towards achieving 
our 2018 goals and further success in 
the years beyond.
OUR WORKFORCE
Health and safety remain the paramount 
priority of our Board. I regret to report 
that one fatal accident occurred in early 
2017. While the trend of the broader 
safety indicators continued to improve, 
supported by our drive towards a more 
systematic approach to incidents, this 
fatality is unacceptable. One fatality  
is one too many, and our sincere 
condolences and support have been 
conveyed to the family of the victim. 
We will never sacrifice the health and 
safety of our people – or the long-term 
sustainability of our business – for 
short-term gain, financial or otherwise, 
and strive to implement best-in-class 
systems and practices throughout the 
Company. However, it is clear that there 
remains much work to do, particularly 
where contractors are concerned. 
Contractor staff do not always display  
a consistent focus on safety and lack 
sufficient training due to frequent 
rotation of personnel. During the year 
we took decisive steps to engage them 
in our health and safety culture. This 
new approach has already borne fruit 
and will be extended in 2018.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT  
CONTINUED
The Board’s Health, Safety, 
Environment and Community Relations 
(HSECR) Committee continued to 
review our culture and values as part  
of its work and will be monitoring 
progress in the coming year . We again 
increased our HSECR activities during 
2017, supporting a large number of 
new and established programmes 
which underline our commitment to 
the wellbeing of our people and their 
communities. Please see the Social 
and Sustainability Report on pages 
74-103 for more details.
SUPPORTING OUR EXECUTIVE TEAM
The Board plays an active role in  
setting Group strategy and supporting 
the Executive Committee. We regularly 
review progress versus plan, ensuring 
that the business has the required 
flexibility to respond to changing 
market conditions while at the same 
time fulfilling our commitment to 
continuous investment across 
price cycles. 
During 2017, we again ensured that 
capital allocation was balanced by 
growth, shareholder returns, financial 
strength and flexibility, within the 
context of our commitment to 
sustainability and risk management. 
Familiarity with the business is key for 
an effective Board. I encourage Board 
members to gain practical knowledge 
about our activities, and over the course 
of the year my colleagues visited a 
number of operational sites. For example, 
six Directors visited San Julián to  
gain first-hand understanding of  
the importance and challenges  
of the operation. 
STRENGTHENING OUR  
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
The most important function of  
the Board is to ensure strong and 
effective corporate governance.  
We have continued to identify and, 
where appropriate, implement best 
practice in line with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and evolving 
stakeholder expectations in both  
the UK and Mexico. 
I have set out details regarding the 
major developments in my introduction 
to the Corporate Governance section on 
page 117. In summary, these include:
• New anti-bribery and corruption 
legislation in Mexico. The work  
we have undertaken over the past 
few years to ensure compliance  
with UK legislation enabled us to 
accommodate the requirements  
of the new Mexican legislation 
with ease. 
• Continued support for greater 
gender diversity at Board level,  
in line with our commitment to  
align Fresnillo more closely with 
expectations relating to diversity  
on FTSE 100 boards.
• Evolution of the independent 
representation on the Board.
• The continued support of over 99% 
of our independent shareholders for 
our executive remuneration policy.
As we approach the tenth anniversary 
of our listing on the London Stock 
Exchange, I am pleased to report  
that, while our business model has 
remained essentially the same,  
we are also continuing to learn and 
evolve – particularly in the areas of 
sustainability, the application of IT and 
corporate governance. For example, 
our Code of Conduct was reviewed and 
benefited from updates during the year, 
reflecting our commitment to building 
and maintaining an ethical culture 
across all our operations. Based on  
our values of Responsibility, Integrity, 
Trust and Loyalty, this culture is the 
cornerstone of our past achievements 
and the platform for our future success. 
2017 again saw us complement regular 
workshops and master classes with 
online training in order to ensure  
that all our people are aware of the 
importance we attach to our values.
Corporate culture is a key agenda item 
for every Board meeting, with updates 
on the cultural programme provided  
as part of the CEO’s report. These 
regular bulletins are supported by  
an annual presentation by the Head  
of Sustainability.
CHANGES TO THE BOARD
In May, I was delighted to welcome 
Dame Judith Macgregor as an 
Independent Non-executive Director . 
Dame Judith was the British 
Ambassador to Mexico from 2009 to 
2013 and has been the President of  
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office 
(FCO) Women’s Association since 2006, 
overseeing a significant increase in  
the number of FCO women in senior 
grades. Dame Judith is the third female 
appointment to the Board in the past five 
years, and is currently one of two female 
members. With women continuing to  
be under-represented on our Board  
and in our workforce, during the year  
we developed a new policy which aims  
to encapsulate our commitment to 
greater diversity and inclusion.
OUTLOOK FOR 2018 AND BEYOND
We will continue to maintain our 
disciplined approach to investment  
in order to support the key ‘Explore, 
Develop, Operate and Sustain’ 
elements of the business model. Our 
focus will once again be on efficiency 
and cost control to underpin projects, 
ongoing performance improvements at 
Fresnillo, increased production at San 
Julián, development of Juanicipio and 
the continued evaluation of the Orisyvo 
gold project.
Human Capital is key to our ability  
to create value through growth  
and returns. Throughout 2017, our 
people again showed the skills and 
professionalism needed to overcome 
challenges as well as the commitment 
to deliver results. On behalf of the 
Board and shareholders I want to 
express my gratitude for their efforts.
The Board and I reiterate our 
confidence in the established and 
proven strategy and in the capacity  
of the Executive Committee to execute 
it. While volatility in exchange rates or 
precious metals prices may present 
short-term challenges, we anticipate 
further growth and returns over the 
longer term.

FRESNILLO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Once again, we have managed our costs, 
expanded our exploration pipeline and 
achieved our production guidelines –  
all of which have combined to enable us 
to continue our track record of creating 
value through growth and returns. At  
the time of our IPO in 2008, we made  
a commitment to double production by 
2018. After nine years – a period that has 
seen a global financial crisis as well as 
volatile prices for precious metals – we 
are well on the way to confirming this 
remarkable achievement. 
Our success bears testament to the 
expertise, commitment and sheer hard 
work of our people, without whom none 
of this would have been possible. But it 
is also a tribute to the original vision of 
the Board and the strength of a strategy 
that is both effective and consistent. 
When times are challenging, it can be 
tempting to switch strategy to address 
short-term trends, for example, by 
making substantial cutbacks to areas 
such as exploration. Indeed, this is 
something that we have seen many  
of our peers do over the last decade.  
At Fresnillo, however, our strategy has 
remained constant from our first day  
of operation – and this consistency has 
been the platform for what has been a 
successful record of growth and returns.
Q – WHAT WERE THE PRODUCTION 
HEADLINES FOR THE YEAR?
A – Silver production from our mines 
reached a record level of 54.2 moz,  
due to phase I at San Julián operating 
at full capacity for the entire year and 
the start of operations of phase II at the 
same mine. Production at the Fresnillo 
mine also increased year-on-year, albeit 
at a slower pace than anticipated. We 
are continuing to implement several 
improvement measures at the mine, 
including enhanced equipment 
maintenance, the installation of a 
vertical conveyor to reduce truck 
haulage and increased supervision to 
improve the efficiency of our contractors. 
These measures, together with the 
hiring of two new contractors, will help 
us maintain development rates at the 
Fresnillo mine and improve them in  
the long run. 
As expected, gold production slightly 
decreased due to the reduction in 
inventories at Herradura in 2016 not 
being repeated to the same extent in 
2017, and a slower speed of recovery  
at Noche Buena due to a longer 
leaching process. 
Zinc production increased as a result  
of the positive contribution from San 
Julián and increased volumes produced 
at the Fresnillo mine due to the higher 
ore grades. 
Q – HOW DID PRECIOUS METALS’ PRICES 
IMPACT PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR?
A – Fresnillo’s operations are designed 
to deliver results across price cycles. 
They did so during the years when 
prices were falling – and they have done 
so again over the last 12 months, when 
prices for silver and gold have been 
largely stable. At the same time, the 
year saw a significant increase in prices 
for base metals, which are by-products 
of our silver and gold production 
processes, and this upward trend made 
a positive contribution towards our 
overall financial performance.
Our proven ability to perform in all 
price environments is important, given 
the unpredictable nature of prices. This 
ability is based on an effective strategy 
teamed with high quality execution. 
Operational excellence, targeted 
investment and disciplined cash 
management, as well as sustainable 
business practices, are the hallmarks 
of our decade-long reputation for 
achievement.
Q – LOOKING AT THE STRATEGY IN DETAIL, 
HOW DID YOU MAXIMISE THE POTENTIAL  
OF EXISTING OPERATIONS IN 2017?
A – Maximising the potential of existing 
operations is the first pillar of our 
strategy and we recorded a number  
of key achievements during the year . 
Firstly, we continued the turnaround at 
our flagship Fresnillo mine, which has  
a history that can be traced back to the 
16th century. While the mine remains 
very productive, it is nonetheless a 
mature operation – and there is an 
inevitable downward trend in grade  
as the workable veins narrow and 
weaken. Put simply, we have to invest  
in infrastructure in order to maintain 
high rates of production as we go 
deeper and incur the increased  
costs associated with greater  
haulage distances.

I am pleased to say that, despite issues 
with maintenance and contractors, 
performance at Fresnillo has improved 
year-on-year, with an upturn in 
production from 15.9 moz in 2016  
to 16.5 moz in 2017. 
At Saucito, the relatively small 
investments made in previous years 
have consolidated the mine’s position 
as the world’s largest silver producing 
mine allowing throughput to increase 
by a third, albeit reducing recoveries  
in the short term. 
We also maximised the efficiency of the 
Dynamic Leaching Plant at San Julián, 
where the drive and skills of our people 
have seen us consistently achieve 3,500 
and, at times, over 3,800 tonnes per 
day from a process that has a nominal 
design capacity of 3,000 tonnes per day.
In last year’s report I referred to a 
comprehensive review of how IT can be 
the springboard for improved efficiency. 
This initiative made significant progress 
in 2017, with several projects now in 
place and delivering results. Among 
others, these include: Ventilation Plus, 
which is now providing ventilation on 
demand at San Julián and is being 
deployed at Saucito, Fresnillo and 
Ciénega; Track Plus, which enables our 
teams to know the precise locations of 
every resource across a mine, and is  
in operation at San Julián and Saucito; 
and ProxAlarm, which improves safety 
by preventing collisions and other 
incidents involving vehicles and is  
in the process of being installed at  
all mines.

Q – HOW HAVE YOU DELIVERED GROWTH 
THROUGH DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS?
A – The construction of the San Julián 
silver and gold mine has been a hugely 
important project for Fresnillo. We 
identified the need for this project at 
the time of the IPO and it finally came 
to fruition in 2017, with the completion 
of phase II. The flotation plant was 
commissioned in July and we expect 
the mine to achieve an average annual 
production of 14.2 moz of silver and 
49.3 koz of gold. Located on the 
Chihuahua/Durango border, we believe 
that San Julián has the potential to 
become established as an entirely  
new mining district.
In addition, construction of the Pyrites 
plant has continued as planned. This 
development project will strengthen 
the Company’s production profile by 
extracting additional quantities of  
silver and gold from the historical  
and ongoing tailings at the Fresnillo 
and Saucito mines.
Construction of the second line at the 
Dynamic Leaching Plant at Herradura 
also continued during the year, with 
commissioning expected in the first 
half of 2018. This plant will enable 
sulphides occurring deeper in the  
pit to be processed more efficiently.
FOR OUR DEVELOPMENT KPIS

Q – HOW HAVE YOU EXTENDED THE GROWTH 
PIPELINE?
A – Our ability to fuel the pipeline has 
been one of our most notable success 
stories over the years. While some of our 
peers have neglected their exploration 
activities, our strategy has been to 
actively expand ours – and the talented 
team of over 100 Fresnillo geologists has 
enabled us to make great strides in our 
resources. From just over 1 boz of silver 
in 2008, our resources had more than 
doubled to 2.3 boz by the end of 2017, 
supported by around 1.8 m hectares  
of exploration mining concessions in 
Mexico. At the same time, our gold 
resources have increased from 12 moz  
in 2008 to 38.5 moz at the end of 2017.
We have made good progress in Peru, 
where 350,000 hectares of concessions 
have given Fresnillo the largest 
exploration portfolio in the country. We 
have identified significant opportunities 
at Pilarica and expect this to become 
our first operational mine outside 
Mexico in the medium term. We are  
also set to begin exploration in Chile, 
following three years of scouting the 
territory, and have begun a project to 
evaluate opportunities in Argentina, 
which shares some of Chile’s 
geological potential.

Q – AND HOW HAVE YOU ADVANCED  
AND ENHANCED THE SUSTAINABILITY  
OF YOUR OPERATIONS?
A – The last of our four strategic  
pillars, sustainability lies at the heart  
of everything we do at Fresnillo –  
and nothing is more important to the 
sustainability of our Company than the 
health and safety of our employees and 
contractors. Although the trend from 
2011 to 2017 is in the right direction,  
we can never be complacent, and sadly 
we have to report that we experienced 
one fatality at the beginning of the year .
We continued to strengthen our  
health and safety programmes in 2017, 
focusing on engaging contractors as 
well as our own people. Around 70% of 
our workforce of 16,000 are contractors, 
and we are working hard to align them 
fully with our health and safety culture 
and expectations. A new approach 
piloted at Saucito and subsequently 
adopted at both Fresnillo and Ciénega 
is already strengthening our safety 
culture. Under this new approach, 
which we plan to roll out across our 
other operations in the coming months, 
our people are encouraged to report 
each incident within a fixed time frame, 
no matter how minor and with a full 
description. Our safety team then 
analyses the incident and identifies  
its root cause, enabling us to more 
systematically put measures in place  
to prevent any reoccurrence. 10

CONTINUED
Our promise to create value through 
growth and returns is not confined to 
our financial investors, and we were 
pleased to be included in the FTSE4 
Good Index in 2017. We work hard to 
ensure that the communities close to 
our operations also see a return on 
their investment of time, skills and 
commitments. Initiatives such as the 
Week of Health, Silver Saves Lives  
and a wide range of educational 
programmes have proved very 
successful in improving the lives and 
prospects of those who depend on us 
or are impacted by our operations. 
FOR OUR SUSTAINABILITY KPIS

Q – THE GOALS SET AT THE TIME OF THE 
IPO ARE ALMOST ALL NOW ACHIEVED – 
HAVE YOU SET A NEW TARGET?
A – It is cause of great satisfaction to the 
management team that we are on track 
to achieve our original production goals 
by the end of the next financial year .
We are currently in the process of 
finalising our next set of objectives,  
and these will be announced as part  
of our interim results presentation in 
August 2018.
Q – WILL THE STRATEGY CHANGE IN ORDER 
TO ACHIEVE YOUR FUTURE GOALS?
A – No, absolutely not. A proven strategy 
applied with consistency has been the 
foundation for our success to date and 
a key differentiating factor between 
ourselves and our peers. 
Despite our relative youth as a 
standalone Company, our history as a 
mining group stretches back 130 years 
– and we drew on all the experience 
gathered across those decades to 
identify and establish the principles 
that shaped our strategy. The business 
model is sound, the balance sheet 
robust and the ability to deliver results 
across all price cycles has been ably 
demonstrated.
As we move into our second decade,  
we will continue to monitor opportunities 
to complement organic growth with 
accretive mergers and acquisitions. 
However, we recognise that this can  
be a challenge. Most operations we 
evaluate from geological and financial 
perspectives fall short of the rigorous 
criteria and expectations we apply to 
Fresnillo operations.
Q – WHAT DO YOU EXPECT IN 2018?
A – While we are forecasting that all  
our operations will perform at their 
maximum levels, we nonetheless 
anticipate a challenging year in 2018. 
Inflationary pressures are likely to 
increase and it is unclear whether 
precious metals prices have already 
bottomed out or may drift lower . In 
addition, 2018 is an election year in 
Mexico and this will doubtless bring  
an unwelcome degree of volatility to 
exchange rates.
However, that said, our people  
have worked successfully in similar 
market environments before and will 
undoubtedly do so again. We expect 
continued growth through exploration 
and development, together with 
increased production at San Julián, 
further improvements in performance 
at Fresnillo, completion of the new 
Dynamic Leaching Plant at Herradura 
and the commissioning of the new 
Pyrites plant at Saucito.
These projects will lead to increased 
production with associated costs, 
though we will continue to seek 
corresponding efficiencies from other 
operations. A strong balance sheet, 
targeted investment and operating 
costs amongst the lowest in the 
industry, will again be the defining 
characteristics of our Company. In 
particular, I look forward to our project 
at Juanicipio moving from exploration 
to the development stage, subject to 
Board approval in April 2018. 
Our new approach to health and safety 
is set to be rolled out to all mines,  
and this should lead to an improved 
system that will benefit all employees 
and contractors.
In conclusion, I would like to thank  
our people, communities, suppliers, 
clients and shareholders for their 
continued support during the last year . 
Together, we face the future with 
cautious confidence.

OUR INVESTMENT CASE
CREATING VALUE THROUGH  
GROWTH AND RETURNS 
STRONG BALANCE SHEET
OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY, INVESTMENT ACROSS PRICE 
CYCLES, SHAREHOLDER RETURNS
Our healthy cash position and low leverage ratio 
enable us to invest in profitable growth, optimise 
operations and deliver solid returns to shareholders. 
Our capital expenditures in 2017 totalled US$604.8 
million, while we invested US$141.1 million in 
exploration activities and paid dividends of 
US$236.6 million.
HIGH QUALITY ASSETS
LONG-TERM VISIBILITY, LONG LIFE RETURNS 
We are one of Mexico’s largest concession  
holders, with approximately 1.8 million hectares  
of surface land. Our district consolidation strategy 
enables us to leverage local knowledge and shared 
infrastructure. Our portfolio of low cost gold and 
silver mines, high potential development projects  
and advanced exploration prospects contain over 
2,320 moz of attributable silver resources and 
38.5 moz of gold resources.
LOW COST AND FLEXIBLE OPERATIONS 
HEALTHY MARGINS, ADAPTABILITY ACROSS  
PRICE CYCLES
The quality of our assets means that we are able  
to extract mineral profitably across metal price 
cycles. We maximise the potential of each operation 
by customising mine plans, leveraging technology 
and sharing personnel, expertise and plant capacity 
across our districts. We continue to seek and 
implement new ways to improve efficiency, optimise 
our consumption of materials and energy, and 
maintain our position as a low cost producer . 
DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO DEVELOPMENT 
LONG-TERM PROFITABLE GROWTH
Before we embark on a development project, we 
apply stringent viability criteria covering areas such 
as rates of return and high environmental and social 
impact standards. We set delivery timelines and 
budgets to meet production targets in the context of 
market conditions, and maintain control by carrying 
out engineering and construction activities. Having 
successfully implemented the second phase of the 
San Julián mine in 2017, we are on track to deliver 
the new Pyrites plant at Saucito and the second line 
of the dynamic leaching plant at Herradura, both 
in 2018.
SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS PRACTICES 
ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP, SOCIAL LICENCE  
TO OPERATE, ETHICAL CULTURE
Our ability to create value for all our stakeholders 
and ensure operational continuity is built on a series 
of commitments to sustainability: to understand and 
respect the needs of local communities; to prioritise 
local goods, services and employees; to ensure the 
health and safety of our people; and to minimise our 
impact on the environment. During 2017, we invested 
over US$30.9 million in our HSECR initiatives, up 
41% compared with the previous year .

CREATING VALUE THROUGH
EXPLORE 
Our approach to exploration is one of the  
factors that marks Fresnillo as different to our 
peers in the mining industry. While others react 
to market pressures by pulling back on their 
efforts, we maintain a strategic commitment  
to continuous exploration across all precious 
metals price cycles.
The result? A steady pipeline of reserves and 
resources that fuels our ability to deliver growth 
and returns not just this year or next year, but in 
the decades ahead.
GROWTH
• Around US$1.5 billion invested in exploration 
since 2008.
• Number of full-time geologists almost 
doubled, from 55 in 2009 to 100 in 2017.
• Close to 900 kilometres drilled at our 
operations and projects by the exploration 
teams in 2017.
RETURNS
• Around 300 local community personnel 
employed as assistants to our geologists.
• Increase in silver resources from 1.1 bnoz  
in 2008 to 2.3 bnoz in 2017.
• Increase in gold resources from 12 moz  
in 2008 to 38.5 moz in 2017.

FRESNILLO IN CONTEXT
We are also affected by factors 
common to the mining industry in 
general as well as by those more 
specific to the business environment  
in Mexico.
In silver, our peers are other primary 
silver miners although much of the 
global silver production is derived as  
a by-product of gold, lead, zinc and 
copper mines. We have long been  
the top global producer of silver, both 
by-product and primary, and aim to 
maintain that leadership position. 
We are also one of Mexico’s largest 
gold producers with peers being other 
medium-size producers.
THE PRECIOUS METALS MARKET
Silver prices traded in the range of 
US$15.62/oz to US$18.54/oz during 
2017, ending the year up 6.3% versus 
the previous year which suggests a 
fairly balanced market. Prices were 
driven in part by investors seeking  
a safe haven in the face of global 
uncertainties.
Gold ended 2017 13.5% higher versus 
2016, supported by a weakening US 
dollar, continued geopolitical instability 
and increased equity valuations which 
saw investors adding gold to their 
portfolios in order to manage risk 
exposure. The price of gold fluctuated 
between US$1,158/oz and US$1,349/oz 
over the 12 months.
Fresnillo plc does not take a position  
on where prices, demand or sentiment 
are headed; however, we do monitor 
price movements and market dynamics 
in order to support our financial 
projections and cash management 
strategies, and prices will continue to 
colour budget considerations in areas 
such as exploration and the timing of 
certain capital expenditures.

SUPPLY AND DEMAND
SILVER
The price of silver has been supported 
by a year-on-year decline in production 
since the 2015 peak, with the latest 
reports estimating that annual 
production for 2017 will fall to 870 moz, 
a reduction of 2% 
1
. To a significant 
extent, this continuing downward trend 
is a result of the industry’s ongoing 
under investment in capex, as miners 
attempt to protect margins. Most 
analysts expect global production  
to again fall in the coming years.
However, silver production as a 
by-product of base metal mining is 
likely to grow, as producers increase 
activity in response to recent hikes in 
the prices of lead and zinc (up 22.4% 
and 30.5%, respectively, for the 12 
months ending 31 December 2017). 
Given the time and resources required 
to bring a new mine on stream, our 
expectations are that any negative 
impact of such additional supply will  
be felt in the medium rather than the 
short term.
As the chart shows, demand for  
silver is predominantly generated  
by industry and also by investors,  
who prize it as a safe haven. The 
exceptionally high electrical and 
thermal conductivity of silver make  
it ideal for use in the electrical and 
electronic industries, in particular  
the solar energy sector . 
SILVER DEMAND BY SECTOR 
2
 MOZ
 Jewellery 20% (207.0)
 Coins & Bars 20% (206.8)
 Silverware 5% (52.1)
 Industrial Fabrication 55% (561.9)
Looking ahead, we see both positive 
and negative factors influencing 
demand. Global economic growth and 
innovation will increase demand for 
technologies associated with solar 
energy, mobile telephony, the internet 
of things and autonomous vehicles, 
among other sectors. This will in turn 
drive demand for silver . On the other 
hand, this increase in demand will to 
an extent be offset by the practice of 
thrifting, as manufacturers seek to 
control their costs by reducing silver 
content in their products.
GOLD
Global gold production continues  
to grow, with 3,268 tonnes being 
produced in 2017, according to the 
World Gold Council. 
Demand for gold is primarily due to its 
value as a hedge against inflation. It 
has long been regarded as a reliable 
safe haven asset and a highly regarded 
store of wealth. In addition, gold is 
sought after by societies across the 
world for its appearance and has been 
fashioned into jewellery and works of 
art for centuries. Gold also plays a role 
in industry, where properties such as 
conductivity mean it is the metal of 
choice for a huge range of high-end 
electronic products.
The outlook for gold is heavily 
influenced by developments in the US. 
Potential headwinds for gold prices 
include a stronger US dollar and the 
new US tax reform. In addition, with  
the dollar ceasing to fall, the Federal 
Reserve has confirmed its intentions  
to further tighten monetary policy.

OUR MARKETS  
CONTINUED
CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND  
BALANCE SHEET STRENGTH
From 2012 into 2016, weakening 
commodity prices introduced a sense 
of urgency among heavily leveraged 
mining companies to strengthen their 
balance sheets. Today and in the near 
term, the focus for many is on 
sustaining current production levels 
rather than investing for growth. As 
existing mines move towards the end of 
their lives, miners will increasingly rely 
on lower grade deposits or those with 
more complex metallurgy. The search 
for new deposits is time-consuming 
and demands significant capital at a 
time when access to such funds is 
constrained and many miners appear 
unwilling to invest. Only when balance 
sheets have been strengthened are 
miners likely to look to increase 
production and re-leverage.
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FRESNILLO
Our strategy has always been to  
invest across all price cycles, while 
maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
This dual focus is a key differentiator 
for Fresnillo – it has enabled us to  
build a solid business that provides 
consistently high returns for investors 
and, at the same time, increase our 
mineral resources and production 
profiles. So while some of our peers 
look to stand still, we are continuing  
to create a platform and a pipeline for 
sustained growth. 
TECHNOLOGY IMPLEMENTATION
Cost inflation continues to be a major 
factor for our industry – particularly  
in Mexico, which has recorded average 
inflation of over 5% per year for the last 
two years – and miners are seeking  
to establish themselves at the lower 
end of the cost curve in a bid to gain 
competitive advantage. Technology  
has a major role to play, not only  
in improving health, safety and  
working conditions, but also in 
boosting productivity. 
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FRESNILLO
Our continued investment in digital 
technology – including the optimisation 
of processes – is a significant factor in 
our drive to reduce costs while improving 
performance. We provide greater detail 
on technology initiatives launched or 
developed during 2017 on pages 50-51.
SUSTAINABILITY AND LICENCE  
TO OPERATE
Miners must navigate complex issues 
and regulations in order to maintain a 
licence to operate and grow sustainable 
businesses. Environmental and social 
factors are increasingly important 
issues, with resource nationalism in 
many jurisdictions affecting regulation 
and taxation. In addition, pressure  
from non-governmental organisations 
(NGOs) and communities, both organised 
and ad hoc, can lead to work stoppages, 
project closures and increased pressure 
for more tangible community benefits 
and shared value creation mechanisms.
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FRESNILLO
We strive to ensure that the 
communities close to our operations 
benefit from the success of our 
business. Initiatives such as the Week 
of Health, Silver Saves Lives, a wide 
range of educational programmes  
and shared activities have proved very 
successful in improving the lives and 
prospects of those who depend on us 
or are impacted by our operations.

 (TONNES)
 Jewellery 52% (2,135.5)
 Investment 30% (1,231.9)
 Central banks & other institutions 10% (371.4)
 Technology 8% (332.8)
On the upside, increased global 
economic prosperity is likely to breathe 
some life back into the depressed 
jewellery market, while continued 
geopolitical uncertainties continue  
to have an impact on demand. 
KEY INDUSTRY TRENDS
Several trends affect the mining 
industry and therefore our performance 
and prospects. As many of these trends 
are aligned with our key risks, we 
include detailed analysis of their 
implications as well as our response 
and mitigating actions on pages 34-47.  17

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT  
IN MEXICO 
Mexico has the second largest economy 
in Latin America and is characterised 
by a mature and relatively stable tax 
and legal framework. The country’s 
resources are significant and diverse, 
offering opportunities for many types  
of companies. In addition, energy 
reforms are increasing foreign direct 
investment and supporting the drive 
towards cleaner, cheaper and more 
sustainable sources of energy.
The country has a mining history 
extending almost 500 years. It is  
the largest producer of silver in the 
world and a top global producer of 
gold, copper and zinc, amongst other 
minerals. All our current operations  
are located in Mexico, where the mining 
sector accounts for 4% 
2
 of GDP.  
We take a broadly positive view of the 
long-term opportunities in Mexico.  
That said, with the presidential  
election scheduled for 2018 and NAFTA 
negotiations ongoing, we expect market 
volatility in the short term to continue.

EMPLOYEES
We are committed to upholding labour 
standards, respecting human rights and 
demonstrating an ethical culture across 
our operations. Our top priority is to 
guarantee a working environment that 
protects the health and safety of our 
employees and contractors. Training and 
talent management initiatives help us 
enhance and retain our Human Capital. 
COMMUNITIES
We engage with local communities  
to address their concerns and ensure 
social acceptance for all our projects. 
We invest directly and through 
partnerships in a range of initiatives 
that aim to minimise our impacts and 
enhance the quality of life and long-
term wellbeing of the communities 
where we operate. These include 
programmes that focus on the 
environment, education, health and 
social integration, entrepreneurship 
and infrastructure. 
SUPPLIERS
We work closely with contractors  
and suppliers, negotiating long-term 
purchase agreements to secure better 
pricing and ensure timely availability  
of key equipment, materials and 
services. A key supplier is Servicios 
Administrativos Peñoles, S.A. de C.V. 
(SAPSA), a subsidiary of the Company’s 
controlling shareholder, Industrias 
Peñoles, S.A.B. de C.V. (Peñoles), which 
is contracted to supply administrative 
services. The relationship is regulated 
by a Services Agreement (‘NSA’, or 
‘New Services Agreement’), ensuring 
that all services are delivered at arm’s 
length and on normal commercial 
terms as per the Relationship 
Agreement with Peñoles.
CUSTOMERS
We maximise revenue by working 
closely with refiners and smelters.  
All the primary products originating 
from our mines in 2017 were sold to 
the Met-Mex Peñoles, S.A. de C.V. 
refining and smelting facility in 
Torreón, Coahuila (Mexico) under  
a series of supply agreements set  
on an arm’s length basis and in line 
with international benchmarks. The 
relationship allows us to benefit  
from relatively low transport costs 
associated with our proximity to 
Met-Mex operations. We have sold  
to other refiners and smelters in the 
past and may do so in the future if 
conditions warrant.
SHAREHOLDERS
We balance shareholder returns with 
investment in growth projects in order 
to generate long-term sustainable 
value for our stakeholders. Peñoles 
holds 75% of our shares and has been 
the principal investor in the Group’s 
assets for over 50 years, focusing on 
supporting our long-term success. 
Peñoles is also a significant supplier 
and customer . The remaining shares 
are traded on the London and Mexican 
Stock Exchanges and we maintain 
regular dialogue with our 
independent investors. 
GOVERNMENTS AND REGULATORS
In Mexico and throughout Latin America 
we adhere to and respect all the laws 
and regulations governing natural 
resources and mining companies, 
particularly environmental, construction 
and labour laws. We cooperate with the 
authorities on security and regulatory 
matters. This approach helps to ensure 
ongoing access to the necessary 
exploration, mining rights and 
environmental permits across 
our operations. 
MEMBERSHIP ORGANISATIONS
We collaborate with and belong to a 
number of organisations to advocate 
and advance strategic initiatives that 
support shared objectives including: 
• CAMIMEX (the Mexican Mining 
Chamber) which advocates industry 
positions and sets benchmarks for 
the mining sector .
• CESPEDES (Sustainable 
Development Studies Commission 
for the Mexican Private Sector) which 
coordinates the private sector stance 
on issues such as the transition 
towards a green economy and 
greenhouse gas mitigation efforts.
• Mining Cluster for the State of 
Zacatecas which promotes the 
development of economic, social

to the first phase commencing operations 
in August 2016 and the second phase

the ramping up of operations over the

MANAGING OUR RISKS
OUR APPROACH TO RISK MANAGEMENT IS BASED ON A FRAMEWORK THAT 
EFFECTIVELY EMBEDS A CULTURE OF RISK AWARENESS ACROSS THE  
GROUP. THIS FRAMEWORK ENABLES US TO IDENTIFY, ASSESS, PRIORITISE  
AND MANAGE RISKS IN ORDER TO DELIVER THE VALUE CREATION  
OBJECTIVES DEFINED IN OUR BUSINESS MODEL.
RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Our risk management system is based 
on risk identification, assessment, 
prioritisation, mitigation and monitoring 
processes, which are continually 
evaluated, improved and enhanced  
in line with best practice. 
In addition to our established risk 
management activities, our executives, 
operations managers, the controllership 
group, HSECR managers and exploration 
managers regularly engage in 
strengthening the effectiveness  
of our current controls.
This supports the Board in its 
responsibilities of monitoring and 
reviewing risk management and  
the internal control systems. 
2017 RISK ASSESSMENT
As part of our 2017 risk assessment 
exercise, a team of 142 people worked 
together to evaluate 108 risks across 
all our operations, advanced projects, 
exploration offices, and support and 
corporate areas. We identified and 
subsequently added a new risk during 
the year which reflected the specific 
circumstances related to the ‘Increase 
in the frequency of the reviews by the 
tax authorities with special focus on the 
mining industry’.
We narrowed down our 108 risks  
into major risks which are monitored 
by executive management and the 
Audit Committee. We then further 
consolidated these into 12 principal 
risks which are closely monitored by 
the Board of Directors. This new risk  
is grouped within the ‘Potential actions 
by the government’ principal risk.

HEAT MAP
2017 2016 X
As part of our bottom-up process,  
each business unit head determined 
the perceived level of risk for their 
individual unit. Executive management 
then reviewed and challenged each 
perceived risk level, and compared it to 
Fresnillo plc’s risk universe as a whole. 
The results of this exercise were used 
as an additional input to identify the 
Group’s principal risks. We conducted 
the same risk analysis on advanced 
projects, detailing the specific risks 
faced by each project according to their 
unique characteristics and conditions. 
The risk heat map for each business 
unit and development project is 
included in the Review of Operations 
(pages 54-71).
In 2017, cyber security risk was 
elevated to a principal risk due to  
its increased relevance within the 
mining industry. As the mining industry 
continues to go through a digital 
transformation, with greater reliance 
on automated operational systems, 
more sophisticated and coordinated 
attacks are being launched by a broad 
range of groups looking to exploit 
vulnerabilities.

CHANGE IN HEAT MAP 
DESCRIPTION OF RISK LEVEL
According to the majority of silver 
and gold price analysts, the expected 
volatility of metal prices is lower  
than in recent times. Medium-term 
projections indicate stronger prices 
due to unpredictable global political 
and economic issues, including: the 
US administration’s ability to drive 
through changes to fiscal policy;  
very low or negative real rates; and 
improvement in the Eurozone’s 
economic position due to recent 
centrist political successes.
KEY RISK INDICATORS 
• Gross profit sensitivity to percentage 
change in precious metals price  
and to the Mexican peso/US dollar 
exchange rate.
• EBITDA sensitivity to percentage 
change in metals price and  
to Mexican peso/US dollar 
exchange rate.

RISK DESCRIPTION
Certain events could create an adverse impact on our  
sales and profits, and potentially the economic viability  
of projects. These events include:
• A decrease in precious metal prices, which is the primary 
driver for this risk. For the second consecutive year, gold 
achieved a higher annual average realised price over  
the previous year (+1.7% versus 2016). Silver prices 
experienced a slight decrease of 1.7%. 
• Revaluation of the Mexican peso. In 2017, the peso was 
revalued by 4.5% versus the average spot exchange rate 
of US dollars.
• General inflation in Mexico. This was 6.7% in Mexican 
pesos in 2017. The specific inflation affecting the  
Company was 6.4% in US dollar terms.
• A decrease in the price of our by-products, which is a 
relatively minor risk. In 2017, prices rose for the second 
consecutive year, with the average annual prices for lead 
and zinc rising 24.9% and 34.9%, respectively, over the 
previous year .
RESPONSE/MITIGATION
Our hedging policy remains guided by the principle of 
providing shareholders with full exposure to gold and silver 
prices. However, following shareholder approval for the 
acquisition of 44% of Penmont (and associated companies) 
in 2014, we initiated a specific hedging programme to 
protect the value of the investment made in the acquisition, 
using a collar structure to allow partial continued exposure 
to gold prices. The volume associated with this phased 
hedging programme was strictly limited to up to 44% of 
production associated with the acquired Penmont assets 
and will not be extended to other assets in the Group. The 
total volume hedged was 1,559,689 oz of which 324,780 oz 
expired in 2017 with no corresponding cash impact. The 
only impact on the income statement was a loss of US$41 
million related to the time value associated with gold 
commodity options.
FOR THE FINANCIAL REVIEW
SEE PAGES 104-115
We are not precluded from entering into derivatives to 
minimise our exposure to changes in the prices of lead and 
zinc by-products. The Group entered into a collar hedging 
structure in 2017, with maturities starting in 2018 so no 
results were recorded in the income statement. This 
structure aims to mitigate the risk related to the sale  
of lead and zinc. See note 31 in the financial statements 
page 239. 
Furthermore, we have hedging policies in place for foreign 
exchange risk, including those associated with capex 
related to projects. In 2017, we entered into a number of 
foreign exchange forward contracts denominated in euros, 
Swedish krona and Canadian dollars. See note 31 in the 
financial statements page 238.
We suffered significant increases in our main energy 
inputs over the previous year, with the average cost of 
diesel (USC$/lt.) rising by 22.2% and the KWH weighted 
average (USC$) increasing by 28.8%. This was due to the 
increase in international petroleum prices and the market 
liberalisation of fuel prices in Mexico. We will continue to 
identify and maintain efficiency initiatives to reduce our 
energy consumption.  37

CHANGE IN HEAT MAP 
DESCRIPTION OF RISK LEVEL 
The mining industry continues to  
face legal challenges in regard to 
access to land by individuals and 
local communities who may seek to 
disregard previous land agreements. 
This has been a consistent challenge 
in recent years.
In addition, in areas close to land  
of interest, prior and informed 
consultation and consent of 
indigenous communities may be 
required on a case-by-case basis.
The outcome is that, despite our 
many strategic actions, the perceived 
level of this risk remains very high.
KEY RISK INDICATORS 
• Percentage of land required for 
advanced exploration projects  
which is under occupation or other 
agreements other than full property 
ownership (overall and by project).
• Total US dollar and percentage of 
project budget spend on HSECR 
activities, including community 
relations (at projects and exploration 
sites).
2. ACCESS TO LAND
RISK DESCRIPTION
Failure or significant delays in accessing the surface land 
above our mineral concessions and other land of interest  
is a persistent risk to our strategy, and has a potentially 
high impact on our objectives. Possible barriers to land 
access include:
• Rising expectations of land owners.
• Refusal to acknowledge prior land acquisition terms  
and conditions by members of an agrarian community.
• Influence of multiple special interests in land 
negotiations.
• Conflicts in land boundaries with an often arduous 
resolution process.
• Succession issues among land owners resulting in a  
lack of clarity about the legal entitlement to possess  
and sell land.
• Litigation risk i.e. increased activism by agrarian 
communities and/or judicial authorities.
• Presence of indigenous communities in the proximity  
of land that is of interest, where prior and informed 
consultation and consent of such communities may 
be required.
Furthermore, insecurity and conflicts in our exploration and 
operational areas increase the complexity of land access.
RESPONSE/MITIGATION
We actively manage our mining rights in order to maximise 
our opportunities for successful land access, focusing on 
areas of interest or strategic value. At the end of 2017, 
after adding required areas and divesting areas of less 
interest, we held 1.8 million hectares, the same area as  
the previous year . Other initiatives include:
• Careful advanced planning for land requirements and 
acquisitions (e.g. anticipating any issues with a potential 
land purchase before intensive exploration). In certain 
areas of interest, we negotiate leasing or occupation 
agreements with purchase options, in compliance with 
legal and regulatory requirements.
• The fostering of strong community relations through 
investment in community programmes and infrastructure. 
Such investments totalled US$2.4 million in 2017.
• Always seeking tri-party cooperation between the 
government, community and ourselves in securing  
access to land.
• Early involvement of our community relations teams 
during the negotiation and acquisition processes, 
including the exploration stage.
• Working with our land negotiation teams, which comprise 
specialists hired directly by Fresnillo and also provided by 
Peñoles as part of the service agreement.
As part of an ongoing review of the legal status of our  
land rights, we identified certain areas of opportunity and 
continue to implement measures to manage this risk on  
a case-by-case basis. Such measures include, whenever 
possible, negotiating with agrarian communities for the 
outright purchase of land. We use mechanisms provided 
under agrarian law and also utilise other legal mechanisms 
under mining law which afford added protection for land 
occupation. We have already closed several such agreements 
in the states of Sonora and Zacatecas. These activities 
form part of our ongoing drive to reduce exposure to risk 
regarding surface rights. 38

CHANGE IN HEAT MAP 
DESCRIPTION OF RISK LEVEL
We continue to perceive this risk 
level as very high due to the pressure 
that the government or government 
officials (in either case, both at the 
federal and local levels) could exert 
over the mining industry. Evidence of 
this influence on our industry can be 
seen in the increase in the frequency 
of reviews by the tax authorities, the 
new legislation requiring management 
to ensure that contractors are 
compliant with their own tax 
obligations and the imposition of the 
environmental taxes contained in the 
new Tax Law in Zacatecas. In addition, 
it is evident in the continued perceived 
level of corruption across Mexico, 
which remains high 
1
 and worsened 
versus the previous year . We share a 
general industry view that, regrettably, 
local and regional governments in 
particular have worsened in this 
regard, notwithstanding the national 
effort to implement an anticorruption 
system, which is not yet fully deployed. 
As a result, delays in obtaining permits 
for certain operations and/or projects 
remain a risk.
President, senate and representative 
chambers elections, together with 
other local positions, will be held  
in 2018. As a result, an increase 
in the level of this risk is likely, 
depending on the candidates’  
stance towards mining. 
KEY RISK INDICATORS 
• Number of media mentions related 
to mining regulations. These could 
include mentions of tax, royalties, 
the banning of mining activities in 
protected areas and legal precedents. 
The indicator also provides detail on 
the media itself, such as speaker 
profile and political alignment.
3. POTENTIAL ACTIONS BY THE GOVERNMENT
E.G. IMPLEMENTATION OF MORE STRINGENT REGULATIONS FOR OBTAINING PERMITS, ETC.
RISK DESCRIPTION
Government actions may have an adverse impact on us. 
These could include stringent regulations relating to the 
environment or explosives, or more challenging processes 
for obtaining permits or more onerous tax compliance 
obligations as well as more frequent reviews by tax 
authorities; refer to financial statement notes for more 
detail, pages 192-243.
On 1 January 2017, a new tax law (the ‘Tax Law’) came  
into effect in the state of Zacatecas in northern Mexico.  
It includes a new set of ‘environmental taxes’ relating 
to the following activities undertaken within the state:
i. Extraction of materials other than minerals referenced in 
Article 4 of the Mexican Mining Law (gold, silver, lead, zinc, 
etc.) from the soil and sub-soil through open-pit processes;
ii. Emissions of certain substances into the atmosphere;
iii. Deposit of contaminants into the soil and water; and
iv. Storage of waste in public or private landfills.
The right of indigenous communities to be consulted and 
grant their prior and informed consent regarding mining 
concessions may affect the granting of new concessions  
in Mexico.
RESPONSE/MITIGATION
Together with our internal and external advisors, we filed 
an appeal in the form of a legal injunction before Federal 
Courts in Mexico. This challenged the validity of the Tax 
Law on the basis that in our opinion, extractive activities 
are regulated at a federal level. A ruling was issued in our 
favour and the state of Zacatecas has filed a last appeal 
which is under review. Although we believe that the initial 
ruling will be upheld, if this is not the case, we estimate 
that the potential net impact of these new taxes on our 
income statement would be in the range of US$4-7 million 
for the 2017 fiscal year and subsequent years. 
We continue to collaborate with other members of the 
mining community via the Mexican Mining Chamber to 
lobby against this and any other new detrimental taxes, 
royalties or regulations. We also support the industry’s 
lobbying efforts to improve the general public’s 
understanding of the Mining Law.
We remain compliant with all applicable environmental 
regulations and are fully committed to operating in a 
sustainable way.
We seek to maintain full compliance with tax authority 
requirements. In doing so we continue to cooperate with 
any ongoing tax inspections.
Although Mexico’s Mining Law does not yet incorporate 
indigenous consultation, it remains an ongoing issue. 
Some local state governments have begun to legislate on 
this matter as a prior requirement for mining projects to 
proceed in specific areas where indigenous populations 
may be present.

CHANGE IN HEAT MAP 
DESCRIPTION OF RISK LEVEL 
We have continued to experience  
a high level of security incidents, 
both in frequency and severity. The 
perceived level of risk has therefore 
remained very high. In the regions 
and projects where we operate,  
we did not observe an improvement 
in the crime rate during 2017.
We also refer to The Global Peace 
Index 
2
 ranking, which indicates  
a higher likelihood of violent 
demonstrations and political 
instability. This index uses three 
broad themes: level of safety and 
security in society; the extent of 
domestic or international conflict; 
and the degree of militarisation. 
Mexico ranks 142 of 163 countries 
worldwide (from best to worst), as  
a country with a low state of peace 
and has fallen by two places in the 
ranking. In addition, we use the 
Mexico Peace Index 
2
 ranking as a 
reference. This is a comprehensive 
index of the following indicators 
(adjusted with non-compliant rates): 
homicides; violent crimes; firearms 
crimes; non-convicted prisoners;  
and drug trafficking crimes. The 
index ranks states from 1 to 5,  
where 1 represents the most 
peaceful. Guerrero, Zacatecas and 
Chihuahua tend to rank among the 
less peaceful states in Mexico, while 
Sonora and Durango are located in 
the medium range.
KEY RISK INDICATORS 
• Total number of security incidents 
affecting our workforce (thefts, 
kidnapping, extortion, etc.).
• Number of sites affected and work 
days lost, by region and type of site. 
• Number of media mentions related 
to security issues affecting the 
mining industry.
4. SECURITY
RISK DESCRIPTION
Our people, contractors and suppliers face the risk of 
kidnapping, extortion or harm due to security conditions  
in the regions where we operate. We face the risk of 
restricted access to operations/projects and theft 
of assets.
The influence of drug cartels, other criminal elements  
and general lawlessness in the regions where we operate, 
combined with our exploration and project activities in 
areas of transfer or cultivation of drugs, makes working  
in these areas a particular risk for us.
RESPONSE/MITIGATION
We closely monitor the security situation, maintaining 
clear internal communications and coordinating work in 
areas of higher insecurity. We have adopted the following 
practices to manage our security risks and prevent and 
deal with possible incidents:
• We maintain close relations with authorities at federal, 
state and local levels, including army encampments 
located near the majority of our operations.
• We have finalised a new standard for the technological 
and physical security of all our business units. 
Implementation has taken more time than expected  
due to the extent of the new arrangements and the 
increased scope. However, we are planning to complete 
implementation for all business units during 2018.
• In 2017 we launched an initiative to professionalise  
our security contractors. The aim is to ensure that we  
only work with those who can meet our requirement  
to employ trained security experts. This process will 
continue in 2018.
• We have continued to improve our logistics controls  
in order to reduce the probability of theft of mineral 
concentrate. These controls include: the use of real-time 
tracking technology; surveillance cameras; tests to 
 identify alterations in transported material; guard services; 
and control checkpoints in a ‘safe corridor’. We have also 
reduced the number of authorised stops in order to optimise 
delivery times and minimise the exposure of convoys. For 
example, no stops are allowed on short-haul routes. 
• We continue to invest in community programmes, 
infrastructure improvements and government initiatives 
to support the development of lawful local communities 
and discourage criminal acts. 
• In order to ensure the security of our personnel, access  
to the San Nicolas del Oro prospect remains suspended 
because of the level of insecurity in the state of Guerrero. 
We plan to work together with key actors in the community 
to promote the benefits of mining as an alternative source 
of work and as a generator of improved social and 
educational infrastructure.
• Both internally and among our contractors, we continue to 
promote the reporting of criminal acts to the authorities.
• We are evaluating the option of increasing the number of 
housing units close to certain business units, in order to 
reduce the risk exposure during transportation.

DESCRIPTION OF RISK CHANGE
We have maintained our social 
licence to operate in our 
communities. Continuing to maintain 
and protect this licence demands 
strong collaboration with the local 
community and stakeholders. 
There are multiple examples of how 
years of protests and demands have 
led to the cancellation of projects. 
Objections are not only from local 
communities, but also from local  
and international NGOs as well as 
regulators working to meet high 
expectations and pressure from 
governments. We continue to perceive 
this complex issue as a high risk. 
KEY RISK INDICATORS 
• Number of local actions by non-
governmental organisations (NGOs) 
or other local social groups against 
mining, by region.
• Number of actions by NGOs or other 
local social groups against mining  
in the Americas.
• Number of media mentions related 
to demonstrations against the 
mining industry.
5. PUBLIC PERCEPTION AGAINST MINING
RISK DESCRIPTION
Across the world, public opinion is increasingly wary of the 
potential adverse social and environmental consequences 
of mining operations. This sentiment is manifested through 
increased regulatory obligations for mining companies  
and increased social activism by communities and other 
grassroots organisations.
RESPONSE/MITIGATION
Communities are our strategic partners. To win and 
maintain their trust, we must show understanding and 
effective engagement, and be accountable for our impact. 
Our well-established programme for community 
engagement includes: 
• Increase our understanding and accountability:
 – Monitoring public opinion within local and 
international media.
 – Holding continuous dialogue with our key local 
stakeholders through formal and informal meetings. 
 – Carrying out social baseline, human rights and 
perception studies to better understand our positive 
and negative impacts. In 2017 we conducted such 
studies in all of our operations.
 – Operating a grievance mechanism to address 
stakeholder concerns.
• Purposeful and aspirational engagement with local 
communities:
 – Maintaining a Social Investment Portfolio to create 
long-term value, aligned with the UN Global Goals  
for sustainable development. We have identified four 
pillars where we can make a real difference: Education, 
Water, Health and Capacity building.
 – Partnering with NGOs in these four pillars of social 
investment: Education (IBBY, INNOVEC & First 
Robotics), Water (Captar AC), Health (National 
University Foundation) and Capacity Building 
(ProEmpleo).
 – Engaging with municipal authorities to invest the 
resources of the Mining Tax Fund in infrastructure 
projects that benefit our neighbour communities.
• Collaborating with peers in the international and Mexican 
mining community to promote the benefits of the mining 
industry and responsible mining practices.

DESCRIPTION OF RISK LEVEL 
Safety is continually monitored by the 
Board, which has always given it the 
highest priority. The Board oversees 
all accident investigations, ensuring 
that the appropriate actions are 
taken to improve safety systems 
and practices.
KEY RISK INDICATORS 
• Accident rate.
• Days lost rate.
• Accidents frequency: 
 – Without lost time.
 – With lost time.
 – Fatalities.
6. SAFETY
RISK DESCRIPTION
It is an inherent risk in our industry that incidents due to 
unsafe acts or conditions could lead to injuries or fatalities.
Our people face risks such as fire, explosion, electrocution 
and carbon monoxide poisoning, as well as risks specific  
to each mine site and development project. These include 
rock falls caused by geological conditions, cyanide 
contamination and heavy or light equipment collisions 
involving machinery or personnel.
RESPONSE/MITIGATION
Regrettably, a fatal injury in the first half of 2017 meant 
that we did not reach our goal of zero fatalities. 
Management has since taken decisive steps to address and 
prevent the root causes of fatal injuries and strengthened 
our safety initiatives. These include: 
• A permanent effort to reinforce our safety culture, 
comprising the following programmes: ‘Rules that Save 
Lives’, ‘Operational Discipline’ and ‘Behavioural Change’, 
supported by comprehensive accident investigation. 
• A pilot project at our Saucito mine to improve safety 
performance and develop competences in our supervisors. 
The project involves training a group of trainers to 
subsequently lead the programme for the rest of the 
business units. 
The Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate increased  
to 23.22 in 2017 (versus 16.93 in 2016) and the Lost Time 
Injury Frequency Rate increased to 8.14 (versus 5.99  
in 2016). 
We continue to deliver training for both employees and 
contractors. Personnel received an average of 87 hours  
of training in 2017. 35 of these 87 hours involved HSECR 
training, of which 33 related to safety.

DESCRIPTION OF RISK LEVEL
Our strict investment governance 
process and system of capital project 
controls remain in place, safeguarding 
our ability to deliver growth through 
development projects on time and on 
budget. During 2017, we successfully 
completed the commissioning of  
San Julián, which had the effect of 
reducing our project perceived risk 
level. We plan to start construction  
at Juanicipio in 2018. Several factors 
have led us to perceive a lower  
level of risk for Juanicipio than for 
previous projects. These include a 
lower level of investment, easier 
access to infrastructure and the 
site’s proximity to current operations. 
KEY RISK INDICATORS 
• Earned value (rate of financial 
advancement versus physical 
advancement).
• Percentage of major equipment 
ordered and received according  
to plan.
• Percentage of completion of mine 
development.
7. PROJECTS (PERFORMANCE RISK)
RISK DESCRIPTION
The pursuit of advanced exploration and development 
opportunities are core to meeting our strategic goals. 
However, they carry certain project-related risks:
• Economic viability: The impact of capital cost to develop 
and maintain the mine; future metal prices; and operating 
costs through the mine’s life cycle.
• Uncertainties associated with developing and operating 
new mines and expansion projects: Fluctuations in ore 
grade and recovery; unforeseen complexities in the
 mining process; poor rock quality; unexpected presence  
of underground water or lack thereof; lack of community 
support; and inability to obtain and maintain required 
operating permits.
• Delivery risk: Projects may go over budget in terms of cost 
and time; they may not be constructed in accordance with 
the required specifications; and major mining equipment 
may not be delivered on time.
RESPONSE/MITIGATION
Our investment evaluation process determines how to  
best direct available capital using technical, financial and 
qualitative criteria.
• Technical: We assess the resource estimate and 
confirmed resources, the metallurgy of the mineral 
bodies, the investment required in general infrastructure 
(e.g. roads, power, general services, housing) and the 
infrastructure required for the mine and plant.
• Financial: We look at risk relative to return for proposed 
investments of capital. We set expected internal rates  
of return (IRR) per project as thresholds for approving  
the allocation of capital based on the present value of 
expected cash flows from the invested capital.
• Qualitative factors: The alignment of the investment  
with our strategic plan and business model; synergies 
with other investments and operating assets; and the 
implications for safety, security, people, resourcing and 
community relations.
We closely monitor project controls to ensure that we 
deliver approved projects on time, on budget and in line 
with the defined specifications. The executive management 
team and Board of Directors are regularly updated on 
progress. Each advanced exploration project and major 
capital development project has a risk register containing 
the identified and assessed risks specific to the project.
The project development pipeline in 2018 includes: 
• Ongoing construction and development of the Pyrites 
plant.
• The Centauro Extension, including a second line of the 
dynamic leaching plant, at Herradura.
• Project optimisation of Fresnillo’s plant.
• Feasibility study and start of construction of Juanicipio.

DESCRIPTION OF RISK LEVEL 
During 2017, we continued to build 
on our good relations with unions  
at national and local levels, and we 
do not expect an increase in this 
perceived level of risk. Our executive 
management and the Board recognise 
the importance of union relations 
and follow any developments with 
interest. 
KEY RISK INDICATORS 
• Union members level of satisfaction. 
• Number of media mentions related 
to mining union developments.
8. UNION RELATIONS
RISK DESCRIPTION
Although the risk of union action or a deterioration in  
union relations at some sites may be possible, overall  
our relationship with the unions continues to strengthen. 
Nonetheless, internal union politics could impact us 
negatively, as could pressure from other mining unions 
that want to take over the Fresnillo labour contract.
RESPONSE/MITIGATION
Our strategy is to integrate unionised personnel into  
each business unit (BU) team. We achieve this by clearly 
assigning responsibilities and programmes for maintaining 
close relationships with unions at mine sites and at 
national level. We maintain close communication with 
union leaders at various levels of the organisation in  
order to: raise awareness about the economic situation  
the industry is facing; share our production results; and to 
encourage union participation in our initiatives regarding 
safety and other operational improvements. These 
initiatives include the safety guardians programme, 
alliances for obtaining certifications, integration of high 
productivity teams and family activities. During the year, 
we held six leadership workshops which were attended  
by 150 key union leaders at our business units. 
We are proactive and timely in our responses to the needs 
of the unions, and experienced no labour-related work 
stoppages in 2017. If required, we engage experienced 
legal counsel, both internal and external, to support us  
on labour issues. We will continue to closely monitor  
union and labour developments.  44

DESCRIPTION OF RISK LEVEL
Maintaining a reasonable investment 
in exploration, even when metal 
prices are low, means that the level 
of this risk remains steady. While 
continuous investment has always 
been a hallmark of our exploration 
strategy, replenishing exploited 
reserves and increasing our total 
amount of resources could be a 
challenge in the future. 
KEY RISK INDICATORS 
• Drill programmes completed 
(overall and by project).
• Change in the number of ounces  
in reserves and resources.
• Rate of conversion from resources 
to reserves.
9. EXPLORATION
RISK DESCRIPTION
We are highly dependent on the success of the exploration 
programme to meet our strategic value-creation targets 
and our long-term production and reserve goals.
In addition to the growing level of insecurity and access  
to land detailed in previous risks, other risks that may 
impact prospecting and converting inferred resources 
include: the lack of a robust portfolio of prospects in our 
pipeline with sufficient potential in terms of indicated and 
inferred resources; and insufficient concession coverage  
in target areas.
We also risk the loss of purchase opportunities due to 
insufficient speed in decision-making. 
As our production escalates and more mines approach  
the end of their lives, replenishing our reserves becomes 
increasingly challenging.
RESPONSE/MITIGATION
During 2017, we invested a total of US$145.3 million 
in exploration activities. Our objectives for 2018 include  
a budgeted risk capital investment in exploration of 
approximately US$200 million. The approximate spending 
split is 42% for operating mines, 33% for exploration 
projects and the remaining 25% for prospects, regional 
prospecting and mining rights. 
Our exploration strategy also includes:
• A focus on increasing regional exploration drilling 
programmes to intensify efforts in the districts with 
high potential.
• For local exploration, aggressive in-field exploration to 
upgrade the resources category and convert inferred 
resources into reserves.
• A team of highly trained and motivated geologists,  
both employees and long-term contractors.
• Advisory technical reviews by international third party 
experts, up-to-date and integrated GIS databases, remote 
sensing imagery and software for identifying favourable 
metallogenic belts and districts to be field-checked by 
the team.
• Drill-ready high priority projects.
During 2017 we slightly increased our land concessions  
by 13,133 hectares, which are located in areas of interest 
to Fresnillo.

CHANGE IN HEAT MAP 
Change in risk level: not applicable 
as this risk was first identified  
as a principal risk in 2017. It had 
previously been included in our  
risk register universe.
DESCRIPTION OF RISK LEVEL 
In 2016, a major Canadian gold 
mining company suffered a data 
breach impacting private corporate 
and employee information. Over the 
last six years, the mining sector has 
faced 17 
2
 cyber incidents. As this  
risk is an increasing threat to the 
industry, we have decided that it 
should be monitored and overseen  
by the Audit Committee. 
KEY RISK INDICATORS 
We are currently developing KRIs to 
monitor this new principal risk and 
we are considering the following:
• Total number of cyber security 
incidents affecting our industry/ 
our Company. 
• Number of media mentions related 
to cyber security issues affecting the 
mining industry.
10. CYBER SECURITY
RISK DESCRIPTION
We recognise the importance of the confidentiality, 
continuity, integrity and security of our data and 
production systems. 
As a mining company, we may be under threat of cyber 
attacks from a broad set of attacker groups, from 
‘hacktivists’ and hostile regimes to organised criminals. 
Their goals include a desire to take advantage of the role 
that mining plays in regional and global supply chains as 
well as in national economies. 
Certain groups may also attempt to exploit vulnerabilities 
created by the industry’s heavy reliance on operational 
automated systems and IT
 1
. In our case, this could include 
initiatives such as Operations Technology and Information 
Technology (OTIT) Integration and Digital Mine (pages 50-51).
RESPONSE/MITIGATION
Our cyber security strategy seeks to ensure that our 
networks, systems and data are secured in accordance 
with best practices as promoted by the US National 
Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber security 
Framework (NIST CSF) and Control Objectives for 
Information and Related Technologies (COBIT).
During 2017, we created a committee tasked with 
establishing a uniform and effective protocol for  
how we respond to cyber security incidents.

CHANGE IN HEAT MAP 
DESCRIPTION OF RISK LEVEL
We aim to carefully align our Human 
Capital with our operational and 
growth requirements. We believe 
that we have currently achieved this 
alignment, due to the success of 
activities including our ongoing 
university recruitment and employee 
retention strategies.
Contractor resourcing continues to 
be a major challenge. We maintain a 
broad base of contractors in order to 
provide us with operational flexibility, 
and aim to professionalise them to 
the same level as our own employees. 
KEY RISK INDICATORS 
• Number of positions filled by  
area of specialty, for vacancies  
and new positions.
• Employee turnover rate.
• Average hours of training and 
professional development per 
employee.
• Number of contractor personnel 
relative to unionised personnel  
per BU.
11. HUMAN RESOURCES
RISK DESCRIPTION
Our people are critical to delivering our objectives. We face 
risks in selecting, recruiting, training and retaining the 
people we need.
A lack of reliable contractors with sufficient infrastructure, 
machinery, performance track record and skilled personnel 
is also a risk that could impact our ability to develop and 
construct mining works.
RESPONSE/MITIGATION
Recruitment: we have assessed our hiring requirements 
for key positions for 2018, and aim to meet them by internal 
training and promotion, and by recruitment through:
• Our close relationships with universities offering earth 
science programmes. We have dedicated programmes to 
identify potential candidates based on performance who 
may be hired as interns and/or employees on graduation. 
• CETEF (Centre for Technical Studies Fresnillo) which 
teaches specific mining operational skills. All 13 
graduates hired in 2017 joined as full-time employees. 
• CETLAR (the Peñoles Centre for Technical Studies) which 
trains mechanics and electrical technicians. All eight 
graduates hired in 2017 for Fresnillo BUs joined as 
full-time employees.
Retention: our aim is to be the employer of choice, and we 
recognise that in order to be a profitable and sustainable 
company, we have to generate value for our employees  
and their families. We do this by providing a healthy, safe, 
productive and team-oriented working environment that 
not only encourages our people to fulfil their potential but 
also supports process improvements. Our focus is on 
continuous improvement driven by training, development 
and personal growth opportunities; in summary our focus 
is on fair hiring, fair remuneration and benefits and gender 
equality as described in our Human Capital section on 
pages 79 and 85. In 2017 we were once again recognised 
as a Great Place to Work, and were ranked in 22nd place  
among companies with more than 5,000 employees.
Performance: we have continued our performance 
evaluation process, reinforcing formal feedback.  
We promote the certification of key technical skills for 
operational personnel, and provide an administrative  
and leadership skills development programme where 
appropriate. We develop our high potential middle 
managers through the Leaders with Vision programme. 
Contractors: we have long-term drilling and mining 
contracts. We invest significantly in training contractors, 
particularly on safety and environmental requirements.  
We have supported the enrolment of 58 of our contractor 
companies into the self-management Programme on 
Health and Safety at Work (PASST), promoted by the 
Mexican Secretariat of Labour and Social Welfare (STPS).  
Of these companies, 19% have been certified, 72%  
are in the process of being certified, and 9% have 
adhered voluntarily. 47

DESCRIPTION OF RISK LEVEL 
Our environmental management 
system, together with our investment 
in preventative measures and training, 
are key factors which reduce the risk 
of major environmental incidents. 
Based on available information, we 
did not see a change in this perceived 
risk level. 
KEY RISK INDICATORS 
• Number of BUs with ISO 14001:2004 
certification.
• Number of BUs with Clean Industry 
certification.
• Number of BUs with International 
Cyanide Code certification.
• Number of environmental permits 
for all advanced exploration projects 
(according to schedule).
12. ENVIRONMENTAL INCIDENTS
RISK DESCRIPTION
Environmental incidents are an inherent risk in our 
industry. These incidents include the possible overflow  
or collapse of tailing dams, cyanide spills and dust
emissions, any of which could have a high impact on our 
people, communities and business.
RESPONSE/MITIGATION
Our environmental management system ensures 
compliance with Mexican regulations, provides 
transparency and supports initiatives that reduce our 
environmental footprint. We disclose our performance 
regarding our Natural Capital on pages 86-95 of 
this report. 
All our mining units are certified under ISO 14001 and  
have Clean Industry certification. 
Our leaching operations in Herradura and Noche Buena 
operate in compliance with the Cyanide Code issued by 
the International Cyanide Management Institute. 
We rigorously adhere to the requirements established  
by each project’s environmental permit (Environmental 
Impact Statement issued by the Ministry of Environment, 
SEMARNAT). We also continue to support contractors in 
their efforts to integrate environmental management 
systems.  48

FRESNILLO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
The Directors reviewed the viability 
period and confirmed that a five-year 
period to December 2022 remained 
suitable, in line with the nature of 
planning in the mining industry and the 
Company’s five-year forecast period 
normally used to evaluate liquidity and 
contingency plans. This is important, 
given that our business activities cover 
the full value chain from exploration to 
mine operation. It allows us to model 
capital expenditure and development 
programmes planned during the 
timeframe, and reflects cash flows 
generated by the projects currently 
under development. Due to the long 
business cycles in our industry, the 
Directors considered that a shorter 
time period would be insufficient.
Reporting on the Company’s viability 
requires the Directors to consider 
those principal risks that could  
impair the solvency and liquidity of the 
Company. In order to determine those 
risks, the Directors robustly assessed 
the Group-wide principal risks and 
operation-specific risks by undertaking 
consultations with executive 
management, mine managers and 
other personnel across our operations. 
Through these conversations, the 
Directors also identified low probability, 
high loss scenarios – ‘singular events’ 
– with the potential magnitude to 
severely impact the solvency and/or 
liquidity of Fresnillo.
For the purpose of assessing the 
Group’s viability, the Directors identified 
that of the principal risks detailed on 
page 35, the following are the most 
important:
• ‘Impact of metal prices and global 
macroeconomic developments’, 
specifically volatility in the prices of 
gold and silver over a period of time.
• Access to land.
• ‘Potential actions by the 
government’ which could include  
a delay in obtaining permits and/or 
new restrictive regulations.
• Environmental incidents.
It was determined that none of the 
individual risks would in isolation 
compromise the Group’s viability. The 
Directors therefore went on to Group 
principal risks into the following severe 
but plausible scenarios, in each case 
determining the risk proximity (how 
soon the risk could occur) and velocity 
(the speed with which the impact of a 
risk could be felt):
Scenario 1: Impact of metal prices and 
global macroeconomic developments. 
Over a period of a year, precious metal 
prices fall and then remain at a low 
level for the following four years of  
the viability period, varying between 
US$1,130-1,225 per gold oz. and 
US$15.4-17.0 per silver oz. To create 
this impartial projection for the future 
low metal price environment, the 
Directors used an average of the three 
lowest forecasts from each year of the 
assessment, based on consensus 
estimates published by institutional 
financial analysts. This low metal price 
environment was deemed to be the 
most significant risk and pervasive 
across the Company. (Principal risk)
Scenario 2: Bench collapse at an open 
pit mine. A landslide occurs covering 
the lower pit of one of our mines. Due 
to the unexpected nature of the event, 
fatalities occur . Production is gradually 
ramped back up and re-established to 
full capacity. (Singular event)
Scenario 3: Tailings dam breach at  
a mine. A tailings dam collapses and 
tailings are released into the surrounding 
area, causing environmental damage.  
A fund is created by the Company to be 
used to remediate and compensate for 
any damages caused. The investigation 
into the causes of the event is drawn 
out and further time is needed for all 
environmental permits to be reinstated. 
As a result, the mine remains closed 
throughout the viability assessment 
period. (Principal risk)
Scenario 4: Flooding at a mine. An 
unforeseen fault containing water is cut 
into, with water then entering the mine 
in excess of pumping capacity, thereby 
halting production of one of the main 
areas in the mine. The ramp-up to 
pre-event production levels commences 
once management determines that it is 
safe to do so. (Singular event)
Scenario 5: Action by the government 
at a mine. Explosives are stolen on site 
causing the authorities to suspend the 
mine’s explosives permit. Production  
is halted while an investigation into  
the matter is completed. Once permits 
have been restored, production ramps 
back up to pre-event levels. 
(Principal risk)
Scenario 6: Access to land at a mine. 
Conflicts with local communities arise 
resulting in the Company having to 
cease operations, until negotiations 
can be finalised and the land can be 
re-occupied. (Principal risk)
Scenario 7: San Julián suspension  
due to government actions. Members 
of the local community are poisoned 
due to the rupturing of a cyanide tank. 
Pressure from social activists results  
in the Mexican government withdrawing 
all permits, with no intention of 
reinstating them in the future. This 
leads to the permanent closure of the 
San Julián mine for the duration of the 
viability period, while mitigating actions 
are executed. (Principal risk)
VIABILITY STATEMENT & GOING CONCERN STATEMENT
IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROVISION C.2.2 OF THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
CODE, AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE GROUP’S CURRENT POSITION AND ITS 
PRINCIPAL RISKS FOR A PERIOD LONGER THAN THE 12 MONTHS REQUIRED BY 
THE GOING CONCERN STATEMENT, MANAGEMENT PREPARED A VIABILITY 
ANALYSIS WHICH WAS ASSESSED BY THE BOARD FOR APPROVAL. 49

The hypothetical scenarios above are 
extremely severe in order to create 
outcomes that have the ability to 
threaten the viability of the Group. 
However, multiple control measures 
are in place to prevent and mitigate any 
such occurrences. Should any of these 
scenarios take place, various options 
are available to the Company in order 
to maintain sufficient liquidity to 
continue in operation. When quantifying 
the expected financial impact and 
remediation time required for each of 
these risks, management performed 
benchmarking against the Group’s  
own experience and against publicly 
available information on relevant, 
similar incidents in the mining industry.
All scenarios were first evaluated using 
average metal prices 
1
, and once the 
mitigation plans had been applied 
where necessary, it was decided that 
there was no threat to the viability of the 
Company. To create a more stringent 
test and further challenge the resilience 
of the Group, all scenarios were then 
overlaid with scenario one, (low metal 
prices) and then re-evaluated.
When these scenarios were re-
modelled, none led to an extremely low 
or negative cash balance because the 
strong cash balance at the end of 2017 
(US$896 million comprising cash and 
cash equivalents of US$876 million  
and investment fund available for sale 
of US$20 million) positions Fresnillo 
plc in a healthy financial situation. In 
addition, the current macroeconomic 
circumstances, metal prices and 
exchange rates (MXN/USD), contribute 
to the preservation of a positive cash 
balance position through the 
scenarios assessed. 
The lowest cash balance level was 
identified in scenario number seven,  
in combination with the low metal 
prices scenario. However, even in  
this scenario a positive cash balance 
would be maintained throughout the 
viability period, with a minimum level  
of US$197 million during the third  
year (2020), meaning that mitigating 
actions would not be required. Risk 
management and internal control 
systems are in place (page 34) 
throughout the Group. Through the 
internal control systems, the Directors 
monitor key variables that have the 
ability to impact the liquidity and 
solvency of the Group, and we are 
confident that management is able  
to sufficiently mitigate any situations  
as they might occur .
Risk mitigation and control measures 
that are in place include a Crisis 
Committee, while the Board would  
also be briefed and convened as 
necessary, in order to respond to 
events as they develop. Dedicated 
personnel for managing media, 
engaging with authorities and other 
stakeholders are appointed at each 
level of the organisation, depending  
on the magnitude of the crisis.
In connection with longer-term viability, 
the US$800 million Senior Notes issued 
in 2013 are due for repayment in 2023, 
one year after the end of the viability 
review period. It is currently anticipated 
that all or part of these US$800 million 
will be refinanced. If, however, market 
conditions then will not permit 
refinancing on acceptable terms, under 
all the scenarios outlined above with 
depressed metal prices, the Company 
would have adequate resources to 
repay the US$800 million in full.
Based on the results of this robust 
analysis and having considered the 
established controls for the risks and 
the available mitigating actions, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the five-year period of 
their detailed assessment. This longer- 
term assessment process supports the 
Directors’ statements on both viability, 
as set out above, and going concern,  
set out below.
1 The average metals price derived from a range of Financial Institutions analysis as of December 2017.
GOING CONCERN STATEMENT
The Group’s business activities, 
together with the factors likely  
to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set  
out above in the Strategic Review on 
pages 8-115. The financial position  
of the Group, its cash flows and 
liquidity position are described in the 
Financial Review in pages 104-115.  
In addition, note 31 to the financial 
statements includes the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes  
for managing its capital; its financial 
risk management objectives; details 
of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities; and its exposures 
to credit risk and liquidity risk.
In making their assessment of the 
Group’s ability to manage its future 
cash requirements, the Directors 
have considered the Company and 
Group budgets and the cash flow 
forecasts for the period to 
31 December 2019. In addition, they 
reviewed a more conservative cash 
flow scenario with reduced silver and 
gold prices of US$15.6 and US$1,133, 
respectively, throughout this period, 
while maintaining current budgeted 
expenditure approved by the Executive 
Committee. This resulted in our 
current cash balances reducing  
over time but maintaining ample 
liquidity throughout the period.
The Directors have further calculated 
prices (US$12.5 and US$865 for silver 
and gold, respectively), which should 
they prevail to the end of 2019, would 
result in cash balances decreasing  
to minimal levels by the end of 2019, 
without applying mitigations.
Should metal prices remain below 
the stressed prices above for an 
extended period, management have 
identified specific elements of capital 
and exploration expenditures which 
could be deferred without  
adversely affecting production 
profiles throughout the period. 
Finally management could amend 
the mining plans to concentrate on 
production with a higher margin in 
order to accelerate cash generation 
without affecting the integrity of the 
mine plans.
After reviewing all of the above 
considerations, the Directors  
have a reasonable expectation  
that management have sufficient 
flexibility in adverse circumstances 
to maintain adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence  
for the foreseeable future. The 
Directors, therefore, continue to 
adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the annual 
financial statements. 50

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND CYBER SECURITY
At Fresnillo, we have continued to  
invest in the latest intelligent solutions 
in order to improve safety, productivity 
and decision-making. At the same time, 
we have identified and are addressing 
our gaps in cyber security. This report 
highlights how the Company leverages 
Intellectual Capital to identify and 
implement innovative and effective 
technological solutions to support 
decision making and meet the 
challenges that lie ahead. 
IT STRATEGY
During 2017, we invested a total of 
US$18.6 million in technology. Our 
strategy is guided by the IT Governance 
Committee, chaired by the CEO. The 
Committee’s main responsibilities are to:
• Review technology options for 
business process innovation.
• Select the best technology, ensure 
alignment with business strategy 
and prioritise projects.
• Strengthen cyber security 
framework and protocols.
• Develop and oversee a technology 
implementation budget.
• Reward results, not activities.
CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN 2017
The implementation of key technologies 
has helped us take great strides towards 
safer and more productive operations.
During the last year, we made 
significant progress on extending  
the benefits of these solutions across 
our mine portfolio. This included 
further implementation of three key 
programmes: Ventilation Plus at San 
Julián, Ciénega, Saucito and Fresnillo; 
Track Plus at Saucito, San Julián and 
Ciénega; and ProxAlarm at San Julián, 
Ciénega and Herradura.
2017 also saw the initial 
implementation of several projects, 
including ProxAlarm and MineOps 
Optimiser, at Noche Buena. In addition, 
at Herradura we have started work to 
introduce a Fatigue Monitoring project 
aimed at reducing operator error, and  
a Slope Monitoring project that will 
help optimise the pit wall slope angles 
as well as creating a safer place to 
work. We expect full implementation of 
all these programmes to be completed 
by the third quarter of 2018.
Looking further ahead, by 2023 we 
expect to have implemented the One 
View project at our corporate office in 
Mexico City and the Intelligent Plants 
projects at all our plants. Additional 
technology projects will be prioritised 
and evaluated for implementation  
by the IT Governance Committee 
going forward.

THE CHALLENGE OF CYBER SECURITY
The issue of cyber security continues  
to climb up boardroom agendas 
worldwide, and is one of our key risks.
 
FOR MORE ON CYBER SECURITY RISKS
SEE PAGE 45
We value the confidentiality, continuity, 
integrity and security of our data and 
systems and during 2017 we made 
progress in further developing and 
implementing our cyber security 
strategy.
In line with best practice, our approach 
is based on two key frameworks:
• The US National Institute of 
Standards and Technology Cyber 
security Framework (NIST CSF) 
which outlines how companies can 
assess and improve their ability  
to prevent, detect and respond to 
cyber attacks.
• Control Objectives for Information 
and Related Technologies (COBIT), 
which was created by ISACA, the 
international professional association 
for IT management and governance, 
to provide an implementable set of 
IT-related controls, processes and 
enablers. 
IMPROVING HOW WE RESPOND  
TO POTENTIAL INCIDENTS
A timely and targeted response can 
play a major role in minimising any 
potential damage resulting from a 
cyber security incident.
During 2017, we collaborated with 
Peñoles in a joint project aimed at 
developing clear and consistent 
processes to guide our stakeholders  
in their response to any information 
security incidents. A key aspect of the 
challenge is to ensure that our culture 
supports our people in their ability  
to adapt behaviours and follow new 
policies and procedures. We have 
already made significant headway  
with this project and anticipate full 
completion by April 2019.
Towards the end of the year we also 
commissioned consultants Deloitte to 
support our cyber security initiatives 
by:
• Defining a formal cyber security 
strategy and governance.
• Reviewing and assessing risks 
present on our core business 
processes.
• Recommending initiatives and 
projects to help us maintain security 
at recommended levels. 
The table below provides greater detail on the progress achieved to date for the implementation of our technology projects:

CREATING VALUE THROUGH
OPERATE
Our operational performance is a key measure 
of our progress since the IPO. We strive to 
maintain an increasing level of production 
through three strategic initiatives. Firstly,  
we optimise capacity and recovery rates,  
for example, by investing in infrastructure  
to increase development rates and milling 
capacity. Secondly, we seek opportunities  
to expand operations at our existing mines, 
through activities such as further exploring 
areas of influence.
Finally, we look for continuous improvements

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE YEAR
Silver production increased 4.1%  
over 2016 due to the higher volumes  
of ore processed and the higher ore 
grade resulting from access to certain 
high grade veins at San Alberto and 
San Carlos.
Despite the increase in silver 
production, we continued experiencing 
delays in development. The average 
development rate for the year was 
3,366 metres per month as a result  
of lower productivity from contractors 
and mining equipment failures which 
impeded long-hole drilling activities.

To address this situation, we are 
implementing a plan that includes 
hiring additional contractors, working 
with existing contractors to improve 
their performance and improving 
equipment maintenance. We expect 
these measures to maintain current 
development rates in the short term, 
while increasing them in the long term. 
We continued investing in optimisation 
projects during the year . For example, 
we installed a vertical conveyor to reduce 
truck haulage at the deeper levels of  
the mine. We also made progress with 
the project to increase plant capacity  
to 9,000 tonnes per day, with the 
installation of the zinc thickener . The 
second stage of this project will be to 
install additional flotation cells, with  
the final stage being the installation  
of the vibrating screens. We expect  
these stages to be completed in the  
next couple of years and anticipate that 
the project will result in an additional 
average annual production of three 
million ounces of silver once 
commissioned by the end of 2019.
For 2018, we expect the silver ore 
grade to be around 235 g/t, while  
lead and zinc ore grades are expected  
to be in the region of 0.96% and 1.77% 
respectively. For the following five 
years, the silver ore grade is expected 
to remain around 230-250 g/t.
Silver resources remained broadly 
unchanged as a result of the addition of 
inferred resources, offset by a decrease 
in measured and indicated resources 
due to depletion and lower grade infill 
drilling results. 
Silver reserves decreased due to 
depletion, lower grade infill drilling and 
a higher cut-off grade resulting from 
the increase in all-in sustaining costs.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
Total capex allocation in 2017 was 
US$111.7 million, mainly for mine 
development, sustaining capex, the 
deepening of the San Carlos shaft and

and ore throughput.
• Maintain development rates at 
current levels in the short term, 
while increasing them in the  
long term.
• Carry out intensive in-fill deep 
drilling to increase certainty in 
operational planning.
• Expand flotation area at the 
beneficiation plant.
• Continue deepening the San 
Carlos shaft.
the installation of the vertical conveyor 
band and zinc thickener . In 2018, capex 
will largely be allocated to mining 
works, sustaining capex, the ongoing 
deepening of the San Carlos shaft and 
a tunnel boring machine to support the 
continued development of the mine. 
Investments in technology will include 
setting up Track Plus and ProxAlarm 
systems and monitoring Ventilation  
on Demand (see pages 50-51).
Adjusted revenue, excluding inter-
segment sales, increased by 10.1%  
to US$421.3 million due to the 4.1% 
increase in volumes of silver sold.
Cost per tonne increased 8.2% to 
US$47.5 in 2017 in line with the 
increase in cost inflation for this mine 
of 7.2% (net of the devaluation of the 
exchange rate) mainly associated with 
the increase in diesel and electricity 
prices and higher contractor and 
personnel unit costs.
Cash cost per silver ounce decreased 
66.7% to US$0.7 (2016: US$2.1). Margin 
per ounce increased 8.6% to US$16.4 
and, expressed as a percentage of

KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE YEAR
Annual silver production decreased 
slightly to 21.2 million ounces in 2017 as 
a result of the expected lower ore grade. 
This was mainly due to the higher grade 
development ore processed in 2016  
and the restricted access to high grade 
areas resulting from the anchoring 
activities to avoid rock instability. These 
factors more than offset the higher 
volume of ore processed. 
In 2018, the expected silver ore grade  
will be around 285 g/t due to regaining 
access to higher ore grade areas. The 
Silver ore grade is expected to remain 
stable at this level in the next three years. 
However, the gold ore grade is expected 
to increase gradually, reaching c. 1.3 g/t 
by 2020.

The 2017 drilling programme was 
focused on further resource generation 
and infill drilling aimed at upgrading the 
resource category into reserves. This 
was achieved, with increases in both 
silver resources and reserves, though 
this campaign will continue into 2018. 
The preparation of ramps and 
infrastructure for the hoist and 
equipment to deepen the Jarillas shaft 
continued, and in 2018 we will initiate 
the deepening of the shaft from 630 
metres to 1,000 metres. This project 
aims to provide access to the deeper 
reserves in the Jarillas vein.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
Capital expenditures in 2017 totalled 
US$133.7 million, primarily allocated  
to in-mine development and sustaining 
capex, the construction of the Pyrites 
plant and the deepening of the Jarillas 
shaft project. In 2018, capex will 
primarily be allocated to maintaining 
development rates, the deepening of 
the Jarillas shaft and the construction 
of the Pyrites plant (see page 66).  
Other minor investments will include 
continuing the implementation of 
Ventilation Plus and ProxAlarm 
systems (see pages 50-51).
Adjusted revenue at Saucito decreased 
by 4.5%, mainly as a result of the lower 
volumes sold and lower precious metal 
prices. The mine’s contribution to 
consolidated silver revenue decreased 
to 39.7% in 2017 (2016: 48.5%), although 
Saucito remained the main contributor 
to consolidated silver revenues. Gold 
contributed 16.1% to Saucito’s revenue 
(2016: 18.5%), representing 7.2% of the 
Group’s gold revenue.
Cost per tonne increased 29.3%  
to US$47.6, mainly due to: i) lower 
volume of ore processed from 
development works; ii) increases  
in the use of consumables, services 
and maintenance; and iii) cost  
inflation (7.7%).  57

KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE YEAR
Annual gold production remained 
stable as the expected lower ore  
grade was offset by the increase in  
ore processed resulting from improved 
equipment availability. This followed  
on from efficiencies achieved in the 
maintenance programme. Silver 
production increased 5.1% year-on-
year due to the higher ore grade at  
the Taspana and San Ramón veins.
Taspana is an area located 30 kilometres 
away from the main Ciénega mine. We 
expect its contribution to continue rising 
in the future, and for Taspana to become 
another satellite mine.
In 2018, the average gold ore grade is 
expected to remain stable at 1.8 g/t and 
silver ore grade is expected to average 
160 g/t. From 2019 to 2021, the gold ore 
grade is expected to average 2.0 g/t and 
silver ore grade to be around 160-170 g/t.
Construction of the third tailings dam 
commenced in 2017 and is expected to 
be concluded in 2019.

Our exploration programme confirmed 
a continuation of the ore body at the 
Rosario-Las Casas veins, which would 
justify an expansion of the beneficiation 
plant to 5,000 tpd at the Ciénega mine. 
We expect to commence basic 
engineering for this expansion in 2018. 
Gold and silver resources increased  
as a result of exploration efforts in the 
Rosario-Las Casas and Taspana veins. 
Inferred resources increased, while 
measured and indicated resources 
decreased due to depletion and a 
higher cut-off grade. Gold and silver 
reserves decreased as a result of the 
increased cut-off grade resulting from 
the higher all-in sustaining costs.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
Capex in 2017 totalled US$46.5 million 
and was allocated to mine development, 
sustaining capex, construction of the 
third tailings dam and land acquisition. 
Budgeted capex for 2018 will mainly be 
allocated to mining works, sustaining 
capex and construction of the third 
tailings dam. 
Adjusted revenue increased to 
US$198.3 million in 2017 due mainly  
to increased volumes of silver and zinc 
sold and higher gold, lead and zinc 
prices. Ciénega is the Group’s most 
polymetallic mine, a fact demonstrated 
by the increased contribution from 
silver, lead and zinc from 54.7% in  
2016 to 57.2% in 2017.
Cost per tonne at Ciénega increased 
19.9% to US$66.5 due to: i) the increase 
in development works recognised in  
the income statement; ii) increases in  
the use of consumables, services and 
maintenance; and iii) cost inflation (6.3%). 
Cash cost per gold ounce was 
-US$163.7, an increase compared to 
-US$217.2 in 2016 as a result of the 
higher cost per tonne and lower gold 
ore grade, partly offset by higher 
by-product credits. Margin per ounce 
decreased to US$1,431.1 in 2017  
(2016: US$1,463.66). Expressed as  
a percentage of gold prices, the  
margin declined slightly to 112.9%

KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE YEAR
Annual gold production decreased 9.0% 
as a result of: the expected reduction  
in inventories at Herradura in 2016  
not being repeated to the same extent 
during 2017; and the lower ore grade of 
mineral deposited at Herradura. These 
factors were partly offset by the higher 
volume of ore processed. 
Following further optimisation of the 
inventory levels at the leaching pads, 
no additional decreases are expected  
in 2018.
Gold ore grades in 2018 are expected  
to average 0.75 g/t. This is expected  
to increase to 0.80 g/t in subsequent 
years, with minor fluctuations 
anticipated depending on the 
mine plan.
The construction of the second line at 
the DLP continued, with commissioning 
expected in the second quarter of 2018. 
This US$110 million project will 
increase efficiency as we process 
sulphides found deeper in the pit.

 MINES IN OPERATION: HERRADURA
We continued to evaluate a possible 
expansion of the Centauro pit during 
the year . We have now decided to carry 
out an additional 130,000 metres of 
drilling in 2018 to further optimise  
the pit shell and improve the financial 
metrics of this project.
Gold reserves increased as a result  
of the ongoing effort to upgrade the 
increased resources reported in 2016 
into reserves. However, gold resources 
decreased as result of an estimated 
higher life of mine all-in sustaining 
cost and stricter geotechnical 
parameters required for the expanded 
open pit. 
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
Capital expenditures in 2017 totalled 
US$153.2 million, which included mine 
preparation, sustaining capex and the 
construction of the second line at the 
DLP . Capex for 2018 will mainly be 
focused on mining works, sustaining 
capex, the construction of additional 
leaching pads, the second line at the 
DLP and land acquisition. Minor 
investments will include the 
implementation of the Fatigue 
Monitoring system and SmartOps 
system (see pages 50-51). 
Adjusted revenue decreased 7.5% to 
US$606.8 million, reflecting the lower 
volumes of gold sold.
Cost per tonne of ore deposited 
increased 3.9% to US$8.0. This was 
lower than the estimated cost inflation 
at this mine of 6.7%, mainly due to  
the lower stripping costs charged to 
production costs.
Cash cost per gold ounce increased 
4.7% to US$492.9, as a result of the 
higher cost per tonne and lower gold 
ore grade. Margin per ounce and 
margin expressed as a percentage of 
gold prices remained broadly stable  
at US$774.6 and 61.1%, respectively 
(see page 110). 61

KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE YEAR
Annual gold production decreased  
5.5% due to the lower overall speed of 
recovery resulting from the ore’s kinetic 
characteristics. This was partly offset  
by: the higher volume of ore processed 
resulting from the optimisation of the 
haulage routes, which led to shorter 
distances; and a higher ore grade.
We remained focused on improving 
efficiency and reducing costs, which 
included the ongoing relocation of waste 
dumps to reduce haulage distance and 
increasing the useful lifetime of vehicle 
components and tyres.

 MINES IN OPERATION: NOCHE BUENA
In 2018, the average ore grade is 
expected to be around 0.48 g/t. Ore 
grades through the life of the mine  
are expected to be in the range of  
0.45 g/t-0.51 g/t.
Two new areas with mineralisation 
were identified in 2017. Despite the 
limited upside potential, the Navidad 
pit contributed to this year’s gold 
production, while ore from the Año 
Nuevo pit helped to replace reserves  
at this mine. 
Gold reserves and resources continued 
to decrease as a result of the natural 
depletion of the pits.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
Capital expenditures in 2017 totalled 
US$18.7 million, focused on mining 
works and sustaining capex, including 
the construction of leaching pads  
to guarantee operational continuity. 
Spend in 2018 will again primarily be  
in sustaining capex, including leaching 
pad number 7 and the implementation 
of the ProxAlarm system (see pages 
50-51). 
Adjusted revenue at Noche Buena 
decreased 4.6% to US$215.5 million, 
reflecting the lower volumes of 
gold sold.
Cost per tonne at this mine remained 
stable at US$7.5. This was lower than the 
estimated cost inflation at this mine of 
5.1%, mainly due to the lower stripping 
costs charged to production costs.
Cash cost per gold ounce increased 
3.6% to US$793.5. Margin per ounce 
decreased to US$474.0, while margin 
expressed as a percentage of the gold

KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE YEAR
Silver and gold production at San Julián 
Veins (phase I) was 5.9 million ounces 
and 82.8 thousand ounces, respectively, 
reflecting the first complete year of 
operating at full capacity and the 
achievement of reaching a milling 
capacity of over 3,800 tonnes per day. 
In 2018, the silver ore grade is expected 
to average around 150 g/t and gold ore 
grade to average 1.7 g/t. Both grades 
are expected to remain broadly stable 
in the following three years.
We completed the construction of  
San Julián phase II-flotation plant  
on budget in mid-July. The milling 
facility achieved processing nameplate 
capacity of 6,000 tonnes per day in  
the third quarter of the year and has 
produced five million ounces of silver 
since its commission. In 2018, the San 
Julián JM (phase II) silver ore grade is 
expected to be around 185 g/t with the 
gold ore grade averaging around 0.10 
g/t. The silver ore grade is expected to 
increase in the next three years and to 
fluctuate within a range of 160-210 g/t.
Capex spend in 2017 was US$79.1 
million, mainly related to the completion 
of the construction of the flotation plant 
at San Julián JM (phase II). Budgeted 
capex for 2018 will mainly be allocated 
to mining works, sustaining capex, 
construction of the third tailings dam, 
and implementation of the Track Plus, 
ProxAlarm and Mine Optimiser systems 
(see pages 50-51).
Adjusted revenue and adjusted 
production costs increased, reflecting 
the first complete year of operations  
at San Julián phase I and the start of 
commercial production at San Julián 
phase II. 
Cost per tonne and cash cost are not 
considered to be representative as they 
correspond to the start-up period and, 
in addition, a significant volume of  
the stock pile was processed during 
this period.

ABOUT THE PROJECT
The construction of the Pyrites plant 
project progressed as expected during 
the year . In the second quarter of 2018, 
we anticipate commissioning the 
leaching plant which will process 
tailings from the Saucito mine. We also 
commenced construction of a 14,000 
tpd tailings flotation plant to process 
the historical and ongoing tailings from 
the Fresnillo mine in 2017, and this is 
expected to be concluded by 2019. 
This Pyrites plant is expected to 
improve overall recoveries of gold and 
silver to maximise production in the 
Fresnillo district. The plant will froth 
float pyrite concentrates that will be 
leached in a 2,000 tpd dynamic leaching 
plant, with a Merrill Crowe plant 
producing precipitates. Production is 
expected to total an average of 3.5 moz 
silver and 13 koz gold per year once 
operating at full capacity.
KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE YEAR
Continued progress including 
construction of the vertical mills, 
assembly of agitation tanks and the 
installation of equipment at the Merrill 
Crowe plant.

the first time this type of process will have been performed.
5. The surrounding communities do not provide their support or 
hinder operations (social license for operation) due to community 
complaints regarding operations e.g. dust, blasting vibrations, 
noise, pollution and water use.
6. The challenge faced in fine grinding to such small sizes  
(10 to 20 microns) to ensure metallurgical recovery.
7. Failures/delays in obtaining the required environmental  
permits (e.g. MIA, CUS, ET J).
8. Limited capacity of electricity supply; with this new project  
the Fresnillo district will reach its limit.

 EXPLORATION
EXPLORATION IS THE LIFEBLOOD OF FRESNILLO – IT IS A KEY COMPETITIVE 
ADVANTAGE AND BOTH THE FOUNDATION OF OUR PAST ACHIEVEMENTS  
AND THE PLATFORM FOR OUR FUTURE.
Delivered by a team of talented, 
dedicated geologists, our strategic 
commitment to continuous exploration 
across all precious metals price cycles 
is in marked contrast to the approaches 
adopted by many of our peers. While 
they have tended to cut back their 
efforts in the face of challenging 
market conditions, we have maintained 
our focus and continued to invest in 
order to build a robust pipeline of 
reserves and resources.
A TALENTED TEAM...
Around 100 geologists form the 
backbone of our exploration activities. 
Many members of this team have 
extensive experience, including 
detailed knowledge of our existing 
assets and associated mineralisation 
clues, backed by a track record of 
finding new projects and turning  
them into operating mines. They  
are supported by younger geologists  
in training as well as by some  
300 assistants drawn from local 
communities.
...BACKED BY TECHNOLOGY AND  
GUIDED BY STRICT CRITERIA
We ensure that our team is provided 
with the tools to do their job at all times 
by investing in training and technology 
across price cycles. The latest geospatial, 
geological, geochemical and geophysical 
technologies, including satellite imagery 
and hyperspectral techniques, among 
others, constitute the foundations  
that increase the probability that our 
geologists will make the next discovery.
Our approach is to evaluate 
opportunities within existing mines  
and at new locations against a set of 
strict criteria – including a minimum 
potential of 100 moz of silver or 2 moz 
of gold equivalent – to ensure they meet 
our operational and revenue objectives. 
We also evaluate further factors before 
commencing activities, such as ore 
grades, metallurgical recoveries, 
extraction costs, environmental impact 
and community costs. Only those 
projects that score well against these 
requirements receive a green light.
2017 PERFORMANCE
During 2017, our exploration activities 
were focused on our existing mines, 
notably Herradura, Fresnillo, Saucito, 
Ciénega and San Julián. These mines 
are under-explored and offer a great 
deal of potential. For example, at both 
the Ciénega and the Fresnillo mines, 
the main systems were extended to  
the East and West, respectively. 
In terms of projects, we prioritised 
those that are more advanced – and 
one of the highlights of the year was 
the conversion of resources from 
inferred to indicated at Guanajuato. 
This is an important step towards 
opening a mine in the district, and 
although we will continue to carry  
out studies in 2018, we can envisage 
Guanajuato becoming an important 
part of the Fresnillo operational 
portfolio in future years.
At Juanicipio, we deployed a directional 
drill to improve accuracy and, while 
delays in setting up the equipment 
resulted in a shortfall in our planned 
drilling programme for the year, this 
will have no adverse impact on project 
delivery dates.
The main challenge for our exploration 
team during the year was again access 
to land – and we continue to work 
closely with communities across our 
portfolio. For example, in Chile we have 
now evaluated over 100 properties and 
are currently negotiating access to our 
preferred locations.
RESERVES AND RESOURCES
To estimate resources and calculate 
reserves, we use the 2012 edition of  
the JORC code. We used a gold price  
of US$1,250/oz across our operations, 
which for our open pit resources 
represents a decrease of US$150.  
The change brings us into line with  
our peers and more accurately reflects 
our conservative standpoint. The price 
used for silver resources and reserves 
was reduced to US$17.0/oz, with  
an immaterial effect in resources 
(-146 ounces).
Silver reserves fell by 5.4% as we did 
not replace reserves at Fresnillo while 
those of gold rose by 22.7% due to good 
results at Herradura.
Our silver resources grew by 6.9% in 
2017, largely due to intensive exploration 
at Saucito, and gold resources remained 
stable. Total resources for the Group 
currently stand at 2,320.5 moz of silver 
and 38.5 moz of gold.
Highlights of 2017
• 5.4% decrease in silver 
reserves.
• 22.7% increase in gold reserves.
• 6.9% increase in silver 
resources.
• 0.3% increase in gold resources.
Priorities for 2018
• Continue exploration activities 
at all existing mines.
• Continue negotiations for 
access to land at advanced 
projects. 
• Roll out communication 
programmes to explain the 
benefits of mining, across  
all of our operations.
• Continue deep drilling  
at Juanicipio.
• Conclude the feasibility study  
at Juanicipio and carry out  
a feasibility study at Centauro 
Deep.
• Undertake a preliminary 
economic assessment at 
Orisyvo and Guanajuato. 68

The consolidation of mining districts is 
one of our key strategies, and allows us 
to leverage local knowledge and shared 
infrastructure. The following section 
examines the exploration potential of 
each of our four principal districts,  
as well as key development projects  
in our pipeline.
FRESNILLO DISTRICT
As a preeminent silver mining district 
located in the heart of Mexico, this 
region is largely responsible for making 
Fresnillo plc the largest producer  
of silver in the world. The district’s 
strengths include a long history of 
mining activities, a skilled workforce 
and good infrastructure. Our team  
of geologists have harnessed these 
advantages, while leveraging their own 
local and regional knowledge, in order 
to maximise the district’s long-term 
potential. During 2017, 87,208 metres 
of drilling was carried out in the area. 
Juanicipio, a joint venture project with 
MAG Silver where Fresnillo owns 56%, 
is a standalone project, located just 
eight kilometres from the Fresnillo 
mine. Exploration in 2017 was focused 
on the depth extension of the Valdecañas 
vein, and we are currently in the process 
of concluding a feasibility study. 
SAN JULIÁN DISTRICT
Located on the Chihuahua and  
Durango border, San Julián began life 
as a greenfield project ten years ago. 
The mine’s second phase was fully 
commissioned in July 2017 following  
a US$515m capital investment 
programme. 
Our exploration team continues to 
explore and identify new targets in the 
area through our district consolidation 
strategy. The team’s findings – supported 
by the significant investment already  
in place – endorse our view that San 
Julián has the potential to become 
established as an entirely new mining 
district, underpinning our long-
term goals.
During 2017, our intensive drilling 
programme continued, totalling 73,995 
metres. By deploying an integrated 
approach that combines geophysics, 
geochemistry, geology and drilling,  
we were able to increase gold resources 
by 63 koz and silver resources by 5 moz 
in the southern part of the district, 
where numerous exploration targets 
remain untested. The 2018 programme 
includes intensified drilling in this 
sector and definition of drill targets  
in the northern part of the district, 
where surface exploration work is 
commencing.
HERRADURA DISTRICT
Located in the north west of Mexico, 
the Herradura district is home to the 
Herradura, Noche Buena and Soledad-
Dipolos mines as well as Centauro 
Deep, a strategically important project 
located below the existing Centauro pit. 
The district accounted for 70% of our 
total gold production in 2017.
Exploration continues to focus on 
brownfield targets, particularly on  
the Centauro Deep extension.
CIÉNEGA DISTRICT
Situated in the Sierra Madre mountain 
range, this district contains our most 
polymetallic mine, Ciénega, in addition 
to the San Ramón satellite mine and 
the Taspana development works. We 
have carried out several comprehensive 
brownfield exploration programmes in 
the district, and these have identified  
a number of targets. The projects that 
have shown the greatest potential are 
now undergoing further analysis.
Last year, the exploration campaign was 
intensified at the Taspana and Tajos 
veins, where mining and preparation 
works are advancing at a good pace.  
In 2018, our plans include to drill-test 
extensions of the veins along strike  
and at depth, and to evaluate other 
opportunities in the district. 
DURING 2017, OUR 
EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES 
WERE FOCUSED ON 
HERRADURA, FRESNILLO, 
SAUCITO, CIÉNEGA  
AND SAN JULIÁN.

MEETING OUR COMMITMENTS
Dear Shareholder,
A key aspect of our Directors’ duty to 
promote the success of the Company  
is to consider the wider interests of  
all stakeholders. As Chairman of the 
HSECR Committee, I am pleased to 
present the activities of the HSECR 
Committee during the year . 
In the light of regulatory developments 
and evolving shareholder expectations, 
we evaluated management strategy in 
order to engage our stakeholders on 
issues that are significant to society  
and relevant to the business. The 
Committee is mindful of its responsibility 
to ensure that management has effective 
policies, due diligence processes  
and management systems in place to 
proactively address material issues.  
As part of our governance agenda,  
we continued to monitor initiatives  
to embed ethics and integrity into  
the organisational culture.
In addition to our primary task of 
overseeing health, safety, environment 
and community relations matters,  
this year has seen an increase in the 
responsibilities of the Committee 
following the implementation of the 
Modern Slavery Act. On behalf of  
the Board, the Committee evaluated  
the effectiveness of management in 
preventing modern slavery. Following 
this evaluation, Fresnillo plc released 
its first Modern Slavery Statement, 
which sets out the steps taken to 
prevent any involvement in slavery  
and human trafficking. 
We instructed management to  
enhance the Company’s reporting 
practices, following the implementation 
of the EU Directive on non-financial  
and diversity information and the UK 
Financial Reporting Council’s guidance 
on non-financial reporting. Consequently, 
this year’s strategic report emphasises 
the inputs that Fresnillo uses to create 
long-term value and the associated 
linkages to the six Capitals: Human, 
Natural, Social & Relationship,

monitored a pilot project launched  
at Saucito in conjunction with Real 
Safety, which uses positive incentives  
to recognise and reward extraordinary 
safety behaviour . Please see the case 
study on page 81 for details. We again 
carried out safety drills in 2017 to further 
improve our emergency response 
capabilities and I am pleased to report 
that our business units continue to be 
certified to OHSAS 18001.
We work hard to ensure that we provide 
our people with a healthy workplace, and 
continued to monitor their exposure to

METHODOLOGY FOR MATERIALITY 
ASSESSMENT
1. Identification of stakeholders: 
Stakeholders are identified by  
two criteria:
 – Impact: Who is directly or 
indirectly affected or benefited  
by our operations or projects?
 – Influence: Who is currently 
involved or likely to get involved  
in issues related to our operations 
or projects?
The list of stakeholders is identified 
and validated by the people in Fresnillo 
who have the most frequent interactions 
with a given stakeholder .
2. Identification of the sustainability 
issues: Our Issue identification 
follows AccountAbility’s five-part 
materiality test. 
 The sources of sustainability issues 
are: Issues with a direct financial 
impact, industry best practices 
(ICMM, DJSI, FTSE4Good, STOXX ESG, 
SASB, etc.), stakeholder concerns 
(engagement activities: perception 
surveys, meetings, etc.), issues 
reflected in our policies and 
government regulations.
The graphic below shows how we indicate the relevance and risk of our material issues across the mining lifecycle.

3. Evaluation of sustainability issues: 
 – Stakeholders: The significance  
of an issue is evaluated by 
stakeholders.
 – Management: The materiality  
of an issue to the business and 
their risk and relevance in the 
lifecycle of mining is evaluated  
by management.
NEXT STEPS
Launch a programme to engage  
our organisation in defining KPIs in

HUMAN CAPITAL
We seek to attract, develop and retain 
the best people, and engage them  
over the long term. We are committed 
to eliminating unsafe workplace 
conditions and behaviours, and  
to keeping our people healthy. We 
continue to work hard to develop an 
organisational culture based on trust, 
and to embed ethics and integrity into 
that culture in order to create a fair  
and respectful workplace. We respect 
labour rights and engage union 
representatives constructively. 
TALENT MANAGEMENT
Our Centre for Technical Studies 
(CETEF) trains mining technicians  
to meet our specific needs. CETEF 
candidates are chosen from the 
communities surrounding our 
operations, thus securing talent  
and strengthening our social licence  
to operate. We regularly assess the 
potential of our people to take on 
supervisory roles in order to create 
career and succession plans.
We collaborate with leading 
educational institutions in Mexico  
to attract young talent in geology, 
metallurgy and mining engineering, 
offering students internships of  
varying lengths. We recruit graduates 
from our pool of interns through the 
‘Engineers in Training’ programme. 
These graduates are assigned a  
coach from our operations team who 
supervises their development and 
provides performance appraisals –  
and those with good appraisals  
receive permanent job offers.
We develop our high potential middle 
managers via the Leaders with Vision 
programme. This involves senior 
executives delivering seminars 
throughout the year as a mechanism  
to engage and mobilise our people.  
The executives participate in a training 
programme organised by the Mexico 
Autonomous Institute of Technology 
(ITAM), a leading business school.
PERFORMANCE
The growth of the workforce and the 
use of more international training 
providers led to an increase in total 
training investment. We improved  
the quality of training while keeping  
the training hours per person at 
similar levels.

SAFETY
OUR GOAL
To instil a safety culture where our workers and contractors have the 
knowledge, competence and desire to work safely. 
HOW WE WILL WIN
Enabler – Eliminate unsafe workplace 
conditions and behaviours.
Key activities:
• Proactively assess and prioritise 
risks in order to determine operating 
procedures, equipment, training and 
controls. 
• Perform situational assessments and 
legal compliance audits to identify 
operational non-conformities and to 
develop specific action plans with 
clear deadlines and accountabilities.
• Use a five-phase process to ensure 
operational discipline: Making sure 
safety procedures are available; 
assuring their quality; training  
and communication; evaluation  
of compliance; and continuous 
improvement.
• Promote the STOP (Stop, Think, 
Observe and Plan) programme, 
which teaches that all accidents  
can be prevented, promotes risk 
monitoring for all processes and 
emphasises the responsibility of  
the chain of command to detect  
and immediately remediate  
unsafe conditions.
• Conduct root cause analysis of 
accidents resulting in a critical 
injury or loss of life, in order to 
understand the underlying factors 
and determine any remedial 
actions required.
Enabler – Instil a safety culture where 
our workers and contractors have the 
knowledge, competence and desire to 
work safely.
Key activities:
• Engage our managers, union 
representatives and contractors, 
encouraging them to take a 
leadership role in our safety culture.
• Hold behavioural change workshops, 
facilitated by psychologists who 
provide guidance and counsel on 
personal issues that may lead to 
distractions and accidents.

EXPLORATION DEVELOPMENT OPERATION CLOSURE
• Continue to deliver Rules that Save 
Lives, part of our effort to embed 
critical rules into our safety culture, 
with regular reviews, updates and 
reminders in training sessions and 
group meetings.
• Support our contractors in enrolling 
in the Mexican Labour Ministry’s 
voluntary Self-Managed Safety 
Programme, where the main 
objective is to encourage a self-
evaluation culture and continuous 
improvement.
PERFORMANCE
We regret to report one fatal injury in 
2017, additionally the Total and Lost 
Time Injury Frequency Rates increased 
during the year due to the increase  
in the workforce, new contractors and 
high turnover rates of contractors’ 
employees. We are committed to 
implementing the measures required  
to reverse the negative trend in our 
safety record. For example, in 2017 we 
piloted our ‘I care, we care’ programme 
at Saucito, which uses positive incentives 
to foster good habits in risk identification 
and management. We also performed 
safety drills to further develop our 
emergency response capabilities and 
our business units continue to be 
certified to OHSAS 18001.

EMBEDDING SAFETY IN OUR CULTURE
The safety of our people is always the top 
priority for our executive team. However, 
while management can establish and 
promote safety-led processes, the everyday 
behaviour of workers themselves remains 
a key factor in reducing incidents.
During the year we launched a new 
initiative at our Saucito mine, aimed at 
reinforcing the importance of safety in  
our corporate culture. The ‘I care, we care’ 
programme recognises and rewards 
extraordinary safety behaviour to emphasise 
the role that individual actions and attitudes 
play in building a safe working environment. 
Employees and contractors have been 
trained to recognise desired safety 
behaviours, with the programme using  
a card-based system to reward teams  
and individuals who exhibit best practices. 
Poor examples of safety behaviours are 
also highlighted by the programme and 
used by supervisors to demonstrate areas 
for improvement. 82

in the summer of 2017, we were proud to establish our 
first breastfeeding room, which will help support our 
ambition to gain Family Responsible Certification.
Nursing mothers working at Saucito now have the  
option of feeding their children in the breastfeeding 
room or going home to do so for one hour during 
working hours. In cooperation with the breastfeeding 
team from Fresnillo General Hospital, we also held a 
workshop to raise awareness and encourage nursing

FAIR REMUNERATION
Fair remuneration, recognition and 
development opportunities combine  
to motivate our people to strive for 
excellence. We offer non-unionised 
employees life insurance, health care, 
disability coverage, maternity and 
paternity leave, retirement provision, and 
a savings fund as well as profit sharing 
(known as PTU in Mexico). Our collective 
agreements with unionised-employees 
consider a wide range of issues around 
compensation and working conditions. 
These include wages, recruitment and 
dismissals, shifts and working hours, 
national holidays, vacations, work 
permits, disciplinary measures, personal 
equipment, training, health and safety, 
occupational diseases, life insurance, 
career opportunities (rank, seniority, 
etc.), savings fund and early retirement 
compensation.
OUR GOAL
To attract, retain and incentivise our 
workforce with a value proposition  
that balances remuneration with 
opportunities for career development.
HOW WE WILL WIN
Enabler – Remunerate fairly  
with salaries and benefits that  
are externally competitive and 
internally equitable.
Key activities:
• Monitor the competitiveness of  
our remuneration and benefits by 
benchmarking against our peers  
in the Mexican Mining Chamber 
(CAMIMEX).
• Maintain constructive collective 
bargaining with union 
representatives.
• Engage our non-unionised people  
to encourage career development 
over short-term rewards.
• Implement rules for compensation 
based on salary ranges that are 
gender independent.
CHILD LABOUR
Child labour deprives young people of 
their childhood, dignity and education. 
Our minimum age for employment is 
18, and we require contractors at all 
our sites to adhere to this rule. We 
contribute to the eradication of child 
labour in our communities by supporting 
school infrastructure, as well as reading 
and other programmes that improve 
educational opportunities for children.
MODERN SLAVERY
Modern slavery is a grave violation  
of human rights. It comprises all forms 
of contemporary slavery such as forced 
labour, servitude, human trafficking 
and the worst forms of child labour .  
We have a zero-tolerance approach  
to modern slavery and expect our 
employees, suppliers and contractors 
to reject any and all of its forms. For 
more details, please see our Modern 
Slavery Statement on our website.
DISCRIMINATION
We are committed to ensuring that  
our people are treated fairly and with 
dignity in the workplace and do not 
tolerate any form of harassment, 
intimidation or discrimination.  
We promote equal opportunity, 
ensuring that employment and career 
development decisions are based on 
performance, qualifications, skills, 
experience and ethical behaviour .
DIVERSITY & INCLUSION
Fresnillo plc values and respects all 
people from diverse backgrounds. We 
aspire to develop an inclusive culture 
where our people feel valued and are 
inspired to contribute to their fullest 
potential. Women are under-represented 
in our workforce and in the Mexican 
mining industry in general. During  
the year, we developed a new policy to 
encapsulate and express how we will 
drive a positive improvement in diversity 
and inclusion. With the support of the 
University of Arizona, we also trained 
managers and executives on how to 
manage a diverse workforce, raising 
awareness of unconscious bias. In 
addition to fostering women in mining, 
our diversity programme will also  
focus on attracting, retaining and 
engaging millennials.
PERFORMANCE
During 2017, we successfully negotiated a remuneration adjustment with the four 
union committees. Collective bargaining covers the elements outlined in ‘Working 
conditions’ above.
Recognising that women are under-represented in our workforce (see Diversity 
below), we implement rules for the compensation of non-unionised employees 
based on gender-independent salary ranges. Currently, any differences in the 
compensation of men and women are primarily due to different seniorities.

While the mining and processing

industries, we recognise that our 
business has the potential to consume 
water, disturb land and produce waste 
and greenhouse gases. Optimising our

impact of our activities and being 
transparent and accountable regarding 
our environmental footprint are crucial 
elements of sustainable mining and 
help us to retain our social licence

Before developing any mining project, 
we conduct EIAs, which identify potential 
impacts and actions to manage them. 
EIAs address many issues, such as 
surface and groundwater resources, 
water quality, air quality, soils, 
biodiversity (including threatened  
or endangered species), landscape  
and socio-economic conditions. We 
present our EIA report, known as an 
Environmental Impact Statement  
(EIS), to the environmental authorities 
for evaluation.

MINERAL WASTE MANAGEMENT
Our operations produce mineral waste 
and, in much smaller quantities, 
non-mineral hazardous waste. The 
global trend towards lower ore grades 
will increase mineral waste over time, 
especially in open pit mining. Mineral 
waste includes waste rock, spent heaps 
and tailings, with the management of 
the latter being a key concern for the 
industry. While very rare, recent tailings 
incidents in the industry have served  
as a reminder of the critical nature of 
these structures.
OUR GOAL
To protect local communities and the 
environment by managing mineral 
waste responsibly.
HOW TO WIN
Enabler – Manage our waste 
responsibly to protect the health and 
safety of communities, the quality of 
the environment and our reputation.
Key activities:
• Obtain permits to build and operate 
tailing storage facilities.
• Design and build our tailings  
dams following the hydrological, 
geotechnical and structural design 
requirements of the Mexican 
authorities, in order to resist 
extreme weather and 
seismic events.
• Use diversion channels to prevent 
run-off water from entering the dam 
reservoir and seepage collection 
systems, in order to protect the 
environment downstream.
• Strictly control the water balance  
to prevent overtopping failures and 
ban the use of tailings dams as 
water reservoirs.
• Conduct daily inspections, periodic 
internal audits and third party 
stability reviews of the embankments 
of our operational and closed tailings 
dams.
• Regularly monitor the structural 
and chemical stability of our mineral 
waste storage facilities.

WATER STEWARDSHIP
OUR GOAL
To increase access to safe water by minimising 
our water footprint and cooperating with our 
stakeholders, notably communities, authorities 
and NGOs.
Although we operate in a number of arid 
regions, the mining and processing of 
ore requires large volumes of water – 
and this is often a relevant issue for local 
communities. We recognise that water  
is a human right and cooperate with 
communities to increase water access.
Securing access and being responsible 
water stewards are critical success 
factors, and the prevention of 
environmental impacts on water 
resources and related ecosystems  
is fundamental to our social and 
environmental licences to operate. 
Before we commence any project,  
we carry out EIAs to gain knowledge  
of water resources and their 
vulnerability on a local and regional 
scale. Responding to the expectations 
of our stakeholders, we conduct our 
evaluation of water risk using the 
Aqueduct tool from the World 
Resources Institute (WRI). 
HOW WE WILL WIN
Enabler – Operational excellence to 
reduce our water footprint.
Key activities:
• Implement closed water circuits, 
eliminating the need to discharge 
processed water into water streams.
• Reuse wastewater from 
municipalities and our own 
operations and camps.
Enabler – Environmental compliance 
and cooperation with local 
stakeholders.
Key activities:
• Secure water rights from authorities 
before using any water in mining 
and mineral processing.
• Send unused water from dewatering 
to settlement ponds to control 
suspended solids, before discharging 
the cleaned water downstream.
• Respect our water quotas, 
monitoring our discharges and 
taking action to ensure that they 
adhere to water quality regulations.
• Cooperate with water authorities 
and other stakeholders, including 
communities, to increase water 
access. See the community relations 
section (pages 96-103).

Mining is energy intensive. We use 
energy at every stage of the value  
chain and this accounts for a significant 
portion of our overall costs. We use 
fossil fuels in the extraction and haulage 
of ore and waste rock removal, while 
electricity is used in our processing 
plants. As mining operations go deeper 
in response to decreasing ore grades, 
we expect our energy demand to 
increase.

HOW WE WILL WIN
Enabler – Engaging communities 
effectively in the lifecycle of mining.
Key activities:
• Exploration: Our exploration teams 
are the first to establish contact with 
a local community. We identify the 
relevant stakeholders and focus our 
engagement efforts on obtaining 
temporary land access to explore 
and assess social risks.
• Development: Our stakeholder 
relationships deepen in this phase of 
the cycle, as we build trust through 
activities including local hiring, 
contracts and social investment.  
For our advanced feasibility and 
development projects, we conduct 
social risk assessments to help us 
identify the issues that matter most 
to the community.
• Operation: We regularly engage  
with the community via formal  
and informal meetings in order to 
manage expectations and detect 
risks and opportunities. We also 
carry out comprehensive perception 
studies which help us monitor how 
benefits are perceived and assess 
our impact on the key issues facing 
the community.
Enabler – Working with communities 
to develop a purposeful social 
investment portfolio aligned with the 
UN Sustainable Development Goals.
Key activities:
• Education: In line with SDG 4, we 
seek to support inclusive and quality 
education as a key lever to reduce 
poverty and inequality. We collaborate 
with NGOs and communities to deliver 
programmes which encourage 
children to read, communicate,  
and learn science and robotics. 
• Health: In line with SDG 3, we seek 
to ensure healthy lives and promote 
wellbeing. We work closely with 
NGOs, authorities and communities 
to provide healthcare and promote 
healthy lifestyles.
• Water: In line with SDG 6, we are 
committed to ensuring the availability 
and sustainable management of 
water and sanitation for all. We 
collaborate with communities  
to develop water and sanitation 
infrastructure funded by the Mining 
Fund, to ensure that our direct 
social investment is well-targeted 
and to raise awareness of 
environmental care.
• Capacity building: In line with SDG 
8, we promote sustained, inclusive 
and sustainable economic growth, 
full and productive employment  
and decent work for all. We support 
suppliers from local communities 
and collaborate with regional mining 
clusters to develop skills in the 
areas where we operate.

PERFORMANCE
2017 HIGHLIGHTS
Education
• We continued to partner the NGO 
International Board on Books for 
Young People (IBBY), bringing books 
and children together through our 
Picando Letras programme. This 
programme currently benefits  
8,186 children in 66 schools – from 
kindergartens to high schools –  
in local communities close to  
our Ciénega, Penmont, Saucito, 
Fresnillo, San Julián, Rodeo and 
Gigante (Guanajuato) mines and 
projects.
• Together with the NGO INNOVEC 
and the Zacatecas State government, 
we supported a programme to teach 
science in an experiential and 
engaging manner . A total of 3,776 
children in the Fresnillo area are 
currently benefiting from this 
programme.
• We partnered with local schools in 
Fresnillo, Caborca (Penmont) and 
Turuachi (San Julián) and entered 
three teams in the FIRST (For 
Inspiration and Recognition of 
Science and Technology) Robotics 
competition. With the support  
of mentors from the Company, 
children aged from 15 to 18 learnt 
how to develop their expertise in 
robotics, as well as the importance 
of teamwork and volunteering. 
Capacity building
• We continued to promote the 
development of regional value chains 
by participating in the established 
mining clusters of Zacatecas  
and Sonora, and also joined the 
Chihuahua mining cluster during 
2017. The Zacatecas cluster brings 
together 16 mining operations, 73 
local suppliers, five universities,  
five local government agencies and 
three company research centres. 
The Sonora cluster comprises 102 
suppliers, 19 mining operations, 
eight universities and six chambers 
and associations.
• To diversify local economies, we 
provided training for entrepreneurs  
in the communities of Fresnillo and 
Uruachi (one of our exploration areas).
Health
• In partnership with the National 
University Foundation we organised 
Health Weeks in Fresnillo, Ciénega, 
Penmont, San Julián and at our 
Rodeo project, benefiting a total  
of 11,400 people during the year .
Water & infrastructure
• We piloted a project in partnership 
with Captar AC to implement 
rainwater collection in the 
community of Las Papas in 
San Julián.
• We continued to engage with the 
municipalities, campaigning for 
higher levels of investment by the 
Mining Fund in the communities 
neighbouring our operations.

CASE STUDY
BRINGING BOOKS AND 
CHILDREN TOGETHER
Our activities bring employment and financial benefits to 
local workers – and we also work hard to support their 
families through a wide range of community initiatives.
During 2017, we again continued to work with the NGO 
International Board on Books for Young People (IBBY) to 
bring books and children together through its respected 
Picando Letras programme. The aim of the programme 
is to create a space where teachers, parents, youngsters 
and children interact, raise awareness and reflect as a 
result of reading; in an enjoyable, free and meaningful 
manner . This strengthens community bonds, educates 
people so they can self-reflect, express their feelings 
and thoughts and really listen to others in a tolerant  
and respectful environment.
The team from IBBY guided us on the choice of books 
and initial teacher training as well as on how to monitor 
progress and coach the teachers. With their valuable 
support, we expanded the project in 2017 and opened 
more ‘bunkos’ (small community libraries where 
volunteers read aloud to children and facilitate 
discussions). Over the course of the year, we helped  
a total of 8,186 children from 66 schools – from 
kindergartens to high schools – in the communities  
of Ciénega, Penmont, Saucito, Fresnillo, San Julián, 
Rodeo and Gigante (Guanajuato).
CASE STUDY
ENSURING HEALTHY 
LIVES AND PROMOTING 
WELLBEING
Nothing is more important to us than our people,  
which is why we use our expertise and resources to  
help ensure they lead healthy lives. This is particularly 
important in some of our local communities, where 
access to healthcare is a stakeholder concern either  
due to remote location or low socio-economic levels. 
In 2017 we worked closely with the UNAM Foundation, 
NGOs and local health authorities to foster a preventive 
and self-care culture. The programme benefited more 
than 11,435 people from over 100 communities from 
Penmont, Fresnillo District, Ciénega and San Julián. 
These benefits included free eye care, dental care, 
vaccination and diabetes detection and also raised 
awareness of issues such as the importance of good 
eating habits.

LAND ACQUISITIONS & RESETTLEMENTS
Developing a mining project involves 
land acquisition and in some cases,  
the resettlement of households. We 
recognise that these are complex and 
life-changing issues for communities. 
When poorly planned and managed, 
land acquisition and resettlement  
can adversely impact the livelihoods 
and social structure of communities, 
damage our relationships or even 
cause conflict. We recognise that the 
right to an adequate standard of living 
after land acquisition and resettlement 
projects is a basic human right.
OUR GOAL
To manage resettlement responsibly, 
respecting local laws and following 
international best practices.
HOW WE WILL WIN
Enabler – Manage resettlements 
responsibly.
Key activities:
• Avoid resettlements whenever 
possible, by exploring 
alternative options.

Risk:  High   Medium   Low
EXPLORATION DEVELOPMENT OPERATION CLOSURE
• If resettlements are unavoidable, 
work together with affected 
households, communities and 
governments to minimise adverse 
impacts, restoring or improving 
livelihoods and living conditions.
• Further develop our competences 
and internal processes to manage 
resettlements, including social 
baseline and asset surveys, an 
entitlement and compensation 
framework, negotiation, livelihood 
restoration programmes and 
ongoing monitoring and evaluation.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
By following strict controls on cash, costs and expenses and while adhering to our capex budgets, we have maintained a 
healthy cash and other liquid funds 
1
 position and a low leverage ratio. This has enabled us to invest in profitable growth  
and deliver solid returns to shareholders. 
The following report presents how we have managed our Financial Capital. 
COMMENTARY ON FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
This has been another year of progress for Fresnillo, as we continued our long-established reputation for creating value 
through growth and returns. Gross profit and EBITDA increased during the year by 4.9% and 2.7%, respectively. We also 
maintained a solid financial position, with US$896.0 million in cash and other liquid funds 
1
 as of 31 December 2017 despite 
paying dividends of US$236.6 million in accordance with our policy and investing capex of US$604.8 million to underpin our 
future growth.
A number of factors contributed to the increase in gross profit and EBITDA, including the increased contribution of San Julián 
to silver and zinc sales, together with higher gold and base metals prices, which increased Adjusted revenue. These factors 
were partly offset by cost pressures, higher depreciation charges and exploration expenses and, these together with the sale 
of a non-strategic exploration project and the effect of the revaluation of the Mexican peso/US dollar spot exchange rate on 
deferred taxes, resulted in an increase of 32.0% in net profit for the year .

GOVERNANCE
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
The Group’s financial performance is largely determined by the quality of our assets, the skills of our personnel and the 
execution capabilities of management to achieve our strategic goals. However, there are a number of macroeconomic 
variables that lie beyond our control and which affect financial results. These include:
PRECIOUS METAL PRICES
In 2017, the average realised gold and silver prices remained broadly stable at US$1,267.4 per ounce (2016: US$1,246.5) and 
US$17.0 per ounce (2016: US$17.2), respectively. However, the average realised lead and zinc prices increased 24.9% and 
34.9% year-on-year, to US$1.06 and US$1.36 per pound, respectively. 
We hedged a portion of our by-product lead and zinc production but, contrary to previous years, this did not have an effect  
on revenue.
MX$/US$ EXCHANGE RATE
The Mexican peso/US dollar spot exchange rate at 31 December 2017 was $19.74 per US dollar, compared to $20.66 per  
US dollar at 31 December 2016. The 4.5% spot revaluation had a favourable effect, primarily on deferred income taxes.  
This positively compared versus the 20.1% devaluation in 2016, which resulted in a significant adverse effect on deferred 
income taxes. 
The average spot Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rate devalued by 1.5%, from $18.66 per US dollar in 2016 to $18.94 per  
US dollar in 2017. This resulted in a favourable effect estimated at US$4.7 million on the Group’s production costs, as costs 
denominated in Mexican pesos (approximately 45% of total costs) were lower when converted to US dollars.
COST INFLATION
In 2017, there was a net increase in the weighted average input cost over the year, of 6.4%. This inflation included the positive 
effect of the 1.5% average devaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar . 
LABOUR
Unionised employees received on average a 5.8% increase in wages in Mexican pesos, and administrative employees at the 
mines received a 4.5% increase; when converted to US dollars, the weighted average labour inflation was 3.3%. 
ENERGY
ELECTRICITY
The Group’s weighted average cost of electricity increased by 28.9% from US$5.9 cents per kW in 2016 to US$7.6 cent per kW 
in 2017. This increase was mainly explained by the higher average generating cost of the Comisión Federal de Electricidad 
(CFE), the national utility, following the increase in the prices of natural gas and fuel and, to a lesser extent, of imported coal.
DIESEL
The weighted average cost of diesel in US dollars increased 22.2% to US$76.5 cents per litre in 2017, compared to US$62.6 
cents per litre in 2016, reflecting the price liberalisation of fuels.

Tyres (5.2)
Explosives (6.4)

Weighted average of all operating materials (1.1)
Unit prices of the majority of certain operating materials decreased in US dollar terms. However, this was mostly offset by  
the increase in the unit price of other reagents, particularly those linked to the price of copper and zinc, reflecting the higher 
metals prices. As a result, the weighted average unit prices of all operating materials decreased by 1.1% over the year .  
There has been no significant impact on the unit cost of operating materials from the devaluation of the MXN peso/US dollar 
exchange rate as the majority of these items are dollar-denominated.
CONTRACTORS 
Agreements are signed individually with each contractor company, and include specific terms and conditions that cover not only 
labour, but also operating materials, equipment and maintenance, amongst others. Contractor costs are mainly denominated 
in Mexican pesos and are an important component of our total production costs. In 2017, increases granted to contractors, 
whose agreements were due for review during the period, resulting in a weighted average increase of 4.9% in US dollars.
MAINTENANCE
Unit prices of spare parts for maintenance remained unchanged on average in US dollar terms (0.4% increase). 106

Total revenue of US$2,093.3 million increased by 9.9% over 2016. This was explained by the 9.2% increase in Adjusted revenue 
as a result of the increase in volumes of silver and zinc sold and higher realised metal prices, except for silver .

The higher volumes of silver and zinc sold, mainly due to the start-up of San Julián phase II and the first complete year of San 
Julián phase I, resulted in a positive impact on revenue of US$114.8 million, which represented 61.0% of the US$188.2 million 
increase in Adjusted revenue. The remaining 39.0%, or US$73.4 million, was explained by the benefit of higher gold, lead and 
zinc prices. 
As expected, the contribution of San Julián changed the relative proportion of Adjusted revenue, with silver revenue 
representing 38% of total Adjusted revenue in 2017 compared to 35% in 2016. Gold contribution to Adjusted revenue decreased 
from 55% in 2016 to 50% in 2017 as a result of the expected decrease in volumes of gold sold. The contribution of by-product 
lead and zinc to the Group’s Adjusted revenue increased from 9% in 2016 to 12% in 2017, due to higher lead and zinc prices 
and the increased volumes of zinc sold, primarily from the San Julián and Fresnillo mines. 
Herradura remained the main contributor to Adjusted revenue, reflecting a further decrease in gold inventories during the 
year . Saucito continued to be the second largest contributor, although its contribution declined from 26% in 2016 to 23% in 
2017, in line with a 4.5% decrease in Adjusted revenue. Fresnillo’s contribution remained stable at 19%, notwithstanding  
the 10.0% increase in total Group Adjusted revenue. San Julián (phase I and phase II) contributed 13% to the Group’s  
Adjusted revenue.
The relative contribution to silver Adjusted revenue changed over the year with San Julián (phase I and II) representing 18.6%, 
while the contributions of Saucito, Fresnillo and Ciénega decreased as expected, reflecting an expanded silver asset base. 
Similarly, contribution to gold revenue was modified with the San Julián mine representing 9.3% of total Adjusted gold revenue.

HEDGING
In 2017 we entered into a series of derivative contracts to hedge part of our lead and zinc by-product production through collar 
structures. These contracts will start to mature in 2018. As no hedging structures expired in 2017, there was no effect on 
revenue. The chart below illustrates the outstanding hedging structures as of 31 December 2017.

In the second half of 2014, Fresnillo plc initiated a one-off hedging programme to protect the value of the investment made  
in the Penmont acquisition. The hedging programme was executed for a total volume of 1,559,689 oz of gold with monthly 
maturities until December 2019.

TREATMENT AND REFINING CHARGES
Treatment and refining charges

 are reviewed annually using international benchmarks. Treatment charges per tonne of lead 
and zinc concentrate decreased in dollar terms by 18.8% and 17.8%, respectively, compared to 2016. However, this was partly 
offset by the 2.0% increase in silver refining charges and the increase in volumes of zinc concentrates with high silver contents 
shipped from Fresnillo and San Julián (phase II) to Met-Mex, as well as the increased volumes of precipitates sold from San 
Julián (phase I). As a result, treatment and refining charges set out in the income statement decreased by only 0.8% over 2016.

Cost of sales increased 14.1% to US$1,167.9 million in 2017. The US$144.5 million increase is explained by the following 
combination of factors:
• An increase in Adjusted production costs (US$150.3 million). This was primarily due to: i) additional Adjusted production 
costs associated with the increased production (US$94.7 million); ii) cost inflation (US$40.2 million); iii) increases in the  
use of consumables, services, maintenance and others (US$17.9 million); and iv) the lower volume of ore processed from 
development works at Saucito (US$12.7 million). The increase was partly offset by the decrease in development works 
charged to production costs (US$10.5 million) and the positive effect of the 1.5% devaluation of the average Mexican peso/US 
dollar spot exchange rate (US$4.7 million). 
• Depreciation (US$21.1 million). This is due to the additional asset base at San Julián, mitigated by lower depreciation at the 
other operating mines.
• Reversal of inventories write-down in 2016 and others (US$17.5 million). 
• Profit sharing increased slightly by US$1.8 million.
These negative effects were partly offset by:
• Variation in change in work in progress (-US$43.3 million). This reflected the further decrease in inventories on the leaching 
pads at Herradura, albeit not of the same magnitude as the decrease in 2016. 
• Mexican peso/US dollar hedging (-US$2.8 million). With the Mexican peso exchange rate hedging programme suspended, 
there was no effect in the income statement in 2017, compared to the US$2.8 million loss recorded in 2016. 
COST PER TONNE, CASH COST PER OUNCE AND ALL-IN SUSTAINING COST (AISC)
Cost per tonne is a key indicator to measure the effects of mining inflation and cost control performance at each mine. This 
indicator is calculated as total production costs, plus ordinary mining rights, less depreciation, profit sharing and exchange rate 
hedging effects, divided by total tonnage processed. We have included cost per tonne hauled/moved as we believe it is a useful 
indicator to thoroughly analyse cost performance for the open pit mines.

Cash cost per ounce, calculated as total cash cost (cost of sales plus treatment and refining charges, less depreciation) less 
revenue from by-products divided by the silver or gold ounces sold, when compared to the corresponding metal price, is an

The particular variations in cash cost for each mine are explained as follows:
FRESNILLO: US$0.71/OZ (2017) VERSUS US$2.09/OZ (2016), (-66.2%)
The decrease in cash cost per ounce is mainly explained by: the higher by-product credits per silver ounce, due to the increase 
in zinc volumes sold, and higher lead and zinc prices (-US$1.60/oz); lower treatment and refining charges (-US$0.26/oz); and 
increase in ore grade (-US$0.07/oz). This was partly offset by higher cost per tonne (+US$0.54/oz) (see page 55).
SAUCITO: US$1.50/OZ (2017) VERSUS – US$0.39/OZ (2016), (N/A)
The increase was driven by: the higher cost per tonne (+US$1.69/oz) (see page 56); the expected lower silver grade (+US$0.53/
oz); and lower by-product credits per ounce of silver resulting from the decrease in volume of gold sold (+US$0.08/oz). These 
adverse effects were partly offset by lower treatment and refining charges (-US$0.39/oz) and lower profit sharing (-US$0.03/oz).
CIÉNEGA: -US$163.74/OZ (2017) VERSUS – US$217.19/OZ (2016), (N/A)
The increase in cash cost was primarily due to: the higher cost per tonne (+US$225.41/oz) (see page 58); and the expected 
decrease in gold grade (+US$23.81/oz). These unfavourable factors were partly offset by higher by-product credits per ounce  
of gold, due to the increased volumes of silver and lead sold, and higher lead and zinc prices (-US$179.45/oz); lower treatment 
and refining charges (-US$13.40/oz); and lower profit sharing (-US$2.92/oz). 
HERRADURA: US$492.86/OZ (2017) VERSUS US$470.72/OZ (2016), (+4.7%)
The increase in cash cost resulted from: the higher cost per tonne (+US$29.81/oz) (see page 60); the lower gold grade 
(+US$25.95/oz); higher profit sharing (+US$0.66/oz); and lower by-product credits per gold ounce, due to the decreased volume 
of silver sold at a lower price (+US$0.61/oz). These adverse effects were offset by: a favourable inventory valuation effect, as 
ounces with a higher cost of production in the current period are mixed with the initial lower cost of inventory affecting cost of 
sales (-US$34.76/oz); and lower treatment and refining charges (-US$0.13/oz). 
NOCHE BUENA: US$793.48/OZ (2017) VERSUS US$765.90/OZ (2016), (+3.6%)
The increase in cash cost per ounce was mainly due to: the favourable effect of the reversal of the write-down of gold inventories 
on the leaching pads in 2016, which did not occur in 2017 (+US$37.59/oz); and lower by-product credits (+US$2.22/oz). This was 
partly offset by the higher ore grade (-US$6.07/oz) (see page 62) and others (-US$6.17/oz). 
SAN JULIÁN PHASE I: As operations commenced in August 2016, AISC for 2016 is not considered representative as it 
corresponds to the start-up period, when a significant volume of ore from the stock pile was processed. 
SAN JULIÁN PHASE II: As operations commenced in July 2017, there are no comparable year-on-year figures. 
In addition to the traditional cash cost described above, the Group is reporting all-in sustaining costs (AISC), in accordance with 
the guidelines issued by the World Gold Council.
This cost metric is calculated as traditional cash cost plus on-site general, corporate and administrative costs, community costs 
related to current operations, capitalised stripping and underground mine development, sustaining capital expenditures and 
remediation expenses.
We consider all-in sustaining costs to be a reasonable indicator of a mine’s ability to generate free cash flow when compared 
with the corresponding metal price. We also believe it is a means to monitor not only current production costs, but also 
sustaining costs as it includes mine development costs incurred to prepare the mine for future production, as well as 
sustaining capex.

Total Fresnillo plc 925.4 882.1 43.3 4.9
Total gross profit, net of hedging gains and losses, increased by 4.9% to US$925.4 million in 2017. 
The US$43.3 million increase in gross profit was mainly explained by: i) the higher profits associated with increased production 
of US$142.9 million; ii) the US$72.3 million estimated benefit of the increase in metal prices; and iii) the US$4.7 million 
favourable effect of the Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rate devaluation. These factors were partly offset by: i) the lower ore 
grades mainly at Saucito and Herradura, which had an estimated adverse impact of US$88.1 million; ii) cost inflation estimated 
at US$40.2 million and others of US$48.3 million. 
Herradura and Saucito remained the largest contributors to the Group’s consolidated gross profit, albeit with a decrease in  
their gross profit when compared to 2016. Gross profit at the Fresnillo mine increased by 20.8% over 2016, while the mine’s 
contribution to the Group’s total gross profit increased to 20.9%. San Julián was the fourth largest contributor, providing 10.1% 
of total gross profit, while Noche Buena and Ciénega’s share of the Group’s total gross profit remained broadly unchanged.
ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
Administrative expenses increased 22.9% from US$59.1 million to US$72.7 million, due mainly to additional administrative 
personnel hired to service a larger number of mines and projects and an increase in services provided by third parties (advisors, 
consultants and service providers). Furthermore, increased administrative services provided by Servicios Industriales Peñoles, 
S.A.B de C.V. in relation to San Julián (phase I and phase II) also contributed to the increase in administrative expenses during 
the year .  112

Exploration expenses increased by 16.4% to US$141.1 million in 2017, due to intensified exploration activities, mainly around 
our mining districts and advanced exploration projects (see pages 67-71). An additional US$4.2 million was capitalised, mainly 
relating to exploration expenses at the Juanicipio project, and to a lesser extent at Guanajuato. As a result, risk capital invested 
in exploration totalled US$145.3 million in 2017, a 5.4% increase over 2016. In 2018, total invested in exploration is expected to 
be approximately US$200 million, of which US$8 million is estimated to be capitalised.

EBITDA is a gauge of the Group’s financial performance and a key indicator to measure debt capacity. It is calculated as gross profit 
plus depreciation, less administrative, selling and exploration expenses. In 2017, EBITDA increased 2.7% to US$1,060.1 million 
mainly due to the higher revenue. This was partly offset by the higher adjusted production costs, exploration and administrative 
expenses. However, EBITDA margin expressed as a percentage of revenue decreased, from 54.2% in 2016 to 50.6% in 2017.

In 2017, other income and expenses of US$16.8 million was recognised in the income statement, mainly resulting from the  
sale of non-strategic mining claims to Argonaut Gold Inc around its Castillo mine. This compares favourably against the 
US$9.0 million expense recorded in 2016, which included disposals of fixed assets, remediation works and costs incurred  
in the maintenance of closed mines. 
SILVERSTREAM EFFECTS
The Silverstream contract is accounted for as a derivative financial instrument carried at fair value. The revaluation of the 
Silverstream contract generated a US$70.3 million non-cash gain mainly as a result of converting resources into reserves at 
Sabinas and the higher forward price of silver . In addition, a US$43.3 million non-cash gain was generated by: the unwinding  
of the discounted values; and the difference between payments (volume and price) actually received and accrued in 2017 and 
payments estimated in the valuation model as at 31 December 2016. The total effect recorded in the 2017 income statement 
was a gain of US$113.7 million, which adversely compares to the US$133.5 million gain registered in 2016.

Since the IPO, cumulative cash received has been US$593.0 million, while total non-cash revaluation gains of US$797.4 million 
have been taken to the income statement. The Group expects that further unrealised gains or losses will be taken to the income 
statement in accordance with silver price cyclicality or changes in the variables considered in valuing this contract. Further 
information related to the Silverstream contract is provided in the balance sheet section on page 115 and in notes 14 and 30  
to the consolidated financial statements.
FINANCE COSTS AND INCOME 
Finance costs and income in 2017 rose by 3.6%, from US$32.2 million to US$34.0 million, mainly due to the decrease in 
borrowing costs capitalised in 2017 compared to 2016. 
In addition, a US$41.1 million non-cash finance loss was generated by the mark-to-market time value of the outstanding gold 
hedging programme which was put in place to protect the investment made in the acquisition of the 44% stake of Newmont in 
Penmont in 2014. 
FOREIGN EXCHANGE 
A foreign exchange loss of US$6.4 million was recorded as a result of the realised transactions in the year and the positive 
effect of the 4.5% spot revaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar on the value of peso-denominated net monetary 
assets. This compared favourably against the US$18.4 million foreign exchange loss recognised in 2016. 
We also enter into certain exchange rate derivative instruments as part of a programme to manage our exposure to foreign 
exchange risk associated with the purchase of equipment denominated in euro (EUR), Swedish krona (SEK) and Canadian dollar 
(CAD). At the end of the year, the total EUR, SEK and CAD outstanding net forward position was EUR 8.79 million, CAD 0.76 
million and SEK 32.06 million with maturity dates from March through September 2018. The volume that expired in 2017 was 
EUR 9.23 million with a weighted average strike of 1.1368 US$/EUR, and SEK 15.31 million with a weighted average strike of 8.43 
SEK/US$, which has generated a gain of US$6,532 and US$55,119 respectively, both being recorded in the income statement.
TAXATION
Corporate income tax expense decreased from US$260.0 million in 2016 to US$153.5 million in 2017, despite the 3.2% increase  
in profit before income tax. This decrease resulted mainly from the effect of the 4.5% revaluation of the Mexican peso/US dollar 
spot exchange rate in 2017 versus the 20.1% devaluation in 2016 on the tax value of assets and liabilities; together with the impact 
of the higher inflation rate (6.7% in 2017 versus 3.4% in 2016) on the inflationary uplift of the tax base of assets and liabilities. 
The effective tax rate, excluding the special mining rights, was 20.7%, which was below the 30% statutory tax rate. This was 
mainly due to the tax credit related to the special tax on diesel, the inflationary uplift of the assets, liabilities and tax losses,  
and the revaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar, which impacted the carrying amount of assets and liabilities 
(denominated in US dollars) and their tax bases (denominated in Mexican pesos) (see note 10 to the financial statements). 
Including the effect of the special mining rights, the effective tax rate was 24.4% in 2017.
PROFIT FOR THE YEAR
Profit for the year increased from US$425 million to US$560.8 million, while profit attributable to equity shareholders of the 
Group increased to US$560.6 million, up from US$427.0 million in 2016. 
Excluding the effects of the Silverstream Contract, profit for the year increased from US$331.5 million to US$481.2 million. 
Similarly, profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Group, excluding the Silverstream effects, increased to US$481.0 
million, up from US$333.5 million.

FRESNILLO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Cash generated by operations before changes in working capital increased by 4.9% to US$1,073.7 million, mainly as a result  
of the higher profits generated in the year . Working capital increased US$2.9 million mainly due to an increase in trade and 
other receivables resulting from the higher volumes sold and the higher gold, lead and zinc prices (US$44.4 million); and an 
increase in prepayments and other assets (US$0.7 million). This increase in working capital was partly offset by a decrease  
in inventories (US$5.7 million) and an increase in trade and other payables (US$36.4 million).
Taxes and employee profit sharing paid increased 169.4% over 2016 to US$309.3 million. 
As a result of the above factors, net cash from operating activities decreased 15.2% from US$898.0 million in 2016 to  
US$761.5 million in 2017.
Other sources of cash were the proceeds of the Silverstream Contract of US$43.3 million, proceeds from the sale of non-
strategic assets of US$26.1 million and capital contributions from minority shareholders in subsidiaries of US$18.9 million. 
The above funds were mainly used to purchase property, plant and equipment for a total of US$604.8 million, a 39.3% increase 
over 2016. Capital expenditures for 2017 are further described below:
PURCHASE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
2017
US$ million
Fresnillo mine 111.7
 Mine development and purchase of in-mine equipment 
and installation of a new zinc thickener and vertical 
conveyor band
Saucito mine 133.7
 Development, replacement of in-mine equipment, 
construction of the Pyrites plant and deepening of the 
Jarillas shaft
Herradura mine 153.2
 Stripping activities, sustaining capex and construction  
of second line of DLP
San Julián 79.1 Completion of San Julián phase II 
Ciénega mine 46.5
 Development, replacement of in-mine equipment, 
construction of tailings dam and purchase of land
Noche Buena 18.7 Mining works and sustaining capex
Juanicipio project 34.1 Exploration expenditure and construction of ramps
Other 27.7
Total purchase of property, plant and equipment 604.8
Dividends paid to shareholders of the Group in 2017 totalled US$236.6 million, a 168.2% increase from 2016, in line with our 
dividend policy that includes a consideration of profits generated in the period. The 2017 payment included the final 2016 
dividend of US$158.4 million and the 2017 interim dividend paid in September of US$78.2 million.
Net interest of US$21.0 million was paid, mainly reflecting the interest paid in relation with the issuance of the US$800 million 
principal amount of 5.500% Senior Notes.
The sources and uses of funds described above resulted in a decrease in net cash of US$16.0 million (net decrease in cash  
and cash equivalents), which combined with the US$912.0 million balance at the beginning of the year resulted in cash, cash 
equivalents and short-term investments of US$896.0 million at the end of 2017.

BALANCE SHEET
Fresnillo plc continued to maintain a solid financial position with cash and other liquid funds 
1
 of US$896.0 million as of 
31 December 2017. This represented a 1.7% decrease versus December 2016, as explained on the previous page. 
Inventories decreased 2.1% to US$271.1 million mainly as a result of the further decrease in inventories of gold deposited  
on the leaching pads at Herradura.
Trade and other receivables increased 40.3% to US$402.1 million as a result of the increase in income tax recoverable, higher 
metal volumes sold which increased receivables and an increase in value added tax receivable.
The change in the value of the Silverstream derivative from US$467.5 million at the beginning of the year to US$538.9 million as 
of 31 December 2017 reflects proceeds of US$42.3 million corresponding to 2017 (US$37.4 million in cash and US$4.9 million in 
receivables) and the Silverstream revaluation effect in the income statement of US$113.7 million. 
The net book value of property, plant and equipment was US$2,448.6 million at year end, representing a 12.3% increase over 
2016. The US$268.4 million increase was mainly due to: the larger asset base following the commissioning of San Julián; 
capitalised development works; construction of the Pyrites plant and the second DLP line; purchase of additional in-mine 
equipment; and the construction of leaching pads at Herradura and Noche Buena. 
The Group’s total equity was US$3,066.6 million as of 31 December 2017, a 12.9% increase over 2016. This was mainly explained 
by the increase in retained earnings, reflecting the 2016 profit, lower dividends paid during the year and the net unrealised gains 
on cash flow hedges. 
DIVIDENDS
Based on the Group’s 2017 performance, the Directors have recommended a final dividend of US$29.8 cents per Ordinary Share, 
which will be paid on 4 June 2018 to shareholders on the register on 27 April 2018. The dividend will be paid in UK pounds sterling 
unless shareholders elect to be paid in US dollars. This is in addition to the interim dividend of US$10.6 cents per share totalling 
US$78.1 million.

DEAR SHAREHOLDER
During 2017, stakeholder expectations for good corporate governance have continued to evolve both in the UK 
and Mexico. My Board colleagues and I have sought to understand the implications of those developments for 
Fresnillo plc and respond to them accordingly.
In Mexico, there was a significant development in anti-bribery and corruption legislation during the year . It was 
pleasing, from the Board’s perspective, to see that the work we have undertaken over the past few years to 
ensure compliance with the UK Bribery Act enabled us to accommodate the requirements of the new Mexican 
legislation very easily. Nevertheless, this provided us, as a Board, with the opportunity to review and update our 
Group Code of Ethics and Anti-Bribery and Corruption policy. We have also continued to monitor the work being 
undertaken by the management team to understand and develop our corporate culture which will help us as we 
engage with our employees and the communities in which we operate.
In 2017, we were required to re-submit our executive remuneration policy to shareholders for approval at the 
AGM. I am delighted that, again, over 99% of our independent shareholders supported the remuneration policy. 
We note that our policy is unusual in some respects compared to many companies in the FTSE 100 index because 
our approach to executive remuneration seeks to align with Mexican market practice. The Remuneration 
Committee continues to review investor expectations and will continue to provide good explanations for those 
aspects where we differ from the norm in our Remuneration Report (see pages 152-161).
Ahead of the 2017 Annual General Meeting, we engaged in a number of conversations with institutional investors 
and their representative bodies about our Board composition and membership, recognising the need to evolve 
the independent representation on the Board and ensure that our Directors have sufficient time to be able to 
commit to the work of the Board. During the second half of 2017, we continued to consider the evolution of the 
Board and as a result, we recently announced some further changes to the Board which will take effect from the 
2018 AGM.
I am delighted that Dame Judith Macgregor joined the Board as an independent Non-executive 
Director following the AGM. Dame Judith brings a range of perspectives to the Board, and we will 
benefit from her diplomatic experience particularly gained during her four years as the British 
Ambassador to Mexico. It is also proposed that Georgina Kessel will join our Board after the 
2018 AGM. These two appointments mean that 50% of the new appointments to the Fresnillo 
plc Board in the past six years will have been female, demonstrating our commitment to 
broaden the diversity of our Board. The Nominations Committee continues to be mindful that 
Fresnillo plc does not yet meet the current expectations for gender diversity on FTSE 100 
boards and will continue its efforts to address this in its future Board appointments.
Guy Wilson, the Chairman of our Audit Committee, has now served on the Board for nine years. 
In keeping with the UK Corporate Governance Code requirements on director independence, 
it will no longer be possible for Guy to remain on the Board as an independent Non-executive 
Director and Audit Committee Chairman. It is therefore with great regret that Guy will step 
down from the Board after the 2018 AGM.
We will continue to speak to our institutional investors and other counterparties 
concerning our approach to corporate governance in order to ensure that we 
communicate our perspective on governance within our Mexican context, while at  
the same time responding to any questions or concerns that shareholders may have 
about our governance standards.
As we approach the tenth anniversary of our listing on the London Stock Exchange, 
we remain committed to the standards of good governance set out in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code which we will endeavour to apply in the way that  
we believe best serves the interests of all of our stakeholders.

FRESNILLO AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
APPROACH
The Board takes corporate governance seriously and 
considers its responsibilities under the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’) with care. With nearly 75% 
of its share capital owned by Peñoles, it is important 
to consider corporate governance in the context of the 
Company’s relationship with its parent company. The Board 
considers this to be a strength rather than a threat because 
it brings the shareholder perspective into the boardroom 
and creates an additional level of accountability for the 
executive team compared to other listed companies.
The framework for corporate governance within Fresnillo plc 
therefore has three features which are relatively unusual for 
UK public companies; in particular:
• There are no Executive Directors on the Board; however, 
the Fresnillo Board operates differently from the traditional 
UK board with Non-executive and Executive Directors. The 
non-independent and independent Directors on the Board 
engage with the business of the Board in slightly different 
ways. The non-independent Directors have more regular 
day-to-day access to the executive management of 
Fresnillo plc within the Peñoles context and therefore are 
able to engage with proposals put forward by the Executive 
Committee in a more direct manner . The independent 
Non-executive Directors bring an external perspective 
to bear when evaluating proposals and conducting  
the business of the Board. Thus the non-independent 
Directors, the independent Non-executive Directors and 
the Executive Committee have complementary roles in 
the business of the Board.
• The membership of the Remuneration Committee  
is made up of Non-executive Directors (the majority  
of whom are independent) who are able to bring the 
following perspectives to the working of the 
Remuneration Committee:
 – an understanding of shareholder expectations;
 – an understanding of the evolving remuneration 
expectations of investors on the London Stock 
Exchange; and
 – an understanding of the general approaches to 
remuneration within the Mexican market.
 In addition, given the Company’s London premium  
listing and most of the remuneration requirements  
being internationally driven, the Nomination Committee 
and Board are of the view that Charles Jacobs, based  
in London, is the most appropriate chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee.
• Having the Chairman, who is non-executive but not 
independent, as a member of the Remuneration 
Committee, enhances the Committee’s collective ability 
to take these perspectives into account in its discussions.
• Fresnillo plc derives synergistic benefits from services 
provided by Peñoles. Being a part of a group which has 
common requirements across a number of service areas, 
provides opportunities for resources to be shared 
efficiently from a cost point of view. The Audit Committee 
has therefore developed governance processes to ensure 
that these arrangements provide the intended benefits  
to the Company in a transparent and controlled manner . 
The key elements of the Board’s approach to ensuring that 
the Company’s commercial relationship with its parent 
company and other related parties are independent and 
maintained on an arms length basis are described later  
in this section.
UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE 
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
As a company with a premium listing on the London 
Stock Exchange, Fresnillo is required under the FCA 
Listing Rules to comply with the Code Provisions of 
the Code (a copy of which can be found on the website 
of the Financial Reporting Council www.frc.org.uk)  
or otherwise explain its reasons for non-compliance.
The following statement is therefore made in respect 
of the year ended 31 December 2017 in compliance  
with such requirement.
For the financial year ended 31 December 2017,  
the Company has complied with the provisions of the 
Code in all areas, save in respect of two instances.
• Code Provision D.1.1 provides that the Remuneration 
Committee should include provisions that would 
enable the Company to recover sums paid or withhold 
the payment of any sum to senior executives, and 
specify the circumstances in which it would be 
appropriate to do so. Following the approval by 
shareholders of the Company’s Remuneration Policy 
at the 2017 AGM on 23 May 2017, the Remuneration 
Committee now has discretion to reduce annual bonus 
payments where circumstances justify it. Thus, the 
Board considers that the Company was in compliance 
with Code Provision D.1.1 with effect from the date of 
approval of the new Directors’ Remuneration Policy. 
Further explanation is set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on page 165.
• Code Provision D.2.1 provides that the Board should 
establish a Remuneration Committee of at least three 
independent Non-executive Directors. The composition 
of the Fresnillo Remuneration Committee is made up 
of three members including two independent Non-
executive Directors one of whom, Charles Jacobs, is 
the Chairman of the Committee. The Chairman of the 
Company, Alberto Baillères, who was not independent 
at the time of his appointment, is also a member .  
The Board believes that Mr Baillères’ experience and 
knowledge of the Group and the Mexican market and 
his considerable contribution to the Remuneration 
Committee’s deliberations justifies his membership 
of the Remuneration Committee. Mr Baillères is not 
involved in matters concerning his own remuneration.
The following sections of this report explain how the 
principles of the Code were applied and provide cross-
references to other sections of the report and/or the 
Company’s website (www.fresnilloplc.com) where more 
detailed descriptions are available. 123

THE GOVERNANCE OF FRESNILLO’S RELATED PARTY ARRANGEMENTS
RELATIONSHIP AGREEMENT
Peñoles has entered into a relationship agreement with the Company (the ‘Relationship Agreement’) to ensure that 
relationships between the Fresnillo Group and the Peñoles Group are conducted at arm’s length and on normal commercial 
terms. The non-independent Directors listed previously have been appointed to the Board by Peñoles pursuant to the 
Relationship Agreement.
The Relationship Agreement complies with the independence provisions set out in Listing Rule 6.1.4DR for controlled 
companies. The Company has complied with the independence provisions included in the Relationship Agreement during  
the financial year ended 31 December 2017. As far as the Company is aware, such provisions have been complied with  
during the financial year ended 31 December 2017 by Peñoles and/or any of its associates.
Peñoles has also undertaken not to exercise its voting rights to amend the Articles of Association in a way which would be 
inconsistent with the provisions of the agreement. It has also agreed to abstain from voting on any resolution to approve a 
‘related party transaction’ (as defined in paragraph 11.1.5 R of the Listing Rules) involving any member of the Peñoles Group.
The following diagram summarises the approach taken to identify and manage related party transactions.

HOW THIS IS MANAGED
If a Director is interested in a company which could potentially enter into 
transactions with a Fresnillo plc Group company, the Board will normally 
consider that interest under its arrangements for authorising conflicts of 
interest under s175 of Companies Act.
HOW THIS IS MANAGED
The Executive Committee will seek to ensure that the best possible terms 
are achieved for a proposed transaction and that they are verified by industry 
benchmarking reports or independent valuation/assessment, where possible.
HOW THIS IS MANAGED
The Audit Committee reviews the key terms of major transactions which 
are verified as to price and quality with external consultants or independent 
benchmarking, where possible.
HOW THIS IS MANAGED
Under the Relationship Agreement and the Listing Rules, the Independent 
Directors must approve any transaction with the Peñoles Group and its associates 
without the non-independent Directors voting.
Ongoing monitoring of Directors’ interests and related parties of the Company 
provides the information to determine if a related party approval is required 
for a proposed transaction, where possible.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Group requires that Directors complete a ‘Director’s List’. The list sets out details of situations where each Director’s interest 
may conflict with those of the Company (situational conflicts). Each Director has re-submitted their list as at 31 December 2017 
for the Board to consider and authorise any new situational conflicts identified in the re-submitted lists.
At the beginning of each Board meeting, the Company Secretary reminds the Directors of their duties under sections 175, 177 
and 182 of the Companies Act which relate to the disclosure of any conflicts of interest prior to any matter that may be discussed 
by the Board. Further information about related party matters considered by the Board during the year are set out in the Audit

BOARD LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS
BOARD COMPOSITION
As at the date of this Report, the Board consists of a Non-executive Chairman, seven Non-executive Directors that it considers 
to be independent and four Non-executive Directors not considered to be independent. There are no Directors who have 
executive responsibilities within the Company.
BOARD ROLES
The requirements of the roles of Chairman and of the Chief Executive Officer have been agreed by the Board and are set out in 
a written Statement of Responsibilities. Octavio Alvídrez, the Chief Executive Officer, is not currently a member of the Board.
Charles Jacobs, the Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders if they have concerns that have not been resolved 
through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or Head of Investor Relations. The 
composition of the Board has been structured to ensure that no one individual can dominate the decision-making processes  
of the Board.
CHAIRMAN’S INDEPENDENCE
The Chairman, Mr Baillères, is beneficially interested in more than 50% of the share capital of the Company through his interest 
in Industrias Peñoles S.A.B. de C.V., the Company’s controlling shareholder . Mr Baillères is also the Chairman of Peñoles and 
other companies within the BAL Group.
Mr Baillères was appointed to the Board by Peñoles pursuant to the Relationship Agreement, thus at the time of his 
appointment was not independent. Having been responsible for overseeing the successful development of the Group over 
many years, the Board considers that his continued involvement as its Non-executive Chairman is very important to the 
continued success of the Company.
The Relationship Agreement continues to provide a transparent governance system, which ensures that the Company benefits 
from Mr Baillères’ leadership and experience while being able to demonstrate to other shareholders that the Fresnillo Group 
is capable of carrying on its business independently. In particular, the Relationship Agreement ensures that transactions and 
relationships between the Fresnillo Group and its controlling shareholder are at arm’s length and on competitive commercial 
terms. Further information regarding the Relationship Agreement can be found on pages 123 and 144.
INDEPENDENCE
The Board considers the Directors listed as being independent on pages 119 and 120, to be independent in character and 
judgement. For each of these Directors, their circumstances are assessed by reference to Provision B.1.1. of the Code and  
the Board remains satisfied that they are each independent when the standards set out in Code Provision B.1.1 are taken into 
account. In making this assessment, the Board has taken the following considerations into account:
Charles Jacobs Charles Jacobs is the worldwide senior partner and chairman of Linklaters LLP . 
Mr Jacobs is not involved in the provision of legal or any other services to the 
Company by Linklaters LLP .
Linklaters LLP is currently one of the Company’s legal advisers where any such  
advice is limited to English law and is provided by a different partner of Linklaters 
LLP . Selection of legal advisers is not a Board matter and is decided at the 
management level. None of the Fresnillo management sit on the Board. However,  
if any decision were to be made at the Board level regarding Linklaters LLP, which 
has not happened to date, Mr Jacobs would excuse himself in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 relating to Directors’ interests.
Mr Jacobs does not have, and has not had within the last three years, a material 
business relationship with the Company either directly, or as a partner, shareholder, 
director or senior employee of a body that has such a relationship with the Company. 
By way of illustration, the legal fees paid to Linklaters LLP for the last three financial 
years were £177k for the year ended 31 December 2015, £148k for the year ended 
31 December 2016 and £117k for the year ended 31 December 2017. Thus, in each 
year, the fees paid to Linklaters represented less than 0.01% of Linklaters global 
earnings and less than 0.01% of the Company’s global revenues. The Audit Committee 
reviews the appropriateness of all professional advisers’ fees each year including 
legal fees as part of their review of ordinary course of business expenses.

Fernando Ruiz Fernando Ruiz has, since 2008, been a retired partner and consultant in the firm

Mr Ruiz is an independent non-executive director of Grupo Nacional Provincial, S.A.B. 
and Grupo Palacio de Hierro S.A.B. de C.V., which are companies within the BAL 
Group. Given that he is not involved in executive duties in any of those companies and 
has a similar obligation to be independent for those two companies as for Fresnillo, 
the Board does not consider that Mr Ruiz’ position as an independent Non-executive 
Director of the Company is adversely impacted by those two appointments.
Fernando Ruiz’ breadth of knowledge and experience across a wide range of Mexican 
businesses, together with the invaluable audit and tax experience he brings to the role, 
are highly regarded by the Board. Notwithstanding his length of service on the Board, 
the Board is satisfied that he continues to demonstrate the qualities of independence 
and objectivity in carrying out his role as a Non-executive Director . 
Jaime Serra No issues to consider .
Alberto Tiburcio Alberto Tiburcio retired as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Mancera S.C.,

Young LLP prior to his retirement.
Mr Tiburcio is an independent non-executive director of Grupo Nacional Provincial, 
S.A.B. and Profuturo Afore, S.A. de C.V., which are companies within the BAL Group. 
Given that he is not involved in executive duties in any of those companies and has  
a similar obligation to be independent for those two companies as for Fresnillo, the 
Board does not consider that Mr Tiburcio’s position as an independent Non-executive 
Director of the Company is adversely impacted by those two appointments.
Guy Wilson Guy Wilson retired as a partner of Ernst & Young LLP, the Company’s auditor,  
in 2008. Mr Wilson was not involved in the provision of audit or any other services  
to the Company by Ernst & Young LLP prior to his retirement.
COMMITMENT
The Nominations Committee annually reviews the time commitments of the Non-executive Directors to the Fresnillo plc Board. 
Its philosophy in doing so, is that the total workload of the Non-executive Director should be taken into consideration. For those 
Directors who do not have a fulltime job elsewhere the availability of time is different to those that do. The Board benefits from 
the experience of those Directors as well as from their other interests. This is considered to be a strength. Furthermore, public 
companies vary considerably in the expectations that they place on their non-executive directors. A global company with various 
lines of business operating in many countries, should not count the same as a single-product company with operations primarily 
in just one country. Fresnillo plc falls into the latter category and because of the relative simplicity of its activities, the Board 
does not consider that it needs more than four scheduled Board meetings a year, a factor which is reflected in the relatively  
low fees that the Company pays its Non-executive Directors. This relatively low number of meetings is further justified by the 
degree of governance oversight of the Company which comes by virtue of it being also a member of the BAL Group of which five 
of its Non-executive Directors are also members. The Non-executive Directors are required, by their letters of appointment, to 
spend 14 days per annum on Company business. The BAL Group Directors usually meet with management prior to each Board 
meeting to extensively review the agenda and papers for the forthcoming meeting with them. They also oversee management 
responses to actions arising from the Board meetings. This time commitment, as well as the time required in travelling to the 
UK for the annual general meeting each year, significantly exceeds the time commitment specified in their letters of appointment. 
The independent Directors have committee responsibilities which, in conjunction with their Board duties, take up more time 
than their letters or appointment require. In addition, the UK-based Directors also travel to and from Mexico for Board and 
Committee meetings which also significantly increases the time that they spend on their Board duties.
OVERBOARDING
During the year, the Company engaged specifically with shareholders and voting agencies on the subject of perceived 
overboarding on the part of some of the Board members. Board members have discussed this issue both formally and 
informally during the year and their perspective on this matter is underpinned by two generic factors which may not always 
be apparent to shareholders:
(1) A number of directors hold non-executive roles within companies listed in Mexico. Mexican listed companies generally 
operate with large boards with the option for alternate directors to be appointed and generally lower expectations on the 
time and commitment required from their non-executive directors. The Board estimates that the time commitment for 
board and committee meetings at a Mexican company is between a third and a quarter of the time required at a UK plc. 126

BOARD LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS 
CONTINUED
(2) The calendar for Board and Committee meetings is scheduled to align with all of the other meetings of companies, 
including listed companies within the BAL Group ownership structure. This ensures that Fresnillo plc Directors who  
are appointed to the boards of other companies within the BAL Group do not have any time conflicts with their other 
commitments on BAL Listed Entity boards. The near full attendance record of the non-independent Non-executive 
Directors over the ten years since the Company’s IPO bears this out.
The other listed company directorships of the Fresnillo plc directors is set out on pages 118 to 120 of this report.

BOARD PROCESS
The Board supervises the management of the Group’s activities, including the implementation of both the Group’s long-term 
plans and commercial strategy. In addition, the Board provides leadership to the Fresnillo Group setting the key values by 
which the Group will continue to operate. The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its approval which includes 
approvals of major expenditure, investments and key policies. The schedule is annually reviewed to keep it up to date with any 
regulatory developments. The last review and revision was undertaken in October 2017.
All meetings of the Board are held in Mexico. The Board has a well-established programme of meetings. Board members 
usually receive Board papers five days prior to meetings in order to enable the Directors adequate time to study and consider 
the documents. Members of the Executive Committee, led by the Chief Executive Officer, are present at all of the Board 
meetings and present all of the papers on operational and financial matters.
Directors have the right to raise concerns at Board meetings, and can ask for those concerns to be recorded in the Board 
minutes. The advice and services of the Company Secretary (whose appointment and removal is a matter reserved for  
the Board) are also available to the Directors. The Group has also established a procedure which enables, in relevant 
circumstances, Directors to obtain independent professional advice at the Company’s expense. 127

CORPORATE CODE OF CONDUCT
The Corporate Code of Conduct is approved by the Board as a guideline for all Directors, executives, employees and related 
third parties (including clients, suppliers and the community) to act in accordance with the Code. The Code helps to ensure 
a foundation of values and works as a guide for behaviour that encourages an environment of ethics and responsibility for 
the benefit of our stakeholders. It serves to complement the internal and external regulations already in force and also to 
establish corrective measures for anyone who fails to comply with the provisions of the Code. It also provides the framework 
for the Company’s compliance with the UK Bribery Act and the Mexican anti-bribery and corruption legislation. Changes to  
the Code of Conduct were ratified by the Board in February 2017, the objective of these changes was to:
• incorporate a ‘behavioural compass’ establishing basic questions that personnel should ask themselves before making 
decisions;
• highlight the corporate values;
• address topics such as money laundering and industrial espionage;
• emphasise that safety is a top priority; and
• give greater clarity on sanctions in the case of violations.
CULTURE
During 2017, the Board received regular reports on the organisational culture and ethics programme, including a presentation 
at its July meeting. The programme consists of three main elements: evaluation, support activities and training. Reports are 
received on the three cultural KPIs, the number of whistleblowing line cases, reports on management (the tone from the top) 
and disciplinary cases. The Group undertook an Ethisphere ethical, culture and perceptions assessment to benchmark its 
culture and these findings were reviewed by the Board.
The HSECR Committee has been given responsibility for overseeing the programme on behalf of the Board, and has reviewed 
the progress of the programme in detail during its meetings in 2017. 128

BOARD PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In order to evaluate its own effectiveness, the Board undertakes annual appraisals using a combination of externally facilitated 
and internally-run evaluations over a three-year cycle. The cycle of the Board’s evaluations is summarised as follows:
YEAR 1
Externally facilitated Board evaluation 
using questionnaires and/or 
interviews 
YEAR 2
Follow-up on action plan prepared in 
response to year 1 evaluation using 
internally-facilitated questionnaires 
YEAR 3
Focus on outstanding and emerging 
issues arising from the action plan 
using internally-facilitated 
questionnaires
BOARD EVALUATION IN 2017
At the beginning of 2017 the Board considered an action plan in response to the findings of the internally-facilitated evaluation 
undertaken in 2016, being the final step in the previous three-year cycle.
In 2017, Fresnillo engaged Lintstock to facilitate an evaluation of the performance of the Board of Directors. Lintstock is an 
advisory firm that specialises in Board performance reviews and has no other connection with the Company.
The first stage of the review involved Lintstock engaging with the key project sponsors, including Executive Committee and 
Non-executive Board members, to set the context for the evaluation and to tailor survey content to the specific circumstances 
of Fresnillo. All Board members were then requested to complete an online survey addressing the performance of the Board 
and its Committees. The anonymity of the respondents was ensured throughout the process in order to promote an open and 
frank exchange of views.
Lintstock subsequently produced a report addressing the following areas of Board performance:
• The appropriateness of the Board’s composition was assessed and respondents were asked to identify any additional 
competencies from which the Board would benefit.
• The Board’s understanding of the views of key stakeholders and the markets in which the Company operates was 
considered. The Board’s oversight of the culture and behaviours throughout the organisation was also reviewed.
• The relationships between Board members and management, and the atmosphere in and management of meetings,  
were assessed, as was the quality of the Board packs and management presentations at meetings.
• The effectiveness of the Board in reviewing the Company’s current performance, and influencing future performance,  
was considered and respondents were asked to identify areas upon which they feel the Board should spend more or less 
time focusing.
• The Board’s oversight of strategy and the Company’s progress against its strategic pillars was considered, as was the 
Board’s understanding of the capacity of the organisation to deliver the strategy. Respondents’ views as to the top strategic 
issues facing the Company were also identified.
• The Board’s oversight of risk management was assessed, as was the Board’s effectiveness in monitoring the Company’s 
health and safety performance.
• The appropriateness of the structure of the Company at senior levels was reviewed and the level of interaction between  
the Board and top management in various settings was considered.
As a result of the review, among other things the Board agreed to the following key actions:
KEY FINDINGS FROM 2017 EVALUATION PROPOSED ACTIONS
More time should be devoted to strategy In future there will be one general strategy discussion a year 
and specific strategy discussions e.g. in relation to health & 
safety or exploration, at each other meeting during the year .
More time should be allocated to succession planning A formal Board discussion of the succession plan will be 
scheduled once a year .
INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS
Non-executive Directors occasionally meet the Chairman without executives being present. The independent Non-executive 
Directors meet annually in order to evaluate the performance of the Chairman. On the back of this meeting, the Senior 
Independent Director discusses the views of the independent Directors with the Chairman. The Independent Directors held 
this meeting in 2017 after the February meeting and took the 2016 Board Evaluation review into account in their discussions 
and feedback to the Chairman. 130

Human Board, Audit and HSECR Committees • Review of culture and organisational 
ethics strategy and reports on metrics.
• Approval of Modern Slavery Statement.
• Oversight of whistleblower arrangements.
• Succession planning.

The Executive Committee is responsible for the day-to-day stewardship of all classes of capital and its members report to  
the Board on the key metrics and initiatives.
Indirectly, the Remuneration Committee supports the governance of the six types of capital by setting remuneration targets 
which incentivise value creation across all six types of capital.
BOARD DEVELOPMENT AND INDUCTION
Senior management present on the Group’s strategic initiatives to provide the Non-executive Directors with more information 
about the broader context to the Company’s activities. In addition, there is a regular distribution of industry briefings on technical, 
market and sector issues.
Directors are encouraged to visit the Company’s mines to familiarise themselves with the Fresnillo Group’s operations building 
on mine visits in recent years. During 2017, there were two visits by members of the Board to the new San Julián development. 
Mr Alejandro Bailléres and Mr Arturo Fernández, along with members of the Executive Committee visited San Julián in 
September 2017 and Messrs Wilson, Jacobs and Dame Judith Macgregor visited the same mine in October 2017. Mr Jacobs  
and Dame Judith Macgregor also visited the Fresnillo mine in October 2017.
Briefings were arranged for all Directors from the Company’s legal advisers. These include presentations which were aimed  
at familiarising the Directors with the duties and responsibilities as Directors of a UK listed company. In addition, the Chairman 
meets with Directors to discuss any training or development needs.
Following her appointment to the Board in May 2017, a series of briefings were arranged for Dame Judith Macgregor, 
including meetings with the Company’s key advisers and a presentation about the duties of a director of a UK listed public 
company. Meetings were also arranged with members of the Executive Committee to enable Dame Judith to discuss the 
Company’s strategy and business plans in more detail. Dame Judith also attended a meeting of the Audit Committee as  
an observer as part of her induction. 131

DEAR SHAREHOLDER
In my letter as Chairman of the Nominations Committee in the 2016 Annual Report, I stated that we remain 
strongly committed to the principle of equality of opportunity when considering new appointments to the Board. 
Shortly after the publication of that report, we were delighted to announce that Dame Judith Macgregor would 
be joining the Board with effect from the 2017 AGM. Dame Judith has now joined the Board and is adding useful 
counsel and insight to our discussions. I am equally delighted that we propose to appoint Georgina Kessel to the 
Board following the 2018 AGM bringing the proportion of women on our Board to 25% compared to less than 
10% just over a year ago. Our policy is to make appointments to the Board on the basis of merit and there can  
be no doubt that we have kept to our policy in making both of these appointments.
The Nominations Committee remains mindful that we are in a phase during which careful consideration of the 
composition of the Board is required, particularly as some of our independent Non-executive Directors reach the 
ninth anniversary of their appointment. We have therefore made changes to the composition of the Board and  
its Committees to retain the right number of independent Non-executive Directors on our Board and meet the 
standards set by the UK Corporate Governance Code.
As a Committee, we are also keen to ensure that our current Board members are committing appropriate 
amounts of time and effort to the Board’s work and have scrutinised the other commitments and attendance 
record of our Directors very carefully. We are aware that two of our Board members hold more external 
directorships than some of our stakeholders would prefer and levels of attendance at Board and Committee 
meetings also come under scrutiny. We are delighted that our Board is made up of very talented and expert 
Directors and the contribution of each one both in and outside of Board meetings is valued. Each year we 
monitor the contribution of our Directors and, in 2017, we had the additional assurance provided by our 
externally facilitated Board and Committee evaluation exercise to support our views on this point. 
At present, the North America Free Trade Agreement, which is of critical importance to Mexico, 
is coming under increasing scrutiny and one of our Directors, Jaime Serra, who was key to 
its original introduction, is for a while, in demand because of his expertise in this area. 
We are pleased that he is actively contributing to this important development for Mexico 
and are happy to accept that this meant that he just missed one Board meeting as 
a consequence.
During the year, the membership of the Nominations Committee changed with Fernando 
Ruiz standing down from the Committee following the Company’s AGM in May and being 
replaced by Alberto Tiburcio, an independent Non-executive Director . I would like to place 
on record my thanks to Fernando for his contribution to the Committee since its formation 
in 2008 and I am pleased to welcome Alberto to the Committee in his place.
Yours faithfully

NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE
BOARD APPOINTMENTS POLICY AND PROCESS IN SUMMARY
The Nominations Committee and Board are strongly committed to the principle of equality of opportunity when making new 
appointments to the Board while ensuing that appointments are made on the basis of merit. The Nominations Committee 
continues to consider the composition of the Board with a focus on its continued commitment to diversity.
The criteria for determining the composition of the Board and future Board appointments continue to be based on:
• Relationship Agreement requirements for appointments to the Board by Peñoles.
• The Company’s leading position as a precious metals miner in Mexico.
• The Company’s inclusion in the FTSE 100 Index.
• The specific functions on Board committees which independent Directors will be required to fulfil.
• The provisions set out in the current terms of reference of the Nominations Committee.
The Nominations Committee does not use open advertising or retain any external consultants when making new appointments 
to the Board as it is considered unnecessary considering the Company’s contacts within Mexico and further afield.
BOARD DIVERSITY POLICY IN SUMMARY AND PROGRESS
All Board appointments are made on merit. The Board recognises and embraces the benefits of having a diverse Board; 
particularly the value that different perspectives and experience bring to the quality of Board debate and decision-making. 
There are certain considerations which are taken into account in considering the composition of the Board such as: 
background and experience; age; gender; and shareholder perspectives.
The Board believes that setting targets for the number of people from a particular background or gender is not the most 
effective approach to take. The Board will therefore look to follow the principles of this policy rather than specified quotas  
or targets. Following the appointment of Dame Judith Macgregor as an independent Non-executive Director during the year, 
three of the seven new Directors that have been appointed to the Board since 2012 have been women. This demonstrates  
the Board’s commitment to gender diversity. With 16.6% of the current Board composition being female, the Nominations 
Committee recognises that this does not meet the 33% target for representation of women on the board set by the Hampton- 133

Alexander Review. Nevertheless, it will continue to keep the gender balance of the Board as a key factor in considering future 
Board appointments, which at all times will be based on merit.
The Board recognises that very few women are attracted to mining engineering and geology academic programmes in Mexico 
and, in view of the stage of development of Mexico, the participation of women in the labour force as a whole is still relatively 
low. This will take time to rectify but it is changing and the Company is committed to hiring and developing women with 
educational training in mining engineering, geology, finance and accounting.
With nine Mexican and three British directors on the Board, the Nominations Committee is satisfied with the ethnic diversity  
of the Board.
Full versions of the Board Appointments Policy and Process and the Board Diversity Policy and the Group Diversity Policy,  
can be found on the Company’s website (www.fresnilloplc.com).
ACTIVITY DURING 2017
The Nominations Committee met twice during the year .
BOARD APPOINTMENTS
The Nominations Committee is committed to a progressive refreshing of the Board, as recommended by Code Provision B.2.3 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Following departures from the Board in 2016, the Nominations Committee, led by the Chairman, considered options for  
the appointment of a new independent Non-executive Director at its meetings in February and April 2017. In making its 
recommendation that Dame Judith Macgregor be appointed to the Board, the Nominations Committee recognised that Dame 
Judith’s impressive credentials as a diplomat, including four years as the British Ambassador to Mexico, would bring a new 
and valuable perspective to the Board’s work. The Nominations Committee recognises that further independent Non-executive 
Director appointments are necessary as some of the current independent Directors reach the nine-year deadline for independence 
set by the UK Corporate Governance Code. Consequently, Mr Guy Wilson will step down from the Board at the 2018 AGM and, 
subject to shareholder approval at the same meeting, be replaced as an independent Non-executive Director by Georgina Kessel.
COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
The Nominations Committee reviewed the composition and effectiveness of the Board Committees in 2017 and, while it was 
satisfied that the Committees are working well, it also considered that the membership of the Committees would need to be 
refreshed in order to ensure that they clearly reflect the appropriate representation of independent Non-executive Directors on 
each Committee. The Nominations Committee therefore approved the following changes to the Board Committees in April 2017:
• Alberto Tiburcio was appointed to the Nominations Committee in place of Fernando Ruiz;
• Jaime Serra Puche was appointed to the Remuneration Committee in place of Mr Ruiz; and
• Mr Ruiz left the Audit Committee and was appointed a member of the HSECR Committee.
EXECUTIVE SUCCESSION PLANNING
Each year, the Nominations Committee reviews a schedule of possible successors for all the positions on the Executive Committee 
(Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of Exploration and Chief Operating Officer). This review considers 
both short-term emergency and long-term planning scenarios. Any actions needed to support the development of potential 
long-term successors are discussed. The Nominations Committee also monitors the long-term evolution of the membership of 
the Board as a whole. These matters were all discussed by the Nominations Committee in 2017 and it is satisfied with the actions 
that are being taken to support this.
OTHER NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE ACTIVITY
The Nominations Committee also considered the following matters:
• Approval of the Nominations Committee Report prior to publication.
• Review of the time commitment required from each Director .
• The proposed re-election of each of the continuing Directors at the AGM.
• A self-evaluation exercise (which concluded that the Nominations Committee is functioning well).
The terms of reference of the Nominations Committee are available on the Company’s website at www.fresnilloplc.com.
The letters of appointment for the Non-executive Directors are made available for inspection at the Company’s registered 
office, during normal business hours. 134

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
In additional to our normal duties, which are set out in the following Report, we have been addressing three 
issues which arose in 2017, namely new accounting standards, the Non-Financial Reporting Directive and the 
increasing activities of the Mexican tax authorities.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Management has modelled the effects of IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts 
with customers. The results indicate that the financial effects on our Group financial statements of IFRS 15  
are likely to be minimal. The effect of IFRS 9 is estimated to be an initial adjustment from retained earnings to 
hedging reserves as at 1 January 2017 of US$23.0 million and an adjustment decreasing financial costs for the 
year ended 31 December 2017 of US$42.1 million.
THE NON-FINANCIAL REPORTING DIRECTIVE
We have been monitoring management’s actions to assemble the information required, using Internal Audit  
to validate the data extracted from our operational records. We have also taken into consideration section 172  
of the Companies Act 2006 to ensure that the resulting information is properly presented.
TAXATION
During 2017, the Mexican tax authorities have opened a number of investigations into the tax returns of our 
subsidiaries, some of them going back several years. These investigations are considered to be routine but the 
level of activity appears to have increased. These investigations cover three main areas.
•  The normal reviews instigated by our recognised trade union seeking to ensure that PTU (the statutory employee 
profit-sharing arrangement which is available to all Mexican employees) has been correctly calculated.
•  Reviews looking at certain of our subsidiaries’ tax returns for the year 2013 which reflect the corporate 
reconstruction of our mining operations.
•  The tax inspections have been relatively straightforward so far in that activity has been limited  
to requests for information which we have promptly supplied by the due dates.
In addition, new legislation required us to obtain details of the tax compliance of certain contractors 
to whom we made payments. We are working with our suppliers to ensure that full information is 
provided to the tax authorities. So far, this is working well but it did consume a significant amount 
of time and resources in 2017 prior to the online portal to input this information to the tax 
authorities opening in 2018.
In all of the above, we are confident that no material tax costs or penalties will arise and therefore 
we do not consider that potential tax exposure in relation to the above matters is a significant 
issue for the financial statements for 2017, as reflected in note 10 to the financial statements, 
but we will continue to monitor the situation closely.
AUDIT COMMITTEE EVALUATION
In the latter part of 2017, Lintstock, an independent advisory firm, carried out an 
evaluation of us, using a questionnaire-based approach which indicated that we were 
doing an effective job. Nevertheless, we have done our own evaluation to identify a few 
areas of focus for 2018 which are set out in the Effectiveness section of this Report.
SAN JULIÁN
During the year, I and two of my fellow Directors had the opportunity to visit San Julián 
which is the first time I have visited a new mine. It is an amazing sight to see when, after 
flying over an impressive mountain range for some time, you see a transformed valley 
below. As it is a new mine, you can see how the mine commenced and from the plans 
you can see its logical development over time. The accommodation, community centre 
and recreational facilities are excellent and we also had a chance to see how the 
Company works positively with the local community. All in all, it is a visit that I will 
remember for a long time as the whole operation is a credit to the hard work of the 
development team to have completed such a large project in a remote location in a 
relatively short time and on budget.

KEY ACTIVITIES IN 2017
• Review of the financial statements and Annual Report for the year ending 31 December 2016.
• Review of the computations for Tax and PTU.
• Review of Payments to Government disclosure.
• Review of interim financial statements for 2017 and Interim Announcement.
• Review of plan for preparing the financial statements and Annual Report for the year ending 31 December 2017.
• Consideration of new accounting standards and their implications for the Company’s financial reporting.
• Consideration of whether any changes were required to the existing accounting policies. 
SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENT AREAS
The Audit Committee spends time ensuring that there is consistency between the policies and judgements used in preparing 
both the full-year and half-year financial statements prior to respectively recommending those financial statements to the 
Board for approval. In conjunction with management and the external auditor, the Audit Committee considers the principal 
areas of audit risk and judgements made in relation to the financial statements which should be considered during its review 
of the financial statements and the external auditors report thereon. In many cases, these significant judgement areas will be 
the same as those considered in previous years; however, as the mining cycle progresses these judgement areas will evolve 
and new ones will need to be considered while others may become less important. This process may be summarised in the 
following way:

SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENT AREAS IN 2017
The significant judgement areas prioritised in 2017 are set out below. In each case, the Audit Committee concluded that the 
accounting treatment and disclosure in the financial statements is appropriate.
MINERAL RESERVES AND RESOURCES (SEE PAGES 274 TO 278)
ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK Reserves and resources are a primary driver of Fresnillo’s market valuation and a 
significant input into calculations of depreciation and assessments of impairment. 
Inaccuracies in the estimation of reserves and resources would lead to broad 
implications across the Annual Report and Accounts.
VARIABLES CONSIDERED The estimation of mineral reserves and resources requires significant judgement, not 
only in respect of mineral physically in place but also metal price and cost assumptions 
used to determine the cut-off grade for identifying economically viable ore bodies. There 
is also judgment in developing and maintaining the mine plans which estimate the 
timing and quantities of related production.
SOURCES OF ASSURANCE The Audit Committee reviewed the report by SRK Consulting (the Company’s independent 
reserves and resources auditor) on the reserves and resources (excluding Silverstream) 
and considered the year-on-year changes in SRK’s estimation of reserves and resources 
quantities. The Audit Committee also considered EY’s evaluation of the competence and 
objectivity of SRK, in the context of financial reporting. 137

SILVERSTREAM CONTRACT (SEE NOTE 14 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS)
ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK The Silverstream contract represents a large asset on our balance sheet which can, 
as a result of movements in variables discussed below, give rise to large, albeit non-
cash, income or expense amounts in our income statement.
VARIABLES CONSIDERED The Silverstream contract is a derivative financial instrument which must be reflected at 
fair value at each balance sheet date. The fair value is most sensitive to the timing and 
volume of forecast production derived from the reserves and resources and production 
profile of the Sabinas mine, estimated future silver price and the discount rate applied 
in the valuation.
SOURCES OF ASSURANCE The Audit Committee reviewed the inputs into the estimation of the valuation at the 
balance sheet date and associated sensitivity analysis. This included management’s 
consideration of a review of the Peñoles reserve and resource estimation process 
performed by SRK in the year (that had been commissioned by Peñoles) and the 
disclosures relating to the Silverstream contract. It discussed with EY their procedures 
for their audit of the valuation and the key assumptions therein.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS INCLUDING REVENUE RECOGNITION (SEE NOTE 27 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS)
ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK Fresnillo has a controlling shareholder and as a result has very strong ties both to  
Peñoles and the broader BAL group. There is a risk that related party relationships could 
be taken advantage of to manipulate earnings or otherwise distort our financial position. 
Furthermore, related party transaction disclosure requirements allow investors to 
understand the Company’s exposure to inappropriate related party transactions and there 
is a risk that disclosures in our financial statements could be inaccurate or incomplete.
VARIABLES CONSIDERED Every year, the Audit Committee scrutinises the probity of all major related party 
transactions to ensure that they are entered into transparently and fairly to all 
shareholders (see the section of this report headed ‘Transactions with Related Parties’). 
The Audit Committee has also considered transfer pricing assessments completed by 
the Group’s external adviser, PricewaterhouseCoopers.
SOURCES OF ASSURANCE The Audit Committee reviewed EY’s procedures to ensure that related party transactions 
are recognised accurately and correctly reported in the relevant disclosures in the 
Annual Report, to ensure that they are consistent with the information it is presented 
with during the year .
TAXATION AND PTU (SEE NOTE 10 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS)
ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK The taxation of mining companies in Mexico has been the subject of much attention and 
governmental action in Mexico. In accordance with the Mexican legislation, local companies 
also pay employee profit sharing (‘PTU’) equivalent to approximately 10% of the taxable 
income of each fiscal year . 
There is a risk that deductions taken when calculating tax and PTU charges may be 
challenged, and that any resulting exposures to payable taxation and PTU may not have been 
provided for appropriately. In addition, certain tax assets and liabilities are denominated in 
Mexican pesos and may be revalued during the period, resulting in foreign exchange gains 
or losses which need to be taken into account when assessing the tax charge for the period.
VARIABLES CONSIDERED The Audit Committee seeks to conclude that the stated charges for PTU and taxation are 
fair and reasonable. It reviews all the significant judgements and adjustments applied  
to accounting profit in determining profit subject to taxation or PTU for each subsidiary 
which are clearly set out in papers prepared by management.
SOURCES OF ASSURANCE Throughout the year the Audit Committee received updates on the status of tax inspections 
and the Company’s progress in meeting the new legislation with respect to contractors’ tax 
compliance. The Audit Committee also challenged management’s detailed memorandum 
and sought EY’s views and ascertained the degree to which such judgements and 
adjustments are supported by internal and/or external subject matter experts and ensured 
that these explanations correspond with information it was presented with during the year 
prior to approving the relevant disclosures in the Annual Report. 138

LICENCES AND LAND TITLE (SEE NOTE 12 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS)
ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK Without good title to land and licences to operate, the Company would be unable to 
operate its mines. Defective title or failure to comply with operating conditions set 
out in the mine licences would give rise to impairment risk.
VARIABLES CONSIDERED The Audit Committee considers whether the Company continues to have a robust 
process to ensure that all required legal documentation is completed correctly on 
acquisition of land titles particularly in light of litigation and ejido activity. The specific 
questions arising from this are: (i) whether there are factors which may give rise to 
asset impairment; (ii) whether the level of legal provisions and narrative disclosures in 
the accounts are adequate; and (iii) whether/when the Group would be able to resume 
operations at Soledad-Dipolos.
SOURCES OF ASSURANCE The Audit Committee has oversight over the progress of the land title review and 
throughout the year has received verbal and written reports from the Company’s 
Head of Legal based on assessments by the Company’s external legal counsel.
ENSURING THAT THE ANNUAL REPORT IS FAIR, BALANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE
There are a number of steps that the Board undertakes to ensure that the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable:
• Management prepares drafts of the Annual Report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017.
• Two weeks prior to the Annual Report being approved by the Board, members of the Audit Committee and other Directors 
review a current draft enabling them to assess whether the information was consistent with their understanding of the 
Company’s business.
• Suggested changes put forward by the Directors, based on knowledge obtained through Board and Audit Committee 
papers and discussion and other interactions with management are taken into account by management in preparing 
the final version of the Annual Report.
• Any Alternative Performance Measures (‘APM’) used in the Annual Report are reviewed by the Audit Committee.
• Internal Audit undertake a review exercise of the non-financial numbers in the Annual Report which are extracted from the 
Company’s operational records.
• The Audit Committee reviews the Annual Report and financial statements and then recommends them to the Board for approval.
As a result of the above procedures, the Board considers that, taken as a whole, the Annual Report is fair, balanced and 
understandable.

EXTERNAL AUDIT CONTINUED
During 2017, the members of the Audit Committee met twice with representatives from EY without management present and 
once with management without representatives of EY present, to ensure that there are no issues in the relationship between 
management and the external auditor which it should address. There were none.
APPOINTMENT OF THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR
In February 2017, the Audit Committee considered and recommended the re-appointment of the external auditor, EY, to the 
Board prior to the Company’s Annual General Meeting. This recommendation was made following a robust tender exercise 
which had been conducted during 2016 (and was outlined in the Audit Committee Report for 2016). EY’s tender in 2016 made 
certain commitments to enhance the quality of the external audit and the Committee have monitored how EY has fulfilled the 
commitments made at that time.
The Audit Partner is Daniel Trotman and he has been the Audit Partner for three years.
EVALUATION OF THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR
The key criteria against which the external audit tenderers were assessed in 2016, and which remain appropriate for the 
assessment of EY, are as follows:
• Experience in mining, with precious metals expertise preferred, in companies of a similar size and complexity.
• London team experienced with FTSE 100 companies and associated regulation and governance supported by local Mexican team.
• Quality of partners in UK and Mexico and quality of their teams, evidenced by firm and external evaluations. Issues from the 
FRC’s Audit Quality Review (AQR) of the firm relevant to audit of Fresnillo and details of internal processes used for quality 
assurance. Quality and experience of other technical resources that may be used on assignments.
• How the audit approach is aligned to Fresnillo’s specific circumstances as set down in detail in their audit plan for the year .
• Communication skills in both written documentation and meetings.
• Expected continuity of team.
• Proposed hours and fees.
• Independence of firm and details of internal practices to ensure continuing compliance with independence requirements 
and freedom from conflicts of interest.
• Co-ordination with parent company management and auditors.
The Audit Committee also reviewed the FRC’s Audit Quality Review on EY as a firm, the FRC having not selected Fresnillo for 
review, and ensured that no findings concerning EYs audit quality were relevant to the audit of Fresnillo plc.
In February 2018, based on the above criteria, and following detailed discussions with management, the Audit Committee 
evaluated the performance of EY in 2017 and concluded that it was appropriate to recommend the re-appointment of EY as 
external auditor at the 2018 Annual General Meeting.
QUALITY AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES POLICY
The Audit Committee is mindful of its responsibility to ensure that the external auditor maintains its independence and objectivity 
and is appropriately qualified with sufficient resources and expertise to fulfil the role. The Audit Committee specifically reviewed, 
and is satisfied with, the independence of EY as the external auditor based on disclosures provided by EY in accordance with UK 
Ethical Standards for the audit profession.
The Audit Committee reviewed its policy for the provision of non-audit services to the Fresnillo Group by the external auditor  
(the ‘Policy’) during the year having updated it in 2016. No further changes were made to the Policy in 2017. The current policy 
permits the engagement of the external auditor to provide statutory audit services, certain assurance, and due diligence services 
where fees are less than US$5,000 to be pre-approved. Any engagement of the external auditor to provide permitted services 
above US$5,000 is subject to the specific approval of the Audit Committee. During 2017, the Audit Committee authorised EY to 
provide the following services under the Policy on the basis that neither piece of work was deemed by the Audit Committee to 
compromise EY’s independence:
(i)  A short deferred tax training session for the Fresnillo financial reporting team in Torréon (US$4,200).
(ii)  Accounting support for the finance team in relation to the application of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 (US$23,500).
(iii) A review of the calculations underpinning the tax methodology in Péru (US$7,000).
In February 2017, EY informed the Audit Committee that there had been a minor breach of the Ethical Standards on non-audit 
services as a result of EY undertaking less than two hours work on tax compliance services in the UK in January 2017. Such 
work was permitted prior to 31 December 2016 and the services had been provided in error . The Audit Committee was 
satisfied that there was no threat to EY’s independence as a result of this matter .
Details of the fees paid to EY during the year as shown in note 28 to the financial statements. 140

• Review of the draft Viability Statement prior to submission to Board for approval. 
RISK
Management continues to build on the existing risk management framework, seeking to enhance risk governance and 
management across the business in line with the changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code. In order to support the 
Board in monitoring the normal risk management activities, the Audit Committee reviewed management’s activities to:
• develop a continuous monitoring process consisting of validating the effectiveness of current controls;
• continue promoting ownership of risk mitigation and associated controls among the process owners at the business unit 
level (being the first line of defence) through their periodic reporting on the effectiveness of controls; and
• ensure that the Group’s corporate values and control culture are embedded throughout the organisation.
These efforts have resulted in a transparent analysis of the operational, financial and executive management controls for each 
of the risks that have been identified by management in its risk universe. A quarterly report is prepared for the Board which 
explains any significant variations in the KRIs and management’s conclusion on the likely effect on the relevant risk ratings 
and/or any modifications in the related controls. This is reviewed by the Audit Committee prior to its submission to the Board.
During 2017, the Audit Committee and Board formally reviewed the Principal Risks and Uncertainties of the Group prior to the 
publication of both the interim and full-year reports.
Further details of the risk management system are set out on page 34.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Company’s objectives and policies on financial risk management including information on the Company’s exposures to 
market risk, such as foreign currency, commodity price, interest rate, inflation rate and equity price risks; credit risk and 
liquidity risk can be found in note 31 to the financial statements.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
In the current year the Audit Committee continued to receive updates on the Group’s IT strategy, its linkage to the Group’s overall 
business strategy and the financial implications of that strategy for the business plan. The Audit Committee has also focused on 
the related risks of cyber security. The Audit Committee was satisfied that progress has been made during the year in each of 
these areas. Further information about the Group’s approach to IT is set out on pages 50 and 51 of the Strategic Report.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Group has in place internal controls and risk management systems in relation to the Group’s financial reporting process 
and the Group’s process for preparing consolidated accounts. These systems include policies and procedures to ensure that 
adequate accounting records are maintained and transactions are recorded accurately and fairly to permit the preparation of 
financial statements in accordance with IFRS. 141

STATEMENTS
During 2017, the Audit Committee has continued to review the quarterly internal control monitoring document which was 
introduced in 2016 and which is prepared and submitted to the Board at each of its regular meetings. This document specifically 
reports on internal controls and the key findings from the quarterly Internal Audit reports.
 
The process agreed by the Audit Committee to monitor the Group’s system of internal controls is focused on improving the 
understanding of how the various sources of assurance (such as operational management, financial management, executive 
management and Internal Audit) interact in the review and execution of material controls identifying and addressing any gaps 
in the control framework. To this end, the Audit Committee, with the assistance of the risk function and management, has 
assessed its approach to monitoring the ongoing effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls. The progress to date 
was reviewed by the Audit Committee in February 2018.
Further control exceptions identified in the current year include those relating to operational safety, compliance with regulations 
for handling hazardous materials and explosives, monitoring of electrical installations, installation of auxiliary services within the 
mine, monitoring and operation of tailings deposits and the oversight over contractors. These issues are not pervasive throughout 
the Group’s operations but each issue has occurred at least at one of the Group’s operating areas and plans for remediation have 
been approved and these are being progressed.
On the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Board agreed that the following statement be made about the review of 
the system of internal control in the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts.
The Board has, through the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee (at its February 2018 meeting), reviewed the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls. As a result of this review, the Board considers that the measures that 
have been or are planned to be implemented complement Fresnillo’s risk management framework and are appropriate to the 
Group’s circumstances.
The Board is committed to the continued development of its internal control regime with a view to achieving and maintaining 
best practice levels of risk management and internal control for international mining companies listed on the London 
Stock Exchange.
GOING CONCERN
The Directors must satisfy themselves as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern for a minimum of 12 months 
from the approval of the financial statements. The Audit Committee supported the Board in this assessment by considering 
whether, in adverse circumstances, the Company has adequate liquid resources to meet its obligations as they fall due.  
In February 2018, the Audit Committee reviewed the Group budget and cash flow forecasts for the period to December 2019, 
taking into account the Company’s anticipated production profiles at each mine, budgeted capital and exploration expenditure 
and the sensitivity of the cashflow forecasts to movements in metal prices.
The Audit Committee also considered EY’s report on this assessment and on the reasonableness of assumptions therein, 
including their consistency with assumptions and estimates used elsewhere in the preparation of the financial statements.  
In particular, the Committee challenged management on the feasibility of the mitigating actions and the potential speed of 
their implementation. As a result of the procedures performed, the Audit Committee satisfied itself that the going concern 
basis of preparation is appropriate and the financial statements appropriately reflect the conclusions on going concern.
LONGER-TERM VIABILITY
Having adopted a robust process in 2015 for the preparation of the initial Viability Statement (which was described in the 
2015 Audit Committee Report), in 2016 the Audit Committee considered with management ways of further enhancing the 
disclosures by including references to contingency planning. The Audit Committee agreed with management that no further 
changes were required in 2017.
The Board’s Going Concern Statement and longer-term Viability Statement are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 48 and 49.  142

INTERNAL AUDIT
KEY ACTIVITIES IN 2017
ANNUALLY • Review Internal Audit Plan and its resourcing for the following year .
• Evaluation of Internal Audit.
TWICE A YEAR • Meeting between the Audit Committee and Internal Audit without management 
present.
EVERY MEETING • Review of significant Internal Audit findings (including progress on red flags) based 
on the audits conducted during the most recent quarter .
The Head of Internal Audit and Internal Audit Manager attend all meetings of the Audit Committee. The Chairman of the Audit 
Committee met separately with them five times during 2017 around the time of each Audit Committee meeting.
The Internal Audit team seeks to complete audits of all the operating risks across all of the Fresnillo Group’s mining assets on a 
regular basis. During the year, the Audit Committee received specific input from Internal Audit to focus on four particular areas:
1. New mines: Following the emphasis on auditing the Company’s new mines which was initiated in 2016, Internal Audit 
completed its examination to ensure that proper procedures were implemented from the beginning in those new operations 
and to ascertain whether there were any lessons to be learned. This work was fundamental to refine methodologies and 
working arrangements between multiple disciplines to provide enhanced transparency to management about operational 
and financial performance throughout the process of building and commissioning new mines.
2. Red flags: At each meeting during the year, the Audit Committee has focused on the progress made by management in 
dealing with ‘red flag’ items raised during internal audit visits to ensure that the management responses to remediation 
are appropriate and timely. Significant progress, which has been monitored by Internal Audit, has been made during the 
year to reduce the number of issues requiring long-term remedial work that remained outstanding at the end of 2017.
3. IT issues: (including cyber security): During 2017, the Audit Committee received presentations from the Head of IT setting 
out the Group IT Strategy for the year and demonstrating how this supports the overall Group Strategy. Within these 
presentations, the Audit Committee considered the steps being taken by management to deal with cyber security threats, 
liaised with Internal Audit to ensure that appropriate controls are, or are planned to be, in place and reviewed the extent to 
which awareness has been raised internally.
4. Data protection: Internal audit monitored the steps being taken to ensure that appropriate levels of procedural compliance 
with the requirements of Mexican data protection legislation are in place. Human Resources has taken over day-to-day 
responsibility for the implementation of the relevant procedures. The Audit Committee understands the steps being taken 
by management to deal with these matters and is satisfied with the progress being made.
In addition, the Audit Committee also monitored the quality of the dialogue between Internal Audit and the Executive Committee 
in reviewing internal audit findings and agreeing action plans with appropriate levels of operational buy-in to deal with the 
points raised. The Audit Committee met with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer several times during  
the year to review the outstanding points and is satisfied with the progress achieved through this dialogue.
The members of the Audit Committee evaluate the performance of the Internal Audit team annually and in 2017 this process 
was facilitated by the Chairman of the Audit Committee who discussed the findings of that review with the Head of Internal 
Audit and Internal Audit Manager and consulted with his colleagues on the Audit Committee before finalising the review.  
When reviewing the Internal Audit Plan for the year, the Audit Committee also considered the personnel available within  
the Internal Audit team, their expertise and experience, to resource their increasing workload. 143

WHISTLEBLOWING
KEY ACTIVITY IN 2017
• Review of whistleblowing cases considered by Honour Commission at each meeting of the Audit Committee.
The ‘Fresnillo Plays Fair’ whistleblower hotline allows stakeholders to anonymously report (via an independent third party) 
violations of the Group’s Code of Conduct. The results are assessed by an independent third party and processed for review  
by the Honour Commission, which comprises the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, the Compliance Officer 
(currently the Chief Financial Officer), the Director of Internal Audit, the Vice President of Exploration and the Legal Manager . 
These arrangements have been established for some time and the Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring that appropriate 
investigation of all whistleblowing incidents is undertaken in a timely manner .
In 2017, there were a total of 46 reports, a 10% decrease over 2016. The Audit Committee continues to view this level as encouraging 
for our efforts to promote a greater understanding of the benefits of reporting issues. The Audit Committee considers that this 
indicates that employees recognise that such reports are valued and investigations are rigorously evaluated. 68% of the 2017 reports 
were actioned in the year with the remainder, having been raised in the latter part of the year, still being under investigation.
Fresnillo plc has a whistleblowing line available for all stakeholders, including employees, third parties and the general public. 
Information regarding this whistleblowing mechanism is widely circulated with access available via our website in the Ethics 
and Culture/Code of Conduct section.
The whistleblowing reports are reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Honour Commission and then presented to the Audit 
Committee. The purpose of the whistleblowing line is to encourage employees and others to raise good faith concerns about 
misconduct that goes or appears to go against the Company’s internal Code of Conduct and our institutional values.
The following table provides a summary of the cases that were received in 2016/2017:
2017 2016
Alleged inappropriate arrangements with suppliers 10 9
Alleged professional negligence 7 4
Alleged theft 7 6

Reports received can be anonymous; all are investigated as to their merits and addressed by the designated area assigned by 
the Compliance Officer in coordination with the Honour Commission. Once an investigation is concluded, results are presented 
to the Honour Commission which decides if any particular necessary action or sanction is required. A summary of such 
actions are presented below:

During 2017, the Audit Committee was satisfied that all matters had been or are being properly investigated with appropriate 
action taken. The Audit Committee considers that current level of issues raised is good evidence that the programme is  
being taken seriously across the Group and is operating satisfactorily, albeit that it was noticed in 2017 that the process of 
investigating issues raised in the cases reported took more time to arrive at the appropriate solution which was the reason 
behind the increased number of cases in progress of investigation over 2016. 144

RELATED PARTIES
Peñoles owns just under 75% of the issued share capital of the Company (see page 148) and therefore has and will continue  
to have a significant level of influence over the affairs and operations of Fresnillo.
Being part of the same Group also provides an opportunity for synergistic benefits to be achieved operationally and 
administratively by combining the resourcing of common services that can be shared between Peñoles and Fresnillo. 
The principal arrangements between the Company and related parties are:
THE SHARED SERVICES AGREEMENT The Shared Services Agreement is an agreement between the Company and Peñoles 
under which 23 categories of services are provided to the Company by Peñoles. The 
Shared Services Agreement was renewed for five years with effect from 31 December 
2012. In order to ensure that Fresnillo is charged appropriately for services rendered by 
Peñoles under the Shared Services Agreement, management has regular meetings with 
Peñoles to discuss its performance against the Key Performance Indicators (‘KPIs’) for 
each of the different categories of service where issues of non-compliance are addressed 
and remediation agreed. In addition, Internal Audit conducts reviews of approximately 
one third of the services provided each year to ensure that these services are provided in 
accordance with the agreed KPIs. As a result, all services are reviewed by Internal Audit 
over a three-year cycle.
During 2017, the Audit Committee reviewed the planning for the renewal of the Shared 
Service Agreement in early 2018. Supported by KPMG, this process seeks to use third 
party benchmarking across all of the service categories covered by the Share Services 
Agreement to ensure that the scope and pricing for each service is appropriate.
The Audit Committee also reviewed the performance of Peñoles in meeting the KPIs for 
the different service categories over the current term of the Shared Services Agreement. 
The Audit Committee is satisfied that appropriate services have been achieved.
The Audit Committee discussed with KPMG their methodology for benchmarking prices 
for each of the 24 separate services now required and their evaluation of all of the prices 
tendered. Their resulting conclusion was a price for 2018, the first year of the new  
five-year Shared Services Agreement, which represented an increase of less than  
10% over 2017, made up from inflation and additional service levels required offset  
by operational efficiencies.
The Audit Committee concluded that the new five-year Shared Services Agreement  
was reasonable in all respects and recommended that the independent Non-executive 
Directors approve its signing by the Company, which they did at the Board meeting in 
February 2018.
THE MET-MEX AGREEMENT During the year, the Audit Committee considered the proposed charges in respect of 
the Met-Mex arrangements for 2017 comparing proposed prices to comparable prices 
charged by Met-Mex to independent customers and to those of other refineries taking 
account of ore composition and transport costs to ensure that they are reasonable. 
Based on the satisfactory outcome of that review, the Chairman of the Audit Committee 
recommended to the Board that the independent Directors approve the proposed 
charges for 2017 under the Met-Mex arrangements, which they did at the Board 
meeting in October 2017.
OTHER AGREEMENTS There are other dealings with related parties in the ordinary course of business 
(e.g. insurance brokerage) which, although not requiring approval by independent 
Directors, will from time-to-time be reviewed by the Audit Committee to ensure 
that the arrangements are on a reasonable arm’s-length basis.
KEY ACTIVITIES IN 2017
• Review of related parties list and payments to key external advisors.
• Review of insurance programme (including the role of related parties in the insurance programme).
• Review of Met-Mex treatment charge and refining charge rates for 2017.
• Review of preparations for the renewal of the Shared Services Agreement in 2018.  145

EFFECTIVENESS
Since the inception of the Audit Committee, there has been a continuing programme of evaluation which has embraced the 
activities of the Committee itself as well as the performances respectively of the external auditor and the Internal Audit function. 
At least once every three years, these reviews have been externally facilitated with internal evaluation exercises undertaken 
during the intervening years. During 2017, there were two key workstreams to this activity: (i) follow-up to the internally-
facilitated evaluation of the Audit Committee undertaken in 2016; and (ii) an externally facilitated review of the Audit Committee 
undertaken by Lintstock as part of its review of the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees.
2016 evaluation follow-up: The internal evaluation in 2016 was facilitated by the Company Secretary, using a questionnaire-
based approach. This was the final step in a three-year process which commenced with the previous external evaluation in 
2014. The conclusions of the 2016 evaluation were that the Audit Committee was satisfied that its core duties were being 
performed well; however, it identified five further areas for review during 2017. The following table shows the progress  
made on those five areas of review during the year:
ACTION PROGRESS
• Review of the Board’s post-investment review procedures. • A new format for reporting to the Board on post-
investment appraisal was presented to the Board 
at its July meeting.
• Oversight of management’s evaluation of the Shared 
Services Agreement as it approaches its renewal date.
• A presentation on the process and metrics for the 
renewal of the Shared Services Agreement was 
presented at the February 2018 meeting of the 
Committee with the Agreement being presented  
to the Board for approval by the Independent Non-
executive Directors in February 2018.
• Oversight of the IT Governance Committee in relation 
to the management of the IT strategy and IT-related 
internal controls and the liaison with Internal Audit.
• The Audit Committee has received presentations from 
the Head of IT on the IT Strategy and its interface with 
the Company’s Business Plan and Strategy. The Audit 
Committee Chairman has attended numerous meetings 
with IT personnel to oversee the production of detailed 
plans and timelines to deliver the IT requirements of the 
Company’s Business Plan. The role of the IT Governance 
Committee in overseeing the IT Strategy was reviewed 
and progress noted.
• The interface between the Audit Committee, Internal 
Audit and the HSECR Committee in relation to internal 
audit findings relating to health, safety and environmental 
matters.
• Early in 2017, we decided to combine these two actions 
to better reflect management’s efforts to rationalise the 
various elements of non-financial information into a 
more coherent structure. The Audit Committee has 
overseen this work and liaised with Internal Audit to 
ensure that any data required from operational records 
is sourced appropriately.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
CONTINUED
EFFECTIVENESS CONTINUED
2017 external evaluation follow-up: The 2017 evaluation of the Committee by Lintstock used a questionnaire-based 
approach. Lintstock concluded from the completed questionnaires that the management of Audit Committee meetings,  
in terms of the annual cycle of work, the meeting agendas and supporting documentation and the time and input during 
meetings, was highly rated, and that the Committee functioned effectively and no areas for improvement were noted. 
Nevertheless, the Audit Committee, from its own evaluation, identified that there were areas which warranted further  
review in 2018.
• Oversight to ensure that the lessons learnt from the post-investment appraisal exercise in 2017 are correctly reflected in 
management’s methodologies for new projects.
• Continued liaison with the IT Governance Committee over the development of IT-related internal controls and the 
interaction with Internal Audit.
• Oversight of the development of performance indicators on non-financial information and the related work by Internal Audit.
• Continued liaison with management over progress on the various outstanding matters with the Mexican tax authorities.
NEXT STEPS
The Audit Committee intends to undertake an externally-facilitated evaluation of the Internal Audit function during 2018. It will 
conduct an internal review of its own effectiveness in 2018. 147

2018 ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The Company’s tenth Annual General Meeting will be held on Wednesday 30 May 2018 at 12.00 noon. The business of the 
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) will be conducted in accordance with the provisions B.7.1, B.7.2, E.2.1 and E.2.2 of the Code. 
The Chairman of the Board and the chairmen of each of the Board Committees will be available to answer questions put 
forward to them by shareholders of the Company. The Annual Report and Accounts and the Notice of the Annual General 
Meeting will be sent to shareholders at least 20 working days prior to the date of the meeting. In planning the business of  
each AGM, the Board takes account of institutional shareholder guidelines on pre-emption rights, share buy-backs and 
shareholder rights in relation to general meetings when drafting the usual resolutions dealing with those matters. In each 
case, resolutions are presented to the AGM to give the Board flexibility to respond to market developments.
AUTHORITY TO PURCHASE OWN SHARES
The Company was authorised by a shareholders’ resolution passed at the Annual General Meeting held in May 2017 to purchase 
up to 10% of its issued Ordinary Share capital. Any shares which have been bought back may be held as treasury shares or, if 
not so held, must be cancelled immediately upon completion of the purchase, thereby reducing the amount of the Company’s 
issued and authorised share capital. This authority will expire at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and a resolution to 
renew the authority for a further year will be proposed. No shares were purchased by the Company during the year .

COMPONENTS OF DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION 
HOW IS THE REMUNERATION POLICY ACHIEVED? 
COMPONENT RATIONALE
SALARY Setting base salary levels for Executive Directors or key management at an appropriate 
level is key to managerial retention in Mexico. Salaries are positioned within the range 
according to experience and length of service.
Ordinarily, the same basis for change (e.g. salary increases) will be applied 
across the Company to senior management and employees alike. 
BONUS The annual bonus rewards the achievement of financial and strategic business targets 
and the delivery of personal objectives. Annual bonus is capped at six months’ salary 
and is paid on the basis of metrics set out in the remuneration policy. 
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES The annual bonus scheme sets targets which are aligned to the long-term strategic 
objectives so that these priorities are embedded within the day-to-day activities of 
our business rather than being seen as something extra. 
BENEFITS Benefits are provided in line with the Group’s policy on employee benefits. 
PENSION The Group operates a defined contribution scheme. Executive Directors and key 
management are entitled to membership of the defined contribution scheme. 
SHARES The Company does not use share-based forms of remuneration because this 
continues not to be a common form of remuneration in Mexico. 
Additional features of Fresnillo’s Remuneration Policy
SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES In the absence of share-based incentive schemes, there is no need to adopt shareholding 
guidelines for executives. 
RECOVERY OF BONUS 
(MALUS/CLAW-BACK)
The absence of long-term incentives makes it difficult to adopt claw-back and malus 
arrangements. There is however scope within the bonus scheme for bonus awards to  
be adjusted downward at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
REMUNERATION POLICY OBJECTIVE
WHAT DOES THE POLICY SEEK TO ACHIEVE?
The Group’s remuneration policy seeks to ensure that the Company is able to attract, retain and motivate its Executive 
Directors and members of the Executive Committee. The retention of key management and the alignment of management 
incentives to the creation of shareholder value being key objectives of this policy.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
CHAIRMAN’S ANNUAL STATEMENT
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
I am pleased to take this opportunity to give you an overview of the work of the Remuneration Committee 
during 2017.
The most important job for the Remuneration Committee in 2017 was the renewal of our Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy at the Annual General Meeting in May. We proposed a few minor amendments to the Policy which were 
favourably received and I am delighted that our independent shareholders overwhelmingly supported the renewal 
of the Policy. My Remuneration Committee colleagues and I welcome shareholders’ endorsement of the Policy. 
Having received such strong support for our approach to executive remuneration, we will continue to work hard 
to ensure that our approach remains the most appropriate one to serve the long-term interests of the Company. 
During the year Fernando Ruiz, who had served on the Committee from its inception in 2008, stepped down from the 
Committee. Fernando’s contribution to the Committee over the past nine years has been greatly appreciated by his 
colleagues and we thank him wholeheartedly for his commitment and support during that time. I am delighted to 
welcome Jaime Serra, an independent Non-executive Director, to the Committee and look forward to working with him.
In commenting on the activities of the Remuneration Committee during the year, I would like to highlight the time 
and attention that the Committee devoted to first, ensuring that executive remuneration is aligned to remuneration 
trends across the Group and second, ensuring that remuneration promotes the long-term interests of the 
Company. In reviewing the Chief Executive Officer’s salary each year, the Remuneration Committee takes account 
of the salary increases agreed for the whole workforce as well as other actuarial benchmark data on salaries.  
In 2017, the CEO was awarded a 3.5% increase in salary compared to an average benchmark increase of 4.61%.  
In determining this level of increase, the Remuneration Committee took account of previous increases in salary 
awarded to the Chief Executive Officer . The Committee also received periodic benchmarking data from Willis 
Towers Watson, as required by the Remuneration Policy, which confirmed that the CEO’s total remuneration 
remains well inside the parameters set in the Policy. While the CEO participates in a bonus scheme which  
is modest by any FTSE 100-listed company standard, he is not permitted by Mexican law to participate  
in the PTU scheme, the statutory employee profit-sharing arrangement which is available to all other 
Mexican employees and which has the potential to pay annual bonuses which are a significantly 
higher proportion of salary than the annual bonus scheme for the CEO. The CEO also participates  
in the same pension scheme arrangements as all other employees. The Remuneration Committee 
therefore believes that the CEO’s remuneration is well aligned to that of the workforce as a whole. 
Prior to the 2017 AGM, the Remuneration Committee spent time considering whether any changes 
were needed to the Remuneration Policy and concluded that while some minor amendments  
would be appropriate, for example, in relation to the exercise of discretion, the overall approach  
was correct. Nevertheless, the Remuneration Committee revisited the question of whether long-
term incentives should be introduced into the Policy. This requirement was discussed with advisers 
and it was concluded that there was no need to introduce longer-term incentives at this time. The 
reasons for this are twofold. Firstly the Committee is satisfied that the annual cash bonus 
scheme contains sufficient elements and incentives to ensure that the Group is sustainable 
over the long-term. In particular, the high proportion of bonus paid for replenishment of 
reserves and resources and delivery of growth projects as well as the penalties in place  
for unhealthy, unsafe and environmentally unfriendly practices are designed to focus 
executive attention on the long-term viability of the Company as well as short-term 
performance. Second, we have always maintained that long-term incentives are not a key 
feature of remuneration within the Mexican market and we have been consistent on that 
since we listed in London back in 2008. During the year, we asked Willis Towers Watson 
to evaluate that assumption and while there is some anecdotal evidence that long-term 
incentives are beginning to emerge as a feature of remuneration in Mexico, we are yet  
to be convinced that our Remuneration Policy needs to be changed. We will continue  
to monitor this aspect between now and the next renewal of our Policy in 2020.
The activities of the Remuneration Committee are described in more detail in the 
following sections of this Report. Staying in line with our previous approach to 
remuneration reporting, we have published remuneration information in respect  
of our Chief Executive Officer as if he were a member of the Board, even though  
that is not currently the case. We believe this is within the spirit of our reporting 
obligations, even if it is not strictly required, as it adds to the transparency of our 
reporting. As ever, I am always interested to hear the views of shareholders on  
our approach to executive remuneration.
Yours faithfully

1 The points weighting is considered by the Remuneration Committee each year to ensure that it reflects an appropriate balance of priorities for management. Where a 
change of emphasis is considered to be necessary, the weighting will be amended in future years.
2 Any decrease in equivalent ounces produced and/or in reserves and resources will result in points being deducted from the total points scored in proportion to the level  
of the shortfall compared to the previous year . Production excludes amounts from the Silverstream contract and is compared against budget for the year . Total resources 
includes 100% of all of the resource estimates at the Group’s controlled mines, irrespective of ownership.
3 Net profit is adjusted to exclude currency fluctuation, the effect of year-on-year changes in metals prices and any revaluation of the Silverstream contract. The 2017 net 
profit amount for the purposes of the 2017 annual bonus was in line with this approach. A table setting out the reconciliation of net profit to the numbers reported in the 
financial statements is set out on page 155. The target is set as the prior year profit, excluding the revaluation of the Silverstream contract, the mark-to-market revaluation 
of derivatives and foreign exchange gains/losses in the prior year .
4 The points awarded for the stakeholder and teamwork objectives are subject to some discretion. The following points are awarded depending on the Remuneration 
Committee’s assessment of the stakeholder and teamwork effort: Satisfactory performance = 100% of weighting points; outstanding performance = 140% of weighting 
points; and underperformance = 0 points.
5 In the event of a single fatality, zero points will be awarded for safety. For the purposes of calculating fatalities; all fatalities are included, irrespective of whether they are 
employees or contractors. Conversely, in the event of zero fatalities during the year, the number of points awarded would be increased to ten points.
6 In addition to the penalty for a single fatality (see note 5), the number of points awarded will be further reduced by 1% if there are two fatalities, or by 2% if there are three 
fatalities, or by 3% if there are four fatalities etc.
7 In the event of an environmental incident, the total bonus score will be reduced by 2%, in the case of two incidents, a further 3% will be deducted. In the case of three 
incidents, a further 4% and so on.
8 Under the current Remuneration Policy, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to make adjustments to bonus payments (see section headed Discretion in the table 
on page 163). 155

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER SALARY AND BENEFITS
The total remuneration paid to the Chief Executive Officer, Octavio Alvídrez, during the year was US$1,072,113.
During the year, Mr Alvídrez served as Chief Executive Officer but was not a member of the Board. Mr Alvídrez is employed 
under a contract of employment with Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo S.A. de C.V., a subsidiary of Fresnillo plc. Mr Alvídrez’ 
contract was entered into on 15 August 2012 and is governed by Mexican Federal Labour Law. Mr Alvídrez’ service agreement 
does not have a fixed term and can be terminated in writing by either party. There is no provision in Mr Alvídrez’ service 
agreement entitling him to additional compensation for termination other than those required by Mexican labour laws for 
termination without cause. No benefits are payable on termination.
The salary payable under Mr Alvídrez’ service agreement is MX$930,154 per month, which excludes payments for holidays, 
Company-paid savings contributions and other cash benefits. In 2017, his total salary payments were MX$15,322,731 
(US$809,480). In 2016, his total salary payments were MX$14,780,860 (US$792,255). In 2017, Mr Alvídrez was awarded a salary 
increase of 3.5%. The percentage level of salary increases for employees during the year was an average of 5.75%. As required 
by the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, Willis Towers Watson have confirmed that the Chief Executive Officer’s remuneration 
remains in line with the remuneration policy.
Under his service agreement, Mr Alvídrez is entitled to 26 working days’ paid holiday per year . He is not entitled to profit-
sharing (‘PTU’). Mr Alvídrez is also entitled to life insurance, the use of a chauffeur and company car, the payment of medical 
insurance premiums covering limited expenses and check-ups, meals and subsistence payments and club subscriptions.
The Remuneration Committee consider that year-on-year changes to the remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer align 
equitably with changes in the remuneration of the Company’s workforce for the following reasons:
Salary The Remuneration Committee ordinarily use the same percentage agreed for the whole workforce  
as the percentage basis for the annual salary increase for the Chief Executive Officer .
Bonus The Chief Executive is prohibited from participating in the PTU scheme and therefore may only receive 
a maximum of six months’ pay. All other employees are eligible for PTU payments annually which can 
be as high as 200% of salary in exceptional years.
Benefits The Chief Executive Officer participates in the Company-wide benefits scheme.
Pension The Chief Executive Officer is a member of the Company’s standard pension scheme. 157

ANNUAL BONUS
Mr Alvídrez achieved 101.0 points under the bonus scheme for the year ended 31 December 2017 (2016: 109.5 points) and 
therefore was awarded a bonus of MX$1,860,308; (US$98,278) for 2017.
PENSIONS
The Group operates two pension schemes: a defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme (which was introduced 
on 1 July 2007). Further information on the Group’s pension schemes is set out in the Remuneration Policy on page 164.
MALUS AND CLAW-BACK
The introduction of the 2016 UK Corporate Governance Code requires companies to either introduce malus and/or claw-back 
provisions and other forms of deferred variable pay where appropriate, or explain why they have not complied with the Code. 
The Remuneration Policy approved at the 2017 AGM gives the Remuneration Committee discretion to reduce bonus payments 
to take account of poor operational or financial performance during the year or in relation to previous years. Downward 
adjustment would also be considered where the executive response to adverse health, safety or environmental performance 
during the year was considered to be poor . Such discretion would be applied after any adjustments in relation to safety and 
environmental performance had already been deducted under the annual bonus plan see page 165 in the Directors’ 
remuneration policy section.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY IN 2017 AND 2018
The Remuneration Committee established the peer group of companies for the purposes of validating the remuneration of 
Executive Directors and senior management (the ‘Peer Group’). The Peer Group consists of 11 resources companies from 
Europe (three companies), USA and Canada (six companies) and Mexico (two companies) as follows:
Europe Randgold Resources
Acacia Mining
Hochschild Mining
USA/Canada Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd
Goldcorp Inc.
Hecla Mining Co.
Newmont Mining Corporation
Panamerican Silver Corp.
Yamana Gold Inc.
Mexico Goldcorp
Grupo Mexico
The Remuneration Committee has agreed that the Chief Executive’s salary should be set within a range of 25-75% of the Peer 
Group for base salary. In 2017, Willis Towers Watson advised the Remuneration Committee that the CEO’s salary remains well 
within the parameters set out in the remuneration policy.
The Remuneration Committee has considered the effectiveness of key performance indicators (‘KPIs’) and targets that were 
set for 2017 and it continues to consider that the overall structure of the Incentive Plan and the targets set in 2017 remain 
appropriate for 2018 other than where adjusted to reflect the 2018 business plan targets. The Remuneration Committee  
has also, with effect from 2018, introduced a cap on each of the KPIs (other than the Safety KPI) such that the points awarded 
on any KPI (other than Safety) cannot exceed 135% of the target set for that KPI at the beginning of the year . Under the 
Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders in 2017, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to amend bonuses in 
certain circumstances (as set out in the Policy). Such discretion is unaffected by this cap. The 2018 weightings and measures 
are therefore set out in the table below. The 2018 targets and performance against those targets will be disclosed in next 
year’s report. 158

2 Any decrease in equivalent ounces produced and/or in reserves and resources will result in points being deducted from the total points scored.
3 Net profit is adjusted to exclude currency fluctuation, the effect of year-on-year changes in metals prices and any revaluation of the Silverstream contract.
4 The points awarded for the stakeholder and teamwork objectives are subject to some discretion. The following points are awarded depending on the Remuneration 
Committee’s assessment of the teamwork effort: Outstanding = 7 points; Satisfactory = 5 points; Underperformance = 0 points.
5 In the event of a single fatality, zero points will be awarded for safety. For the purposes of calculating fatalities; all fatalities are included, irrespective of whether they are 
employees or contractors. Conversely, in the event of zero fatalities during the year, the number of points awarded would be increased to ten points.
6 In addition, to the penalty for a single fatality (see note 5), the number of points awarded will be further reduced by 1% if there are two fatalities. From the remaining total 
score, an additional 2% will be deducted if there are three fatalities. In the case of four fatal accidents, an additional 3% will be deducted from the remaining total score  
and so on for further fatalities.
7 A further adjustment was introduced in 2017 for environmental incidents. In the event of an environmental incident, the total bonus score will be reduced by 2%. In the 
case of two incidents, a further 3% will be deducted. In the case of three incidents a further 4% will be deducted and so on.
8 Under the Remuneration Policy approved at the 2017 AGM, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to make adjustments to bonus payments in circumstances set  
out in the section headed Discretion in the table on page 163.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
ROLE
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for making recommendations to the Board on the Group’s remuneration 
policy for Executive Directors and senior management (the Chief Executive Officer and other members of the Executive 
Committee), and for determining specific remuneration packages for senior management, including pension rights and  
any compensation packages, as well as remuneration of the Chairman within agreed terms of reference.
MEMBERSHIP
The Remuneration Committee consisted of the following Directors as at 31 December 2017:
• Mr Charles Jacobs (Chairman), independent Non-executive Director
• Mr Alberto Baillères, Chairman of the Board
• Mr Jaime Serra, independent Non-executive Director
Mr Serra was appointed a member of the Remuneration Committee on 23 May 2017. Mr Fernando Ruiz, independent  
Non-executive Director, was a member of the Remuneration Committee until he stepped down on 23 May 2017.
Although the UK Corporate Governance Code states the need for the Remuneration Committee to be made up of independent 
Non-executive Directors, the Board believe that it is vital that the membership of the Committee is made up of Non-executive 
Directors who are able to bring the following perspectives to the working of the Remuneration Committee:
• An understanding of shareholder expectations.
• An understanding of the evolving remuneration expectations of investors on the London Stock Exchange.
• An understanding of the general approaches to remuneration within the Mexican market. 159

The current composition of the Remuneration Committee is considered to be appropriate. Although Mr Baillères was non-
independent at the time of his appointment to the Board (and therefore his membership of the Remuneration Committee  
does not comply with Code Provision D.2.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code), the Board continues to uphold the view  
that Mr Baillères’ experience and knowledge of the Group and the Mexican market and his considerable contribution to the 
Remuneration Committee’s deliberations justifies his membership of the Remuneration Committee.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE ACTIVITY DURING 2017
During the year, the Committee met three times. Its key activities during the year were:
• Approval of and recommendation of changes to the Remuneration Policy to the Board for approval prior to inclusion in the 
business of the 2017 for shareholder approval.
• Receipt of reports from Willis Towers Watson concerning the benchmarking of remuneration for members of the Executive 
Committee and Executive Directors, by reference to the peer group.
• Consideration of information about Mexican inflation trends and internal employee salary reviews prior to setting the 
annual salary increases for the Chief Executive Officer and members of the Executive Committee.
• Receipt of a report from Willis Towers Watson concerning developments in market practice in Mexico in relation to long-
term/share-based incentives.
• Review of the Non-executive Directors’ fees.
• Review of the performance of the Chief Executive Officer and members of the Executive Committee compared to the KPIs 
set for 2016 and approval of annual bonus awards for 2016 based on achievement of KPI targets.
• Review of KPI targets for the Chief Executive Officer and members of the Executive Committee for 2017, including 
consideration of the effectiveness of changes to the targets to reward better performance in safety improvement and 
exploration efforts set the previous year .
• Receipt of reports from the Company Secretary on UK regulatory developments in relation to executive remuneration.
• Other activities, e.g. Committee evaluation, as required by the Committee’s terms of reference and review of the terms  
of reference of the Committee.
The terms of reference for the Remuneration Committee have been approved by the Board and are available on the Company’s 
website at www.fresnilloplc.com.
ADVISORS TO THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Remuneration consultants are engaged by Group companies to provide benchmarking information on remuneration but not to 
provide guidance on the structure of remuneration. All of the consultants that the Group uses are independent of the Company. 
No remuneration consultants are directly engaged by the Remuneration Committee itself.
Benchmarking information on pay and employment conditions is supplied annually by Mercer, Hay Group and Data Compensation. 
The information provided is used across the Group in determining salaries for all employee grades including senior management. 
While the Remuneration Committee takes such information into account when considering executive remuneration, none of these 
advisors are considered to materially assist the Remuneration Committee in the performance of its duties.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee receives specific reports comparing the remuneration of the members of the 
Executive Committee to international benchmarks. Willis Towers Watson have advised the Remuneration Committee in 
relation to the establishment of the peer group and the provision of benchmarking information showing the position of the 
remuneration, and particularly the salaries, of members of the Executive Committee in relation to the peer group. Willis 
Towers Watson provide general advice and benchmarking information to the Group concerning executive remuneration and 
during 2017, the Group paid Willis Towers Watson US$20,735 (2016: US$nil).
The Company Secretary ensures that the Remuneration Committee fulfils its duties under its terms of reference and provides 
regular updates to the Remuneration Committee on relevant regulatory developments in the UK.
The Group Human Resources Department provides information on Mexican market trends and compensation structures for 
the broader employee population in the Fresnillo Group. 160

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
APPENDIX: DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
INTRODUCTION
This part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policy of the Company and has been prepared in 
accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 
(‘the Regulations’). The policy has been developed taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 
and the views of our major shareholders. It describes the policy to be applied for the financial year ending 31 December 2017 
and beyond. The remuneration policy was put to a vote at the 2017 Annual General Meeting and overwhelmingly approved. The 
effective date of the policy is therefore the date of the 2017 Annual General Meeting of the Company, 23 May 2017. As required 
by UK law, the remuneration policy is binding in relation to Directors. The Company currently has no Executive Directors who 
would be bound by the remuneration policy. However, the Company will (as it has previously done) treat the Chief Executive 
Officer as if he were an Executive Director for the purposes of the remuneration policy and for reporting on his remuneration.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Group’s remuneration policy seeks to ensure that the Company is able to attract, retain and motivate its Executive 
Directors and members of the Executive Committee. The retention of key management and the alignment of management 
incentives and the creation of shareholder value being key objectives of this policy.
Setting base salaries for Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee at an appropriate level is a key to 
managerial retention in Mexico. Therefore, the Remuneration Committee seeks to ensure that salaries are market competitive 
both within the Mexican context and internationally for comparable companies. Total compensation is set within a range around 
the median level for the Company’s peer group within Mexico and internationally, total remuneration is benchmarked triennially 
to ensure that the whole remuneration package is maintained at this level over the long term. Salaries are positioned within the 
range according to experience and service.
The table below sets out the key elements of Executive Directors’ pay set out in the remuneration policy (the ‘Policy Table’):
 
BASE SALARY
PROVIDES THE CORE REWARD FOR THE ROLE
Operation Reviewed annually and fixed for 12 months starting on 1 April each year and the review is influenced by:
• Role, experience and performance.
• Average workforce salary adjustments.
• Mexican economic factors.
• Comparison with the Company’s peer group in Mexico and internationally.
Salaries are benchmarked triennially by reference to companies of similar size and complexity and will 
be positioned within a mid-range of the Company’s comparator peer group in Mexico and internationally. 
The next review will take place in April 2019.
Maximum value The Executive Director’s salary will be reviewed taking account of the benchmarking information 
received by the Remuneration Committee and the maximum value of the Executive Director’s base 
salary will be positioned within the mid-range for companies in the peer group of Mexican and 
international resources companies. An Executive Director’s salary will be increased in line with 
increases applied across the whole workforce. In exceptional circumstances, the Executive Director’s 
salary may be increased by up to but never more than 10% above the average pay increase for the 
whole workforce of the Company in any year . The rationale for such increases will be fully explained 
in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Performance metric The Remuneration Committee considers individual salaries at the appropriate meeting each year 
by reference to the factors noted under the ‘Operation’ heading in this table. Details of the current 
remuneration of the Executive Director are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Discretion The Remuneration Committee will establish the Company’s comparator peer group in Mexico and 
internationally as part of the triennial review which it will consider in April 2019. The peer group will 
be reviewed again in April 2019. The Committee will report on the outcome of these reviews within the 
relevant Annual Report on Remuneration.

ANNUAL BONUS
REWARDS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF BOTH SHORT AND LONG-TERM FINANCIAL AND STRATEGIC BUSINESS TARGETS AND DELIVERY 
OF PERSONAL OBJECTIVES
Operation Targets are renewed annually and relate to the strategic aims of the business as a whole. A scoring 
system is used for the plan. Each objective set for the executive at the beginning of the year is allocated 
a points-rating which represents a median performance target for that objective. Upper and lower 
point thresholds are set to allow for outstanding performance and to ensure that underperformance 
is not rewarded. For each member of the Executive Committee (including the Chief Executive Officer, 
the Chief Financial Officer, the Vice President of Exploration and the Chief Operating Officer), a bonus  
is only payable if the aggregate performance equals or exceeds 100 points. Bonus payments are paid 
for aggregate performance against target at or above 100 points as follows:
Points Variable pay (month’s salary) Variable pay (% of salary)
Less than 100 Zero Zero
100.00–103.75 Two 16.67
103.76–107.50 Three 25.00
107.51–111.00 Four 33.33
111.01–115.00 Five 41.67
115.01+ Six 50.00
Maximum value The maximum percentage of salary is 50% (six months’ salary) and is paid where Executive Directors 
achieve 115.01 points or more under the Annual Bonus Plan (the target is 100 points).
Performance metric The KPI targets set out in the previous table will apply and are intended to focus on risks that are 
within the control and influence of management. Thus, the management of safety, security, project, 
human resource, exploration and environmental risks are all currently implicitly covered within the 
KPIs. The KPIs and targets, which are set by reference to the reserved and resources and financial 
metrics at the previous year end and/or set in the budget for the forthcoming financial year are also 
designed to ensure that both short-term objectives and the long-term development of the Fresnillo 
Group are given equal priority.
Details of the measures, targets and performance which is tested on an annual basis will be 
provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Discretion The Remuneration Committee considers that the KPIs, upon which bonuses are based, may need to 
evolve from year-to-year in line with the strategy and therefore it retains the discretion to make modest 
adjustments to the KPIs themselves, the bonus bands within the overall maximum and the individual 
KPI weightings from year-to-year .
The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to adjust bonus payments in the following 
circumstances:
(i)   A downward adjustment where the KPI outcomes would result, in the opinion of the Remuneration 
Committee, in a bonus payment which cannot be justified by the Company’s financial or 
operational performance during the year (or subsequently in respect of previous years). In this 
case a downward adjustment would be applied.
(ii)   Where factors outside the control of Executive Directors e.g. force majeure circumstances have 
significantly depressed the level of points awarded. In deciding whether adjustment is merited, the 
Remuneration Committee will consider the appropriateness of the Executive Director’s response 
to those circumstances; in this situation a modest upward adjustment may be considered.
(iii)  Poor executive response to adverse health, safety or environmental performance during the 
year, in which case a downward adjustment would be considered.
  The use of any such discretions will be fully explained in future Directors’ Remuneration Reports.
Note: Any adjustment in individual KPI weightings will not result in their achievement being any less difficult to satisfy.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
APPENDIX: DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY (CONTINUED)
BENEFITS
HELP RECRUIT AND RETAIN EMPLOYEES
Operation An Executive Director would be entitled to life insurance, the use of a company car, the payment of 
premiums for medical insurance covering limited expenses and check-ups. Benefits may be changed 
if Company policy on benefits changes.
Maximum value The current benefits are set out in the Annual Remuneration Report. The maximum value of benefits 
will be determined by Company policy that is applicable to all employees.
Performance metric None.
Discretion The Remuneration Committee may consider changes to the benefits made available to Executive 
Directors in line with any changes in the policy for benefits provided to all employees.
PENSION
REWARDS CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT AND SUSTAINED CONTRIBUTION
Operation The Group operates a defined contribution scheme. Executive Directors are entitled to membership 
of the defined contribution scheme.
Maximum value The maximum Company contribution for any employee may not exceed 13% of salary.
Performance metric None.
Discretion Not applicable.
ALIGNMENT OF EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION AND THE MARKET
In setting the fixed remuneration of Executive Directors and the members of the Executive Committee, information relating  
to the mining company comparators is provided by various consultants. Information relating to the Mexican economic metrics 
and internal benchmarking is collated by management for the Remuneration Committee to consider .
Reviews are conducted by Willis Towers Watson triennially. These enable the Remuneration Committee to validate the Company’s 
policy towards remuneration and ensure that it is globally as well as locally competitive. The analysis evaluates the elements of 
base salary, short-term compensation (guaranteed payments and short-term bonus) and long-term compensation (primarily 
stock programmes) separately. With assistance from Willis Towers Watson, the Remuneration Committee has established a 
peer group which will be used to benchmark any Executive Director’s and any Executive Committee member’s remuneration  
to ensure that it remains within the parameters set out in this policy (see page 157 of the Annual Report on Remuneration).
COMPARISON OF EXECUTIVE AND WIDER COMPANY REMUNERATION
When setting pay and benefits for Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee, the Remuneration Committee 
takes account of pay and conditions across the Group. It will consider the overall pay increase percentage negotiated with 
employee representatives as its starting point. Subject to the 10% limit in the Policy Table, the Remuneration Committee may 
agree pay increases above or below the agreed percentage in exceptional circumstances, where in its discretion it considers such 
variance to the norm to be justified. Other than the Willis Towers Watson report specifically commissioned by the Remuneration 
Committee, the same benchmark reports are used in the evaluation of executive and employee remuneration, thus providing a 
common approach to both.
Below Board level, a statutory profit-sharing arrangement (‘PTU’) is operated which in some years has enabled employees to 
receive significant levels of bonus in line with the increased profitability of the relevant employing company. Neither the Chief 
Executive Officer nor any of the Non-executive Directors participate in a PTU scheme within the Fresnillo Group. The other 
members of senior management group below Board level are employed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo S.A. de C.V., 
which pays annual PTU payments. However, such payments are modest.
The Group operates two pension schemes: (i) a defined benefit scheme which was closed to new members on 1 July 2007 with 
benefits frozen at this date for existing members, subject to indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer Price 
Index; and (ii) a defined contribution scheme (which was introduced on 1 July 2007). Membership of the latter scheme is voluntary, 
members earning a salary of no more than 25 times the minimum wage in force from time to time may make contributions of 5% 
to the scheme.
On behalf of members earning a salary of no more than 25 times the minimum wage in force from time to time the employing 
company may make contributions of 5% to the scheme. The employing company may also make additional contributions 
between 5-8% of salary to this plan. Members may elect to match percentages between 5% to 8% of salary.
Executive Directors may participate the Group’s pension schemes on the same basis as any other employee. 165

STATEMENTS
ENGAGEMENT WITH SHAREHOLDERS ON REMUNERATION
The composition of the Remuneration Committee has been designed to ensure that the views of the controlling shareholder 
(through the membership of the Chairman of the Board on the Committee) and the independent shareholders (through the 
membership of a UK-based Director on the Committee) can be represented. The Remuneration Committee has considered 
the views of organisations such as Institutional Shareholder Services (‘ISS’) and the Investment Association both generally  
and as reported to the Company in relation to its own executive remuneration practices prior to each Annual General Meeting, 
when considering the Remuneration Policy and its application. The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee also discussed 
aspects of the Remuneration Policy in person with ISS, and there were no major concerns raised.
The Remuneration Committee does not consult with employees in setting Directors’ remuneration.
POLICY ON RECRUITMENT
The Remuneration Committee will consider the remuneration of new Executive Directors by reference to the remuneration 
policy set out previously. The Remuneration Committee does not as a default position pay sign-on payments or compensate 
new Directors for any variable remuneration forfeited from any employment prior to joining the Board. If it did, such payments 
would be fully explained in the next Annual Report on Remuneration both as to the reason for payment and the rationale for the 
quantum. Salary will be set so as to be market competitive both within the Mexican context and internationally for comparable 
companies and taking account of the experience and seniority of the appointee coming into the new role. The Remuneration 
Committee is likely to set base salaries below median on appointment while retaining discretion to award increases during the 
first and, possibly, subsequent years to bring salaries into the normal range expected for Executive Directors, in line with the 
Company’s stated policy. Such increases will not exceed the maximum level set out in the Policy Table. New Executive Directors 
will receive benefits and pensions in line with the Company’s existing policy and will be able to participate in the Annual Bonus 
Plan on a pro-rated basis for the portion of the financial year for which they are in post. The maximum level of variable pay for 
new recruits will be the same as that set out in the Policy Table for existing employees (pro-rated as necessary).
POLICY ON LOSS OF OFFICE
Other than in circumstances of gross misconduct, Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee, including 
the Chief Executive Officer, leaving employment from the Group, will be entitled to receive salary and pro-rated annual bonus 
based on performance to the date of leaving. Statutory entitlements are payable according to Mexican labour law, based on 
length of service. Mexican labour law does not make any provision for employers and employees to give or receive notice of 
termination of employment. Therefore the Committee will not make payments in lieu of notice to departing executives unless 
required to do so by law. No contractual commitments concerning loss of office were entered into with any Director prior to 
27 June 2012.
ANNUAL BONUS PLAN AND POLICY ON VARIABLE REMUNERATION
It is the Company’s policy not to use its equity to incentivise long-term performance. The Company’s core strategy is one of 
long-term sustainable growth. Sustainable growth in mining requires the steady and safe expansion of the Group’s operations 
through the discovery of new resources and construction, maintenance and/or expansion of new mines. No distinction is 
therefore made between short and long-term incentives.
The Company operates a single cash-based incentive plan for Executive Directors and the members of the Executive 
Committee, including the Chief Executive Officer .
MALUS AND CLAW-BACK
The Remuneration Committee has considered whether malus and/or claw-back provisions should be incorporated into the 
service agreement for the Chief Executive Officer . Given that the Company does not operate any remuneration plans with a 
timeframe of more than one year, the Remuneration Committee does not consider that there is much value in introducing 
claw-back provisions into the contractual arrangements with the Chief Executive Officer at this stage. Within this remuneration 
policy, the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make downward adjustment to bonus payments where the KPI 
outcomes would result, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, in a bonus payment which cannot be justified by the 
Company’s financial or personal performance during the year (or subsequently in respect of previous years). In this case a 
downward adjustment would be applied. 166

2 Variable pay consists only of remuneration where performance measures or targets relate only to one financial year .
3 Fixed pay includes salary, benefits and pension.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
It is the Board’s policy to allow Executive Directors to accept directorships of other quoted and non-quoted companies and 
retain any fees or other remuneration for doing so, provided that they have obtained the consent of the Chairman of the 
Company. Any such directorships must be formally notified to the Board.
CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The remuneration of the Chairman of the Company and the Non-executive Directors consists of fees that are paid quarterly in 
arrears. The Chairman and Non-executive Directors do not participate in any long-term incentive or annual bonus schemes, 
nor do they accrue any pension entitlement. Neither the Chairman nor any of the Non-executive Directors has a service 
contract with the Company; however each has entered into a letter of appointment with the Company.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT
On their initial appointment, each of the Non-executive Directors signed a letter of appointment with the Company, for an 
initial period of three years. Since April 2011, the letters of appointment of serving Non-executive Directors have been drafted 
in accordance with provision B.7.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, thus obliging them to retire at each Annual General 
Meeting and be subject to annual re-election by shareholders to serve for a further term of one year . The amendments have 
been drafted such that renewed appointment will not necessitate a new letter of appointment.
The Chairman of the Company does not receive any fees for acting as Chairman other than his fees as a Non-executive Director .
Each Non-executive Director is expected to commit a minimum of 14 days per year in fulfilling their duties as a Director of 
the Company. Once this policy is approved a base fee of £35,000 per annum will be paid to each non-UK-based Non-executive 
Director to reflect the time commitment and level of involvement they are required to make in the activities of the Board as a 
whole. There are no set fees for membership of any Board committees or for the chairmanship of the Board. The UK-based 
Non-executive Directors receive a higher fee to reflect the additional time commitment that they make in order to travel 
to Board meetings in Mexico and to their responsibilities as appropriate as Senior Independent Director, Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee and Chairman of the Audit Committee.
Unless otherwise determined, the Director concerned may give not less than three months’ notice of termination of the 
appointment. Copies of the Directors’ letters of appointment and service agreements are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office. 167

represented by a duly authorised representative) shall have one vote, and on a poll every shareholder who 
is present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share held. The Notice of Annual General 
Meeting specifies deadlines for exercising voting rights and appointing a proxy or proxies.

• the standard restrictions for a UK-quoted company set out in article 32 of the Articles of Association;
• where, from time to time, certain restrictions may become imposed by laws and regulations  
(for example, insider trading laws); and
• pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority whereby certain Directors,

Ordinary Shares.
A Director may be elected either to fill a casual vacancy or as an additional Director, but so that the

by which, with the Company’s co-operation, financial rights carried by securities are held by a person 
other than the holder of the securities. There are no agreements between holders of securities that 
are known to the Company which may result in restrictions on the transfer of voting rights.

repayment to Ordinary Shareholders on winding up or on a return of capital. The Sterling Deferred 
Shares do not entitle the holder to payment of any dividend, or to receive notice or to attend and speak 
at any general meeting of the Company. The Company may also at its option redeem the Sterling

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and those International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) adopted by  
the European Union.
The Directors are required to prepare financial statements for each financial year which present a true and fair view of the 
financial position of the Company and of the Group and the financial performance and cash flows of the Company and of the 
Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and 
Errors’ and then apply them consistently;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Company and of the Group’s financial 
position and financial performance;
• state that the Company and the Group has complied with IFRS, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
• prepare the accounts on a going concern basis unless, having assessed the ability of the Company and the Group to 
continue as a going concern, management either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and of the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Acts 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable UK law and regulations, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of a Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Report that comply with that law and regulations. In addition the Directors 
are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Neither the Company nor the Directors accept any liability to any person in relation to the annual financial report except to the 
extent that such liability could arise under English law. Accordingly, any liability to a person who has demonstrated reliance on 
any untrue or misleading statement or omission shall be determined in accordance with section 90A and schedule 10A of the 
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.
In accordance with provision C.1.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors consider that the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides information to enable shareholders to assess 
the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT OF THE DIRECTORS IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS
I confirm on behalf of the Board that to the best of its knowledge:
a) the financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
b) the management report (encompassed within the ‘Overview’, ‘Strategic Report’, ‘Performance’ and ‘Governance’ sections) 
includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business, and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

BASIS FOR OPINION 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report below. We are independent of the group and parent company in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as 
applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements (we include our consideration of a prohibited non-audit service provided to the Company below).
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
USE OF OUR REPORT
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO PRINCIPAL RISKS, GOING CONCERN AND VIABILITY STATEMENT
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the annual report, in relation to which the ISAs (UK) 
require us to report to you whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to:
• the disclosures in the annual report set out on pages 34-47 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being 
managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ confirmation set out on pages 140 and 141 in the annual report that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the entity, including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the directors’ statement set out on page 49 in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the entity’s 
ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;
• whether the directors’ statement in relation to going concern required under the Listing Rules in accordance with Listing 
Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or 
• the directors’ explanation set out on page 48 and 49 in the annual report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the 
entity, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the entity will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary 
qualifications or assumptions.
OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH
Key audit matters • Recognition of related party transactions, including revenue recognition
• Valuation of the Silverstream contract
• Disclosures, provisions and asset recoverability arising from the El Bajío ejido litigation and 
land disputes
• Recoverable amount of mining assets
• Potential tax uncertainties arising from tax authority inspections and changes in legislation
• Recoverable amount of investments in subsidiaries (Parent Company Only)
Audit scope • We performed an audit of the complete financial information of 5 components, being the  
4 operating mining units and the Parent Company. These components accounted for:
 – 100% of Revenues; 
 – 96% of Profit before tax, excluding Silverstream revaluation effects and gain on the sale  
of concessions; and,
 – 82% of Total assets.
• In addition, we performed specified procedures on specific balances at a further 5 components.  
These components accounted for:
 – 100% of the Silverstream revaluation effects and gain on the sale of concessions;
 – 4% of Profit before tax excluding Silverstream revaluation effects and gain on the sale  
of concessions; and,
 – 16% of Total assets.
Materiality • Overall Group materiality of US$31.0m which represents 5% of forecast profit before tax,  
before Silverstream revaluation effects and gain on the sale of concessions.
KEY AUDIT MATTERS 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy,  
the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters. 172

KEY AUDIT MATTER
RECOGNITION OF RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING REVENUE RECOGNITION 
• All of the Group’s current year revenue from the sale of goods, being concentrates, doré, slag and precipitates  
(US$2,101.6 million; 2016: US$1,905.5 million), and a significant amount of its expenses incurred (US$111.6 million;  
2016: US$84.0 million), arise from transactions with related parties. These related parties are principally subsidiaries  
of the Group’s direct parent, Industrias Peñoles (“Peñoles”). 
• Principal transactions include the sale of goods to the Met-Mex Peñoles refinery, administrative services received and  
the Silverstream contract.
• There is a risk that, if not at arm’s length or not reflecting the goods or services provided in the period, such transactions 
could be used to manipulate earnings or to distribute profits to the Group’s parent. 
• There is also a risk that revenues are inappropriately recognised as a result of incorrect cut-off or inappropriate 
measurement of product sold. 
• There is an ongoing focus by the Mexican tax authorities on transfer pricing as reflected by the current tax inspections. 
There is therefore the potential risk of tax exposures arising from related party transactions.
	 Our judgment is that the level of risk in this area remains 
consistent with the prior year .
 We have not made significant changes to our audit 
response compared to the prior year .
Related party transactions are disclosed in note 27 to the 
consolidated financial statements, Revenues in note 4 and 
relevant accounting policies in note 2.
OUR AUDIT RESPONSE 
We performed full scope audit procedures over this risk area in 5 components, which covered 100% of the aggregate risk 
amount relating to revenue and 61% relating to related party expenses. In addition we performed specified procedures  
in 1 component which covered 38% of the aggregate risk amount relating to related party expenses. We also performed 
specified procedures over the Silverstream contract, which covered 100% of the risk amount.
Identification of related 
parties and related party 
transactions
• We evaluated the appropriateness of management’s process for identifying, recording and 
reporting related party transactions.
• We read contracts and agreements with related parties to understand the nature of the 
transactions.
• Throughout the performance of our audit procedures, we remained alert for any related  
party transactions outside the normal course of business.
Revenue recognition • On a sample basis we performed testing to verify physical deliveries of product in the year .
• We performed revenue cut-off testing, by reference to shipment dates.
• We evaluated the appropriateness of the accounting for embedded derivatives arising from  
the provisional pricing terms in sales contracts.
• We obtained an understanding of the basis of the treatment and refining charges negotiated 
between the Group and Peñoles for the current year, these being deducted from revenue.
• We compared actual revenues on a disaggregated basis to detailed expectations developed 
based on production in the year and market prices for relevant metals to identify and 
understand variances for further investigation.
Related party expenses • On a sample basis we tested related party expenses against underlying contractual terms.
• We utilised data analysis tools to interrogate entire data sets for potential related party 
transactions. 
• We compared actual results against detailed expectations of income statement line items 
impacted by related party transactions to corroborate that there was no evidence of 
manipulation.
Silverstream contract • We tested a sample of cash receipts in respect of silver that is payable under the contract in 
the year . 
• The valuation of the Silverstream contract is discussed separately below. 
Accuracy of disclosures • We verified that related party disclosures in the financial statements are consistent with the 
results of our audit procedures.

KEY AUDIT MATTER
Identification of related 
parties and related party 
transactions
• We, along with our internal transfer pricing specialist, obtained and reviewed the most recent 
report (for 2016) to management from its transfer pricing specialists. 
• We reviewed a letter provided by the specialist to management in February 2018 providing an 
update with respect to transfer pricing applied in 2017. We met with the specialist to further 
understand the content of the letter and to assess the conclusions reached. 
• We assessed the specialist as a specialist engaged by management.
Revenue recognition • We developed detailed expectations for production volumes based on our interviews with 
management, published production reports and internal reporting to the Executive 
Committee. 
• We performed analytical review procedures applying a low variance threshold, comparing 
revenue and production costs against the expectations we developed.
• We used EY’s bespoke data analysis tools to search for terms indicating related parties and 
prepare a summary of transactions related to known related-party vendors and customers, 
which we compared to the schedule provided by management to the Audit Committee.
KEY OBSERVATIONS COMMUNICATED TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
• Our procedures did not identify issues with the identification, recording or reporting of related party transactions.
• We concluded that revenue recognition in the year is appropriate, including the treatment of related provisional pricing terms.
• In respect of transfer pricing in transactions with related parties, we consider that the work undertaken by management’s 
transfer pricing specialist is appropriate for Mexican tax law and also to support the appropriateness of the pricing applied 
to these transactions for financial reporting considerations.
KEY AUDIT MATTER
VALUATION OF THE SILVERSTREAM CONTRACT 
• The valuation of the Silverstream contract (US$538.9 million at 31 December 2017; 2016: US$467.5 million), a derivative 
financial instrument, is estimated by management using a discounted cash flow model. 
• Key assumptions are the estimation of the reserves and resources and the related production profile of the Sabinas  
mine (owned and operated by Peñoles), future silver prices and the discount rate applied. These assumptions require 
management judgment and estimation. 
• The resulting valuation is sensitive to changes in these assumptions which may result in material revaluation effects  
in the financial statements (US$113.7 million pre-tax gain in 2017; 2016: US$133.5 million pre-tax gain).
	 Our judgment is that the level of risk in this area remains 
consistent with the prior year .
 We adapted our procedures to consider the findings of a 
specialist engaged by Peñoles to assess its estimation 
process of the mineral reserves and resources of the 
Sabinas mine in the current year .
The nature of the Silverstream contract and related valuation 
considerations are disclosed in note 14 to the consolidated 
financial statements and the relevant accounting policies  
in note 2. 174
FRESNILLO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
OUR AUDIT RESPONSE
We performed specified procedures over the valuation of the Silverstream contract at 31 December 2017 and related income 
statement revaluation effects. These procedures covered 100% of the risk amount.
Valuation model • In conjunction with our valuation specialists, we evaluated the appropriateness of the 
valuation approach and related model used by the Company to determine the fair value  
of the Silverstream contract under accounting standards. 
Reserves and resources  
and production profile  
of the Sabinas mine
• We interviewed the Sabinas mine geologist in order to understand the assumptions used  
in the estimation of reserves and resources and movements in the estimation in the year .
• We issued instructions to the auditor of Peñoles to perform procedures and report to us in 
respect of the reserves and resources estimate and mine plan of the Sabinas mine. These 
procedures included:
 – conducting walkthroughs to confirm our understanding of Peñoles management’s 
processes to estimate quantities of reserves and resources and to develop the Sabinas 
mine plan;
 – testing of certain key Peñoles controls which address the risks associated with the 
estimation of reserves and resources quantities and accuracy of the resulting mine plan; 
 – gaining an understanding of reasons for changes in estimates of reserves and resources  
in the year;
 – assessing the professional competence, objectivity, and capabilities of Peñoles’ internal 
specialists involved in the estimation of reserves and resources quantities; and
 – evaluating the reasonableness and appropriateness of inputs to the reserves and resources 
estimates and Sabinas mine plan as at 31 December 2017.
• In the current year Peñoles has engaged SRK Consulting (“SRK”), to perform certain 
procedures over its reserve and resource estimation process. We have therefore also 
instructed the auditor of Peñoles to:
 – gain an understanding of the scope of these procedures;
 – review the conclusions reached by the external specialist and assess whether there are  
any implications for the estimate of Sabinas reserves and resources and related mine  
plan as at 31 December 2017; and
 – assess the professional competence, objectivity, and capabilities of the specialist. 
• We discussed the results of the above procedures and reviewed key working papers.
• We performed sensitivity analysis on inferred resources included in the mine plan. 
Key economic assumptions 
in the valuation
• With assistance from our valuation specialists we corroborated key economic assumptions  
in the valuation, including future silver prices, foreign exchange rates and the discount rate 
applied. 
• This included comparison to market data to consider the appropriateness of silver price and 
discount rate assumptions when considered together in the valuation model and analysis of 
the consistency of assumptions to other accounting estimates.
• We performed sensitivity analysis on the combination of silver price assumptions and  
discount rate.
KEY OBSERVATIONS COMMUNICATED TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
• The valuation model is consistent with that used in prior periods and we consider this appropriate for the nature of this  
long term derivative contract.
• We highlighted the sensitivity of the valuation to economic input assumptions, most significantly silver price and discount 
rate. We consider that both management’s long term silver price and discount rate assumptions are at the lower end of 
respective ranges considered appropriate by EY valuation specialists. We reported sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the 
financial impact of changing these assumptions.

DISCLOSURES, PROVISIONS AND ASSET RECOVERABILITY ARISING FROM THE EL BAJÍO EJIDO LITIGATION AND LAND DISPUTES 
• The El Bajío litigation and land disputes may create uncertainty around the Group’s ability to realise the carrying values  
of impacted assets in the Group’s balance sheet and may give rise to further asset impairment. 
• Related assets are capitalised mining costs and inventory held in leaching pads at the impacted mine site.
• The assessment of the recoverability of impacted assets and appropriate disclosure or provisions in the financial statements 
requires judgement about the future legal outcome of claims and land disputes and estimates of any related financial impacts.
	 Our judgment is that the level of risk in this area remains 
consistent with the prior year . 
 We have not made significant changes to our audit 
response compared to the prior year .
Contingencies in respect of the El Bajío ejido litigation and 
land disputes are disclosed in note 26 to the consolidated 
financial statements and the relevant accounting policies  
in note 2.
KEY AUDIT MATTER
OUR AUDIT RESPONSE
We performed full scope audit procedures over this risk area in 1 component, which covered 100% of the risk amount. 
Recoverability of  
non-current assets
• We assessed management’s conclusion that there is sufficient likelihood of future economic 
benefits flowing from the use of assets impacted by the El Bajío land disputes that continue  
to be carried on the Group’s balance sheet.
• We evaluated management’s assessment of related indicators of impairment in respect of 
those assets.
Inventory valuation • We assessed management’s estimation of the recoverable value of inventory that is impacted 
by land disputes, including corroborating gold price assumptions to market data.
Future legal outcome  
of claims
• We evaluated management’s assessment of the current status of the El Bajío ejido litigation 
and claims against the Group and considered whether there is a requirement for any provision 
or related disclosures under accounting standards.
• We obtained and read independent legal confirmation letters from the Group’s external 
lawyers advising on these issues, and assessed these for consistency with management’s 
conclusions. We assessed these lawyers as specialists engaged by management. 
• We assessed the Group’s internal legal counsel as a management specialist.
• We reviewed related disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts to consider their 
appropriateness and completeness.
Management override • As the evaluation of related controls requires the evaluation of the assumptions used in,  
and the output of, that process, we do not seek to rely on these controls. As such, we did  
not specifically address the risk of management override of controls in this area but rather 
increased the level of challenge when performing our substantive procedures.
KEY OBSERVATIONS COMMUNICATED TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
• We concluded that, based on the facts and circumstances of the El Bajío ejido litigation and land disputes, management’s 
assessment that no provision is required and that the impacted assets are recoverable at 31 December 2017 is appropriate.
• The legal confirmations we received supported management’s judgements in this area.
• We concluded that the carrying value of related assets is appropriate.
• We consider that the disclosure in note 26, Contingencies, is appropriate. 176

KEY AUDIT MATTER
RECOVERABLE AMOUNT OF MINING ASSETS 
• The identification of indicators of impairment is judgmental. 
• When an impairment test is performed, the key assumptions underpinning management’s assessment of the recoverable 
amount of mining assets are reserves and resources and related mine plans and production profiles, estimated future 
operating and capital expenditure, future commodity prices, exchange rates and the discount rates applied.
• The estimation of mineral reserves and resources quantities of the Group’s mines requires significant judgment and 
estimation. 
• The Group’s reserves and resources are audited by SRK, a specialist engaged by management.
• Changes to assumptions could lead to material changes in estimated recoverable amounts, resulting in impairment  
of property plant and equipment (US$2,448.6 million, 2016 US$2,180.2 million). There is however no impairment taken 
prior years that may be reversed.
	 Our judgment is that the level of risk in this area remains 
consistent with the prior year . 
 We have not made significant changes to our audit 
response compared to the prior year .
Management’s assessment of the judgement and estimation 
required is set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial 
statements, with results of management’s assessment  
for impairment in note 12. The reserves and resources  
tables are presented on pages 274-278, after the Parent 
Company notes.
OUR AUDIT RESPONSE
We performed full scope audit procedures over this risk area in 4 components, which covered 100% of the risk amount.
Indicators of impairment  
and methodology used to 
estimate recoverable values
• We reviewed management’s identification of indicators of impairment under accounting 
standards.
• We assessed the methodology used by management to estimate the recoverable value of each 
mining asset for which an impairment test was performed to ensure that this is consistent 
with accounting standards. 
• We have assessed the valuation models used by management to estimate the recoverable 
value of each asset.
Estimation process for 
reserves and resources
• We walked through the process of the estimation of the reserves and resources quantities.
• We identified key controls in this process and obtained evidence of their implementation. 
External specialists  
engaged by management
• We assessed SRK as a specialist engaged by management. 
• Through discussions with SRK, we have gained an understanding of the scope of their work  
to verify that this was appropriate. 
• We read the report of the external specialist and gained an understanding of the changes in 
reserves and resources estimates in the year .
Use of reserves and 
resources in financial 
statement calculations
• We tested that the audited reserves and resources estimates have been appropriately applied 
to relevant areas of the Group’s financial statements, including in assessing the recoverable 
value of mining assets.
Key internal assumptions 
used in management’s 
estimate of the recoverable 
values of mining assets
• We agreed related production profiles to the current mine plans for each mine and considered 
their consistency with our understanding of future plans at the mines obtained through 
interviews with both operating and senior management.
• We assessed operating and capital costs included in the cash flow forecasts for consistency 
with current operating costs and forecast mine production.
Key external assumptions 
used in management’s 
estimate of the recoverable 
values of mining assets
• Working with our valuation specialists we have assessed management’s assumptions  
relating to future metals prices and discount rates, comparing these to market data and  
also for consistency with other estimates used in the financial statements.
• We have performed sensitivity analysis on management’s calculated recoverable values  
for alternative assumptions around silver and gold prices and the discount rate applied.

KEY AUDIT MATTER
POTENTIAL TAX UNCERTAINTIES ARISING FROM TAX AUTHORITY INSPECTIONS AND CHANGES IN LEGISLATION  
This is an area on which the audit team, including senior members thereof, has spent considerable time during the year  
as these areas have developed. Constituent areas discussed below have not resulted in provisions at 31 December 2017  
but are disclosed as contingent liabilities.
Tax authority inspections
• As disclosed in note 26, Contingencies, in the consolidated financial statements, in 2015 the tax authorities (SAT) initiated 
inspections of Minera Penmont for 2012 and 2013 which are ongoing. 
• During the current year SAT initiated a number of further inspections at certain of the Group’s subsidiaries. 
• The Company has provided information to SAT with respect to the inspections initiated in the year . However, to date no 
findings have been raised by SAT. 
Changes in legislation
• Effective 1 January 2017 there were changes in Mexican income tax and VAT requirements relating to contractors, a 
significant area of expenditure for Fresnillo. Fresnillo now has an obligation to ensure that contractors are compliant  
with their own tax obligations, including employment tax. 
• If Fresnillo does not obtain and retain sufficient evidence of a contractors’ compliance, the Company is at risk of not  
being permitted to deduct costs related to the contractor for income tax purposes or recover the related input VAT. 
• The tax authorities committed to establish an online portal to facilitate compliance. This was only made available in 
December 2017. As such there has been a lack of clarity around the implementation of the requirements for 2017 until  
late in the year . In late 2017 the related legislation was updated, to clarify that registration by a contractor on the online 
portal by the end of 2018 was sufficient to discharge any 2017 compliance obligations for Fresnillo. 
	 Our judgment is that the level of risk in this area has 
increased compared with the prior year . 
 We have designed and executed specific audit responses  
to address the risk in the current year .
Contingencies in respect of taxation are disclosed in note 26 
to the consolidated financial statements and the relevant 
accounting policies in note 2. 178

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
KEY AUDIT MATTER
OUR AUDIT RESPONSE 
We performed full scope audit procedures over this risk area in all impacted components, which covered 100% of the risk 
amount. 
Tax inspections • Throughout the year we maintained an understanding of the progress of inspections in order 
to understand the status of inspections started in 2015 as well as areas of information 
requested for new inspections and the status of subsequent correspondence with the tax 
authorities. 
• We read the correspondence with tax authorities relating to the tax inspections and, where 
relevant, legal opinions supporting tax treatments.
• For elements of inspections that were progressed during the year, we critically inspected 
correspondence with the SAT to substantiate management’s views on any remaining exposure 
at 31 December 2017. 
• We evaluated management’s process to determine any remaining exposure and likelihood of 
tax treatments being accepted by the tax authorities.
• We read the related disclosures in the financial statements assessing whether they accurately 
reflect our understanding of the status of the investigations and management’s assessment  
of potential exposure. 
Contractors’ fiscal 
compliance
• Using our tax specialists we assessed the implications of the new legislation and its 
implementation as this evolved during the year . 
• We understood the Company’s process for seeking compliance with the regulation and 
assessed its adequacy. 
• We held meetings with management to understand its progress in obtaining evidence of 
contractor compliance throughout the year .
• On a sample basis we checked the evidence obtained by management in support of 
contractors’ compliance during 2017. 
• Following the clarification of legislation in late 2017 we assessed management’s process to 
achieve contractor registration on the portal, and the subsequent extent of actual registration. 
Management override • As the evaluation of related controls requires the evaluation of the assumptions used in,  
and the output of, that process, we do not seek to rely on these controls. As such, we did  
not specifically address the risk of management override of controls in this area but rather 
increased the level of challenge when performing our substantive procedures.
KEY OBSERVATIONS COMMUNICATED TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
• We conclude that management’s process for evaluating tax exposures is appropriate and that the conclusions reached  
are supportable. 
• We conclude that the disclosure of contingent liabilities is appropriate at 31 December 2017.

RECOVERABLE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES (PARENT COMPANY ONLY) 
• Investments in subsidiaries (US$7,094 million, 2016 US$6,958 million) are more sensitive to changes in recoverable value 
than the Group’s underlying mining assets because these investments were re-measured at fair value in 2008 when the 
Group was established ahead of its Initial Public Offering. 
• The principal driver of the recoverable amount of investments in subsidiaries is the estimated value of underlying mining 
assets held by the Group’s subsidiaries. Refer to related considerations in the related key audit matter above.
• In addition, management estimates the recoverable value of exploration projects in considering the recoverable value of 
subsidiaries.
• Changes to assumptions could lead to material changes in estimated recoverable amounts, resulting in either impairment 
or reversals of impairment taken in prior years. 
	 Our judgment is that the level of risk in this area remains 
consistent with the prior year . 
 We have not made significant changes to our audit 
response compared to the prior year .
Management’s assessment of the judgement and estimation 
required is set out in note 2 to the Parent Company financial 
statements, with management’s assessment of investments  
in subsidiaries included in note 5. 
OUR AUDIT RESPONSE 
We performed full scope audit procedures over this risk area in 1 component, which covered 100% of the risk amount.
Key internal assumptions 
used in management’s 
estimate of the recoverable 
value 
• We have assessed the methodology used by management to estimate the recoverable value of 
each investment for which an impairment test was performed to ensure that this is consistent 
with accounting standards. 
• Refer to the key audit matter above with respect to procedures performed relating to the 
recoverable value of mining assets.

PRINCIPAL CHANGES AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR ARE DETAILED BELOW:
In the prior year we identified “Reserves and resources” as a separate key audit matter . In the current year we consider this  
as a component of a new Key Audit Matter: “The recoverable amount of mining assets” and as a component of “Recoverability 
of investment in subsidiaries.” 
In response to an increased number of tax inspections and changes to income tax and VAT in respect of contractors we identified 
a new Key Audit Matter: “Potential tax uncertainties arising from tax authority inspections and changes in legislation.”
AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT 
TAILORING THE SCOPE
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit 
scope for each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 
We take into account size, risk profile and the organisation of the Group and the effectiveness of group-wide controls and other 
factors such as the results of the work of Internal Audit when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
We performed an audit of the complete financial information of 5 components (2016: 5) (“full scope components”) which were 
selected based on their size or risk characteristics. These components are the 4 operating mining units in Mexico and the 
Parent Company. In some instances operating mining units include more than one operating mine; the Fresnillo mining unit 
includes the Fresnillo and the San Julián mines and the Penmont mining unit includes the Herradura, Noche Buena and 
Soldeda & Dipolos mines. 
We also performed specified audit procedures on specific account balances in a further 5 components (2016: 5). The procedures 
were on those account balances within those components which we deemed to be significant either because of the size of these 
accounts or their risk profile. These accounts included taxation, mine closure provisions, property, plant and equipment and 
cash and cash equivalents and all balances relating to the Silverstream contract. 
The reporting components where we performed audit procedures represented:
Key 
 Full scope   Specified procedures   Other procedures
 
* Excludes sales, Silverstream revaluation effects and gain on sale of concessions.
The audit scope of components at which we perform specified procedures may not include testing of all significant accounts  
of the component but will have contributed to the coverage reflected above. 
The remaining components together represent an effect on the Group’s Profit before tax excluding Silverstream revaluation 
effects and gain on disposal of concessions of less than 1% (2016: (1)%) and 2% of total assets (2016: 2%). For these components, 
we perform other procedures, including analytical review and testing of consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations to 
respond to any potential risks of material misstatement in the Group financial statements.

*  In respect of the valuation of the Silverstream contract, we perform primary procedures directly. The component team performs certain supporting procedures regarding 
cash receipts, and the auditor of Peñoles provides support in respect of procedures on the estimation of reserve and resource quantities and the related mine plan at the 
Sabinas mine. 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at  
each of the components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by the component auditor operating under our 
instruction. Of the 5 full scope components, audit procedures were performed on 1 of these directly by the primary audit team. 
For the 5 components at which specified procedures were performed, where the work was performed by component auditors, 
we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained 
as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
The primary engagement team, including the Senior Statutory Auditor, visited Mexico four times during the audit, during both 
the planning and execution phases, with members of the team working with and supervising the component team in Mexico  
for a number of weeks over several visits. These visits involved discussion and oversight of the component team audit approach, 
consideration of any accounting and auditing issues arising from their work, reviewing key audit working papers, meeting  
with management and attending closing meetings. In addition, in the current year members of the primary engagement  
team, including the Senior Statutory Auditor, visited three of the group’s mining operations. This, together with the additional 
procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements. 
Senior members of the component team attended a Global Team Planning Event in the planning phase of the audit, the Post 
Interim Event after hard close procedures and interacted regularly with the local team between visits to Mexico as appropriate. 
The primary engagement team is predominantly composed of Spanish speakers in order to further enhance our interactions 
with both the component team and management.
The primary team was responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. For certain procedures, in particular areas 
involving significant judgement and heightened audit risk, we performed work ourselves with support where required from the 
component team. In other cases, we reviewed key working papers including, but not limited to, the risk areas described above.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements 
on the audit and in forming our audit opinion. 
MATERIALITY
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and 
extent of our audit procedures.

FRESNILLO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
We determined materiality for the Group to be US$31.0 million (2016: US$29.2 million), which is 5% (2016: 5%) of profit before 
tax prior to Silverstream revaluation effects and gain on sale of concessions, a one-off material item (subject to roundings). 
This is a consistent basis to 2016 (there being no gain on sale of concessions in 2016). We believe that this measure of profit 
represents one of the principal considerations for members of the Group, particularly as the Silverstream revaluation effects 
are principally non-cash in nature and the gain on sale of concession is a one off transaction. 
During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and updated its calculation for the actual financial results  
of the year . This did not result in any changes to materiality.
We determined materiality for the Parent Company to be US$70.5 million (2016: US59.3 million), which is 1% of equity. The 
materiality of the Parent Company is higher than that of the Group, reflective of the Parent Company’s primary role being that 
of a holding company. 
PERFORMANCE MATERIALITY
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately  
low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement 
was that performance materiality was 75% (2016: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely US$23.2 million (2016: US$21.9 
million). We based this judgement on factors including the past history of misstatements, our ability to assess the likelihood  
of misstatements and the effectiveness of the internal control environment.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts 
is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is 
based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement 
at that component. The performance materiality allocated to full-scope components in the current year is set out in the graph 
to the right. 
Allocated performance materiality increased in respect of all components, reflecting the overall performance of the Group  
and the individual contributions of the components to that performance. Specifically in respect of the Fresnillo mining unit,  
we note that the increase in performance materiality reflects the San Julián mine becoming fully operational during 2017.
*  The icons correspond to the key audit matters set out above. Audit procedures in respect of the recoverable amount of investments in subsidiaries are performed at the 
performance materiality of the standalone parent financial statements.

REPORTING THRESHOLD
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of US$1.5m 
(2016: US$1.5m), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in 
light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
OTHER INFORMATION 
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly 
stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in 
the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material 
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a 
material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address the following items in the 
other information and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that those 
items meet the following conditions:
• Fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 169 – the statement given by the directors that they consider the 
annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent 
with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or 
• Audit committee reporting set out on pages 134-146 – the section describing the work of the audit committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code set out on page 122 – the parts of the 
directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R (2)  
do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
OPINIONS ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
• the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. 184
FRESNILLO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the 
course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 169, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control 
as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error . 
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group and parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these financial statements. 
The objectives of our audit, in respect to fraud, are; to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements due to fraud; to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement 
due to fraud, through designing and implementing appropriate responses; and to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected 
fraud identified during the audit. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both 
those charged with governance of the entity and management. 
Our approach was as follows: 
• We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the group. We determined that the 
most significant which are directly relevant to specific assertions in the financial statements are those related to the reporting 
framework (IFRS, the Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance Code), regulations impacting mining operations 
including mining laws, environmental and labour regulations and tax and employee profit sharing requirements in Mexico.
• We understood how Fresnillo plc is complying with those legal and regulatory frameworks by making enquiries to 
management, internal audit, those responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the company secretary.  
We corroborated our enquiries through our review of board minutes and papers provided to the Audit Committee. 
• We assessed the susceptibility of the group’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might 
occur by meeting with management from various parts of the business to understand where it is considered there was  
a susceptibility of fraud. We also considered performance targets and their propensity to influence on efforts made by 
management to manage earnings. We considered the programs and controls that the group has established to address 
risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how senior management monitors those programs 
and controls. Where the risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud 
risk. These procedures included testing manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements were free of fraud or error .
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

OTHER MATTERS WE ARE REQUIRED TO ADDRESS 
• Following a competitive tender process and the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed as auditors  
by the shareholders and signed an engagement letter on 28 July 2017. We were appointed by the company at the AGM  
on 4 May 2016 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2017 and subsequent financial periods. 
• The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is 10 years, covering 
periods from our initial appointment in 2008 through to the year ended 31 December 2017.
• In January 2017, we identified that non-audit services related to December 2016 prohibited under the new FRC Ethical 
Standard had been undertaken. These related to less than 10 hours of tax services related to payroll tax for an immaterial 
subsidiary of the group. No amounts related to these services have been recognised in the financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2017. We, therefore, consider this to be a minor breach of the Ethical Standard and we do not consider  
our independence to be impaired. We notified the Audit Committee of this breach in February 2017. The Audit Committee 
agreed with our conclusion that the breach is minor and that our independence is not impaired. The Committee’s discussion  
of this breach is set out on page 139. The evaluation of whether our independence was impaired included consideration of the 
safeguards to independence in connection with the service specifically that the work was undertaken by a separate team from 
the audit team and responsibility for the related tax calculation was taken by a competent member of the group’s management. 
• The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.

1 The maintenance and integrity of the Fresnillo plc website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these 
matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on

ended 31 December 2017 and 2016, and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, 
available-for-sale financial assets and defined benefit pension scheme assets which have been measured at fair value.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America (US dollars or US$) and all 
values are rounded to the nearest thousand ($’000) except when otherwise indicated.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements set out the Group’s financial position as of 31 December 2017 and 2016, and the results 
of operations and cash flows for the years then ended.
Entities that constitute the Group are those enterprises controlled by the Group regardless of the number of shares owned by 
the Group. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has the right to, variable returns from its involvement 
with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Entities are consolidated from the 
date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred 
out of the Group. The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3.
All intra-Group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profits and losses, including unrealised profits arising  
from intra-Group transactions, have been eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way  
as unrealised gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. 
The interest of non-controlling shareholders may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-
acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, non-controlling interests consist of the amount attributed to such interests at 
initial recognition and the non-controlling interest’s share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Any losses  
of a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interests even if that results in a deficit balance.
Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions –  
that is, a transaction with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid 
and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on 
disposals to non-controlling interest are also recorded in equity. 193

(B) CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES
The accounting policies applied are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2016. During 2017, there were no amendments to existing accounting policies.
NEW STANDARDS, INTERPRETATIONS AND AMENDMENTS (NEW STANDARDS) ADOPTED BY THE GROUP
The Group has adopted from 1 January 2017 Amendments to IAS 7. The amendments require an entity to provide disclosures 
that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities. The Group also has 
adopted Amendments to IAS 12. The amendments clarify the accounting for deferred tax where an asset is measured at fair 
value and that fair value is below the asset’s tax base. They also clarify certain other aspects of accounting for deferred tax 
assets. These amendments had no impact in the financial information of the Group.
Other than the above mentioned amendments there were no significant new standards that the Group was required to adopt 
effective from 1 January 2017.
STANDARDS, INTERPRETATIONS AND AMENDMENTS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE
The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial 
statements are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these standards, as applicable to the Group’s financial statements, 
when they become effective, except where indicated.
IFRS 9 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial 
liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets. The Group has decided 
not to adopt IFRS 9 until it becomes mandatory on 1 January 2018. The Group does not expect the new guidance to have a 
significant impact on the classification and measurement of its financial assets for the following reasons:
CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT
The equity instruments that are currently classified as available-for-sale financial assets satisfy the conditions for classification  
as at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). Under IFRS 9, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are not recycled 
to the income statement. There are no other significant changes to the accounting for these assets. Also, embedded derivatives 
resulting for the sales of goods as described in note 2(p) will be no longer separated from the host contract. Instead, the entire 
receivable will be measured at fair value through profit or loss. Management does not expect this to result in a significant impact 
on the measurement of the receivable.
There will be no impact on the Group’s accounting for financial liabilities, as the new requirements only affect the accounting 
for financial liabilities that are designated at fair value through profit or loss and the Group does not have any such liabilities. 
DERECOGNITION
The derecognition rules have been transferred from IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and have 
not been changed.
HEDGE ACCOUNTING
The new hedge accounting rules will align the accounting for hedging instruments more closely with the Group’s risk 
management practices. At this stage the Group does not expect to designate any new hedge relationships except for the 
derivatives corresponding to purchase of property, plant and equipment. The Group’s existing hedge relationships qualify  
as continuing hedges upon the adoption of IFRS 9. As a consequence, the Group does not expect an impact on the accounting 
for its hedging relationships.
IFRS 9 changes the accounting requirements for the time value of purchased options where only the intrinsic value of such 
options has been designated as the hedging instrument. In such cases, changes in the time value of options are initially 
recognised in OCI. Where the hedged item is transaction related, amounts initially recognised in OCI related to the change  
in the time value of options are reclassified to profit or loss or as a basis adjustment to non-financial assets or liabilities upon 
maturity of the hedged item, or, in the case of a hedged item that realises over time, the amounts initially recognised in OCI 
are amortised to profit or loss on a systematic and rational basis over the life of the hedged item. Under IAS 39, the change  
in time value of options is recorded in the income statement. The initial credit adjustment from retained earnings to hedging 
reserve as at 1 January 2017 would be US$23.0 million and the adjustment decreasing financial cost for the year ended 
31 December 2017 US$42.1 million. 194

(B) CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES CONTINUED
IMPAIRMENT
IFRS 9 requires the Group to now use an expected credit loss model for its trade receivables measured at amortised cost, 
either on a 12-month or lifetime basis. Given the short-term nature of these receivables, the Group does not expect these 
changes will have a significant impact.
PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE
The new standard also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation. These are expected to 
change the nature and extent of the Group’s disclosures about its financial instruments particularly in the year of the adoption 
of the new standard. 
IFRS 15 REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS
The IASB has issued a new standard for the recognition of revenue arising from contracts with customers. The new revenue 
standard will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS. 
The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer . 
The Group has evaluated recognition and measurement of revenue based on the five-step model in IFRS 15 and has not identified 
any financial impacts, hence no adjustments are expected to result from the adoption of IFRS 15. The Group has elected to adopt 
the new standard from 1 January 2018 applying the modified retrospective adoption method.
Certain disclosures will change as a result of the requirements of IFRS 15. The Group expects this to include a breakdown  
of revenue from customers and revenue from other sources, including the movement in the value of embedded derivatives  
in sales contracts.
IFRS 16 LEASES
IFRS 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with  
a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. A lessee is required to recognise a right-of-use asset 
representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. 
IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17. Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify  
its leases as operating leases or finance leases, and to account for those two types of leases differently. These amendments  
are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier application is permitted. However, as there  
are several interactions between IFRS 16 and IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers, early application is restricted  
to entities that also early adopt IFRS 15. The Group has decided to adopt the standard when it becomes effective.
IFRIC 22 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AND ADVANCE CONSIDERATION
IFRIC 22 clarifies which exchange rate to use in reporting foreign currency transactions when payment is made or received in 
advance. The interpretation requires the company to determine a ‘date of transaction’ for the purposes of selecting an exchange 
rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income. In the case that there are multiple payments or receipts 
in advance, the entity should determine a date of the transaction for each flow of advance consideration. IFRIC 22 is applicable for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and earlier adoption is permitted. The interpretation is not expected to have 
any impact in the financial information of the Group.
IFRIC 23 UNCERTAINTY OVER INCOME TAX TREATMENTS
This Interpretation clarifies how to apply the recognition and measurement requirements in IAS 12 when there is uncertainty  
over income tax treatments. The interpretation is to be applied to the determination of taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused 
tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. Application of tax law can  
be complex and requires judgement to assess risk and estimate outcomes where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is 
uncertain. The Group is working to identify potential uncertainties based on previous resolutions of tax authorities. IFRIC 23 is 
applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier adoption is permitted.
The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective. 195

(C) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the 
date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
These judgements and estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with 
regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements. 
Information about such judgements and estimates is contained in the accounting policies and/or the notes to the consolidated 
financial statements.
JUDGEMENTS
Areas of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised  
in the consolidated financial statements are:
• Determination of functional currency (note 2(d)):
 The determination of functional currency requires management judgement, particularly where there may be more than one 
currency in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates.
• Evaluation of the status of projects (note 2(e)):
 The evaluation of project status impacts the accounting for costs incurred and requires management judgement. This includes 
the assessment of whether there is sufficient evidence of the probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals 
to justify the commencement of capitalisation of costs, the timing of the end of the exploration phase and the start of the 
development phase and the commencement of the production phase. These judgements directly impact the treatment of 
costs incurred and proceeds from the sale of metals from ore produced.
• Stripping costs (note 2(e)):
 The Group incurs waste removal costs (stripping costs) during the development and production phases of its surface mining 
operations. During the production phase, stripping costs (production stripping costs) can be incurred both in relation to  
the production of inventory in that period and the creation of improved access and mining flexibility in relation to ore to be 
mined in the future. The former are included as part of the costs of inventory, while the latter are capitalised as a stripping 
activity asset, where certain criteria are met.
 Once the Group has identified production stripping for a surface mining operation, judgement is required in identifying the 
separate components of the ore bodies for that operation, to which stripping costs should be allocated. Generally a component 
is a specific volume of the ore body that is made more accessible by the stripping activity. In identifying components of the ore 
body, the Group works closely with the mining operations personnel to analyse each of the mine plans. The mine plans and, 
therefore, the identification of components, will vary between mines for a number of reasons. These include, but are not 
limited to, the type of commodity, the geological characteristics of the ore body, the geographical location and/or financial 
considerations. The Group reassesses the components of ore bodies annually in line with the preparation of mine plans.  
In the current year, this reassessment did not give rise to any changes in the identification of components.
 Once production stripping costs have been identified, judgement is also required to identify a suitable production measure 
to be used to allocate production stripping costs between inventory and any stripping activity asset(s) for each component. 
The Group considers that the ratio of the expected tonnes of waste to be stripped for an expected tonnes of ore to be mined 
for a specific component of the ore body is the most suitable production measure.
 Furthermore, judgements and estimates are also used to apply the units of production method in determining the 
depreciable lives of the stripping activity asset(s).
• Qualifying assets (note 2(e)):
 All interest-bearing loans are held by the parent company and were not obtained for any specific asset’s acquisition, 
construction, or production. Funds from these loans are transferred to subsidiaries to meet the strategic objectives of the 
Group or are otherwise held centrally. Due to this financing structure, judgement is required in determining whether those 
borrowings are attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset. Therefore, management 
determines whether borrowings are attributable to an asset or group of assets based on whether the investment in an 
operating or development stage project is classified as contributing to achieving the strategic growth of the Group.
• Contingencies (note 26).
 By their nature, contingencies will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur .  
The assessment of the existence and potential quantum of contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant 
judgement and the use of estimates regarding the outcome of future events. 196

(C) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS CONTINUED
ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
Significant areas of estimation uncertainty considered by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
include:
• Estimated recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources, note 2(e):
 Ore reserves are estimates of the amount of ore that can be economically and legally extracted from the Group’s mining 
properties; mineral resources are an identified mineral occurrence with reasonable prospects for eventual economic 
extraction. The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by appropriately 
qualified persons relating to the geological and technical data on the size, depth, shape and grade of the ore body and 
suitable production techniques and recovery rates, in conformity with the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) code  
2012. Such an analysis requires complex geological judgements to interpret the data. The estimation of recoverable ore 
reserves and mineral resources is based upon factors such as geological assumptions and judgements made in estimating 
the size and grade of the ore body, estimates of commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, future capital requirements and 
production costs.
 As additional geological information is produced during the operation of a mine, the economic assumptions used and the 
estimates of ore reserves and mineral resources may change. Such changes may impact the Group’s reported balance 
sheet and income statement including:
 – The carrying value of property, plant and equipment and mining properties may be affected due to changes in estimated 
future cash flows, which consider both ore reserves and mineral resources;
 – Depreciation and amortisation charges in the income statement may change where such charges are determined using 
the unit-of-production method based on ore reserves;
 – Stripping costs capitalised in the balance sheet, either as part of mine properties or inventory, or charged to profit or 
loss may change due to changes in stripping ratios;
 – Provisions for mine closure costs may change where changes to the ore reserve and resources estimates affect 
expectations about when such activities will occur; and
 – The recognition and carrying value of deferred income tax assets may change due to changes regarding the existence  
of such assets and in estimates of the likely recovery of such assets.
• Determination of useful lives of assets for depreciation and amortisation purposes, notes 2(e) and 12:
 Estimates are required to be made by management as to the useful lives of assets. For depreciation calculated under the 
unit-of-production method, estimated recoverable reserves are used in determining the depreciation and/or amortisation 
of mine-specific assets. The depreciation/amortisation charge is proportional to the depletion of the estimated remaining 
life of mine of production. Estimated useful lives of other assets are based on the expected usage of the asset. Each item’s 
life, which is assessed annually, has regard to both its physical life limitations and to expectations of the use of the asset by 
the Group, including with reference to present assessments of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at 
which the asset is used.
• Silverstream, note 14:
 The valuation of the Silverstream contract as a derivative financial instrument requires estimation by management. The 
term of the derivative is based on Sabinas life of mine and the value of this derivative is determined using a number of 
estimates, including the estimated recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources and future production profile of the 
Sabinas mine, the estimated recoveries of silver from ore mined, estimates of the future price of silver and the discount 
rate used to discount future cash flows. For further details on the inputs that have a significant effect on the fair value of 
this derivative, see note 30. The impact of changes in silver price assumptions, foreign exchange, inflation and the discount 
rate is included in note 31.
• Assessment of recoverability of property plant and equipment and impairment charges, note 2(f):
 The recoverability of an asset requires the use of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity prices, 
reserves and resources and the associated production profiles, discount rates, future capital requirements, exploration 
potential and operating performance. Changes in these assumptions will affect the recoverable amount of the property, 
plant and equipment.
• Estimation of the mine closure costs, notes 2(l) and 21:
 Significant estimates and assumptions are made in determining the provision for mine closure cost as there are numerous 
factors that will affect the ultimate liability payable. These factors include estimates of the extent and costs of rehabilitation 
activities, the currency in which the cost will be incurred, technological changes, regulatory changes, cost increases, mine 
life and changes in discount rates. Those uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts 
currently provided. The provision at the balance sheet date represents management’s best estimate of the present value of 
the future closure costs required. 197

• Income tax, notes 2(r) and 10:
 The recognition of deferred tax assets, including those arising from un-utilised tax losses require management to assess 
the likelihood that the Group will generate taxable earnings in future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax 
assets. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash flows from operations and the application of existing 
tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates,  
the ability of the Group to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted.
(D) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the parent company’s functional currency. 
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which it operates. For all operating entities, this is US dollars.
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are translated at the exchange rate 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the 
rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary 
items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates 
of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars using 
the exchange rate at the date when the fair value is determined.
For entities with functional currencies other than US dollars as at the reporting date, assets and liabilities are translated into the 
reporting currency of the Group by applying the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the income statement is translated at 
the average exchange rate for the year . The resulting difference on exchange is included as a cumulative translation adjustment in 
other comprehensive income. On disposal of an entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income 
relating to that operation is recognised in the income statement.
(E) PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Cost comprises the 
purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into working condition for its intended use. The cost of 
self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
The cost less the residual value of each item of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life. Each item’s 
estimated useful life has been assessed with regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of 
economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the item is located. Estimates of remaining useful lives  
are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, machinery and equipment, with annual reassessments for major items. 
Depreciation is charged to cost of sales on a unit-of-production (UOP) basis for mine buildings and installations, plant and 
equipment used in the mine production process or on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the individual asset 
when not related to the mine production process. Changes in estimates, which mainly affect unit-of-production calculations, 
are accounted for prospectively. Depreciation commences when assets are available for use. Land is not depreciated.
The expected useful lives are as follows:
Years
Buildings 6
Plant and equipment 4
Mining properties and development costs 
1
16
Other assets 3
1 Depreciation of mining properties and development cost are determined using the unit-of-production method.
An item of property, plant and equipment is de-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected 
from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising at de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement in the year that the asset is 
de-recognised.
Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale when it is expected that the carrying amount of the asset 
will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use. Assets are not depreciated when classified as 
held for sale. 198

DISPOSAL OF ASSETS
Gains or losses from the disposal of assets are recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards  
of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has been passed.
MINING PROPERTIES AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Payments for mining concessions are expensed during the exploration phase of a prospect and capitalised during the 
development of the project when incurred.
Purchased rights to ore reserves and mineral resources are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition or at fair value  
if purchased as part of a business combination.
Mining concessions, when capitalised, are amortised on a straight line basis over the period of time in which benefits are 
expected to be obtained from that specific concession.
Mine development costs are capitalised as part of property, plant and equipment. Mine development activities commence once 
a feasibility study has been performed for the specific project. When an exploration prospect has entered into the advanced 
exploration phase and sufficient evidence of the probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals has been 
obtained pre-operative expenses relating to mine preparation works are also capitalised as a mine development cost.
The initial cost of a mining property comprises its construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the mining 
property into operation, the initial estimate of the provision for mine closure cost, and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs. 
The Group cease the capitalisation of borrowing cost when the physical construction of the asset is complete and is ready for 
its intended use.
Revenues from metals recovered from ore mined in the mine development phase, prior to commercial production, are credited 
to mining properties and development costs. Upon commencement of production, capitalised expenditure is depreciated using 
the unit-of-production method based on the estimated economically proven and probable reserves to which they relate.
Mining properties and mine development are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment in value, if any.
CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS
Assets in the course of construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment. On completion, 
the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment. The cost of construction in 
progress is not depreciated.
SUBSEQUENT EXPENDITURES
All subsequent expenditure on property, plant and equipment is capitalised if it meets the recognition criteria, and the carrying 
amount of those parts that are replaced, is de-recognised. All other expenditure including repairs and maintenance expenditure 
is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
STRIPPING COSTS
In a surface mine operation, it is necessary to remove overburden and other waste material in order to gain access to the ore 
bodies (stripping activity). During development and pre-production phases, the stripping activity costs are capitalised as part of 
the initial cost of development and construction of the mine (the stripping activity asset) and charged as depreciation or depletion 
to cost of sales, in the income statement, based on the mine’s units of production once commercial operations begin.
Removal of waste material normally continues throughout the life of a surface mine. At the time that saleable material begins 
to be extracted from the surface mine the activity is referred to as production stripping.
Production stripping cost is capitalised only if the following criteria is met:
• It is probable that the future economic benefits (improved access to an ore body) associated with the stripping activity will 
flow to the Group;
• The Group can identify the component of an ore body for which access has been improved; and
• The costs relating to the improved access to that component can be measured reliably.
If not all of the criteria are met, the production stripping costs are charged to the income statement as operating costs as they 
are incurred. 199

STATEMENTS
Stripping activity costs associated with such development activities are capitalised into existing mining development assets, as 
mining properties and development cost, within property, plant and equipment, using a measure that considers the volume of 
waste extracted compared with expected volume, for a given volume of ore production. This measure is known as ‘component 
stripping ratio’, which is revised annually in accordance with the mine plan. The amount capitalised is subsequently depreciated 
over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body related to the stripping activity asset, by using the  
units of production method. The identification of components and the expected useful lives of those components are evaluated 
annually. Depreciation is recognised as cost of sales in the income statement.
The capitalised stripping activity asset is carried at cost less accumulated depletion/depreciation, less impairment, if any.  
Cost includes the accumulation of costs directly incurred to perform the stripping activity that improves access to the 
identified component of ore, plus an allocation of directly attributable overhead costs. The costs associated with incidental 
operations are excluded from the cost of the stripping activity asset.
In identifying components of the ore body, the Group works closely with the mining operations personnel for each mining operation 
to analyse each of the mine plans. Generally, a component will be a subset of the total ore body and a mine may have several 
components that are identified based on the mine plan. The mine plans and therefore the identification of components can vary 
between mines for a number of reasons including but not limited to, the type of commodity, the geological characteristics of the 
ore body, the geographical location and/or financial considerations.
(F) IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS
The carrying amounts of non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate  
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there 
are any indications of impairment. If there are indicators of impairment, an exercise is undertaken to determine whether 
carrying values are in excess of their recoverable amount. Such reviews are undertaken on an asset by asset basis, except 
where such assets do not generate cash flows independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, and then the 
review is undertaken at the cash generating unit level.
If the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded to 
reflect the asset at the recoverable amount in the balance sheet. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
THE RECOVERABLE AMOUNT OF AN ASSET
The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. In assessing value  
in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Fair value less cost of disposal is based  
on an estimate of the amount that the Group may obtain in an orderly sale transaction between market participants. For an 
asset that does not generate cash inflows largely independently of those from other assets, or groups of assets, the recoverable 
amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. The Group’s cash generating units are the 
smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other 
assets or groups of assets.
REVERSAL OF IMPAIRMENT
An assessment is made each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses 
may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. 
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in estimates used to determine the asset’s 
recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased 
to the recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net  
of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised in previous years. Such impairment loss reversal is recognised in the 
income statement.
(G) FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes party to contracts that give rise to them and are classified as 
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; held to maturity investments; available-for-sale financial assets; or loans 
and receivables or derivatives designated as hedging instruments, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of 
its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each balance sheet date. When financial assets 
are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or 
loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
The Group recognises financial liabilities on its balance sheet when, and only when, it becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. Financial liabilities are classified at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, 
payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. All financial liabilities  
are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, including any transaction costs incurred. 200

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS
Financial assets and liabilities classified as held-for-trading and other assets or liabilities designated as fair value through 
profit or loss at inception are included in this category. Financial assets or liabilities are classified as held-for-trading if  
they are acquired or incurred for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the short term. Derivatives, including separated 
embedded derivatives are also classified as held-for-trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments as 
defined by IAS 39. Financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value 
with gains or losses arising from changes in fair value, presented as finance costs or finance income in the income statement.
LOANS AND RECEIVABLES
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-
for-sale.
After initial measurement, such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less  
any allowance for impairment. Gains or losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised  
or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables. 
Non-current receivables are stated at amortised cost. Loans and receivables from contractors are carried at amortised cost.
LOANS AND BORROWINGS
After initial recognition at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs, interest-bearing loans are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs  
in the income statement. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss, in the income statement, when the liabilities are 
derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.
The Group adjusts the carrying amount of the financial liability to reflect actual and revised estimated cash flows. The carrying 
amount is recalculated by computing the present value of estimated future cash flows at the financial instrument’s original 
effective interest rate or, when applicable, the revised effective interest rate. Any adjustment is recognised in profit or loss as 
income or expense.
This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings. For more information, refer to note 20.
AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS
Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified  
in any of the preceding categories and are not held to maturity investments.
Available-for-sale financial assets represent equity investments that have a quoted market price in an active market; therefore, 
a fair value can be reliably measured. After initial measurement, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value 
with mark-to-market unrealised gains or losses recognised as other comprehensive income in the available-for-sale reserve 
until the financial asset is de-recognised.
Financial assets classified as available-for-sale are de-recognised when they are sold, and all the risks and rewards of ownership 
have been transferred. When financial assets are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in other comprehensive 
income are included in the income statement within other operating income or expense.
DE-RECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
A financial asset or liability is generally de-recognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. 
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms 
of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs 
or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss. 
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability (or part of a financial liability) extinguished or transferred  
to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised  
in the income statement. 201

(H) IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial 
assets is impaired.
ASSETS CARRIED AT AMORTISED COST
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, 
the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated 
future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s 
original effective interest rate (i.e., the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset 
is reduced through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss.
The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually 
significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined that no 
objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is 
included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively 
assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues 
to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an 
event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent 
reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does 
not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability  
of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due 
under the original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. 
Impaired receivables are de recognised when they are assessed as uncollectible.
AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS
If an available-for-sale financial asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principal 
payment and amortisation) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement, 
is transferred from equity to the income statement. In assessing whether there is an impairment, the Group considers whether 
a decline in fair value is either significant or prolonged, by considering the size of the decline in this value, the historic volatility 
in changes in fair value and the duration of the sustained decline. Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as 
available-for-sale are not recognised in the income statement.
(I) INVENTORIES
Finished goods, work in progress and ore stockpile inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method based on cost of production which excludes borrowing costs.
For this purpose, the costs of production include:
• personnel expenses, which include employee profit sharing, materials and contractor expenses which are directly 
attributable to the extraction and processing of ore;
• the depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in the extraction and processing of ore; and
• related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity).
Operating materials and spare parts are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. An allowance for obsolete and 
slow-moving inventories is determined by reference to specific items of stock. A regular review is undertaken by management 
to determine the extent of such an allowance.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be 
incurred to completion and disposal.
(J) SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
Where the Group invests in short-term instruments which are either not readily convertible into known amounts of cash or  
are subject to risk of changes in value that are not insignificant, these instruments are classified as short-term investments. 
Short-term investments are classified as loans and receivables. 202

(K) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits 
held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in 
value. Short-term deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and four months. For the 
purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
(L) PROVISIONS
MINE CLOSURE COST
A provision for mine closure cost is made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure, restoration and for environmental 
rehabilitation costs (which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation 
of disturbed areas) based on a mine closure plan, in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs. 
The provision is discounted and the unwinding of the discount is included within finance costs. At the time of establishing the 
provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised where it gives rise to a future economic benefit and is depreciated over future 
production from the mine to which it relates. The provision is reviewed on an annual basis by the Group for changes in cost 
estimates, discount rates or life of operations. Changes to estimated future costs are recognised in the balance sheet by adjusting 
the mine closure cost liability and the related asset originally recognised. If, for mature mines, the revised mine assets net of mine 
closure cost provisions exceed the recoverable value, the portion of the increase is charged directly as an expense. For closed sites, 
changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
(M) EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
The Group operates the following plans:
DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN
This funded plan is based on each employee’s earnings and years of service. This plan was open to all employees in Mexico  
until it was closed to new entrants on 1 July 2007. The plan is denominated in Mexican Pesos. For members as at 30 June 2007, 
benefits were frozen at that date subject to indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer Price Index (NCPI).
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation 
method and prepared by an external actuarial firm as at each year-end balance sheet date. The discount rate is the yield on 
bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations and that are denominated in the same 
currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in OCI and permanently 
excluded from profit or loss.
Past service costs are recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become 
vested. If the benefits have already vested following the introduction of, or changes to, a pension plan, the past service cost  
is recognised immediately.
The defined benefit asset or liability comprises the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan 
assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. The value of any asset is restricted to the present value of any 
economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions to the plan.
Net interest cost is recognised in finance cost and return on plan assets (other than amounts reflected in net interest cost)  
is recognised in OCI and permanently excluded from profit or loss.
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION PLAN
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate 
entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution 
pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss when they are due. The contributions are based 
on the employee’s salary.
This plan started on 1 July 2007 and it is voluntary for all employees to join this scheme. 203

SENIORITY PREMIUM FOR VOLUNTARY SEPARATION
This unfunded plan corresponds to an additional payment over the legal seniority premium equivalent to approximately 12 days 
of salary per year for those unionised workers who have more than 15 years of service. Non-unionised employees with more 
than 15 years of service have the right to a payment equivalent to 12 days for each year of service. For both cases, the payment 
is based on the legal current minimum salary.
The cost of providing benefits for the seniority premium for voluntary separation is determined using the projected unit credit 
actuarial valuation method and prepared by an external actuarial firm as at each year-end balance sheet date. Actuarial gains 
or losses are recognised as income or expense in the period in which they occur .
OTHER
Benefits for death and disability are covered through insurance policies.
Termination payments for involuntary retirement (dismissals) are charged to the income statement, when incurred.
(N) EMPLOYEE PROFIT SHARING
In accordance with the Mexican legislation, companies in Mexico are subject to pay for employee profit sharing (PTU) equivalent 
to 10% of the taxable income of each fiscal year .
PTU is accounted for as employee benefits and is calculated based on the services rendered by employees during the year, 
considering their most recent salaries. The liability is recognised as it accrues and is charged to the income statement. PTU, 
paid in each fiscal year, is considered deductible for income tax purposes.
(O) LEASES
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception 
date including whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement 
conveys a right to use the asset. A reassessment is made after inception of the lease only if one of the following applies:
a) There is a change in contractual terms, other than a renewal or extension of the arrangement;
b) A renewal option is exercised or extension granted, unless the term of the renewal or extension was initially included in the 
lease term;
c) There is a change in the determination of whether fulfilment is dependent on a specified asset; or
d) There is a substantial change to the asset.
GROUP AS A LESSEE
Finance leases which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item,  
are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset, or if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to 
achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are reflected in the income statement.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term, if there 
is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
GROUP AS A LESSOR
Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as 
operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased 
asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in 
the period in which they are earned. 
Where a reassessment is made, lease accounting commences or ceases from the date when the change in circumstances 
gave rise to the reassessment for scenarios a), c) or d) and at the date of renewal or extension period for scenario b) above. 
For arrangements entered into prior to 1 January 2005, the date of inception is deemed to be 1 January 2007, in accordance 
with the transitional requirements of IFRIC 4. 204

(P) REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be 
reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received excluding discounts, rebates and other 
sales taxes.
SALE OF GOODS
Revenue is recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the 
customer, usually when title has been passed. Revenue excludes any applicable sales taxes.
The Group recognises revenue on a provisional basis at the time concentrates, precipitates and doré bars are delivered to the 
customer’s smelter or refinery, using the Group’s best estimate of contained metal. Revenue is subject to adjustment once the 
analysis of the product samples is completed, contract conditions have been fulfilled and final settlement terms are agreed. 
Any subsequent adjustments to the initial estimate of metal content are recorded in revenue once they have been determined.
In addition, sales of concentrates and precipitates throughout each calendar month, as well as doré bars that are delivered 
after the 20th day of each month, are ‘provisionally priced’ subject to a final adjustment based on the average price for the 
month following the delivery to the customer, based on the market price at the relevant quotation point stipulated in the 
contract. Doré bars that are delivered in the first 20 days of each month are finally priced in the month of delivery.
For sales of goods that are subject to provisional pricing, revenue is initially recognised when the conditions set out above have 
been met using the provisional price. The price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative and hence separated 
from the sales contract. At each reporting date, the provisionally priced metal is revalued based on the forward selling price 
for the quotation period stipulated in the contract until the quotation period ends. The selling price of the metals can be 
reliably measured as these are actively traded on international exchanges. The revaluing of provisionally priced contracts  
is recorded as an adjustment to revenue.
The customer deducts treatment and refining charges before settlement. Therefore, the fair value of consideration received 
for the sale of goods is net of those charges.
The Group recognises in selling expenses a levy in respect of the Extraordinary Mining Right as sales of gold and silver are 
recognised. The Extraordinary Mining Right consists of a 0.5% rate, applicable to the owners of mining titles. The payment 
must be calculated over the total sales of all mining concessions. The payment of this mining right must be remitted no later 
than the last business day of March of the following year and can be credited against corporate income tax. 
The Group also recognises in selling expenses a discovery premium royalty equivalent to 1% of the value of the mineral extracted 
and sold during the year from certain mining titles granted by the Mexican Geological Survey (SGM) in the San Julián mine. The 
premium is settled to SGM on a quarterly basis.
OTHER INCOME
Other income is recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to  
the customer, usually when title has been passed.
(Q) EXPLORATION EXPENSES
Exploration activity involves the search for mineral resources, the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment  
of commercial viability of an identified resource.
Exploration expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred and are recorded in the following captions:
• Cost of sales: costs relating to in-mine exploration, that ensure continuous extraction quality and extend mine life; and
• Exploration expenses:
 – Costs incurred in geographical proximity to existing mines in order to replenish or increase reserves; and
 – Costs incurred in regional exploration with the objective of locating new ore deposits in Mexico and Latin America and 
which are identified by project. Costs incurred are charged to the income statement until there is sufficient probability  
of the existence of economically recoverable minerals and a feasibility study has been performed for the specific project. 205

(R) TAXATION
CURRENT INCOME TAX
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered 
from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or 
substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the country the Group operates.
DEFERRED INCOME TAX
Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:
• Where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that 
is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit loss; and
• In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint 
ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and 
unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary 
differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except:
• Where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an 
asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the 
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
• In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint 
ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will 
reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it 
has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset 
is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income is recognised in equity and not in  
the income statement.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current 
tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same 
taxation authority.
MINING RIGHTS
The Special Mining Right is considered an income tax under IFRS and states that the owners of mining titles and concessions are 
subject to pay an annual mining right of 7.5% of the profit derived from the extractive activities. The Group recognises deferred 
tax assets and liabilities on temporary differences arising in the determination of the Special Mining Right (see note 10).
SALES TAX
Expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax, except:
• When the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case, 
the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable; and
• When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or 
payables in the balance sheet. 206

(S) DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING
The Group uses derivatives to reduce certain market risks derived from changes in foreign exchange and commodities price 
which impact its financial and business transactions. Hedges are designed to protect the value of expected production against 
the dynamic market conditions. 
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered 
into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as 
liabilities when the fair value is negative. The full fair value of a derivative is classified as non-current asset or liability if the 
remaining maturity of the item is more than 12 months. 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
are taken directly to the income statement.
Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies (such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value) applicable to 
the specific type of derivative instrument. The fair value of forward currency and commodity contracts is calculated by reference to 
current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles, European foreign exchange options are valued using 
the Black Scholes model. The Silverstream contract is valued using a Net Present Value valuation approach.
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group 
wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for the undertaken hedge. The documentation 
includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the 
entity will assess the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or 
cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair 
value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout  
the financial reporting periods for which they were designated.
Hedges which meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:
CASH FLOW HEDGES
For derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative 
instruments are recorded as in other comprehensive income and are transferred to the income statement when the hedged 
transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. For gains or losses related to the hedging  
of foreign exchange risk these are included, in the line item in which the hedged costs are reflected. Where the hedged item is 
the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial 
carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges  
is recognised directly as finance costs, in the income statement of the related period.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a 
hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss recognised directly in other comprehensive income from the period that the hedge 
was effective remains separately in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs, when it is recognised in 
the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported 
in other comprehensive income is immediately transferred to the income statement.
When hedging with options, the Group designates only the intrinsic value movement of the hedging option within the hedge 
relationship. The time value of the option contracts is therefore excluded from the hedge designation. Changes in fair value  
of time value is recognised in the income statement in finance costs.
EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES
Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives at the date that the Group first becomes party to the contract, 
with reassessment only if there is a change to the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows. Embedded derivatives 
which are not clearly and closely related to the underlying asset, liability or transaction are separated and accounted for as 
stand-alone derivatives. 207

(T) BORROWING COSTS
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes 12 or 
more months to get ready for its intended use or sale (a qualifying asset) are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective 
asset. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.
Where funds are borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs 
incurred. Where surplus funds are available for a short term from funds borrowed specifically to finance a project, the income 
generated from the temporary investment of such amounts is also capitalised and deducted from the total capitalised borrowing 
cost. Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a 
weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Group during the period.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
(U) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
The Group measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair values of financial instruments 
measured at amortised cost are disclosed in notes 30 and 31.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction 
to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: 
• In the principal market for the asset or liability; or
• In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Group.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the 
asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic 
benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset  
in its highest and best use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available  
to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the 
fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement  
as a whole:
Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or 
indirectly observable.
Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether 
transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that  
is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, 
characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. Further information 
on fair values is described in note 30.
(V) DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION
Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability when these are approved by the Company’s 
shareholders or Board as appropriate. Dividends payable to minority shareholders are recognised as a liability when these  
are approved by the Company’s subsidiaries. 208

3. SEGMENT REPORTING
For management purposes, the Group is organised into operating segments based on producing mines.
At 31 December 2017, the Group has seven reportable operating segments as follows:
• The Fresnillo mine, located in the state of Zacatecas, an underground silver mine;
• The Saucito mine, located in the state of Zacatecas, an underground silver mine;
• The Ciénega mine, located in the state of Durango, an underground gold mine; including the San Ramón satellite mine;
• The Herradura mine, located in the state of Sonora, a surface gold mine;
• The Soledad-Dipolos mine, located in the state of Sonora, a surface gold mine; 
• The Noche Buena mine, located in state of Sonora, a surface gold mine; and
• The San Julián mine, located on the border of Chihuahua/Durango states, an underground silver-gold mine. Phase one of 
San Julián mine commenced commercial production in the third quarter of 2016 and phase two in the third quarter of 2017.
The operating performance and financial results for each of these mines are reviewed by management. As the Group’s chief 
operating decision-maker does not review segment assets and liabilities, the Group has not disclosed this information.
Management monitors the results of its operating segments separately for the purpose of performance assessment and making 
decisions about resource allocation. Segment performance is evaluated without taking into account certain adjustments included 
in revenue as reported in the consolidated income statement, and certain costs included within cost of sales and gross profit which 
are considered to be outside of the control of the operating management of the mines. The table below provides a reconciliation 
from segment profit to gross profit as per the consolidated income statement. Other income and expenses included in the 
consolidated income statement are not allocated to operating segments. Transactions between reportable segments are 
accounted for on an arm’s length basis similar to transactions with third parties.
In 2017 and 2016, substantially all revenue was derived from customers based in Mexico.

1 The special mining right ‘SMR’ allows the deduction of payments of mining concessions rights up to the amount of SMR payable within the same legal entity. During the 
fiscal year ended 31 December 2017, the Group credited US$15.7 million (2016: US$12.4 million) of mining concession rights against the SMR. Total mining concessions 
rights paid during the year were US$16.3 million (2016: US$15.4 million) and have been recognised in the income statement within cost of sales and exploration expenses. 
Mining concessions rights paid in excess of the SMR cannot be credited to SMR in future fiscal periods, and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised in relation  
to the excess. Without regards to credits permitted under the SMR regime, the current special mining right charge would have been US$35.1 million (2016: US$36.9 million). 214

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to the same fiscal authority.
On the basis of management’s internal forecast, a deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of tax losses amounting 
to US$227.4 million (2016: US$221.1 million). If not utilised, US$13.7 million (2016: US$10.7 million) will expire within five 
years and US$213.6 million (2016: US$210.4 million) will expire between six and ten years.
The Group has further tax losses and other similar attributes carried forward of US$37.4 million (2016: US$29.1 million) on 
which no deferred tax is recognised due to insufficient certainty regarding the availability of appropriate future taxable profits. 
(D) UNRECOGNISED DEFERRED TAX ON INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES
The Group has not recognised all of the deferred tax liability in respect of distributable reserves of its subsidiaries because  
it controls them and only part of the temporary differences are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. The temporary 
differences for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to US$1,723 million (2016: US$1,949 million). 216

(E) CORPORATE INCOME TAX (‘IMPUESTO SOBRE LA RENTA’ OR ‘ISR’) AND SPECIAL MINING RIGHT (‘SMR’) 
The Group’s principal operating subsidiaries are Mexican residents for taxation purposes. The rate of current corporate 
income tax is 30%.
During 2016 the Mexican Internal Revenue Law granted to taxpayers a credit in respect of an excise tax (Special Tax on 
Production and Services, or IEPS for its acronym in Spanish) paid when purchasing diesel used for general machinery and certain 
mining vehicles. The credit can be applied against either the Group’s own corporate income tax or the income tax withheld from 
third parties. The credit is calculated on an entity-by-entity basis and expires one year after the purchase of the diesel. In the  
year ended 31 December 2017, the Group applied a credit of US$23.2 million (2016: US$19.1 million) in respect of the year and 
recognised a deferred tax asset of US$2.9 million (2016: US$4.8 million) in respect of the IEPS incurred in 2017 and expected to 
be applied during 2018. As the IEPS deduction is itself taxable, the deferred tax asset is recognised at 70% of the IEPS carried 
forward. The net amount applied by the Group is presented in the reconciliation of the effective tax rate in note 10(b).
The SMR states that the owners of mining titles and concessions are subject to pay an annual mining right of 7.5% of the profit 
derived from the extractive activities and is considered as income tax under IFRS. The SMR allows as a credit the payment  
of mining concessions rights up to the amount of SMR payable The 7.5% tax apply to a base of income before interest, annual 
inflation adjustment, taxes paid on the regular activity, depreciation and amortisation, as defined by the new ISR. This SMR  
can be credited against the corporate income tax of the same fiscal year and its payment must be remitted no later than the 
last business day of March of the following year .
11. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the 
weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the period. 
The Company has no dilutive potential Ordinary Shares.

During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group capitalised US$11.4 million of borrowing costs within construction in 
progress (2016: US$18.2 million). Borrowing costs were capitalised at the rate of 5.78% (2016: 5.78%).
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
As at 31 December 2017 and 2016, the carrying amount of mining assets was fully supported by the higher of value in use and fair 
value less cost of disposal (FVLCD) computation of their recoverable amount. Value in use and FVLCD was determined based on 
the net present value of the future estimated cash flows expected to be generated from the continued use of the CGUs. For both 
valuation approaches management used price assumptions of US$1,300/ounce and US$19/ounce (2016: US$1,250/ounce and 
US$18/ounce) for gold and silver, respectively. Management considers that the models supporting the carrying amounts are most 
sensitive to commodity price assumptions and have therefore performed a sensitivity analysis for those CGUs, where a reasonable 
possible change in prices could lead to impairment. Management has considered a low sensitivity by decreasing gold and silver 
prices by 5% (2016: gold and silver 10%) and a high sensitivity by decreasing gold and silver prices by 10% (2016: gold 15% and 
silver 20%). As at 31 December 2017 no impairment resulted in those CGU tested (2016: San Julián US$84.3 million under high 
sensitivity; US$nil under low sensitivity and Herradura US$109.6 million under high sensitivity; US$nil under low sensitivity).

quoted shares.

14. SILVERSTREAM CONTRACT
On 31 December 2007, the Group entered into an agreement with Peñoles through which it is entitled to receive the proceeds 
received by the Peñoles Group in respect of the refined silver sold from the Sabinas Mine (‘Sabinas’), a base metals mine  
owned and operated by the Peñoles Group, for an upfront payment of US$350 million. In addition, a per ounce cash payment of 
US$2.00 in years one to five and US$5.00 thereafter (subject to an inflationary adjustment that commenced from 31 December 
2013) is payable to Peñoles. The cash payment per ounce for the year ended 31 December 2017 was US$5.20 per ounce (2016: 
US$5.15 per ounce). Under the contract, the Group has the option to receive a net cash settlement from Peñoles attributable  
to the silver produced and sold from Sabinas, to take delivery of an equivalent amount of refined silver or to receive settlement 
in the form of both cash and silver . If, by 31 December 2032, the amount of silver produced by Sabinas is less than 60 million 
ounces, a further payment is due from Peñoles of US$1 per ounce of shortfall.
The Silverstream contract represents a derivative financial instrument which has been recorded at fair value and classified  
within non-current and current assets as appropriate. The term of the derivative is based on Sabinas life of mine which is 
currently 38 years. Changes in the contract’s fair value, other than those represented by the realisation of the asset through the 
receipt of either cash or refined silver, are charged or credited to the income statement. In the year ended 31 December 2017 
total proceeds received in cash were US$43.3 million (2016: US$47.5 million) of which, US$5.9 million was in respect of proceeds 
receivable as at 31 December 2016 (2015: US$2.8 million). Cash received in respect of the year of US$37.3 million (2016: US$44.8 
million) corresponds to 3.6 million ounces of payable silver (2016: 3.8 million ounces). As at 31 December 2017, a further US$4.9 
million (2016: US$5.9 million) of cash receivable corresponding to 422,375 ounces of silver is due (2016: 538,756 ounces).
The US$113.6 million unrealised gain recorded in the income statement (2016: US$133.5 million gain) resulted from the 
updating of assumptions used to value the Silverstream contract. The most significant of these were the increase in the Sabinas 
mine silver reserves and resources, the unwinding of the discount, an increase in the forward price of silver, and the difference 
between the payments already received during the year ended 31 December 2017 and payments estimated in the valuation 
model as of 31 December 2016.

On 13 November 2013, the Group completed its offering of US$800 million aggregate principal amount of 5.500% Senior Notes 
due 2023 (the ‘Notes’).

Closing balance 799,046 798,027
1 Accrued interest is payable semi-annually on 13 May and 13 November .
The Group has the following restrictions derived from the issuance of the Senior Notes (the ‘Notes’):
CHANGE OF CONTROL:
Should the rating of the Senior Notes be downgraded as a result of a change of control (defined as the sale or transfer of 35% or 
more of the common shares; the transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the Group; starting a dissolution or liquidation 
process; or the loss of the majority in the Board of Directors) the Group is obligated to repurchase the Notes at an equivalent 
price of 101% of their nominal value plus the interest earnt at the repurchase date, if requested to do so by any creditor .
PLEDGE ON ASSETS:
The Group shall not pledge or allow a pledge on any property that may have a material impact on business performance (key 
assets). Nevertheless, the Group may pledge the aforementioned properties provided that the repayment of the Notes keeps 
the same level of priority as the pledge on those assets.
21. PROVISION FOR MINE CLOSURE COST
The provision represents the discounted values of the estimated cost to decommission and rehabilitate the mines at the 
estimated date of depletion of mine deposits. Uncertainties in estimating these costs include potential changes in regulatory 
requirements, decommissioning, dismantling, reclamation alternatives, timing, and the discount, foreign exchange and 
inflation rates applied. 
During the year, the Group refined its estimation of costs by further analysing the currency in which costs will be incurred. The 
Group has performed separate calculations of the provision by currency, discounting at corresponding rates. As at 31 December 
2017, the discount rates used in the calculation of the parts of the provision that relate to Mexican pesos range from 6.27% to 
7.97% (2016: range of 6.61% to 7.74%). The range for the current year parts that relate to US dollars range from 1.37% to 2.22% 
(2016: not applicable).
Mexican regulations regarding the decommissioning and rehabilitation of mines are limited and less developed in comparison to 
regulations in many other jurisdictions. It is the Group’s intention to rehabilitate the mines beyond the requirements of Mexican 
law, and estimated costs reflect this level of expense. The Group intends to fully rehabilitate the affected areas at the end of the 
life of the mines. 224

22. PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLANS
The Group has a defined contribution plan and a defined benefit plan. 
The defined contribution plan was established as from 1 July 2007 and consists of periodic contributions made by each non-
unionised worker and contributions made by the Group to the fund matching workers’ contributions, capped at 8% of the 
employee’s annual salary.
The defined benefit plan provides pension benefits based on each worker’s earnings and years of services provided by 
personnel hired through 30 June 2007 as well as statutory seniority premiums for both unionised and non-unionised workers. 
The overall investment policy and strategy for the Group’s defined benefit plan is guided by the objective of achieving an 
investment return which, together with contributions, ensures that there will be sufficient assets to pay pension benefits and 
statutory seniority premiums for non-unionised workers as they fall due while also mitigating the various risks of the plan. 
However, the portion of the plan related to statutory seniority premiums for unionised workers is not funded. The investment 
strategies for the plan are generally managed under local laws and regulations. The actual asset allocation is determined  
by current and expected economic and market conditions and in consideration of specific asset class risk in the risk profile. 
Within this framework, the Group ensures that the trustees consider how the asset investment strategy correlates with the 
maturity profile of the plan liabilities and the respective potential impact on the funded status of the plan, including potential 
short-term liquidity requirements. 
Death and disability benefits are covered through insurance policies. 225

22. PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLANS CONTINUED
The pension plan has not invested in any of the Group’s own financial instruments nor in properties or assets used by the Group.
A quantitative sensitivity analysis for significant assumptions as at 31 December 2017 is as shown below:

The sensitivity analysis above has been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on net defined benefit 
obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period. The pension plan 
is not sensitive to future changes in salaries other than in respect of inflation.

(B) OPERATING LEASES AS LESSEE
The Group has financial commitments in respect of non-cancellable operating leases for land, offices and equipment. These 
leases have renewal terms at the option of the lessee with future lease payments based on market prices at the time of renewal. 
There are no restrictions placed upon the Group by entering into these leases. 
The Group has put in place several arrangements to finance mine equipment through loans and the sale of mine equipment  
to contractors. In both cases, contractors are obligated to use these assets in rendering services to the Group as part of the 
mining work contract, during the term of financing or credit, which ranges from two to six years. The Group considers that the 
related mining work contracts contain embedded operating leases.
The future minimum rental commitments under these leases are as follows:

26. CONTINGENCIES
As of 31 December 2017, the Group has the following contingencies:
• The Group is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties.
• Tax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities (SAT, by its Spanish acronym) in respect of income taxes 
for five years following the date of the filing of corporate income tax returns, during which time the authorities have the 
right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest. Under certain circumstances, the reviews may 
cover longer periods.
 As such, there is a risk that transactions, and in particular related party transactions, that have not been challenged in the 
past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in the future. 
• There are currently a number of ongoing tax inspections that have been initiated by the SAT. No findings or claims have been 
communicated to the Company in respect of these, other than relating to Penmont as discussed below. It is not practical to 
determine the amount of any potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome arising from these or any future 
inspections that may be initiated. However, management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate 
and that the Group has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable. 228

CONTINUED
26. CONTINGENCIES CONTINUED
• With regards to Penmont tax audits, which commenced during 2015, the Company considers it completed the provision of  
all documentation required in order to demonstrate that all the 2012-2013 non-taxable income and tax deductions which are 
being challenged, are appropriate. Penmont formally filed a writ before the Mexican Taxpayers Ombudsman (PRODECON, per 
its Spanish acronym) requesting a conclusive agreement in the matter . SAT’s first, second and third response to the request 
detailed that, while the documentation provided was sufficient to demonstrate that all of non-taxable income and the majority 
of the tax deductions are correct, there are still two tax deductions to be approved. In this sense, discussion with the SAT 
continue, and as long as the conclusive agreement is still in progress, the current auditing process is suspended and the tax 
authorities cannot determine a tax deficiency until PRODECON issues the final agreement under the terms agreed between 
Penmont and the SAT.
• On 8 May 2008, the Company and Peñoles entered into the Separation Agreement (the ‘Separation Agreement’). This agreement 
relates to the separation of the Group and the Peñoles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship between the 
Fresnillo Group and the Peñoles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 (‘Admission’). The Separation Agreement 
provides for cross-indemnities between the Company and Peñoles so that, in the case of Peñoles, it is held harmless against 
losses, claims and liabilities (including tax liabilities) properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Group and, in 
the case of the Company, it is held harmless by Peñoles against losses, claims and liabilities which are not properly attributable 
to the precious metals business. Save for any liability arising in connection with tax, the aggregate liability of either party under 
the indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate.
• Peñoles has agreed to indemnify the Fresnillo Group in relation to: (i) any tax charge, subject to certain exceptions, the 
Company may incur as a result of the Pre-IPO Reorganisation (including as a result of a transaction following Admission  
of a member of the Fresnillo Group, provided that Peñoles has confirmed that the proposed transaction will not give rise  
to a tax charge, or as a result of a transaction of a member of the Peñoles Group on or after Admission), the Global Offer or 
Admission; and (ii) certain tax aspects of certain other pre-Admission transactions. Peñoles’ liability under these indemnities 
and in respect of general tax liabilities arising pre-Admission which are not properly attributable to the precious metals 
business of the Fresnillo Group shall not exceed US$500 million. If a member of the Fresnillo Group forming part of Peñoles’ 
tax consolidation pays an intra-Group dividend in excess of its net income tax account (‘Cuenta de Utilidad Fiscal Neta’ or 
‘CUFIN’) account after Admission and is relieved of tax as a result of the consolidation, it is required to pay Peñoles an 
amount in respect of that tax.
• On 30 November 2012, the Mexican government enacted a new federal labour law. During 2014 management implemented 
certain actions as a part of an ongoing process in order to manage the exposure resulting from the issuance of the new 
labour law including any potential impacts on the operations and financial position of the Group, however, management 
does not expect any potential contingency or significant effect on the Group’s financial statements as at 31 December 2017 
and going forward.
• New income tax and VAT legislation in respect of contractors came into effect on 1 January 2017, requiring management  
to ensure that contractors are compliant with their own tax obligations, including employment tax. This has created a new 
obligation for Fresnillo to obtain and retain sufficient evidence of contractors’ fiscal compliance in order to deduct costs 
related to the contractors for income tax purposes and to recover input VAT. In late 2017, the 2018 Federal Revenue Law 
clarified that if the online portal (established by the tax authorities to facilitate compliance) is used in 2018, it would be 
sufficient to discharge any 2017 compliance obligations. Management considers that it is well progressed in meeting  
its obligations for 2017 and does not consider that any significant economic exposure will arise as a result of this new 
legislation with respect to the current year .
• In regard to the ejido El Bajío matter previously reported by the Company:
 – In 2009 five members of the El Bajío agrarian community in the state of Sonora, who claimed rights over certain surface 
land in the proximity of the operations of Minera Penmont (‘Penmont’), submitted a legal claim before the Unitarian 
Agrarian Court (Tribunal Unitario Agrario) of Hermosillo, Sonora, to have Penmont vacate an area of this surface land.  
The land in dispute encompassed a portion of surface area where part of the operations of the Soledad-Dipolos mine are 
located. The litigation resulted in a definitive court order, pursuant to which Penmont was ordered to vacate 1,824 hectares 
of land. The disputed land was returned in July 2013, resulting in the suspension of operations at Soledad-Dipolos. 
 – The Agrarian Court noted in that same year that certain remediation activities were necessary to comply with the relevant 
regulatory requirements and requested the guidance of the Federal Environmental Agency (SEMARNAT) in this respect. 
The Agrarian Court further issued a procedural order in execution of his ruling determining, amongst other aspects, that 
Penmont must remediate the lands to the state they were in before Penmont’s occupation.
 – In the opinion of the Company, this procedural order was excessive since this level of remediation was not part of the 
original agrarian ruling and also because the procedural order appeared not to consider the fact that Penmont conducted 
its activities pursuant to valid mining concessions and environmental impact permits. In December 2016, the Agrarian 
Court issued a subsequent procedural order in which the Court recognised that Penmont complied with the agrarian 
ruling by having returned the land in dispute and, furthermore, that remediation activities are to be conducted in 
accordance with Federal environmental guidelines and regulations, as supervised by the competent Federal authorities. 
Remediation activities in this respect are pending as the agrarian members have not yet permitted Penmont physical 
access to the lands. Penmont has already presented a conceptual mine closure and remediation plan before the Agrarian 
Court in respect of the approximately 300 hectares where Penmont conducted mining activities. The agrarian community 
Ejido El Bajío appealed this procedural order from the Agrarian Court and a Federal District Court denied this appeal.  
The agrarian community has presented in the month of August 2017 a further and last recourse against this ruling by  
the Federal District Court and the final result is pending. 229

 – In addition, and as also previously reported by the Company, claimants in the El Bajío matter presented other claims 
against occupation agreements they entered into with Penmont, covering land parcels separate from the land described 
above. Penmont has no significant mining operations or specific geological interest in the affected parcels and these 
lands are therefore not considered strategic for Penmont. As previously reported, the Agrarian Court issued rulings 
declaring such occupation agreements over those land parcels to be null and void and that Penmont must remediate 
such lands to the state that they were in before Penmont’s occupation as well as returning any minerals extracted from 
this area. Given that Penmont has not conducted significant mining operations or has specific geological interest in 
these land parcels, any contingency relating to such land parcels is not considered material by the Company. The case 
relating to the claims over these land parcels remains subject to finalisation. 
 – Various claims and counterclaims have been made between the relevant parties in the El Bajío matter . There remains 
significant uncertainty as to the finalisation and ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings.

There have been no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and no transfers into and out of 
Level 3 fair value measurements. A reconciliation of the opening balance to the closing balance for Level 3 financial instruments

Realised embedded derivatives during the year (5,807) (500)
Balance at 31 December 6,511 (2,750)
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in  
a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
The following valuation techniques were used to estimate the fair values:
OPTION AND FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS 
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with 
investment grade credit ratings. The foreign currency forward (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot 
exchange rates, the yield curves of the respective currencies as well as the currency basis spreads between the respective 
currencies. The foreign currency option contracts are valued using the Black Scholes model, the significant inputs to which 
include observable spot exchange rates, interest rates and the volatility of the currency.
OPTION COMMODITY CONTRACTS
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment 
grade credit ratings. The option commodity (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot commodity prices, the yield 
curves of the respective commodity as well as the commodity basis spreads between the respective commodities. The option 
contracts are valued using the Black Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot commodities price, 
interest rates and the volatility of the commodity.
SILVERSTREAM CONTRACT
The fair value of the Silverstream contract is determined using a valuation model including unobservable inputs (Level 3). This 
derivative has a term of over 20 years and the valuation model utilises a number of inputs that are not based on observable 
market data due to the nature of these inputs and/or the duration of the contract. Inputs that have a significant effect on the 
recorded fair value are the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine over the contract life, the 
future price of silver, future foreign exchange rates between the Mexican peso and US dollar, future inflation and the discount 
rate used to discount future cash flows.
The estimate of the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine requires estimates of the recoverable 
silver reserves and resources, the related production profile based on the Sabinas mine plan and the expected recovery of  
silver from ore mined. The estimation of these inputs is subject to a range of operating assumptions and may change over time. 
Estimates of reserves and resources are updated annually by Peñoles, the operator and sole interest holder in the Sabinas mine 
and provided to the Company. The production profile and estimated payable silver that will be recovered from ore mined is based 
on the latest plan and estimates, also provided to the Company by Peñoles. The inputs assume no interruption in production over 
the life of the Silverstream contract and production levels which are consistent with those achieved in recent years
Management regularly assesses a range of reasonably possible alternatives for those significant unobservable inputs described 
above, and determines their impact on the total fair value. The significant unobservable inputs are not interrelated. The fair 
value of the Silverstream is not significantly sensitive to a reasonable change in future exchange rates, however, it is to a 
reasonable change in future silver price, future inflation and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows.
For further information relating to the Silverstream contract see note 14. The sensitivity of the valuation to the inputs relating 
to market risks, being the price of silver, foreign exchange rates, inflation and the discount rate is disclosed in note 31. 236

QUOTED INVESTMENTS:
The fair value of available-for-sale financial assets is derived from quoted market prices in active markets. (Level 1)
INTEREST-BEARING LOANS
The fair value of the Group’s interest-bearing loan, is derived from quoted market prices in active markets. (Level 1)
EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES WITHIN SALES CONTRACTS:
Sales of concentrates, precipitates and doré bars are ‘provisionally priced’ and revenue is initially recognised using this 
provisional price and the Group’s best estimate of the contained metal. Revenue is subject to final price and metal content 
adjustments subsequent to the date of delivery (see note 2(p)). This price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative 
and is separated from the sales contract.
At each reporting date, the provisionally priced metal content is revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotational 
period stipulated in the relevant sales contract. The selling price of metals can be reliably measured as these metals are actively 
traded on international exchanges but the estimated metal content is a non-observable input to this valuation (Level 3).
At 31 December 2017 the fair value of embedded derivatives within sales contracts was US$6.5 million (2016: US$(2.7) million). 
The revaluation effects of embedded derivatives arising from these sales contracts are recorded as an adjustment to revenues.
(C) DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group enters into certain forward and option contracts in order to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk 
associated with costs incurred in Mexican pesos and other currencies. The Group also enters into option contracts to manage 
its exposure to commodity price risk as described in note 2(s).

31. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
OVERVIEW
The Group’s principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise trade receivables, cash, available-for-
sale financial assets, interest-bearing loans and trade payables.
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
• Market risk, including foreign currency, commodity price, interest rate, inflation rate and equity price risks;
• Credit risk; and
• Liquidity risk.
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework.
The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate 
risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed 
regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management 
standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees 
understand their roles and obligations.
The Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk 
management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks 
faced by the Group. The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and 
ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee. 238

31. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
OVERVIEW CONTINUED
(A) MARKET RISK
Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates will 
affect the Group’s income or the value of its financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, 
while optimising the return on risk.
In the following tables, the effect on equity excludes the changes in retained earnings as a direct result of changes in profit 
before tax.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK
The Group has financial instruments that are denominated in Mexican peso, euro and Swedish krona which are exposed to 
foreign currency risk. Transactions in currencies other than the US dollar include the purchase of services, fixed assets, spare 
parts and the payment of dividends. As a result, the Group has financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other 
than functional currency, and holds cash and cash equivalents in Mexican peso.
In order to manage the Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk on expenditure denominated in currencies other than  
the US dollar, the Group has entered into certain forward and option derivative contracts with maturity dates from 2018  
(see note 30 for additional detail).
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding Silverstream) to a 
reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso, reflecting the impact on the 
Group’s profit before tax and equity, with all other variables held constant. It is assumed that the same percentage change  
in exchange rates is applied to all applicable periods for the purposes of calculating the sensitivity with relation to derivative 
financial instruments.

the Group’s results. These prices are subject to global economic conditions and industry-related cycles.
The Group uses derivative instruments to hedge against an element of gold, zinc and lead price.
The table below reflects the aggregate sensitivity of financial assets and liabilities (excluding Silverstream) to a reasonably possible 
change in commodities prices, reflecting the impact on the Group’s profit before tax with all other variables held constant.

INTEREST RATE RISK
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or  
the fair values of its financial instruments, principally relating to the cash balances and the Silverstream contract held at the 
balance sheet date. Interest-bearing loans are at a fixed rate, therefore the possibility of a change in interest rate only impacts 
its fair value but not its carrying amount. Therefore, interest-bearing loans and loans from related parties are excluded from 
the table below.

(B) CREDIT RISK
Exposure to credit risk arises as a result of transactions in the Group’s ordinary course of business and is applicable to all 
financial assets and derivative financial instruments. The financial assets are trade and other receivables, cash and cash 
equivalents, short-term investments, the Silverstream contract and available-for-sale financial assets.
The Group’s policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of counterparties’ failure to honour their obligations. Individual 
exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counter-party. The Group’s 
financial assets are with counterparties with what the Group considers to have an appropriate credit rating. As disclosed in note 27, 
the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties. At each balance sheet date, the Group’s 
financial assets were neither impaired nor past due, other than ‘Other receivables’ as disclosed in note 16. The Group’s policies  
are aimed at minimising losses from foreign currency hedging contracts. The Company’s foreign currency hedging contracts are 
entered into with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings.
The Group has a high concentration of trade receivables with one counterparty Met-Mex Peñoles, the Group’s primary customer 
throughout 2017 and 2016. A further concentration of credit risk arises from the Silverstream contract. Both Met-Mex and the 
counterparty to the Silverstream contract are subsidiaries in the Peñoles group which currently owns 75% of the shares of the 
Company and is considered by management to be of appropriate credit rating. 242

31. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
OVERVIEW CONTINUED 
(B) CREDIT RISK CONTINUED
The Group’s surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V., which manages cash and cash 
equivalents, including short-term investments investing in a number of financial institutions. Accordingly, on an ongoing basis 
the Group deposits surplus funds with a range of financial institutions, depending on market conditions. In order to minimise 
exposure to credit risk, the Group only deposits surplus funds with financial institutions with a credit rating of MX-1 (Moody’s) 
and mxA-1+ (Standard and Poor’s) and above. As at 31 December 2017, the Group had concentrations of credit risk as 23% of 
surplus funds were deposited with one financial institution of which 17% was held in short-term Mexican government paper .
The maximum credit exposure at the reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in 
the relevant notes. See note 13 for the maximum credit exposure to available-for-sale financial assets, note 17 for short-term 
investments and cash and cash equivalents and note 27 for related party balances with Met-Mex. The maximum credit exposure 
with relation to the Silverstream contract is the value of the derivative as at 31 December 2017, being US$538.9 million (2016: 
US$467.5 million).
(C) LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using projected cash flows from operations and by monitoring the maturity 
of both its financial assets and liabilities.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.

exercised during 2018 as at 31 December 2017 and during 2017 as at 31 December 2016, either by the Group or counterparty.
Management considers that the Group has adequate current assets and forecast cash from operations to manage liquidity 
risks arising from current liabilities and non-current liabilities.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital 
ratios that support its business and maximise shareholder value. Management considers capital to consist of equity and certain 
interest-bearing loans, including loans from related parties, as disclosed in the balance sheet, excluding net unrealised gains 
or losses on revaluation of cash flow hedges and available-for-sale financial assets. In order to ensure an appropriate return for 
shareholder’s capital invested in the Group management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions 
and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable. The 
Group’s dividend policy is based on the profitability of the business and underlying growth in earnings of the Group, as well as 
its capital requirements and cash flows, including cash flows from the Silverstream.
In managing its capital, the Group considers its cash and other liquid asset position, as set out below:

The financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue by the Board of 
Directors of Fresnillo plc on 26 February 2018.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(A) BASIS OF PREPARATION AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Company for the years ended 
31 December 2017 and 2016, and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain derivative financial 
instruments and available-for-sale financial instruments which have been measured at fair value.
The financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America (US dollars or US$) and all monetary 
amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand (US$’000) except when otherwise indicated.
The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements are set out below. These 
accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated.
(B) CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting policies applied are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the separate financial statements for 
the year ended 31 December 2016.
NEW STANDARDS, INTERPRETATIONS AND AMENDMENTS (NEW STANDARDS) ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY
The Company has adopted from 1 January 2017 Amendments to IAS 7. The amendments require an entity to provide disclosures 
that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities. The Company also  
has adopted Amendments to IAS 12. The amendments clarify the accounting for deferred tax where an asset is measured at  
fair value and that fair value is below the asset’s tax base. They also clarify certain other aspects of accounting for deferred tax 
assets. This amendment had no impact in the financial information of the Company.
Other than the above mentioned amendment there were no significant new standards that the Company was required to adopt 
effective from 1 January 2017.
STANDARDS, INTERPRETATIONS AND AMENDMENTS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE
The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Company’s financial 
statements are disclosed below. The Company intends to adopt these standards, as applicable to the Company’s financial 
statements, when they become effective, except where indicated.
IFRS 9 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial 
liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets. The Company has 
decided not to adopt IFRS 9 until it becomes mandatory on 1 January 2018. The Company does not expect the new guidance  
to have a significant impact on the classification and measurement of its financial assets for the following reasons:
CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT
The equity instruments that are currently classified as available-for-sale financial assets satisfy the conditions for classification as 
at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). Under IFRS 9, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are not recycled to 
the income statement. There are no other significant changes to the accounting for these assets. 
There will be no impact on the Company’s accounting for financial liabilities, as the new requirements only affect the accounting 
for financial liabilities that are designated at fair value through profit or loss and the Group does not have any such liabilities.
DERECOGNITION
The derecognition rules have been transferred from IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and have 
not been changed.

FRESNILLO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

STRATEGIC 
REPORT
CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
IMPAIRMENT
IFRS 9 requires the Company to now use an expected credit loss model for its trade receivables measured at amortised cost, 
either on a 12-month or lifetime basis. Given the short-term nature of these receivables, the Company does not expect these 
changes will have a significant impact. Regarding loans receivables the Company has evaluated the expect credit loss on a 
12-month basis. No material loss has been determined.
PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE
The new standard also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation. These are expected to 
change the nature and extent of the Company’s disclosures about its financial instruments particularly in the year of the 
adoption of the new standard.
IFRS 15 REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS
The IASB has issued a new standard for the recognition of revenue arising from contracts with customers. The new revenue 
standard will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS. 
The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer .  
In the case of royalties the revenue is recognised based on the sales-or usage-based royalties criteria. The Company has evaluated 
recognition and measurement of revenue based on the five-step model in IFRS 15 and has not identified any financial impacts, 
hence no adjustments are expected to result from the adoption of IFRS 15. The Company has elected to adopt the new standard 
from 1 January 2018 applying the modified retrospective adoption method.
IFRS 16 LEASES
IFRS 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with  
a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. A lessee is required to recognise a right-of-use asset 
representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. 
IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17. Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify  
its leases as operating leases or finance leases, and to account for those two types of leases differently. These amendments  
are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier application is permitted. However, as there  
are several interactions between IFRS 16 and IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers, early application is restricted  
to entities that also early adopt IFRS 15. The Company has decided to adopt the standard when it became effective.
IFRIC 22 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AND ADVANCE CONSIDERATION
IFRIC 22 clarifies which exchange rate to use in reporting foreign currency transactions when payment is made or received in 
advance. The interpretation requires the Company to determine a ‘date of transaction’ for the purposes of selecting an exchange 
rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income. In case there are multiple payments or receipts in 
advance, the entity should determine a date of the transaction for each flow of advance consideration. IFRIC 22 is applicable for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and earlier adoption is permitted. The interpretation is not expected to have 
any impact in the financial information of the Company.
IFRIC 23 UNCERTAINTY OVER INCOME TAX TREATMENTS
This Interpretation clarifies how to apply the recognition and measurement requirements in IAS 12 when there is uncertainty 
over income tax treatments. The interpretation is to be applied to the determination of taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, 
unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. Application of  
tax law can be complex and requires judgement to assess risk and estimate outcomes where the amount of tax payable or 
recoverable is uncertain. The Company is working to identify potential uncertainties based on previous resolutions of tax 
authorities. IFRIC 23 is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier adoption is permitted.
The IASB has issued other amendments to standards, including those resulting from improvements to IFRSs that management 
considers do not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Company. 
The Company has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective.
(C) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the 
financial statements. These judgements and estimates are based on management’s knowledge of the relevant facts and 
circumstances, with regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial 
statements. Information about such judgements and estimates is in the accounting policies and the notes to the financial 
statements. 250

NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
(C) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS CONTINUED
JUDGEMENTS
Areas of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in 
the financial statements are:
• Determination of functional currency (note 2(d)):
 The determination of functional currency requires management judgement, particularly where there may be more than one 
currency in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates.
• Contingencies (note 13):
 By their nature, contingencies will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur . The 
assessment of the existence and potential quantum of contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgement 
and the use of estimates regarding the outcome of future events.
ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
Significant areas of estimation uncertainty made by management in preparing the financial information statements include:
• Impairment of available-for-sale financial assets (notes 2(g) and 6):
 The Company classifies certain financial asset as available-for-sale and recognises movements in their fair value in equity. 
When the fair value declines, management makes an assessment of the decline in value to determine whether it is an 
impairment that should be recognised in profit or loss.
• Impairment and subsequent reversal of impairment of investments in subsidiaries (notes 2(e) and 5):
 The Company assesses investments in subsidiaries annually to determine whether any indication of impairment exists. 
Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made, which is considered to be 
the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) and the value in use. Due to the nature of the subsidiaries, the 
assessment of the recoverable amount is generally determined based on the net present value of future cash flows related 
to the subsidiaries requiring the use of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity prices, reserves and 
resources and the associate production profiles, discount rates, future capital requirements, exploration potential and 
operating performance. These cash flows are discounted using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments  
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The determination of that rate requires certain judgements.
 Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, the Company assesses at the end of each reporting period 
whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication 
exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of that investment, requiring similar estimates and assumptions  
as those for determining an impairment charge. At 31 December 2017 the Company reversed impairment losses  
of US$102.8 million (2016: US$997.9 million) to recognised a cumulative impairment relating to subsidiaries of 
US$436.4 million (2016: US$539.2 million).
(D) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The Company’s financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company. The 
functional currency for the Company is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company are translated at the exchange rate 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the 
rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary 
items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates 
of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars using 
the exchange rate at the date when the fair valued is determined.
(E) INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES
Subsidiaries are entities which the Company controls due to it being exposed to, or has the right to, variable returns from its 
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Investments in subsidiaries 
are recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment. Impairment charges and reversals, up to the value of the 
merger reserve, are reclassified from retained earnings to the merger reserve.
When the Company increases its capital investment in or where there is a return of share capital from its subsidiaries, such 
movements are recognised as an addition to, or return of the original cost recognised in investment in subsidiaries. 251
FRESNILLO PLC
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
FRESNILLO 
TODAY
STRATEGIC 
REPORT
CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment. Where an indicator 
of impairment exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary is made, which is considered to  
be the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use. The Company usually determines fair value based on 
the net present value of the future cash flows related to its subsidiaries. If the carrying amount of an investment exceeds the 
recoverable amount, a provision is recorded in the income statement to reflect the investment at the recoverable amount.
Where an impairment charge has previously been recognised, an assessment is made at the end of each reporting period 
whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication 
exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount is made. An impairment loss is reversed to profit or loss to the extent that the 
increased carrying value of the investment in subsidiary does not exceed that that would have been determined had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. 
(F) FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes party to contracts that give rise to them and are classified as 
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; loans and receivables; held to maturity investments; or available-for-sale 
financial assets, as appropriate. The Company determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and 
re-evaluates this designation at each balance sheet date. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured  
at fair value, plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
The Company recognises financial liabilities on its balance sheet when, and only when, it becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. Financial liabilities are classified at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, 
or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are initially 
recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, including any transaction costs incurred.
Financial assets are offset with liabilities and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable 
right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously.
FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS
Financial assets and liabilities classified as held-for-trading and other assets or liabilities designated as fair value transactions 
through profit and loss at inception are included in this category. Financial assets or liabilities are classified as held-for-trading 
if they are acquired or incurred for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also classified as held-for-trading 
unless they are designated as hedging instruments, as defined by IAS 39. Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement.
LOANS AND RECEIVABLES
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-
for-sale.
After initial measurement such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any 
allowance for impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or 
impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables. 
Non-current receivables are stated at amortised cost.
LOANS AND BORROWINGS
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
(EIR) method. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the income statement. Gains and losses are recognised in 
the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.
The Company adjusts the carrying amount of the financial liability to reflect actual and revised estimated cash flows. The 
carrying amount is recalculated by computing the present value of estimated future cash flows at the financial instrument’s 
original effective interest rate or, when applicable, the revised effective interest rate. Any adjustment is recognised in profit or 
loss as income or expense.
This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans. For more information refer note 11. 252

NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
CONTINUED
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
(F) FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CONTINUED
AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS
Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified  
in any of the preceding categories and are not held-to-maturity investments.
Available-for-sale financial assets represent equity investments that have a quoted market price in an active market; therefore 
a fair value can be reliably measured. After initial measurement, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value 
with mark-to-market unrealised gains or losses being recognised as other comprehensive income in the available-for-sale 
reserve until the financial asset is derecognised.
Financial assets classified as available-for-sale are de-recognised when they are sold, and all the risks and rewards of ownership 
have been transferred. When financial assets are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are included 
in the income statement within other operating income or expense.
DE-RECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
A financial asset or liability is generally de-recognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms 
of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs 
or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability (or part of a financial liability) extinguished or transferred to 
another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in 
the income statement.
(G) IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of 
financial assets is impaired.
ASSETS CARRIED AT AMORTISED COST
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the 
amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future 
cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective 
interest rate (i.e., the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through 
use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss.
The Company first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are 
individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined 
that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset 
is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively 
assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues 
to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an 
event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent 
reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does 
not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of 
insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Company will not be able to collect all of the amounts due 
under the original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. 
Impaired receivables are derecognised when they are assessed as uncollectible.
AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS
If an available-for-sale financial asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principal 
payment and amortisation) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement, 
is transferred from equity to the income statement. In assessing whether there is an impairment, the Company considers 
whether a decline in fair value is either significant or prolonged by considering the size of the decline in this value, the historic 
volatility in changes in fair value and the duration of the sustained decline. Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified 
as available-for-sale are not recognised in the income statement. 253

(H) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits 
held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in 
value. Short-term deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and four months. For the 
purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
(I) SHARE CAPITAL
Ordinary shares issued by the Company are recorded at the net proceeds received, which is the fair value of the consideration 
received less costs that are incurred in connection with the share issue. The nominal par value of the shares issued is taken  
to the share capital account and any excess is recorded in the share premium account, including the costs that were incurred 
with the share issue.
(J) REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue can  
be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received excluding discounts, rebates, and other 
sales taxes.
TRADEMARK ROYALTIES
Trademark royalty income is recognised only at the time when it is probable that the amounts related to certain rights will 
be received
INTEREST INCOME
Interest income is recognised as interest accrues (using the effective interest method; i.e. the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the 
financial asset).
DIVIDEND INCOME
Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive the payment is established.
(K) INCOME TAX
CURRENT INCOME TAX
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered 
from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
DEFERRED INCOME TAX
Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:
• Where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor 
taxable profit loss; and
• In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint 
ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and 
unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary 
differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except:
• Where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an 
asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the 
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
• In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests  
in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary 
differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it 
has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. 254

CONTINUED
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
(K) INCOME TAX CONTINUED
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset 
is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current 
tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same 
taxation authority.
(L) DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING
The Company enters into derivative contracts in order to manage certain market risks derived from changes in foreign 
exchange and commodity prices which impact the financial and business transactions of its subsidiaries. Such derivative 
financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when 
the fair value is negative.
In the Group’s consolidated financial statements certain of these derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges  
but for the purposes of the Company’s stand-alone financial statements the related hedged items are not held by the Company, 
so do not qualify as cash flow hedges.
Any gains and losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
are taken directly to the income statement.
Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies (such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value) applicable 
to the specific type of derivative instrument. The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current 
forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES
Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives at the date that the Company first becomes party to the 
contract, with reassessment only if there is a change to the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows. Embedded 
derivatives which are not clearly and closely related to the underlying asset, liability or transaction are separated and 
accounted for as stand-alone derivatives.
(M) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
The Company measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair values of financial instruments 
measured at amortised cost are disclosed in notes 17 and 18.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction 
to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: 
• In the principal market for the asset or liability; or
• In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Company.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the 
asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits 
by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest 
and best use.
The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available 
to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. 255

STRATEGIC 
REPORT
CORPORATE

FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the 
fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as 
a whole:
Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 —  Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly  
or indirectly observable.
Level 3 —  Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines 
whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the 
nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. Further 
information on fair values is described in note 17.
(N) DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION
Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in 
which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
Mexican Income Tax Law establishes a 10% withholding on earnings from 2014 and thereafter, for dividends paid to foreign 
residents and Mexican individuals. 
Dividends paid are not subject to income tax if paid from the Net Tax Profit Account (CUFIN). Dividends paid that exceed CUFIN 
are subject to an income tax payable at a rate of 30%. The tax is payable by the Company and may be credited against the 
normal income tax payable by the Company in the year in which the dividends are paid or in the following two years. Dividends 
paid from earnings previously taxed are not subject to any withholding or additional tax payment.

During 2017 and 2016 the Company has identified some indicators which have caused management to reverse previously 
recognised impairment losses on its investments in subsidiaries. The Company has calculated the recoverable amount of  
its investments in subsidiaries as at 31 December 2017 and as a result has recognised a reversal of previously recognised 
impairment loss amounting to US$102.8 million (2016: US$997.9 million). The recoverable amount was estimated based on 
the Fair Value Less Cost of Disposal (FVLCD) model (2016: FVLCD).
The following tables provide relevant information in respect of each impaired subsidiary:
Year ended 31 December 2017
Current year 
Impairment reversal 
US$ thousand

(102,789) 436,454
In determining FVLCD it is necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate future cash flows including reserves and 
resources volumes and related production profile, price assumptions, cost estimates and discount rate. Accordingly, the fair 
value is categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The price assumptions used to calculate FVLCD are determined  
with reference analysts’ consensus of long-term prices. As at 31 December 2017, the Company used price assumptions of 
US$1,300/ounce and US$19/ounce for gold and silver, respectively. 257

As at 31 December 2016 management calculated the recoverable amount using FVLCD methodology. Management considers 
that the model supporting the determination of FVLCD is most sensitive to commodity price assumptions. The price assumptions 
used to calculate FVLCD are determined with reference analysts’ consensus of long-term prices. As at 31 December 2016, the 
Company used price assumptions of US$1,250/ounce and US$18/ounce for gold and silver, respectively.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
As at 31 December 2017 management has performed a sensitivity analysis for those subsidiaries where cumulative impairment 
may be affected by a reasonably possible change in silver and gold prices. Management has considered a decrease in silver and 
gold of 10% (2016: 20% and 15%, respectively). The sensitivity resulted in an additional impairment on Minera Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V. 
of US$448.2 million (2016: US$622.3 million), Minera Mexicana la Ciénega, S.A. de C.V. US$110.6 million (2016: US$85.7 million) 
and Minera Saucito, S.A. de C.V. US$49.5 million (2016: US$nil).

At 31 December 2017, several investments in quoted shares were valued below the cost paid by the Group. This decrease has 
been continued throughout the past 12-month period, which is considered to be prolonged, therefore an impairment of US$0.04 
million was recognised as other expenses in the income statement. During 2016 no impairment arose based on the investment 
in quoted shares.
The fair value of the available-for-sale financial assets is determined by reference to published price quotations in an active

RESERVES
SHARE PREMIUM
This reserve records the consideration premium for shares issued at a value that exceeds their nominal value.
MERGER RESERVE
The merger reserve represents the difference between the value of the net assets acquired as part of the pre-IPO 
reorganisation and the nominal value of the shares issued pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Movements in this reserve 
during 2017 and 2016 represent the impairment losses and reversals of the carrying value of Fresnillo’s investments in 
subsidiaries transferred from retained earnings.
AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS RESERVE
This reserve records fair value changes on available-for-sale investments, net of tax. On disposal or on impairment, the 
cumulative changes in fair value are recycled to the income statement.

The Group has the following restrictions derived from the issuance of the senior notes (the ‘Notes’):
CHANGE OF CONTROL: 
Should the rating of the senior Notes be downgraded as a result of a change of control (defined as the sale or transfer of 35% or 
more of the common shares; the transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the Group; starting a dissolution or liquidation 
process; or the loss of the majority in the Board of Directors) the Group is obligated to repurchase the notes at an equivalent 
price of 101% of their nominal value plus the interest earnt at the repurchase date, if requested to do so by any creditor .
PLEDGE ON ASSETS: 
The Group shall not pledge or allow a pledge on any property that may have a material impact on business performance (key 
assets). Nevertheless, the Group may pledge the aforementioned properties provided that the repayment of the Notes keeps 
the same level of priority as the pledge on those assets.

13. CONTINGENCIES
As of 31 December 2017 the Company has the following contingencies:
• The Company is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties.
• Tax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities in respect of income taxes for five years following the  
date of the filing of the corporate income tax return, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional  
tax assessments including penalties and interest. Under certain circumstances the reviews may cover longer periods.
 As such, there is a risk that transactions, and in particular related party transactions, that have not been challenged in  
the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in the future.
• There are currently a number of ongoing tax inspections that have been initiated by the SAT in respect of certain subsidiaries 
of the Company. No findings or claims have been communicated to the Company in respect of these, other than relating  
to Penmont as discussed below. It is not practical to determine the amount of any potential claims or the likelihood of any 
unfavourable outcome arising from these or any future inspections that may be initiated. However, management believes 
that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Group has complied with all regulations and paid 
or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable.
• With regards to Penmont tax audits, which commenced during 2015, the Company considers it completed the provision of  
all documentation required in order to demonstrate that all the 2012-2013 non-taxable income and tax deductions which  
are being challenged, are appropriate. Penmont formally filed a writ before the Mexican Taxpayers Ombudsman (PRODECON 
per its Spanish acronym) requesting a conclusive agreement in the matter . SAT’s first, second and third response to the 
request detailed that, while the documentation provided was sufficient to demonstrate that all of non-taxable income and  
the majority of the tax deductions are correct, there are still two tax deductions to be approved. In this sense, discussion with 
the SAT continue, and as long as the conclusive agreement is still in progress, the current auditing process is suspended and 
the tax authorities cannot determine a tax deficiency until PRODECON issues the final agreement under the terms agreed 
between Penmont and the SAT.
• On 8 May 2008, the Company and Peñoles entered into the Separation Agreement (the ‘Separation Agreement’). This 
agreement relates to the separation of the Fresnillo Group (the ’Group’) and the Peñoles Group and governs certain aspects 
of the relationship between the Fresnillo Group and the Peñoles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 
(‘Admission’). The Separation Agreement provides for cross-indemnities between the Company and Peñoles so that, in the 
case of Peñoles, it is held harmless against losses, claims and liabilities (including tax liabilities) properly attributable to the 
precious metals business of the Group and, in the case of the Company, it is held harmless by Peñoles against losses, claims 
and liabilities which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business. Save for any liability arising in connection 
with tax, the aggregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate.
• Peñoles has agreed to indemnify the Fresnillo Group in relation to: (i) any tax charge, subject to certain exceptions, the 
Company may incur as a result of the Pre-IPO Reorganisation (including as a result of a transaction following Admission  
of a member of the Fresnillo Group, provided that Peñoles has confirmed that the proposed transaction will not give rise  
to a tax charge, or as a result of a transaction of a member of the Peñoles Group on or after Admission), the Global Offer or 
Admission; and (ii) certain tax aspects of certain other pre-Admission transactions. Peñoles’ liability under these indemnities 
and in respect of general tax liabilities arising pre-Admission which are not properly attributable to the precious metals 
business of the Fresnillo Group shall not exceed US$500 million. If a member of the Fresnillo Group forming part of Peñoles’ 
tax consolidation pays an intra-Group dividend in excess of its net income tax account (‘Cuenta de Utilidad Fiscal Neta’ or 
‘CUFIN’) account after Admission and is relieved of tax as a result of the consolidation, it is required to pay Peñoles an 
amount in respect of that tax.
• New income tax and VAT legislation in respect of contractors came into effect on 1 January 2017, requiring management  
to ensure that contractors are compliant with their own tax obligations, including employment tax. This has created a new 
obligation for Fresnillo to obtain and retain sufficient evidence of contractors’ fiscal compliance in order to deduct costs 
related to the contractors for income tax purposes and to recover input VAT. In late 2017, the 2018 Federal Revenue Law 
clarified that if the online portal (established by the tax authorities to facilitate compliance) is used in 2018, it would be 
sufficient to discharge any 2017 compliance obligations. Management considers that it is well progressed in meeting its 
obligations for 2017 and does not consider that any significant economic exposure will arise as a result of this new 
legislation with respect to the current year .
• In regard to the ejido El Bajío matter previously reported by the Company:
 – In 2009 five members of the El Bajío agrarian community in the state of Sonora, who claimed rights over certain surface 
land in the proximity of the operations of Minera Penmont (‘Penmont’), submitted a legal claim before the Unitarian 
Agrarian Court (Tribunal Unitario Agrario) of Hermosillo, Sonora, to have Penmont vacate an area of this surface land.  
The land in dispute encompassed a portion of surface area where part of the operations of the Soledad-Dipolos mine are 
located. The litigation resulted in a definitive court order, pursuant to which Penmont was ordered to vacate 1,824 hectares 
of land. The disputed land was returned in July 2013, resulting in the suspension of operations at Soledad-Dipolos. 262

NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

13. CONTINGENCIES CONTINUED
 – The Agrarian Court noted in that same year that certain remediation activities were necessary to comply with the 
relevant regulatory requirements and requested the guidance of the Federal Environmental Agency (SEMARNAT) in  
this respect. The Agrarian Court further issued a procedural order in execution of his ruling determining, amongst  
other aspects, that Penmont must remediate the lands to the state they were in before Penmont’s occupation.
 – In the opinion of the Company, this procedural order was excessive since this level of remediation was not part of  
the original agrarian ruling and also because the procedural order appeared not to consider the fact that Penmont 
conducted its activities pursuant to valid mining concessions and environmental impact permits. In December 2016,  
the Agrarian Court issued a subsequent procedural order in which the Court recognised that Penmont complied with  
the agrarian ruling by having returned the land in dispute and, furthermore, that remediation activities are to be 
conducted in accordance with Federal environmental guidelines and regulations, as supervised by the competent 
Federal authorities. Remediation activities in this respect are pending as the agrarian members have not yet permitted 
Penmont physical access to the lands. Penmont has already presented a conceptual mine closure and remediation plan 
before the Agrarian Court in respect of the approximately 300 hectares where Penmont conducted mining activities. The 
agrarian community Ejido El Bajío appealed this procedural order from the Agrarian Court and a Federal District Court 
denied this appeal. The agrarian community has presented in the month of August 2017 a further and last recourse 
against this ruling by the Federal District Court and the final result is pending.
 – In addition, and as also previously reported by the Company, claimants in the El Bajío matter presented other claims 
against occupation agreements they entered into with Penmont, covering land parcels separate from the land described 
above. Penmont has no significant mining operations or specific geological interest in the affected parcels and these 
lands are therefore not considered strategic for Penmont. As previously reported, the Agrarian Court issued rulings 
declaring such occupation agreements over those land parcels to be null and void and that Penmont must remediate 
such lands to the state that they were in before Penmont’s occupation as well as returning any minerals extracted from 
this area. Given that Penmont has not conducted significant mining operations or has specific geological interest in 
these land parcels, any contingency relating to such land parcels is not considered material by the Company. The case 
relating to the claims over these land parcels remains subject to finalisation.
 – Various claims and counterclaims have been made between the relevant parties in the El Bajío matter . There remains 
significant uncertainty as to the finalisation and ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings.

The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged  
in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
The following valuation techniques were used to estimate the fair values:
OPTIONS AND FORWARDS FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS
The Company enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with 
investment grade credit ratings. The foreign currency forward (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot 
exchange rates, the yield curves of the respective currencies as well as the currency basis spreads between the respective 
currencies. The foreign currency option contracts are valued using the Black Scholes model, the significant inputs to which 
include observable spot exchange rates, interest rates and the volatility of the currency.
OPTION COMMODITY CONTRACTS
The Company enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with 
investment grade credit ratings. The option commodity (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot commodity 
prices, the yield curves of the respective commodity as well as the commodity basis spreads between the respective commodities. 
The option contracts are valued using the Black Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot commodities 
price, interest rates and the volatility of the commodity.
QUOTED INVESTMENTS:
Fair value of available-for-sale financial assets is derived from quoted market prices in active markets.
INTEREST-BEARING LOANS
Fair value of the Company’s interest-bearing loan, is derived from quoted market prices in active markets.
LOANS WITH RELATED PARTIES
Fair value of the Company’s loan to related party is determined using a discounted cash flow method based on market interest 
rates at each reporting date. 267

18. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
OVERVIEW
The Company’s principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, are comprised of trade receivables, cash, 
available-for-sale financial assets, loans to and from related parties, interest-bearing loans and trade payables.
The Company enters into certain derivative transactions with the purpose of managing foreign exchange risk arising on  
the activity and transactions of its subsidiaries.
The Company has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
• Market risk, including foreign currency, interest rate and equity price risks;
• Credit risk; and
• Liquidity risk.
This note presents information about the Company’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Company’s objectives, 
policies and processes for assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the 
financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company risk 
management framework.
The Company’s risk management policies have been established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to  
set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems 
are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company activities. The Company, through its training 
and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all 
employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Company risk 
management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced 
by the Company. The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad 
hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
(A) MARKET RISK
Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, or interest rates will affect the 
Company income or the value of its financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, 
while optimising the return on risk.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK
The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions and balances that are denominated in currencies other than 
the US dollar . Transactions in foreign currencies include the purchase of services, payment or receipt of dividends and other 
items. As a result, the Company has financial liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currency, and holds 
cash and cash equivalents in Mexican peso.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in 
the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso, reflecting the impact on the Company’s profit before tax with all 
other variables held constant. It is assumed that the same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable 
periods. There is no impact on the Company’s equity other than the equivalent change in retained earnings.

COMMODITY RISK
The Company’s subsidiaries have exposure to changes in metals prices (specifically gold, lead and zinc) which have a significant 
effect on the Company’s results. These prices are subject to global economic conditions and industry-related cycles.
The Company uses derivative instruments to hedge against precious metals commodity price exposure in its subsidiaries, see 
mentioned in note 17(c).
The table below reflects the aggregate sensitivity relating to changes in the fair value of commodity derivative contracts of 
financial assets and liabilities, reflecting the impact on the Company’s profit before tax with all other variables held constant.

NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
CONTINUED
18. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
INTEREST RATE RISK
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or 
the fair values of its financial instruments. The Company’s earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on any floating 
element of the loans with related parties and interest earned on cash balances. Interest-bearing loans are at a fixed rate, 
therefore the possibility of a change in interest rate only impacts its fair value but not its carrying amount. Therefore, interest-
bearing loans and loans from related parties are excluded from the table below.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of all financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change 
in interest rate applied to a full year from the balance sheet date. There is no impact on the Company’s equity other than the 
equivalent change in retained earnings.

EQUITY PRICE RISK
The Company has exposure to changes in the price of equity instruments that it holds as available-for-sale financial assets.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of available-for-sale assets to a reasonably possible change in market price  
of these equity instruments, reflecting the effect on the Company’s profit before tax and equity.

(B) CREDIT RISK
Exposure to credit risk arises as a result of transactions in the Company’s ordinary course of business and is applicable to all 
financial assets and derivative financial instruments. The financial assets are trade and other receivables, intercompany loans, 
cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale financial assets.
The Company’s policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of counterparties’ failure to honour their obligations. 
Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Company’s exposure to bad debts is 
not significant. The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty. 
The Company’s financial assets are with counterparties that the Company considers to have an appropriate credit rating. As 
disclosed in note 14, the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties. At each balance 
sheet date, the Company’s financial assets were neither impaired nor past due. The Company’s policies are aimed at minimising 
losses from the foreign currency and commodity hedging contracts. The Company’s foreign currency and commodity derivative 
contracts are entered into with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings.
The Company’s surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V., which manages cash and cash 
equivalents investing in a number of financial institutions. In order to minimise exposure to credit risk, the Company only deposits 
cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with a credit rating of M-1 (Moody’s) and mxA-1+ (Standard and Poors) and 
above, and only for periods of less than four months.
The maximum credit exposure at the reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed 
in the relevant notes. See note 6 for the maximum credit exposure for available-for-sale investments, note 8 for cash and cash 
equivalents and note 14 for related party balances. 271

(C) LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company 
monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using projected cash flows and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets 
and liabilities.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Company financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.

The above liquidity tables include expected inflows and outflows from derivative financial instruments which the Company 
expects are going to be exercised during 2017 as at 31 December 2016, and from 2016 to 2019 as at 31 December 2015, either 
by the Company or counterparty.
Management considers that the Company has adequate current assets and forecast cash from operations to manage liquidity 
risks arising from current liabilities and non-current liabilities.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The primary objective of the Company’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy 
capital ratios that support its business and maximise shareholder value. Management considers capital to consist of equity 
and certain interest-bearing loans, as disclosed in the balance sheet, excluding net unrealised gains and losses on revaluation 
of cash flow hedges and available-for-sale financial assets. In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholder’s capital 
invested in the Company, management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves 
them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable. The Company’s 
dividend policy is based on the profitability of the business and underlying growth in earnings of the Group, as well as its 
capital requirements and cash flows. 272

1 Mineral resources are reported inclusive of ore reserves. Mineral resources are not ore reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. All figures rounded to reflect 
the relative accuracy of the estimates. Gold, silver, lead and zinc assays were capped where appropriate.
2 Mineral resources are reported at metal equivalent cut-off grades based on metal price assumptions*, variable metallurgical recovery assumptions (variable metallurgical 
recoveries as a function of grade and relative metal distribution), mining costs, processing costs, general and administrative (G&A) costs, and variable NSR factors (NSR factors 
include smelting and transportation costs). The AgEq is calculated by dividing the cost by the Ag net value factor which includes prices, recoveries, and payabilities.
3 The cut-off grade for Ciénega’s mineral resources varies between 117 and 162 gpt AgEq.
4 The Mega Centauro, Soledad/Dipolos, and Noche Buena resources are reported within pit shells run at a US$1,250/oz Au price.
5 The Mega Centauro, Soledad/Dipolos, Noche Buena open pit mines has produced silver at an average concentration of 0.3 gpt to 1.1 gpt. Silver is not assayed for and is not 
estimated in the resource model. Based on past production, factored in situ silver in the open pit M & I & I resources is approximately in the range of 14 to 15 moz.
6 Mega Centauro mineral reserves are reported at varied cut-offs dependent on material types and grade. Oxide material above 0.25 gpt Au reports to the heap leach, transitional 
and sulfide material above 0.30 gpt Au reports to the heap leach, oxide material above 0.93 gpt Au reports to the mill, transitional and sulfide material above 0.48 gpt Au reports  
to the mill.
7 The Soledad/Dipolos mine has been subject to legal action regarding surface access. SRK has been provided with reassurances that Fresnillo has a reasonable chance to 
reacquire surface rights to these areas.
* Metal price assumptions considered for the calculation of metal equivalent grades are: Gold (US$/oz 1,250.00), Silver (US$/oz 17.00), Lead (US$/lb 1.00) and Zinc (US$/lb 1.20).
• The resources were estimated by Fresnillo. Dr Bart Stryhas,CPG #11034, a Qualified Person, reviewed and audited the resource calculations for Minera Penmont. Matthew 
Hastings, M.Sc, P .Geo, MAusIMM #314693 of SRK, a Qualified Person, reviewed and audited the resource calculations for Ciénega. Benjamin Parsons, BSc, MSc Geology, 
MAusIMM (CP) #222568 of SRK, a Qualified Person, reviewed and audited the resource calculations for Fresnillo and Saucito. Erik Ronald, MEng, PG, MAusIMM #306480  
of SRK, a Qualified Person, reviewed and audited the resource calculations for San Julián. 276

1 Mineral resources are not ore reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. All figures rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates. Metal assays  
were capped where appropriate. Mineral resources are reported at variable metal, metal equivalent or NSR cut-off grades and assuming reasonable metal recoveries. Orisyvo, 
Lucerito, Candameña, Rodeo and Guachichil mineral resources are reported inside a conceptual pit shell based on appropriate mining and processing costs and metal recoveries 
for oxide and sulfide material. Equivalent metal grades (and conceptual pit optimization) are based on US$1,250 per ounce of gold, US$17.00 per ounce of silver (US$1,400 per 
ounce of gold, US$17.50 per ounce of silver for the Orisyvo project), US$1.20 per pound of zinc and US$1.00 per pound of lead.
2 Cut-off grade calculations assume variable metallurgical recoveries.
3 Portions of the Valdecañas deposit within the Minera Juanicipio property where Fresnillo plc holds a 56% interest. Mineral resources quoted reflect Fresnillo plc’s attributable 
56% ownership.

1 All figures rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates. Mineral reserves are reported at metal equivalent cut-off grades based on metal price assumptions*,  
variable metallurgical recovery assumptions (variable metallurgical recoveries as a function of grade and relative metal distribution), mining costs, processing costs, general  
and administrative (G&A) costs, sustaining capital costs, and variable NSR factors (NSR factors include smelting and transportation costs). The AgEq is calculated by dividing  
the cost by the Ag net value factor which includes prices, recoveries, and payabilities. 
2 Reserves include planned dilution to a minimum mining width and to minable outlines.
3 The cut-off grades for the Ciénega reserve vary between 224 and 319 gpt Ag equivalent. 
4 Reserves have no additional dilution added to that inherent in the Selective Mining Unit (SMU) of 15m x 15m x 8m. Reserves are converted from resources through the process  
of pit optimization, pit design, production schedule and supported by a Minera Penmont cash flow model.
5 Mega Centauro mineral reserves are reported at varied cut-offs dependent on material types and grade. Oxide material above 0.25 gpt Au reports to the heap leach, transitional and 
sulfide material above 0.30 gpt Au reports to the heap leach, oxide material above 0.93 gpt Au reports to the mill, transitional and sulfide material above 0.48 gpt Au reports to the mill.
6 The Soledad/Dipolos mine has been subject to legal action regarding surface access. SRK has been provided with documents indicating a reasonable chance that these actions 
will be settled in favour of the mine.
* Metal price assumptions considered for the calculation of metal equivalent grades are: Gold (US$/oz 1,250.00), Silver (US$/oz 17.00), Lead (US$/lb 1.00) and Zinc (US$/lb 1.20).
• Full mining recovery assumed with a factor applied for pillars where appropriate.
• The reserves are valid as of December 31, 2017. All topography is valid as of October 31, 2017. 
• The ore reserves were estimated by Fresnillo. Bret C Swanson, BE (Min) MMSAQP #04418QP, a Qualified Person, reviewed and audited the open pit reserve calculations. 
Fernando Rodrigues, BS Mining, MBA,MMSAQP #01405, MAusIMM #304726 of SRK, a Qualified Person, reviewed and audited the underground reserve calculations. 279

SHARE FRAUD WARNING
Share fraud includes scams where investors are called out of the blue and 
offered shares that turn out to be worthless or non-existent, or an inflated 
price for shares they own. These calls come from fraudsters operating  
in ‘boiler rooms’, mostly based abroad. While high profits are promised, 
those who buy or sell shares in this way usually lose their money.  
Most victims are experienced investors, losing on average £20,000.
PROTECT YOURSELF
If you are offered unsolicited investment advice, discounted shares, 
inflated prices for shares you own, or free company or research reports, 
take these steps before handing over any money:
1. Get the name of the person and organisation.
2. Check the Financial Services Register at www.fca.org.uk/register  
to ensure they are authorised.
3. Use the details on the Financial Services Register to contact the firm.
4. Call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768 if there are no 
contact details on the Register or you are told they are out of date.
5. Search the list of unauthorised firms and individuals to avoid doing 
business with.
6. REMEMBER: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!
If you use an unauthorised firm to buy or sell shares, you will not have 
access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme (FSCS) if things go wrong. 
REPORT A SCAM
If you are approached about a share scam you should tell the FCA using 
the form at www.fca.org.uk/scams (where you can also review the latest 
scams) or call the Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768. 
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters then contact 
Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.

Rules, the Disclosure and Transparency Rules and the Listing Rules  
or applicable law, the Group explicitly disclaims any obligation or 
undertaking publicly to release the result of any revisions to any 
forward-looking statements in this document that may occur due  
to any change in the Group’s expectations or to reflect events or 
circumstances after the date of this document. 280
