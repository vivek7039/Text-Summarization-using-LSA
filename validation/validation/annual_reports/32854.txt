 3 Shire Annual Report 2017
 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Chairman’s review
Focusing innovation on  
patients and customers
In 2017, Shire started its first full financial 
year as a transformed company: the 
undisputed global leader in treating 
rare diseases. 
As we began the year, the integration of 
Baxalta was well under way. A company 
that had commercial operating units in 22 
countries in 2013 is now in more than 60 
countries. A clinical pipeline with 20 
programs in 2013, ended 2017 with 40 
such active programs. And our therapeutic 
footprint had expanded into three new 
dynamic areas: immunology, hematology, 
and oncology.
Shire has transformed itself, but with this 
transformation came obvious challenges. 
We had a global manufacturing portfolio 
that required careful pruning and 
disciplined, efficient management. 
In many countries we had to consolidate 
two offices into one, moving and 
reassigning experienced staff, while 
maintaining commercial momentum. 
And we set aggressive targets for our 
teams, pushing ourselves to meet the 
highest possible financial goals, some 
of which were clearly aspirational.
At the end of 2017, the people of 
Shire could look back with pride. 
The implementation of our Network 
Manufacturing Study laid the foundation 
for efficient and effective supply operations. 
And at the same time, Shire exceeded its 
challenging integration synergy targets for 
the year, saving money and managing its 
global procurement systems in the most 
cost-effective and efficient manner.
Despite these many achievements, 
Shire’s share price performance was 
disappointing. For a Board, management 
team, and company focused on improving 
shareholder value, the challenge is clear 
and we have strengthened our resolve to 
improve and succeed in 2018.
For Shire, success means delivering more 
innovative solutions to the patients who 
depend on us. We know that if patients, 
physicians, and caregivers appreciate and 
value our products, then shareholders will 
also benefit. In this way 2017 was not just 
a year of integration, but also one of 
preparation for the future.
In 2017, we launched 50 products in 
25  countries with therapies to treat 
diseases such as short bowel syndrome, 
hypoparathyroidism and attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We 
significantly advanced our Research and 
Development (R&D) pipeline with 54 
major market filings around the world 
and continued to invest in areas where 
we see great need and opportunity such 
as immunology.
We maintained our dedication to our 
environment and the communities in which 
we serve. In 2017, Shire developed our new 
Responsibility strategy with commitments 
and long-term goals to be achieved by 
2025. We also held our third annual Global 
Day of Service, during which more than 
7,300 Shire employees from around the 
world dedicated more than 29,000 hours 
of their time to volunteering in their 
communities. A detailed description 
of Shire’s commitment to Responsibility 
can be found on page 35.
The accomplishments — focused squarely 
on delivering benefits to patients in need 
and the communities in which we live — 
came during a year of substantial external 
regulatory and macroeconomic challenge. 
The hemophilia market landscape shifted, 
and continues to change rapidly. The global 
political, tax, and regulatory environment in 
which we operate is constantly in motion. 
And the pharmaceutical industry must still 
manage societal challenges in funding, 
pricing, and identifying ways to support 
future innovation. 
These challenges will continue in 2018, 
making it essential that Shire maintains 
its efficient and nimble business strategy. 
Towards that end, we continue to evaluate 
the strategic and operational direction of 
the Company, including an assessment 
of our neuroscience business. While this 
review continues, we are creating two 
distinct business divisions within Shire: 
one focused on rare disease and the other 
focused on neuroscience. This will enable 
sharper management focus, greater 
strategic clarity, and distinct investment 
opportunities for both parts of the 
business. We expect the conclusion of 
our strategic review of these two business 
segments in the second half of 2018. 
Additional details on the divisions can 
be found on page 12.
For our employees, 2017 was a period of 
challenge and change. But it was also a 
year in which they all showed their grit, 
resolve, and unwavering dedication to the 
patients we serve. The Board and I would 
like to thank everyone at Shire, not just for 
their hard work, but also for their drive, 
focus, and commitment during a period of 
transformation. We would also like to thank 
our CEO, Dr. Flemming Ornskov, who has 
led the Shire team through this integration 
with great skill and has kept everyone 
focused on the goal of building a more 
resilient Shire for the long-term.
Finally, I’d like to express my sincere 
appreciation to Bill Burns, Senior 
Independent Director; Anne Minto, the 
previous Chairman of our Remuneration 
Committee; and Dominic Blakemore, 
previous chair of the Audit, Compliance & 
Risk Committee, all of whom will be retiring 
from the Board after the 2018 AGM. 
I am proud of the contributions of 
our more than 23,000 employees and 
am grateful to our patient communities 
for their partnership. And importantly, 
I remain excited and optimistic about 
the future of our Company.
4 Shire Annual Report 2017 Thank you also to former Shire CFO Jeff 
Poulton who left the Company at the end 
of 2017. The contributions of Bill, Anne, 
Dominic, and Jeff cannot be overstated. 
Shire is a better company because of their 
work; we are grateful for their dedication 
and wish them all the best in the future. 
In closing, I am proud of the contributions 
of our more than 23,000 employees and 
our Board, and I am grateful to our patient 
communities for their partnership. And 
importantly, I remain excited and optimistic 
about the future of our Company. It is our 
privilege to continue working on behalf of 
the patients who inspire us every day.

 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Chief Executive Officer’s review
The leading global  
biotech company  
focused on rare diseases
2017 is the year Shire solidified its position 
as the global leader in rare diseases. 
With approximately 70 percent of revenues 
coming from rare disease products, and the 
most robust pipeline in Shire’s history — 
60 percent of which are biologic therapies 
— we continue to make significant progress 
in the Company’s evolution.
As we evolved, we also put the Company 
on solid financial footing. Key to Shire’s 
performance has been the ability to achieve 
strong financial results while managing 
our largest integration. We grew by 
approximately 17,000 employees and 
consolidated 28 country sites globally — 
and remain on track to deliver on our 
Baxalta cost synergy goal of $700 million 
by the third year post-close. We achieved 
sales growth of 33 percent and delivered 
a strong operating cash flow of $4.3 billion 
— enabling us to realize our 2017 leverage 
ratio target. 
We are proud that we now have five of our 
seven franchises contributing more than 
$1 billion in revenue annually. Immunology 
delivered outstanding performance in 2017, 
driven by the success of our sub-cutaneous 
immunoglobulin products and growth in 
International markets. Ophthalmics, our 
newest franchise, generated sales of $259 
million in 2017 as XIIDRA, the only therapy 
approved in the U.S. to treat the signs and 
The main reason I believe our 
Company has performed so 
well is because the Shire team 
is driven by a clear mission, 
a shared purpose, and strong 
values — all of which put the 
patient at the center of all that  
we do.
6 Shire Annual Report 2017 symptoms of dry eye disease (DED), 
reached more than one million prescriptions 
written since launch in late 2016. I am 
greatly appreciative of what our talented 
and focused team has delivered, in many 
cases, exceeding our performance 
expectations in 2017. 
Two distinct market-leading businesses
Since I arrived at Shire five years ago, 
we have grown from an ADHD-focused 
company to a global biotech with two 
distinct market-leading businesses — rare 
disease and neuroscience. To enable these 
two businesses to reach their full potential, 
in early 2018 we announced that the 
neuroscience business warranted 
additional sharpened focus and increased 
investment and that there was a strong 
strategic rationale for creating separate 
Rare Disease and Neuroscience divisions. 
For more information about the two 
divisions, please see page 12. 
Innovation at the heart of our 
vision and culture 
Our long-term vision is to be an innovation-
driven biotech company focused on rare 
diseases and specialized conditions across 
our core scientific platforms and 
therapeutic areas. Shire has an excellent 
record of accessing external innovation and 
delivering late-stage products to market. 
Going forward, we plan to build on these 
capabilities by taking our internal research 
to a new level. To accelerate this goal, 
we have appointed a new Head of 
Research and Development and Chief 
Scientific Officer, Andreas Busch, PhD, an 
accomplished scientist with an extensive 
background and impressive track record 
in research.
At the same time, we continue to 
complement our R&D innovation with new 
advances in health information technologies 
and precision medicine. Shire is utilizing 
artificial intelligence (AI) as well as pursuing 
wearables and sensor technology, 
particularly in clinical trials. We are 
partnering with new, cutting-edge 
companies to improve the time it takes 
for rare disease patients to find a diagnosis, 
tailor our treatment options for smaller 
patient groups, and help us identify hard 
to find patients for clinical trials. More 
information about these efforts can be 
found on page 30.
We are also working to enhance our 
manufacturing network with an eye 
towards optimizing our reliability and 
growth. We’re making important changes 
to our internal and external networks to 
reduce redundancy while also ensuring 
supply continuity. Among the benefits of 
these changes, we anticipate savings of 
$100 million annually beginning in 2019 and 
$300 million annually by 2023. Additionally, 
we are modernizing the manufacturing 
network with new facilities in Georgia 
(U.S.) and Dublin (Ireland). Our Georgia 
plant will expand manufacturing capacity 
for our plasma-derived products by 
approximately 30 percent, while our 
Dublin facility will focus on production 
of antibody-based therapies. 
An industry-leading pipeline
Our R&D organization continues to fuel our 
robust pipeline with innovative therapies. 
In 2017 , our R&D team completed 54 major 
market regulatory filings around the world. 
In addition, Shire received two U.S. FDA 
Fast Track Designations, two Orphan 
Drug Designations, and one Breakthrough 
Therapy Designation. We completed 
nine Phase 3 clinical trials, and received 
126 product approvals globally. These 
accomplishments are major strides forward 
on behalf of our patients. Additional details 
about our pipeline can be found on page 24. 
New product launches fueled growth
As we advanced programs through the 
pipeline, we also developed a team that 
excels at product launches and ensures 
patients have access to these important 
therapies. We executed 50 product 
launches globally in 2017, including the 
initial launch of MYDAYIS in the U.S. and 
expanded into multiple new geographies 
for products such as CUVITRU, NATPARA/

Patient and customer focus
The main reason I believe our Company 
has performed so well is because the Shire 
team is driven by a clear mission, a shared 
purpose, and strong values—all of which 
put the patient at the center of all that we 
do. We know we are most successful when 
we have patients front of mind, inspiring 
our thinking, and guiding our work every 
single day. 
Central to our mission at Shire is being 
close to our patients and our partners, 
which allows us to not only serve them 
better, but also to innovate based on their 
insights. We are often with patients for the 
long-term, given that half of rare diseases 
are diagnosed in childhood. From diagnosis 
to finding appropriate treatment options, 
securing access, and supporting patients 
on treatment, we are committed to the 
wellbeing of our patients for life. The 
inspiration they provide to our team is 
second-to-none. I’d like to take this 
opportunity to thank our patients, their 
families, and their healthcare providers 
for allowing us to be part of their journey. 
Navigating challenges
While I am extremely proud of Shire’s 
accomplishments in 2017, the year was 
not without its challenges. We faced 
generic competition for LIALDA (for the 
treatment of ulcerative colitis) for the first 
time. We also faced a supply interruption 
during the summer for CINRYZE (for the 
treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE)) 
related to issues with a third-party 
manufacturer. We thank HAE patients and 
the HAE community for their patience while 
we worked diligently to address this issue 
and have taken steps to mitigate this risk 
in the future, including bringing additional 
manufacturing of drug product in-house 
beginning in 2018. 
We also experienced increased competition 
in the Hematology franchise, but continue 
to be confident in our leadership position. 
Shire is committed to innovating and 
building for the future — as it can be seen 
with ADYNOVI receiving a positive opinion 
and, early this year, the marketing 
authorization from the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) and with the recent approval 
of myPKFiT, a registered software-based 
medical device for personalized hemophilia 
A dosing in the U.S. And, we continue to 
invest in and expand our pipeline of 
innovative Hematology programs.
While we are proud of our accomplishments 
in 2017, we also acknowledge that we need 
to work even harder on improving 
shareholder value throughout 2018.
Despite these challenges, Shire performed 
very well financially in 2017 — delivering 8% 
pro forma product sales growth to $14.4 
billion, an increase of over $1 billion. We 
also improved our operating margin and 
operating cash flow of $4.3 billion which 
enabled us to reach our debt target. 
Employees and culture
I would like to thank Shire employees and 
the Board of Directors who has provided 
invaluable guidance for the organization. 
We’ve grown from fewer than 6,000 
employees to more than 23,000, and 
everyone continues to focus on our mission 
to serve the needs of patients. The 
accomplishments achieved in 2017 are 
incredible and I look forward to an equally 
impressive 2018.

Outlook and summary
We left 2017 stronger than we’ve ever been 
before with leadership positions in many of 
the therapeutic areas in which we compete. 
In particular, we now have a leading 
high-growth Immunology franchise, which 
will be the foundation of our rare disease 
business as we move into 2018. Our 
neuroscience business will soon benefit from 
increased investment and focus as we look 
to broaden our expertise beyond ADHD.
2018 will be a year of continued focus 
on commercial execution and targeted 
investment in our manufacturing 
infrastructure, new product launches, 
and pipeline to drive future growth. We 
expect to deliver mid-single digit product 
sales growth in 2018 after absorbing the 
anticipated impact of generics. Based on 
current assumptions, we also expect 
margins to be impacted by the start-up 
of our new U.S. plasma manufacturing 
site, intensifying genericization, and lower 
royalties. But, I remain confident that Shire 
will continue to build on our leadership 
position in both rare disease and 
neuroscience and we are committed to 
achieving our 2020 goal of $17-$18 billion 
in revenues and mid-forties Non GAAP 
EBITDA margin.
I am energized and excited about Shire’s 
future as we look forward to growing our 
franchises, especially Immunology; 
executing on our many launches; leveraging 
our robust international footprint in key 
markets such as China to expand access 
to our 40+ marketed products; and, 
building an innovative, results-oriented, 
patient-centric culture. I am confident that 
our team and our partners will continue to 
execute on our priorities and serve as 
champions for our patients.

This is largely in response to the unique set of opportunities and challenges 
that companies in the sector are facing. 
Trends at the macro level
Innovation
We are in an era of unprecedented 
innovation, driven by new scientific 
discoveries and supporting technologies. 
Academic institutions, start-ups, teaching 
hospitals, technology companies, and 
biopharmaceutical companies are 
collaborating in new ways. Advances in 
our knowledge of human biology and the 
molecular basis of disease are generating 
an increasingly diverse range of potential 
therapeutic treatments, including gene 
therapy and cell therapy. Technological 
advances are amplifying our ability to 
capitalize on this emerging science. 
In particular, the amount of accessible 
medical information has grown significantly 
in the past few years and many companies 
have begun to take advantage of this 
resource using data to support the 
diagnosis and treatment of patients. 
For example, advanced analytical 
techniques are being applied to extract 
new insights from genetic and clinical 
data. Similarly, new devices, ranging from 
companion diagnostics to mobile health 
apps to wearable monitors, will be 
increasingly prominent in the next wave 
of therapeutic advances. Please see 
pages 30 and 31 for information on Shire’s 
efforts as they relate to advances in 
health technologies.
Demographics
There continues to be a demographic shift 
in developed markets, such as the U.S., the 
European Union and Japan, where people 
are aging and, as a result, require more 
prescription medicines. In the rest of the 
world too, access to, and spending on, 
healthcare is growing. By 2021, total global 
pharmaceutical spend is anticipated to 
reach $1.5 trillion (a growth rate of 4 to 7 
percent from 2016), with more than 30 
percent coming from emerging and 
developing markets.
1
Rising expectations and competition
Patient groups, regulators, and payers are 
assessing the clinical and economic value 
medicines offer with increasing rigor, 
looking for real-world evidence to 
demonstrate clinical benefit and cost-
effectiveness. The expectation of 
excellence is also heightened by the 
intensifying competition from high-quality 
in-market products as well as expected 
launches of innovative new therapies in 
many disease areas. Given the availability 
of data and the ease of accessing 
information about new medications, 
patients are more informed than ever. 
Moreover, the scope of clinical trials is 
expanding with greater emphasis on 
patient-focused endpoints such as quality 
of life measures. As a result, new therapies 
must compete to demonstrate 
improvements against ever-rising 
standards. In tandem, competition from 
lower-cost alternatives, such as generics 
and biosimilars, will erode market share 
and drive down prices.
Evolving customer landscape
Globally, health systems continue to evolve 
toward increasingly sophisticated and 
frequently more centralized models for 
providing high-quality, coordinated care. In 
the U.S. in particular, the physician practice 
landscape has rapidly shifted from the 
traditional individual or small group practice 
model to large group and employment-
based models. These changes have 
introduced new commercial dynamics for 
biopharmaceutical manufacturers, including 
an increasing role for institutional bodies in 
shaping treatment protocols and buying 
decisions. In addition, the payer, pharmacy 
benefit manager, and distributor landscape 
is undergoing major changes with, for 
example, the integration of OptumRx with 
Catamaran, and the proposed merger of 
pharmacy group CVS Health with insurer 
Aetna. The recent announcement of the 
partnership between Amazon, Berkshire 
Hathaway, and JPMorgan Chase may also 
have an impact on this space. As alluded to 
above, patients continue to take an 
increasingly hands-on role in managing their 
health and medical care, supported by new 
capabilities emerging from the convergence 
of healthcare and technology. Healthcare 
apps and wearable sensors, for example, 
are playing a more prominent role, leading 
technology companies (e.g., Apple, Google, 
Amazon) to increase their healthcare 
investments. As a result of these changes in 
the customer landscape, biopharmaceutical 
companies today require new capabilities to 
address a broader range of stakeholders.
Political volatility
The current political environment, in 
particular the evolving policy dynamics in 
the U.S. and the uncertainty associated 
with Brexit in the UK, has increased 
ambiguity regarding the direction of the 
pharmaceutical market. This potentially 
impacts a range of business factors 
including talent acquisition, regulatory 
frameworks, and supply chain 
considerations. Additionally, unfavorable 
press coverage on topics such as drug 
pricing and marketing practices continues 
to attract scrutiny from regulators, and has 
negatively impacted public sentiment 
towards the industry.
The industry’s response
Biopharmaceutical companies are 
responding to these challenges by focusing 
on specific categories, and developing 
high-impact therapies for high-need patient 
segments, where new therapies can 
demonstrate significant value. 
Focused business models
Biopharmaceutical companies are looking 
to streamline their operations and portfolios 
through divestments or asset swaps to 
focus on targeted areas where they have, 
or can build, unique expertise. The 
emphasis is now on category leadership, 
and the advantages it brings, including 
being the hub in a network of innovation 
expertise in that category. This increases 
the ability of biopharmaceutical companies 
to develop market-changing therapies by 
combining their extensive know-how in 
regulatory affairs, clinical trial execution and 
lifecycle management with the cutting-edge 
science from innovative early-stage 
companies.

Medicines through 2021.  
Report by the QuintilesIMS 
Institute. December 2016
10 Shire Annual Report 2017 High-impact, high-need 
Therapeutic focus is important not only 
for developing expertise, for example in 
oncology or specialty care, but also for 
ensuring a focus on patients with the 
highest need, for whom new therapies 
can have the most impact. Products can 
have a particularly high impact on the lives 
of patients when they not only demonstrate 
improvements in safety and efficacy, but 
also in measures such as quality of life, 
including the ability to maintain 
independence. The increasing volume and 
availability of medical data is also enabling 
a shift toward more individualized care, with 
new therapies increasingly targeting clearly 
defined sub-segments of a patient 
population, rather than attempting to be 
a broad solution for all patients with a 
particular disease. This focus requires 
the ability to understand the range of 
pathologies and biological pathways 
present within a disease category, group 
patient populations through diagnostics, 
demonstrate the benefits in specific patient 
types, and educate the market on newly 
emerging treatment paradigms. 
Shire is well-positioned to 
address these trends
Shire strategic positions
1.  Our long-term vision and commitment 
to rare diseases
In 2013, we laid out our vision to become 
a leader in rare diseases. Since then we 
have achieved high, sustained growth and 
profitability through investments in internal 
R&D, external innovation, and business 
development. Through strategic 
investments in our portfolio and global 
capabilities, including the acquisition 
of Baxalta, we have established an 
unmatched platform to accelerate the 
development and commercialization of 
rare disease therapeutics, maximizing our 
ability to reach patients in need. Our unique 
and valuable leadership position in this 
attractive sector provides a foundation 
for continued leadership in delivering 
innovative therapies to previously 
overlooked or underserved rare disease 
patient populations.
2.  Our relentless focus on patients
Across our disease areas, we are 
committed to supporting and collaborating 
with patients, caregivers, healthcare 
providers and advocacy groups to 
accelerate diagnosis and ensure access 
to appropriate, tailored therapy. The deep 
relationships we build help us more 
effectively understand and respond to 
patient needs in many areas, ranging 
from providing reimbursement support 
to developing the next generation of 
biopharmaceutical products and devices. 
We also continue to generate evidence 
that demonstrates the efficacy and safety 
of our products, as well as the impact on 
patient-centric measures such as quality of 
life. Through innovation we continually seek 
opportunities to bring therapies to patients 
with significant unmet needs.
3.  Our commitment to internal and 
external innovation
We focus on the impact we can have for 
patients, rather than where innovations 
originate. We have established deep 
internal expertise in key research areas, 
including recent investments focusing on 
immunology and antibody technologies. 
In addition, we have acquired, licensed, 
and formed partnerships to gain access 
to external assets at various stages of 
development; this approach has allowed 
us to lever our deep clinical development 
and regulatory expertise to advance a 
larger number of potential therapies 
through the pipeline. As a consequence, 
our leading pipeline comprises a blend of 
both internally-generated and externally-
sourced programs.
4.  Our strong brands and franchises 
that enable leadership
Our philosophy is to establish leadership 
in the therapeutic areas where we 
compete, and we have a rich history of 
using our leadership positions to develop, 
expand, and shape these markets, while 
delivering high-value therapies to patients. 
This has resulted in a robust portfolio 
anchored by products that are largely either 
first-in-class or best-in-class. We target our 
investment to maintain these leadership 
positions, focusing resources on activities 
such as differentiating our products with 
post-marketing data, developing advanced 
delivery devices, and identifying next-
generation products. Across therapeutic 
areas, we partner with providers, 
governments, patient groups and other 
institutions to raise awareness, accelerate 
diagnosis and advance standards of care.

How we create value  
for our stakeholders
In August 2017, Shire announced that it 
was conducting a strategic review of its 
neuroscience business. Following the first 
stage of this review, the Board concluded 
that the neuroscience business warranted 
additional focus and investment and that 
there was a strong business rationale for 
creating two distinct business divisions 
within Shire: a Rare Disease division and 
a Neuroscience division. Each division will 
benefit from sharper management focus, 
greater strategic clarity, and an increased 
ability to deploy resources to key growth 
priorities. This divisional structure will be 
an important first step in enabling Shire 
to maximize mid- to long-term product 
sales, cash generation, and innovation 
for both businesses. The second stage 
of the review will include continuing to 
evaluate all strategic alternatives for the 
Neuroscience division, including the 
merits of an independent listing. Shire 
will give an update on the second stage 
of the review in the second half of 2018.

Risk management framework
Risk management
As a highly regulated biopharmaceutical 
company focused on serving people 
with rare diseases, Shire has implemented 
policies, processes and procedures 
intended to manage risk and ensure 
appropriate and lawful conduct in 
the countries in which the Company 
operates. Successful risk management 
is of benefit to shareholders and other 
stakeholders alike. Shire’s risk management 
strategy is to identify, assess, manage, 
and monitor significant risks that it faces. 
Despite this, no risk management strategy 
can provide absolute assurance against 
loss or unfavorable results. 
Stakeholders in risk management, which 
is overseen by the Board of Directors 
and designed to enable the effective 
identification, assessment, management, 
and monitoring of the Group’s risks, are 
detailed below.
Board of Directors
The Board of Directors is responsible 
for ensuring the development and 
maintenance of sound systems of risk 
management and internal control. In 
fulfilling this responsibility, the Board 
oversees Enterprise Risk Management 
(ERM), determines the Company’s risk 
appetite, and ensures that an appropriate 
risk culture is embedded throughout the 
Company. The Board also interacts with 
key risk and internal control stakeholders 
on a frequent basis, enabling it to monitor 
and review the Company’s principal risks 
and the effectiveness of its risk 
management and internal control systems. 
During the past year the Board conducted 
a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Company, including those that 
could threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency, or liquidity.
18 Shire Annual Report 2017 Audit, Compliance & Risk Committee
The Audit, Compliance & Risk Committee 
supports the Board by overseeing and 
reviewing risk management, compliance, 
and internal control programs through its 
interaction with key stakeholders and 
periodic updates from management. 
The Committee reviews and monitors the 
principal risks facing the Company, with 
each risk assessed on the likelihood of 
materialization, potential financial and 
non-financial impacts, and overall risk 
mitigation effectiveness.
Executive Committee
The Executive Committee oversees the 
implementation and operation of risk 
management and internal control systems 
across the Company. The Committee 
reviews and monitors principal risks 
identified during the enterprise risk 
assessment process, before they are 
presented to the Audit, Compliance & 
Risk Committee. Committee members also 
receive regular risk updates from functional 
and business unit stakeholders. Along with 
both the Chief Compliance and Risk Officer 
and the Head of Internal Audit, Committee 
members are also responsible for 
escalating matters of risk management 
and internal control to the Audit, 
Compliance & Risk Committee and/or 
the Board of Directors, as appropriate.
Chief Compliance and Risk Officer
The Chief Compliance and Risk Officer 
leads the Global Compliance and Risk 
Management Department, and is 
responsible for overseeing compliance 
and risk management systems and 
programs, including ERM across the 
Company, and providing the Executive 
Committee, the Audit, Compliance & Risk 
Committee, and the Board with updates 
on risk management and compliance. 
Global Compliance and Risk 
Management Department
The Global Compliance and Risk 
Management Department, led by the 
Chief Compliance and Risk Officer, is 
made up of compliance, assurance, 
monitoring, privacy, and risk management 
competencies. It is responsible for 
supporting the development, 
implementation, and maintenance of 
relevant risk management and compliance 
systems and programs across the 
Company. This is achieved through 
governance, policy, and procedures; 
awareness, training, and communications; 
as well as, audits, monitoring, and 
investigations. These activities provide 
for risk identification, assessment, 
management, and monitoring, as well as 
the escalation of relevant matters to the 
Executive Committee, Audit, Compliance 
& Risk Committee, and the Board of 
Directors as appropriate.
Enterprise Risk Management Team
The ERM Team, led by the Chief 
Compliance and Risk Officer, includes 
the Head of Global Risk and Compliance 
Assurance, and the Head of Risk 
Management and Business Continuity, 
and is supported by external consultants 
as appropriate. The Team is charged with 
implementing and operating the ERM 
system. This consists of maintaining the 
enterprise risk universe and risk 
assessment methodology, identifying 
functional and executive risk owners, 
facilitating the enterprise risk assessment 
process, providing risk training and 
awareness to stakeholders across the 
Company, assisting with risk reporting, 
and supporting the Executive Committee 
and Audit, Compliance & Risk Committee 
as appropriate.
Internal Audit
Internal Audit provides independent 
assurance to the Audit, Compliance & Risk 
Committee that Shire’s risk management, 
governance, and internal control processes 
are designed and operating effectively.
Business units, corporate functions, 
and franchises
Business units, corporate functions, and 
franchises participate in the enterprise risk 
assessment process by identifying and 
assessing their relevant risks. They are 
responsible for managing their risks; 
implementing controls, and monitoring, 
escalating, and reporting risk.
Global Issues and Crisis Management
Shire operates a Global Issues and Crisis 
Management framework, which assists in 
planning for, and responding to, disruptive 
events that could potentially jeopardize 
the Company’s reputation and business 
operations, The guiding principles 
emphasize the health and safety of 
patients, customers, employees, and the 
community at large; safeguarding the 
Company’s integrity, executing strategy, 
and supporting business continuity.
Principal areas of risk 
The Company is subject to varying degrees 
of risk and uncertainty. The table below 
details the principal areas of risk that were 
identified and assessed through the 
Company’s ERM system in 2017. 
These principal areas of risk are listed 
in no particular order and, along with 
the detailed risk factors set out on pages 
187 to 198 of this Annual Report (the “Risk 
Factors”), should be carefully considered 
before any investment is made in Shire. 
In addition, risks not presently known to 
the Company may also adversely affect 
its business. If any of these aforementioned 
risks were to materialize, the business, 
financial condition, results of operations, 
or prospects of the Company could be 
materially harmed. In such circumstances, 
the value of the Company’s securities could 
decline and an investor could lose part 
or all of his or her investment. In addition, 
forward-looking statements that are 
contained in this Annual Report or in 
the Company’s other reports, filings, or 
statements may be subject to the principal 
areas of risk described below and the 
Risk Factors.

Principal risks and uncertainties continued
Principal area of risk Context Trend
1 
Competition/exclusivity
The market entry of competitor products, and 
increasing competition due to the loss of 
patent exclusivity and product genericization, 
could lead to reduced revenue.
The Company’s products face competition in the markets in which we operate. 
Our products are subject to patent or regulatory expiration and emerging competition from 
generics or biosimilars.
Shire continues to conduct relevant market research, analysis, and product risk 
assessments. We monitor the regulatory, legal, and industry environment to proactively 
anticipate and identify competitor products and plan accordingly. 
Environment, health and safety (EHS)  
material compliance
Failure to adhere to relevant laws, regulations, 
and policies, including Shire’s Environment, 
Health & Safety Policy and Supplier Code 
of Conduct, may result in fines, business 
disruptions, increased operating costs, 
reduced revenue, interruption/postponement 
in research, delays of new product launches, 
and/or other environmental and reputational 
consequences.
The manufacture and distribution of the Company’s products are subject to extensive laws, 
regulations and policies.
Shire has established a cross-functional Product Stewardship Working Group that meets 
quarterly to review any changes to the various material compliance regulations and 
requirements as well as changes to the Company, products, and processes. Shire has 
implemented processes and supporting technology to provide a framework for oversight 
and governance.
Anti-corruption/anti-bribery
Failure to comply with anti-corruption/
anti-bribery laws, regulations, policies and 
standards governing the manufacturing, 
sales, and marketing of Shire products, could 
negatively impact the Company and/or its 
officers, Directors and employees, resulting 
in enforcement activity, civil and/or criminal 
liability, fines, penalties, imprisonment, business 
restrictions, or damage to our reputation.
We operate in numerous countries across the globe, with emergent markets having 
differing levels of infrastructure and legislative/regulatory frameworks. Our industry is 
also highly regulated. These circumstances increase our exposure to potential bribery 
or corruption risks. 
Shire has a well-defined Code of Ethics, a clear set of values, and pertinent policies/
procedures that guide our approach to Anti-Corruption/Anti-Bribery compliance, all of which 
are available Group-wide. Shire continues to review, audit, and monitor compliance with 
relevant policies, procedures, systems, and controls. We deploy global anti-corruption/
anti-bribery measures including training and awareness initiatives and a third-party due 
diligence program.
Cyber security
In today’s complex and ever-changing 
environment, failure to safeguard information, 
systems, applications, databases, and 
networks could result in cyber breaches and 
violations of privacy/consumer protection 
laws, business disruption, loss of intellectual 
property, damage to our reputation, fines, 
penalties and/or compromise of operations 
or financial condition.
The Company is dependent on the availability and integrity of our information and 
supporting technology platforms including systems, applications, databases, and networks. 
We have developed an internal cyber security capability, that provides information and 
assistance to the Company concerning compliance with Shire cybersecurity policies, 
guidance on cybersecurity standards, and recommendations on potential vulnerabilities. 
We provide training, awareness and monitoring of cybersecurity activities. We invest in cyber 
threat intelligence, security operations, and incidence response services to proactively 
predict, prevent, detect and respond to cyber risks.
Data protection and privacy
Failure to effectively identify, collect, and 
store, personal (sensitive) information in 
compliance with federal, state, and regional 
laws, contractual obligations, and policies, 
could result in regulator-imposed fines/
enforcement actions, damage to our 
reputation, and/or civil or criminal liability.
The Company is required to protect natural persons when processing their personal data, 
including maintaining the confidentially, integrity and availability of personal data relating to 
physicians, patients, employees and other individuals whose personal data is being 
processed by the Company.
Shire continues to implement a data protection and privacy management program, 
including governance, policies, and procedures, to address global data protection and 
privacy requirements. Our mitigation strategies are evolving to meet a dynamic regulatory 
environment. We monitor regulatory, environmental, and innovation key risk indicators, utilize 
data analytics, and promote employee awareness of data protection requirements.
Pharmaceutical industry reform
Failure to proactively identify and comply with 
industry laws and pharmaceutical regulatory 
changes across our value chain (including 
government mandated pricing), could result in 
fines, penalties, business disruption, reduced 
revenue, and/or potential exclusion from 
government programs.
The Company has a large portfolio of products in multiple countries across various 
therapeutic areas. We operate in a highly regulated industry, with the research and 
development, manufacturing, marketing, and sale of these products subject to regulatory 
oversight in various jurisdictions across the globe. The successful development, 
manufacturing, distribution, and sale of these products are highly uncertain due to the 
changing regulatory landscape.
Shire continues to monitor the regulatory environment at large, and proactively plans 
for potential regulatory changes within our industry. We collaborate internally across 
global functions and business units, and externally with outside counsel and advisors, 
to understand potential industry reform, and its impact on our strategy, operations 
and performance.

Clinical trial research, 
safety and efficacy
Failure to demonstrate safety and efficacy 
in planned and ongoing clinical trials, 
unsuccessful clinical research, and failure to 
complete clinical research in a timely fashion, 
could result in penalties, fines, reduced 
revenue, and/or damage to our reputation.
The Company has a portfolio of products in various stages of research and development. 
The successful development of these products requires significant investment, with no 
guarantee that these products will receive regulatory approval. 
We continue to emphasize patient safety and a disciplined approach to research and 
development. We have governance structures in place to monitor and evaluate our risk 
exposure in this area, and which also allow for engagement in external reviews with 
thought-leaders, key opinion leaders and other stakeholders. Our combined portfolio is 
subject to review by Shire’s Quality Assurance and Control function for inspection readiness. 
We conduct various operational reviews of the programs ensuring targeted reviews of safety 
and efficacy profiles, including identification of programs where there is limited or 
no mechanistic, clinical or regulatory precedent.
Intellectual property (IP)  
and patents
Failure to obtain, maintain, enforce or defend 
our patents, regulatory data, or other IP may 
lead to the compromise of exclusivity periods 
and reduced revenue. 
As a global biopharmaceutical company, our significant investments in research and 
development, and related intellectual property and patents, are extremely valuable corporate 
assets, and need to be protected. We face intense competition from manufacturers of 
branded and generic therapies who may challenge our patent protections in certain 
markets. We may be subject to adverse outcomes in legal matters and other disputes, 
including the Company’s ability to enforce and defend patents and other intellectual property 
rights required for our business.
Shire works with internal and external counsel to monitor threats, defend our patents and 
IP and prosecute violations. 
Public and private partnerships  
(PPP)/joint ventures (JV)
Failure to effectively manage third-party 
alliances, geopolitical uncertainty, technology 
expropriation, foreign exchange exposure, 
payment/collections, and other risk areas 
could result in reduced revenue, damage to 
our reputation, and/or loss of “license to 
operate” in certain jurisdictions.
We operate a number of collaborative agreements and external alliances with various 
third-parties across the globe to expand our product portfolio and market share. 
Shire carefully evaluates new PPP/JV opportunities before entering into agreements. 
We focus on support and alignment between our patients, healthcare professionals, and 
each PPP/JV . We oversee, monitor, audit, and report on these PPP/JV relationships on a 
regular basis. We review macroeconomic factors, manage relevant government relations, 
and enforce contractual terms. 
Tenders
Failure to effectively execute and win major 
tenders in key markets could result in 
reduced revenue.
Procurement through tenders is standard practice in the majority of our international 
markets and we have developed capabilities to effectively manage tenders. We strive to 
shape tenders to include criteria beyond price so that the value of the therapy is recognized. 
We also encourage payers to partner with us on alternative, value-based models to move 
beyond tenders, where appropriate.
We continue to manage tender relationships and monitor the tender landscape around the 
world, adjusting our approach as needed. 
Global drug safety tracking of patient  
support programs (PSP)
Risk of non-compliance in safety reporting 
and interpretation, and incomplete safety 
information and documentation relative to 
Patient Support Programs (PSPs), could result 
in potential compromise of patient safety, loss 
of confidential data, fines, penalties, business 
disruptions, and/or damage to our reputation. 
We manage an increasing number and variety of PSPs globally and aim to accurately and 
efficiently track and report their respective safety information. 
Shire has implemented a safety reporting policy, registration programs, personnel training, 
and detailed procedures for PSPs. We continue to improve and refine our system to ensure 
central approval and oversight of all global PSPs.
Acquired product/company integration 
and strategic initiatives 
Failure to effectively integrate acquired 
products/companies, and achieve projected 
value from other strategic initiatives, could result 
in lost synergies, diversion of management 
focus, time and resources, operational 
inefficiencies, increased costs, reduced 
revenue, and/or damage to our reputation. 
The integration of new products/companies and the implementation of other strategic 
initiatives can be complex, costly, and time-consuming. Important considerations include 
culture, personnel, product line synergy, operations, platform alignment, compliance, and 
systems, while maintaining focus on patient safety, supply chain execution, customer 
service, sales, and business relationships. 
The Board has established a governance framework to enable the integration of Baxalta 
and the ongoing strategic review of the organization. These initiatives are being led by 
senior, experienced leaders.
We continue to audit and monitor Baxalta integration activities in all functions, franchises, 
and business units, with the Board maintaining oversight. As of December 31, 2017, 
certain Baxalta integration activities, particularly in IT and Technical Operations, continue to 
progress, with the majority of integration work having been completed or being in the final 
phases of implementation. We continue to invest time, attention, and resources in the 
ongoing strategic review of the business.

 25 Shire Annual Report 2017
 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information HAE is a rare, genetic disorder estimated to affect 
about 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 50,000 people worldwide. 
The condition results in recurrent, localized edema 
(swelling). The areas of the body most commonly 
affected are the extremities, gastrointestinal tract, 
and upper airways. The swelling can be debilitating 
and painful, potentially impacting both work and 
education for people living with HAE. Swelling of the 
throat can be life-threatening due to asphyxiation.
Over the past several years, Shire has developed 
a broad portfolio of products for HAE, including acute 
and prophylactic treatments FIRAZYR and CINRYZE, 
and sought out this latest compound through our 
acquisition of Dyax in early 2016. While the decision to 
acquire Dyax was based on a relatively small amount 
of preclinical and clinical data, the team was convinced 
that lanadelumab had the potential to be a meaningful 
advance in the treatment of patients with HAE.
Pipeline spotlight: 
SHP643 for Hereditary 
Angioedema
We are hopeful 
about the possibility 
of approaching 
attack-free efficacy 
with this product.
One program in particular that saw great progress in 2017 
is SHP643 (lanadelumab) for the prevention of hereditary 
angioedema attacks in patients with HAE. This program was 
awarded breakthrough therapy designation in 2015 by the 
U.S. FDA.
Efficiency approaching  
attack free
87%
Reduction
over 26 weeks
26 Shire Annual Report 2017 Shire developed the Phase 3 program in conjunction 
with legacy Dyax and recruited the largest HAE study 
in the fastest time ever (125 patients recruited in 
approximately six months).
Shire announced the Phase 3 topline trial results in May 
2017 , which showed that patients taking lanadelumab 
every two weeks achieved an 87 percent reduction in the 
mean attack rate over 26 weeks. A deeper look into the 
data showed that once patients that took lanadelumab 
once every two weeks achieved steady state (days 
70-182 of the trial), they experienced greater than 90 
percent attack reduction and 77 percent of those 
patients were attack-free. For patients that had attacks, 
the severity of attacks was significantly reduced. Based 
on this data, and pending FDA approval, we are hopeful 
about the possibility of approaching attack-free efficacy 
with lanadelumab. 
We expect to launch SHP643 in the U.S. this year, 
subject to regulatory approval. 
Lanadelumab has the potential to significantly improve 
patients’ treatment experience. Currently-marketed 
prophylactic treatments require multiple injections every 
week. Lanadelumab, on the other hand, is expected 
to require only two low-volume, self-administered 
subcutaneous injections per month. We anticipate that 
this will significantly reduce the treatment burden on 
HAE patients, and hope that this will lead to improved 
therapeutic outcomes.

 27 Shire Annual Report 2017
 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information With a strong pipeline of 40 programs in clinical development, 
launch excellence is a critical driver of Shire’s growth. In 2017,  
$1.6 billion of Shire’s sales came from products launched since 
2013 across the portfolio. With the strategic acquisition of Baxalta 
which came with a strong global infrastructure, particularly in 
emerging markets, Shire has expanded its geographic footprint and 
now has therapies available in more than 100 countries worldwide. 
The rapid country-level integration of the two companies 
throughout 2016 and 2017 allowed us to consolidate 28 country 
sites and launch 50 products at the country level in 2017 alone. 
Here is a closer look at two recent launches, MYDAYIS and XIIDRA.
Commercial spotlight: 
Launch excellence
MYDAYIS
Approximately 50 to 66 percent of children with 
ADHD continue to have symptoms of the disorder 
as adults, resulting in an estimated 4.4 percent of U.S. 
adults living with a diagnosis of ADHD. As individual's 
needs are different, it has become increasingly important 
to have new treatment approaches available, like 
MYDAYIS, to help patients manage their symptoms 
throughout their day.
MYDAYIS is a once-daily, extended-release treatment 
comprised of three types of drug-releasing beads. 
It was approved by the FDA on June 20, 2017 for 
prescription in the U.S. for the treatment of ADHD in 
patients 13 years and older. MYDAYIS is not for use 
in children 12 years and younger. 
Shire's strategy with MYDAYIS was to launch very 
quickly, focusing on the adult ADHD population who 
were looking for a long duration therapy with once-
daily dosing to manage their ADHD symptoms. 
Currently, in the U.S., 56 percent of adult patients 
are prescribed more than one pill per day, in many 
cases to extend the duration of symptom control. 
Shire was in the position to help address this patient 
need with MYDAYIS. 
The strong market demand for this new therapy is 
evident in the nearly 60,000 prescriptions written 
within the first six months of approval, with 25,000 
unique new patients and 8,000 unique prescribers — 
more than any other ADHD product launched in the 
U.S. since 2010. Over time MYDAYIS has the potential 
to become a very meaningful therapeutic option for 
patients 13 years and older with ADHD.

28 Shire Annual Report 2017 XIIDRA
Shire has established a presence in ophthalmics with 
the launch of XIIDRA, which was approved for use in 
the U.S. in July 2016. 
XIIDRA is a twice-daily eye drop solution for dry 
eye disease (DED), one of the most prevalent 
conditions diagnosed by eye care professionals. 
DED may affect up to an estimated 16 million adults 
in the U.S. The condition may significantly affect 
vision-related quality of life, often impacting activities 
such as reading, using computers, driving and 
watching television. XIIDRA provides patients with 
an effective treatment option as the first and only 
treatment approved in the U.S. to treat the signs 
and symptoms of DED.
In the U.S., Shire has generated over 1 million XIIDRA 
prescriptions since launch, and catalyzed total DED 
market growth of 23 percent from August 2016 to 
August 2017. With DED market growth in the low single 
digits prior to Shire’s entry into the market, our disease 
education efforts, namely the eyelove® campaign, 
significantly influenced expansion of the market. 
We expect greater U.S. uptake for XIIDRA once 
broader reimbursement access for Medicare patients 
is available and as we launch XIIDRA internationally. 
As part of our geographic expansion, XIIDRA gained 
its first international approval in Canada in late 2017 
with launch planned for the first quarter of 2018. 
Additional regulatory submissions are progressing in 
key international markets around the world including 
Europe, the Gulf Countries and Asia Pacific. 
We understand the importance of all parts of our 
business — particularly R&D, manufacturing, and 
commercial — working together seamlessly to ensure 
that our innovative new products get to patients in 
need. We are proud of our recent launch successes, 
and with our robust pipeline, anticipate many more 
in the years to come.

 29 Shire Annual Report 2017
 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information One of the ways we embrace technological 
advances to benefit patients is by seeking the best 
complementary minds in technology to enhance our 
digital capabilities. Through these partnerships, we 
push the boundaries of what is possible and improve 
outcomes for patients. For instance, Shire has formed 
partnerships with digital incubators to scan the market 
for disruptive innovations that can help accelerate 
diagnostic capabilities, create efficiencies within 
clinical trials, and improve patient efficacy and safety 
outcomes. In addition to our partnerships with smaller 
companies, Shire collaborates with some of the leading 
technology organizations in the world to help us 
develop ground-breaking solutions to support patients 
struggling with a rare disease. Shire’s breadth of 
experience, coupled with the technology, market reach, 
and global resources of these organizations, creates 
a powerful force on behalf of patients and caregivers. 
Whether large or small, all of our partnerships fuel 
our mission to create a digitized Shire that supports 
patients through every step of their journey. 
OnePath Virtual Assitant
Today, Shire is moving towards a patient-centric 
connected care model, utilizing virtual assistants 
powered by artificial intelligence (AI) as part of our 
OnePath environment for patients living with type 
1 Gaucher, HAE, Hunter syndrome, hypoparathyroidism 
and short bowel syndrome. The OnePath Virtual 
Assistant, the result of collaboration between Shire, 
Accenture and Microsoft, makes it easy for patients to 
get common questions answered at a time and place 
that’s convenient for them, without the need to interact 
directly with a Shire patient services representative if 
no one is available at the exact time of need. 
myPKFiT
We also emphasize individualized care for patients. 
For example, for our hemophilia patients, a one-size-
fits-all treatment approach does not meet their unique 
needs, so we developed myPKFiT, a validated 
software medical device that provides personalized 
pharmacokinetic (PK) estimates and supports the 
development of personalized dosing regimens for 
use with ADVATE, the most prescribed FVIII therapy in 
the world. In December 2017, myPKFiT was granted 
clearance in the U.S. by the FDA and is currently used 
Although each rare disease affects a relatively small number of 
people, together they are one of the largest underserved patient 
populations in the world — and a population that is uniquely 
positioned to benefit from technological innovation in healthcare. At 
Shire, we believe that the technologies that will be most impactful 
in the future will be those that empower patients to be active 
participants in their own treatment and we are working diligently to 
incorporate these technologies into all that we do.
Technology spotlight: 
Intersection of health 
and technology to enable 
patient-centric care 
30 Shire Annual Report 2017 One of the areas where technology can potentially 
have a tremendous impact is in diagnosis. In the UK 
and the U.S. for example, the average time to obtain 
a correct diagnosis for a rare disease patient is five 
to seven years. Patients see an average of 7.3 
physicians during this journey. In an effort to improve 
this process, healthcare providers are using new 
technologies and tapping large data sets to better 
identify symptoms and expedite diagnoses. They are 
also using this information to develop treatments that 
are personalized to the individual or small patient 
sub-groups. 
At Shire, we believe these new technologies 
will play a key role in the work of the Global 
Commission to End the Diagnostic Odyssey 
for Children with a Rare Disease. Co-chaired by 
our CEO, along with Microsoft and EURORDIS-Rare 
Diseases Europe, this new Global Commission will 
harness the power of technology as they consider 
how to shorten the often multiple year journey for 
patients and families to arrive at an accurate 
diagnosis. Working with a multi-sector group of 
rare disease experts from patient advocacy groups, 
academic/research institutions, hospitals and health 
systems, policy organizations, technology and 
biotechnology companies, together they are creating 
an actionable roadmap to break down barriers to 
diagnosis and expect to publish their report early 
in 2019.

by more than 400 healthcare providers in 24 countries 
outside the United States. In the future, Shire plans 
to extend the utility of myPKFiT to another one of 
our hemophilia therapies, ADYNOVATE. As science 
progresses, we are becoming more aware of the 
benefits of precision medicine and devices for 
achieving the best outcomes for patients. As a result, 
we are investigating opportunities to provide more 
customized experiences in other therapeutic areas 
using quantitative pharmacology and machine learning 
to enable data driven healthcare.
Shire strives to be a data-driven organization in 
everything we do. Last year, Shire launched a suite 
of intelligence tools that enhances our understanding 
of how patients access our therapies. The suite is 
powered by advanced analytics and a robust 
dashboard tool that analyzes current data for better 
real-time decision making, while creating predictive 
data models to guide future efforts. This is already one 
of the most advanced analytics stacks in the industry 
and our plan is to continue to expand our capabilities 
to include cognitive and deep learning services so that 
additional patients can benefit from Shire’s therapies, 
as appropriate.
Technology will continue to revolutionize the ways 
in which we support the understanding of rare diseases 
within the medical community. In 2018 we will launch 
an augmented reality experience to help educate 
physicians on rare disease progression and impact. 
By focusing on all phases of the patient journey, from 
symptom identification to diagnosis, treatment initiation, 
and living with the disease, Shire is employing the right 
technologies at the right time to serve our patients.

Championing 
Responsibility
Responsibility is a core value that has long
been embedded across the Company and
runs through every aspect of our business, 
ultimately to better serve patients.
As the leading global biotech company 
in rare diseases, we seek to address 
significant unmet needs and transform 
people’s lives through the breakthrough 
medicines we develop. Everything we do 
across our organization — from engaging 
our people to operating in a responsible 
and sustainable way — is to serve as a 
champion for patients and those who 
care for them. 
Responsibility helps the Company have 
the greatest positive impact on the lives of 
patients, employees, and local and global 
communities. It is a commitment that is 
supported by Shire’s Board of Directors, 
championed by the CEO, driven forward by 
Shire’s senior leaders and shared by our 
employees. It is at the heart of how we lead 
and deliver high patient impact, sustained 
growth, and societal value.
A focused strategy
In 2017, Shire developed its new 
Responsibility strategy with commitments 
and long-term goals to be achieved by 
2025 aimed at enhancing the Company’s 
Responsibility ambition and performance. 
The strategy is based on the findings 
of Shire’s Responsibility materiality 
assessment, conducted in 2016, that 
identified and prioritized key Responsibility 
issues of greatest significance to Shire  
and its key stakeholders (including  
patient groups, investors, suppliers, 
nongovernmental organizations and 
employees). Kim Stratton and members 
of Shire’s Board of Directors provided 
oversight during the strategy development. 
The strategy was ultimately reviewed and 
endorsed by Shire’s Executive Committee 
and the Board. 
Shire’s Responsibility strategy of nine 
commitments is aligned to three strategic 
Responsibility pillars: Supporting Patients, 
People and Culture, and Sustainable 
Operations. The Responsibility strategy 
is focused on patients and those who care 
for them, and is explicitly linked to Shire’s 
strategic drivers, with ethics and integrity 
permeating throughout. Shire considered 
how our Responsibility commitments could 
further the United Nations’ Sustainable 
Development Goals, which cover a 
broad range of social and economic 
development issues. 
This framework will help us focus 
strategically on what is most important  
to Shire and its stakeholders. We 
continually focus to make sure we 
organize and apply ourselves for 
maximum long-term positive impact.
Additional information on the Responsibility 
strategy, commitments and long-term 
goals can be found in Shire’s Annual 
Responsibility Review available at  
www.shire.com/who-we-are/responsibility.
Responsibility and risk management 
Shire’s risk management strategy is to 
identify, assess, mitigate and monitor 
significant risks that it faces, including 
those relevant to its Responsibility strategy 
and commitments. This Responsibility 
section includes details of such risks, 
summary responses and further relevant 
documentation in each area. Two of the 
key risk areas related to Responsibility at 
Shire, Environment Health and Safety (EHS) 
Material Compliance and Anti-corruption/
anti-bribery, are recognized as Company 
Principal Risks in this reporting cycle. See the 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties section

with this type of diagnosis. These efforts 
include an increasing focus on expanding 
diagnostic testing. 
Improving access to existing 
treatments and patient support
We work to improve access to our existing 
treatments by reducing barriers, such as 
affordability and access to therapies. 
We have several programs to assist patients 
in the U.S., including OnePath®, Shire 
Cares®, Hematology Support Center and 
MyIgSource. Outside the U.S., we have 
numerous programs to increase access, 
while helping build capacity and support 
for patients. For example, through an 
agreement with the World Federation 
of Hemophilia, Shire provides annual 
donations of clotting factor to support 
patients in various countries. Shire donated 
nearly eight million units in 2017. We have 
long-running charitable access programs 
partnering with the NGOs Direct Relief 
and Project HOPE, donating enzyme 
replacement therapies for patients with 
LSDs in 16 countries. Working with these 
organizations, as well as with patient 
advocacy organizations and medical 
experts, we also partner to raise awareness 
for rare diseases and build treatment 
capabilities for LSDs in several less 
developed countries. We are aiming to 
create specific Responsibility goals focused 
on Access for recommendation in 2018 as 
part of our Responsibility strategy.
Increasing disease awareness
We aim to share our expertise and provide 
balanced, reliable and scientifically sound 
information to help improve understanding 
and appreciation of rare diseases. This 
happens across multiple therapeutic 
areas in a variety of programs developed 
for patients, caregivers, healthcare 
providers and the general public.
We also continue to encourage responsible 
use of our ADHD products through a 
coalition of medical, mental health, higher 
education, students and industry experts.
Investing in the future
Addressing the need for more physicians 
trained in disciplines associated with the 
diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases 
is one of the ways we prepare for the 
future. Shire’s partnership with the ACMG 
Foundation for Genetic and Genomic 
Medicine is funding 10 much-needed 
genetic fellowships to support the next 
generation of medical geneticists. In 2017, 
the first recipients of the Shire/ACMG 
Foundation Medical Genetics Training 
Awards were awarded. 
Ensuring clinical trial transparency
Safeguarding the human rights and privacy 
of those taking part in our clinical trials 
while maintaining our ongoing dedication 
to maximum clinical trial transparency 
is of paramount importance to Shire. 
We achieve this through compliance with 
evolving transparency laws, regulations, 
practices and full alignment of our policies 
with the responsible sharing of clinical 
trial data. 
Shire adheres to the International 
Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines. We 
recognize the importance of transparency 
in clinical studies and are committed to 
sharing clinical data and results responsibly 
with physicians, researchers and patients, 
while mitigating any risk of personal data 
identification. Through www.shiretrials.com, 
we provide a single portal to access 
easy-to-understand information on our 
current and past clinical trials.
Collaborating to improve care 
In 2017, Shire joined Access 
Accelerated, a collective of more than 
20 pharmaceutical companies and 
partners such as the World Bank and 
the Union for International Cancer 
Control, which collaborates with 
stakeholders to reduce barriers to 
non-communicable disease care in 
low- and middle-income countries. 
Shire has launched its pioneering 
hemophilia homecare program in 
India as an Access Accelerated 
initiative. This program aims to bring 
the hemophilia standard of care in 
developed economies to persons with 
hemophilia in India. Through Access 
Accelerated, we aim to share our 
learnings in bleed reduction and seek 
future collaborations to advance access 
to diagnosis and treatment for rare 
disorders in emerging economies.

Risk exposure Summary response Key Shire reference materials
Local and patient communities
Failure to support, engage, and assist our patient 
communities may result in Shire losing its social 
license to operate in these communities. 
Additionally, Shire needs to continue to 
demonstrate a robust, equitable, and safe 
compassionate use program in local and  
patient communities.
We understand that our impact and reach extends 
beyond Shire into the therapeutic communities 
and groups that represent our patients and their 
families. Shire’s Patient Advocacy team works to 
build and sustain mutually beneficial, trusting 
relationships with patient advocacy organizations 
around the globe. Our team manages 
relationships with more than 100 patient advocacy 
organizations and supports Shire colleagues in 
local operating countries working with patient 
advocacy organizations. Shire’s Global Policy on 
Interactions with the Healthcare Community and 
Government Officials defines the global standards 
for interactions with patients and patient 
organizations. The Patient Advocacy and Global 
Compliance and Risk Management teams provide 
guidance and oversight. 
Additionally, Shire believes that participating in 
clinical trials is the best way for patients to access 
therapies prior to approval. In some extreme 
circumstances when this is not possible, patients 
with life-threatening diseases or conditions may 
seek special access to investigational medicines 
outside of a clinical trial setting. These situations 
are typically referred to as compassionate use, but 
can also be known as expanded access, early 
access, pre-approval access and emergency use. 
Shire has policies available on www.shire.com 
related to clinical trials and compassionate use.

Valuing our people and culture
We are proud of our people and of the entrepreneurial 
culture at the heart of our Company.
Investing in our people
Equipping our employees for success 
is vital to serving our patients and 
communities. We focus on recruiting, 
developing and supporting highly trained, 
collaborative, engaged, high-performing 
employees who can continuously learn and 
grow while doing their best work. These 
are people who thrive in our transparent, 
entrepreneurial, patient-focused culture 
and who live our leadership behaviors.
Fostering a company culture 
of development and inclusion
We focus on professional and leadership 
development, organizational effectiveness 
and performance management in line 
with our ongoing commitment to help 
employees perform and progress 
throughout Shire. In 2017, we launched the 
WeLearn portal that offers easily accessible 
professional learning opportunities to 
support all employees in achieving their 
development goals. We also have 
expanded our mentoring programs and 
leadership effectiveness toolkits for new 
and current leaders. 
Our success continues to be driven by our 
diverse employee talent around the world. 
We value all genders, ethnicities, ages, 
cultures, experiences and backgrounds as 
we build and grow our global organization. 
The benefit of our diverse workforce comes 
from respecting, considering and including 
different views in our work every day 
as described in our Code of Ethics. 
Our growing global reach gives us the 
opportunity to bring to our business, for 
the benefit of our patients, greater depth 
of experiences and capabilities. Shire is 
committed to diversity and inclusion and 
has a commitment to foster a company 
culture of development and inclusion as 
part of its new Responsibility strategy. 
Shire’s Business Resource Groups (BRGs) 
are a valued part of the Shire infrastructure 
and important to our Company’s success, 
as they contribute to building diverse and 
inspired teams by leading initiatives that 
help us attract, develop, and retain talent; 
engage with the world around us through 
meaningful community outreach; and bring 
a diverse set of ideas and experiences to 
spawn ideation, creativity, and energy. 
Each of our eight employee-organized 
BRGs is focused on a unique community 
of our employees: B-Equal (LGBT+), Black 
Leadership Council, Building Asian 
Leaders, Early Career Professionals, 
EnAbles (Disability/Caregivers), Impacto 
(Latino), Veterans, and Women@Shire.
Providing equal opportunities
Shire is committed to maintaining an 
environment that offers equal opportunities 
in employment and advancement, 
encourages inclusive conduct among all 
employees globally, and fosters respect 
for individual characteristics and values. 
As a global organization, our employees, 
patients, business and society benefit 
when we show respect, consideration 
and inclusion of different perspectives in 
our work every day. Shire’s diverse talent 
around the world drives our success. As an 
employer, Shire welcomes the opportunity 
to affirm its continuing commitment to 
provide equal employment or advancement 
opportunity, and to dedicate ourselves to 
establishing a work environment that is 
free from discrimination. This means that, 
as an employer, Shire will not tolerate 
discrimination against any worker or 
job applicant on the basis of race, color, 
religion, gender, national origin, ancestry, 
age, sexual orientation, marital status, 
pregnancy, non-job related mental or 
physical disability, genetic information, 
veteran status, or military service. We 
are committed to the fair treatment and 
reasonable accommodation of applicants 
or employees’ disabilities in accordance 
with all applicable laws in the respective 
locations of all Shire facilities.
Recognizing and rewarding
Our pay for performance philosophy 
provides managers with a variety of 
programs to recognize and reward 
employee contributions. Our employee 
share purchase plans enable employees 
to have a vested interest in Shire’s 
success. We focus on communicating to 
drive performance at every level of the 
business, for example through one-on-
one performance discussions between 
managers and employees and all-employee 
meetings held at our major sites. We 
regularly communicate with all employees 
via all-company meetings, the intranet, 
all-employee emails from the CEO and 
other executives, social networking 
platforms, and leadership briefings and 
cascading communications through 
emails and meetings.
Engaging our employees in 
our purpose and priorities  
Ensuring that we provide a sense of 
purpose for our employees is important 
to us, and we provide opportunities for 
employees to feel they are making a 
meaningful impact on patients and in 
their communities. For example, we 
encourage our employees to support 
patient advocacy organizations by 
recognizing disease awareness days 
and months by hosting and 
participating in internal and external 
events and awareness campaigns such 
as walks and runs. Also, we held our 
third Global Day of Service with more 
than 7,300 employees dedicating more 
than 29,000 hours of their time to 
community projects across more than 
300 locations around the world. 
For everyone involved, it was a 
very satisfying way to give back to 
local communities by making a 
lasting and meaningful difference.
2017 marked the second year of 
partnership with SeriousFun Children’s 
Network, a global community of 30 
camps and programs around the world 
that provides transformative camp 
experiences to children living with serious 
illnesses and their families. Shire’s  
$3 million commitment, $1 million annually 
for three years, enables nearly 1,000 
children to attend these life-changing 
camps. In addition, this year Shire 
employees dedicated more than 5,000 
hours to volunteering with SeriousFun. 
Through our volunteer program, 28 
employees volunteered as camp counselors 
at 12 different camps. Additionally, during 
our Global Day of Service, more than 250 
employees volunteered their time to work 
on enhancing the sites of seven SeriousFun 
camps. And we were proud to sponsor two 
family weekends, allowing 38 families to 
spend quality time together at camp.

Managing sustainable operations
Managing sustainable operations — from sourcing and 
manufacturing responsibly, to delivering safe and 
effective medicines, to using our natural resources 
carefully — helps ensure our patients receive the 
treatments they need to lead healthier lives.
Global approach, local focus 
We strive to operate a sustainable 
organization that protects our employees, 
the environment, our partners and the 
communities in which we live and work, 
as well as one that helps ensure that our 
patients receive the treatments they need 
to lead healthier lives. We are committed to 
establishing a culture of best-in-class safety 
and wellbeing for all employees globally.
Shire’s Responsibility strategy commits 
to sustainable and efficient use of natural 
resources and energy efficiency, including 
greenhouse gas emissions reduction 
goals, water conservation and waste 
management goals. The strategy 
also commits to responsible product 
stewardship and evaluating the social and 
environmental performance of Shire’s 
strategic suppliers. As a world-class 
organization, we work to minimize adverse 
environmental impacts and risks that may 
be associated with our products, facilities 
and operations. 
Our global Environment, Health, and Safety 
(EHS) policy outlines our commitments, 
within our operations and across the entire 
value chain. Shire’s Environment, Health & 
Safety Management Program is designed 
to identify, manage and reduce EHS risks 
associated with our operations, assure 
compliance and support continual 
performance improvement.
We apply the same approach and policies 
to all our facilities worldwide, and we are 
working to develop cross functional 
programs, policies and governance 
structures that will help support progress 
towards achieving our new commitments 
and goals. Nearly all of our manufacturing 
and research and development sites are 
certified to the ISO 14001 Environmental 
Management System Standard and the 
Occupational Health and  Safety 
Assessment Series (OHSAS) 18001 
Standard, with additional sites pursuing 
certification in 2018. Adhering to these 
standards helps ensure that effective 
processes are in place to reduce impact on 
our operations with priority consideration 
for the health and safety of employees and 
contractors; ensure compliance with 
applicable laws, regulations and other EHS 
related requirements; and create a culture 
of continuous improvement related to the 
management of EHS in our operations. 
Looking after our planet
We have initiatives in place to reduce 
our environmental impact through 
activities such as site-specific recycling 
and energy reduction programs. To reduce 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, several 
sites use green energy power purchasing 
agreements including our operations in 
Orth and Vienna, Austria; Neuchatel, 
Switzerland; Lessines, Belgium; and Rieti 
and Pisa, Italy. To promote green building 
and healthier work spaces, we have 
incorporated green building design 
principles and have achieved U.S. Green 
Building Council Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design (LEED) certification 
within several sites, including locations in 
Los Angeles, California; Cambridge and 
Lexington, Massachusetts; Exton, 
Pennsylvania; Vienna, Austria; and 
Rieti, Italy. 
Shire has established a cross-functional 
Global Energy Program that is charged 
with providing a systematic approach to 
measurably reduce energy and water 
consumption and cost, increase use of 
renewable energy, and reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions. 
Promoting health and safety 
We provide a safe work environment, 
as well as promote healthy lifestyles and 
behavior. We have implemented a goal 
as part of our Responsibility strategy to 
drive safety excellence by eliminating 
serious injury, impact, or fatality events at all 
Shire facilities. We train, empower and 
require our employees to take individual 
responsibility for health and safety, and 
launched safety leadership training for all 
leaders in 2017. We engage and consult 
with our employees when developing and 
improving our processes, and encourage 
them to integrate health and safety 
considerations into their everyday activities. 
As part of our Responsibility strategy, we 
are creating a comprehensive health and 
wellbeing program that supports all Shire 
employees to better serve our patients.
Responsible manufacturing 
and supplier diversity
We’re committed to working closely with 
our suppliers and making positive changes 
along our value chain by encouraging our 
business partners, suppliers, and 
contractors to adopt responsible and 
sustainable practices. To that end, our 
Sustainable performance
We received a score of A- for our 
2017 climate performance and a B 
for our water performance in the CDP, 
improvements from Shire’s previous 
scores. The CDP is a global non-profit 
organization working on behalf of 
investors to encourage companies 
to disclose and manage their 
environmental impacts. In 2017, 
over 5,600 corporations disclosed 
environmental data through CDP, 
with an average climate performance 
score among all participants of C and 
average water score of B.
new Responsibility strategy includes a 
focus on ensuring supplier commitment 
to responsibility by evaluating the social 
and environmental performance of 
Shire’s strategic suppliers and working 
with strategic suppliers to influence 
performance. Shire also has launched 
a new Supplier Code of Conduct that 
describes Shire’s expectations of its 
suppliers. Our approach to responsible 
supply chain management also includes 
supplier diversity. We actively seek and 
select qualified suppliers from all segments 
of the business community, in all markets 
where we operate. In the U.S., we employ 
our Supplier Diversity Program to ensure 
that Minority-Owned, Women-Owned, 
Veteran-Owned, Service-Disabled 
Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, 
businesses located in Historically 
Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZone) 
and Small Disadvantaged Businesses are 
afforded a fair and equal opportunity to 
participate in the awarding of contracts. 
In 2017, we exceeded our annual goal of 
9 percent by spending 13 percent of our 
U.S. spend with these small businesses.

of Human Rights and recognize the 
obligation to promote universal respect 
for and observance of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms for all, without 
distinction to sex, age, race, religion, or 
other characteristics protected by law.
We are committed to protecting the human 
rights of our employees in our offices and

labor, employment, and the employment 
relationship in all of the countries where 
Shire does business.
We commit to the principles articulated 
in the International Labor Organization’s

Principles and Rights at Work.” We also 
commit to the protection of human rights 
of our partners and suppliers, and in 
turn, expect them to do the same in their

Review of the business
Overview
The Company has grown both organically 
and through acquisition, completing a 
series of major transactions that have 
brought therapeutic, geographic and 
pipeline growth and diversification. The 
Company will continue to conduct its own 
research and development, focused on 
rare diseases and specialized conditions, 
as well as evaluate companies, products 
and pipeline opportunities that offer a 
strategic fit and have the potential to deliver 
value to all of the Company’s stakeholders: 
patients, physicians, policy makers, payers, 
partners, investors and employees.
The Company’s purpose is to enable 
people with life altering conditions to lead 
better lives. The Company will execute on 
its purpose through its strategy and 
business model. For further details of 
Shire’s strategy and business model, 
refer to pages 12 and 14.
Through deep understanding of patients’ 
needs, the Company is able to:
 • serve patients with high unmet needs 
in specialty therapeutic areas;
 • drive optimum performance of its 
marketed products — to serve patients 
today; and
 • build its pipeline of innovative specialist 
treatments through both R&D and 
Corporate Development activities to 
enable the Company to serve patients 
in the future.
Shire’s in-licensing and acquisition efforts 
are focused on products in specialist 
markets with strong intellectual property 
protection or other forms of market 
exclusivity and global rights. Shire believes 
that a carefully selected and balanced 
portfolio of products with strategically 
aligned and relatively small-scale sales 
forces will deliver strong results.
Company revenues, expenditures and 
net assets are attributable to the R&D, 
manufacture, sale and distribution of 
pharmaceutical products within one 
reportable segment. The Company also 
earns royalties and other revenues (where 
Shire has out-licensed products to third 
parties) that are recorded as royalty and 
other revenues.
Revenues are derived primarily from two 
sources — sales of the Company’s own 
products and royalties and other revenues:
 • 95.3% (2016: 95.5%) of total revenues 
are derived from Product sales; and
 • 4.7% (2016: 4.5%) of total revenues are 
derived from royalties and other 
revenues, including upfront payments 
from out-license arrangements.
The markets where the Company conducts 
its business are intensely competitive and 
highly regulated.
The healthcare industry is also experiencing:
 • pressure from governments and 
healthcare providers to keep prices low 
while increasing access to drugs;
 • increased discounts, which reduce 
revenue, due to the population of “baby 
boomers” covered under Medicare, 
specifically those beneficiaries receiving 
drug cost offset through the Medicare 
Part D Coverage Gap;
 • increasing challenges from third party 
payers for products to have 
demonstrable clinical benefit, with pricing 
and reimbursement approval becoming 
increasingly linked to a product’s clinical 
effectiveness and impact on overall costs 
of patient care;
 • increased R&D costs, because 
development programs are typically 
larger and take longer to get approval 
from regulators;
 • challenges to existing patents from 
generic manufacturers;
 • governments and health-care systems 
favoring earlier entry of low cost generic 
drugs; and
 • higher marketing costs, due to increased 
competition for market share.
Shire’s strategy has been developed to 
address these industry-wide competitive 
pressures. This strategy has resulted in a 
series of initiatives in the following areas:
Shire delivers strong 
revenue and earnings 
growth resulting in 
record operating cash 
flow for full year 2017 .
44 Shire Annual Report 2017 Markets
Shire’s current portfolio of approved 
products spans seven key therapeutic 
areas (TA): Immunology, Hematology, 
Neuroscience, Internal Medicine, Genetic 
Diseases, Oncology and Ophthalmics. In 
2017, the contribution of each TA to overall 
Product sales was as follows:
Product sales

Immunology 4,370.3 30.2
Hematology 3,785.6 26.2

Genetic Diseases 1,437.7 10.0
Oncology 261.7 1.8
Ophthalmics 259.2 1.8
14,448.9 100.0
Shire has grown in part through acquisition 
which has brought therapeutic, geographic 
and pipeline growth and diversification.
The acquisition of Baxalta in June 2016 
added the Hematology, Immunology and 
Oncology franchises and enabled Shire to 
become the global leader in rare diseases 
and highly specialized conditions.
The acquisition of Dyax in January 2016, 
with its lead pipeline product, SHP643, and 
marketed product KALBITOR, expanded 
and extended Shire’s industry-leading HAE 
portfolio (FIRAZYR and CINRYZE).
In July 2016, Shire licensed the global rights 
to all indications for SHP647 from Pfizer Inc. 
SHP647 is an investigational biologic being 
evaluated for the treatment of moderate-to-
severe inflammatory bowel disease.
In 2015, Shire acquired NPS Pharma, 
Meritage Pharma, Inc. (Meritage Pharma) 
and Foresight Biotherapeutics Inc. 
(Foresight).
The acquisition of NPS Pharma added 
global rights to an innovative product 
portfolio with multiple growth catalysts, 
including GATTEX/REVESTIVE and 
NATPARA/NATPAR. The acquisition of 
Meritage Pharma provided global rights 
to SHP621, a Phase 3 ready asset for 
the treatment of adolescents and adults 
with EoE, a rare, chronic inflammatory 
GI disease. This builds upon the 
Company’s rare disease and GI commercial 
infrastructure and expertise. With the 
acquisition of Foresight, Shire acquired 
the global rights to SHP640 (topical 
ophthalmic drops combining 0.6% 
povidone iodine (PVP-I) and 0.1% 
dexamethasone), a therapy in late-stage 
development for the treatment of infectious 
conjunctivitis, an ocular surface condition 
commonly referred to as pink eye. This 
acquisition has a clear strategic fit with 
XIIDRA, which is approved in the U.S. for 
the treatment of the signs and symptoms of 
dry eye disease, and further demonstrates 
Shire’s commitment to building a leadership 
position in ophthalmics.
In 2017, Shire derived 34% (2016: 32%) 
of Product sales from outside of the U.S. 
Shire has ongoing commercialization and 
late-stage development activities, which 
are expected to further supplement the 
diversification of revenues in the future, 
including the following:
 • the launch of MYDAYIS in the U.S.;
 • continued launch of INTUNIV, 
REVESTIVE and ONIVYDE across 
Europe;
 • the approvals of NATPAR and ADYNOVI 
in the EU;
 • submission of SHP643 in the U.S.;
 • submission of CALPEG NDA for ALL 
in the U.S.;
 • submission of VONVENDI MAA in 
Europe; and
 • geographic expansion of XIIDRA with 
the recent approval in Canada and 
submissions in other key markets. 
R&D
Shire’s R&D efforts are focused on core 
therapeutic areas including Immunology, 
Hematology, Neuroscience, Internal 
Medicine, Genetic Diseases, Oncology 
and Ophthalmics. Shire concentrates 
its resources on obtaining regulatory 
approval for later stage pipeline products 
within these therapeutic areas and 
focuses its early-stage research activities 
in rare diseases.

Review of the business continued
Evidence of the successful progression 
of the late stage pipeline can be seen in 
the granting of approval and associated 
launches of the Company’s products over 
the last three years. In this time, several 
products have received regulatory approval 
including: in the U.S., MYDAYIS in 2017, 
XIIDRA and CUVITRU in 2016, NATPARA 
and VYVANSE for BED in 2015; in the EU, 
ONIVYDE and CUVITRU in 2016, 
ELVANSE/TYVENSE for adults, INTUNIV 
for children and adolescents in 2015.
Shire’s management reviews direct costs 
for all R&D projects by development phase.
Shire’s R&D expenses in 2017 and 2016 
include costs on programs in all stages 
of development. The following table 
summarizes the Company’s direct R&D 
spend categorized by development stage,

to the above, the Company recorded R&D 
employee costs of $506.9 million in 2017 
(2016: $431.9 million) and other indirect 
R&D costs of $198.6 million (2016: $153.0 
million), comprising mainly of depreciation 
and up-front and milestone payments for 
in-licensed development projects. 
For a discussion of the Company’s current 
development projects see pages 24 and 25.
Patents and Market Exclusivity
The loss or expiration of patent protection 
or regulatory exclusivity with respect to any 
of the Company’s major products could 
have a material adverse effect on the 
Company’s revenues, financial condition 
and results of operations, as generic or 
biosimilar products may enter the market. 
Companies selling generic products often 
do not need to complete extensive clinical 
studies when they seek registration of a 
generic or biosimilar product and 
accordingly, are generally able to sell a 
generic version of the Company’s products 
at a much lower price.
In 2017, a generic version of the Company’s 
LIALDA product was launched, which led 
to lower sales of Shire’s LIALDA product 
compared to the period before loss of 
exclusivity. In 2017, a generic version of the 
Company’s FOSRENOL product was 
launched, which led to lower sales of 
FOSRENOL compared to the period before 
loss of exclusivity.
Shire is engaged in various legal 
proceedings with generic manufacturers. 
For information regarding current patent 
litigation, refer to Note 25, Legal and Other 
Proceedings, to the consolidated financial 
statements.
Corporate Development
Shire focuses its corporate development 
activity on the acquisition and in-licensing 
of businesses, products or compounds 
that offer a strategic fit and have the 
potential to deliver demonstrable value to 
all of the Company’s stakeholders.
Results of operations for the 
years ended December 31, 
2017 and 2016 
Financial highlights for the year ended 
December 31, 2017 are as follows:
Revenues
 • Product sales increased 33% to 
$14,448.9 million (2016: $10,885.8 
million), primarily driven by the inclusion 
of a full year of legacy Baxalta product 
sales, with strong sales from 
immunoglobulin therapies and 
bio therapeutics. 
 • Royalties and other revenues increased 
39% to $711.7 million (2016: $510.8 
million), primarily due to the receipt of 
an upfront license fee and a full year of 
contract manufacturing revenue acquired 
with Baxalta. 
Operating results
 • Operating income increased 155% to 
$2,455.2 million (2016: $962.9 million), 
primarily due to the inclusion of a full year 
of legacy Baxalta operating income and 
lower expense related to the unwind of 
inventory fair value adjustments, partially 
offset by higher amortization of acquired 
intangible assets.
Earnings per share (EPS)
 • Diluted earnings per American 
Depositary Share (ADS) increased to 
$14.05 (2016: $1.27). The increase is 
primarily due to a tax benefit in 2017 
driven by U.S. tax reform, higher 
operating income, combined with lower 
discontinued operations losses related to 
the divested DERMAGRAFT business.
Cash flows
 • Net cash provided by operating activities 
increased 60% to $4,256.7 million (2016: 
$2,658.9 million), primarily due to the 
inclusion of a full year of legacy Baxalta 
operating cash flows and strong cash 
receipts from higher legacy Shire sales 
and operating profitability, partially offset 
by a payment associated with the 
settlement of the DERMAGRAFT 
litigation and higher interest payments. 
Also, 2016 net cash provided by 
operating activities was negatively 
impacted by a payment associated 
with the termination of a biosimilar 
collaboration acquired with Baxalta.

 47 Shire Annual Report 2017
 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Immunology
Immunology product sales, which 
now include HAE product sales, were 
$4,370.3 million in 2017 compared to 
$2,827.0 million in 2016, primarily driven 
by the inclusion of a full year of 
immunoglobulin therapies and bio 
therapeutics product sales following 
the acquisition of Baxalta in June 2016. 
Immunoglobulin and bio therapeutics 
reported total product sales of 
$2,940.7 million. 
HAE product sales for the year ended 
December 31, 2017 increased to $1,429.6 
million or 9% from $1,310.9 million in 2016, 
primarily driven by FIRAZYR, up 15% to 
$663.0 and CINRYZE up 3% to $699.3 
million. During the third quarter of 2017, 
CINRYZE had a supply constraint caused 
by a manufacturing interruption at a 
third-party supplier. The issue was 
addressed and production resumed in 
the fourth quarter of 2017. On January 24, 
2018, FDA granted approval for the 
technology transfer of CINRYZE drug 
product manufacturing process to the 
Vienna, Austria manufacturing site. 
The Company expects to start 
manufacturing CINRYZE drug product 
in-house in Vienna in the first quarter of 
2018, providing an additional supply 
source to meet patient demand.
Hematology
Hematology, acquired with Baxalta in June 
2016, included sales of recombinant and 
plasma-derived hemophilia products 
(primarily Factor VIII and Factor IX) and 
inhibitor therapies. Hematology product 
sales were $3,785.6 million in 2017 
compared to $2,240.8 million in 2016, 
primarily driven by the inclusion of a full 
year of Hematology product sales following 
the acquisition of Baxalta.
Neuroscience
Neuroscience product sales for the year 
ended December 31, 2017 increased to 
$2,664.1 million, or 7%, from $2,490.5 
million in 2016, with growth primarily driven 
by VYVANSE and the inclusion of MYDAYIS.
VYVANSE product sales for the year ended 
December 31, 2017 increased to $2,161.1 
million, or 7%, from $2,013.9 million in 
2016, due to the benefit of a price increase
1 
taken since 2016, increased demand 
resulting from growth in the U.S. ADHD 
market and strong performance in the 
Company’s international markets, partially 
offset by lower U.S. stocking.
MYDAYIS, which was made available to 
patients on August 28, 2017, contributed 
$21.6 million of product sales in 2017.
Information about litigation related to 
MYDAYIS can be found in Note 25, Legal 
and Other Proceedings, to the consolidated 
financial statements. 
Internal Medicine
Internal Medicine product sales for the year 
ended December 31, 2017 decreased to 
$1,670.3 million, or 5%, from $1,755.5 
million in 2016, primarily driven by the 
impact of LIALDA generic competition, 
partially offset by growth from GATTEX/
REVESTIVE and NATPARA.
LIALDA/MEZAVANT product sales 
decreased to $569.4 million, or 28%, for 
the year ended December 31, 2017 from 
$792.1 million in 2016, due to the impact 
of generic competition in 2017.
Information about litigation related to 
LIALDA can be found in ITEM 3: Legal 
Proceedings and Note 25, Legal and 
Other Proceedings, to the consolidated 
financial statements. 
GATTEX/REVESTIVE and NATPARA/
NATPAR product sales increased to $335.5 
million, or 53%, and $147.4 million or 73%, 
respectively, for 2017, compared to product 
sales in 2016 primarily due to an increase in 
the numbers of patients on therapy and to 
a lesser extent, the benefit of price 
increases taken since 2016

.
Genetic Diseases
Genetic Diseases product sales, which now 
excludes HAE product sales, for the year 
ended December 31, 2017 increased to 
$1,437.7 million, or 4%, from $1,387.1 million 
in 2016, primarily due to ELAPRASE and 
REPLAGAL, as both products benefited 
from an increase in the number of patients 
on therapy.
Oncology
Oncology, acquired with Baxalta in 
June 2016, reported product sales of 
$261.7 million for the year ended December 
31, 2017 compared to $130.5 million for 
the year ended December 31, 2016. 
Oncology includes sales of ONCASPAR 
and ONIVYDE. ONIVYDE was approved 
in the EU on October 18, 2016.
Ophthalmics
Ophthalmic product sales relate to 
XIIDRA, which was made available to 
patients on August 29, 2016. XIIDRA 
product sales were $259.2 million for the 
year ended December 31, 2017 compared 
to $54.4 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2016. 
Royalties and other revenues
Royalties and other revenues increased to 
$711.7 million or 39% for the year ended 
December 31, 2017 from $510.8 million in 
2016, primarily due to an upfront license 
fee received, a full year of contract 
manufacturing revenue acquired with 
Baxalta, increase in SENSIPAR royalties 
and an increase in royalty streams acquired 
with Dyax. 
Cost of sales
Cost of sales increased by $884.3 million 
to $4,700.8 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2017 (31% of Total revenues) 
from $3,816.5 million in 2016 (33% of Total 
revenues), due to the inclusion of a full year of 
legacy Baxalta costs. The decrease in Cost 
of sales as a percentage of Total revenues 
for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 
December 31, 2017 is primarily due to the 
impact of lower expense related to the 
unwind of inventory fair value adjustments, 
partially offset by the inclusion of a full year 
of lower margin product franchises acquired 
with Baxalta.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, 
Cost of product sales included additional 
depreciation totaling $276.1 million (2016: 
$160.8 million), primarily due to the 
acquisition of Baxalta.
R&D
R&D expense increased by $323.5 million, 
or 22%, to $1,763.3 million for the year 
ended December 31, 2017 (12% of Total 
revenues) from $1,439.8 million in 2016 
(13% of Total revenues), primarily due to 
the inclusion of a full year of legacy 
Baxalta costs. 
R&D expense for the year ended December 
31, 2017 included depreciation of $47.2 
million (2016: $34.1 million).
SG&A
SG&A expense increased by $515.7 million, 
or 17%, to $3,530.9 million for the year 
ended December 31, 2017 (23% of Total 
revenues) from $3,015.2 million in 2016 
(26% of Total revenues), primarily due to 
the inclusion of a full year of legacy 
Baxalta costs. 
For the year ended December 31, 2017, 
SG&A expense included depreciation of 
$172.5 million (2016: $98.0 million).
1 The actual net effect of price increases on 
current period net sales compared to the 
comparative period is difficult to quantify 
due to the various managed care rebates, 
Medicaid discounts, other discount 
programs in which the Company 
participates and fee for service agreements 
with wholesale customers.
Strategic report
Review of the business continued
48 Shire Annual Report 2017 Amortization of acquired 
intangible assets
For the year ended December 31, 2017, 
Shire recorded Amortization of acquired 
intangible assets of $1,768.4 million 
compared to $1,173.4 million in 2016. 
The increase of $595.0 million was primarily 
related to a full year of amortization of 
intangible assets acquired with Baxalta and 
the acceleration of CINRYZE amortization 
following positive SHP643 Phase 3 results.
Integration and acquisition costs
For the year ended December 31, 2017, 
Shire recorded Integration and acquisition 
costs of $894.5 million, primarily relating 
to the Baxalta acquisition. Costs included 
asset impairment charges, employee 
severance and expenses associated 
with facility consolidations.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, 
Shire recorded Integration and acquisition 
costs of $883.9 million, primarily relating to 
the Baxalta and Dyax acquisitions. Costs 
included employee severance, acceleration 
of stock compensation, third-party 
professional fees, contract terminations 
and other transaction-related fees. 
Reorganization costs
For the year ended December 31, 2017, 
Shire recorded Reorganization costs of 
$47.9 million, primarily related to the closure 
of the Basingstoke, U.K. office.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, 
Shire recorded Reorganization costs of 
$121.4 million, primarily related to the 
closure of a facility at the Los Angeles, 
U.S. manufacturing site.
Other expense, net
Other expense, net increased by $85.0 
million to $561.8 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2017 from $476.8 million in 
2016, primarily due to a full year of interest 
expense incurred on borrowings used to 
fund the acquisition of Baxalta, reduced by 
repayments of borrowings and partially 
offset by lower amortization of one-time 
upfront borrowing costs for Baxalta and 
Dyax in 2017.
Taxation
The effective tax rate in 2017 was a tax 
credit of 125% (2016: tax credit of 26%). 
The effective tax rate in 2017 was lower due 
to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act (P.L. 115-97) (Tax Act), which was 
signed into law on December 22, 2017. 
Among the changes is a permanent 
reduction in the federal U.S. corporate 
income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective 
January 1, 2018. 
As a result of the reduction in the U.S. 
corporate income tax rate, Shire revalued 
its net deferred tax positions for the year 
ending December 31, 2017. 
This resulted in a decrease to the net 
deferred tax liability of approximately $2.5 
billion, which was recorded as reduction to 
income tax expense for the fourth quarter of 
2017. In addition, Shire has estimated an 
income tax liability of $621.7 million related 
to the transition tax which is applicable to 
certain non U.S. earnings previously 
untaxed in the U.S. The Company recorded 
a $90.1 million income tax expense related 
to the transition tax and reclassified a 
deferred tax liability which had been 
accrued for prior years’ unremitted earnings 
to income tax payable for the remaining 
amount. Shire continues to analyze the Tax 
Act to determine the full effects the new law 
will have on its financial statements and all 
amounts recorded in the 2017 financial 
statements are provisional in nature.
Discontinued operations
The gain from discontinued operations for 
the year ended December 31, 2017 was 
$18.0 million, net of taxes, primarily the return 
of funds previously held in escrow related to 
the acquisition of the DERMAGRAFT 
business. The loss from discontinued 
operations for the year ended December 31, 
2016 was $276.1 million, net of tax benefit of 
$98.9 million, primarily due to the 
establishment of legal contingencies related 
to the divested DERMAGRAFT business.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
General
The Company’s funding requirements 
depend on a number of factors, including 
the timing and extent of its development 
programs; corporate, business and product 
acquisitions; the level of resources required 
for the expansion of certain manufacturing 
and marketing capabilities as the product 
base expands; increases in accounts 
receivable and inventory which may arise 
with any increase in Product sales; 
competitive and technological 
developments; the timing and cost of 
obtaining required regulatory approvals for 
new products; the timing and quantum of 
milestone payments on business 
combinations, in-licenses and collaborative 
projects; the timing and quantum of tax and 
dividend payments; the timing and quantum 
of purchases by the Employee Benefit Trust 
(EBT) of Shire shares in the market to satisfy 
awards granted under Shire’s employee 
share plans; the timing and qualification of 
its refinancing obligations; and the amount 
of cash generated from sales of Shire’s 
products and royalty receipts.
An important part of Shire’s business 
strategy is to protect its products and 
technologies through the use of patents, 
proprietary technologies and trademarks, 
to the extent available. The Company 
intends to defend its intellectual property 
and as a result may need cash for funding 
the cost of litigation.
The Company finances its activities through 
cash generated from operating activities; 
credit facilities; private and public offerings 
of equity and debt securities; and the 
proceeds of asset or investment disposals.
Shire’s Consolidated Balance Sheets 
included $472.4 million of Cash and cash 
equivalents as of December 31, 2017.
Shire has a revolving credit facility (RCF) of 
$2.1 billion which matures in 2021, $810.0 
million of which was utilized as of December 
31, 2017. The RCF incorporates a $250 
million U.S. dollar and Euro swingline facility 
operating as a sub-limit thereof.
In connection with the acquisition of Dyax, 
Shire entered into a $5.6 billion amortizing 
term loan facility in November 2015. As of 
December 31, 2017, $1.2 billion of this term 
loan facility was outstanding. The facility 
matures on November 2, 2018.
In connection with the acquisition of 
Baxalta, Shire assumed $5.0 billion of 
unsecured senior notes previously issued 
by Baxalta, of which $750.0 million is due 
within the next twelve months and issued 
$12.1 billion of unsecured senior notes in 
September 2016, of which none are due 
for repayment in the next twelve months. 
The details of these debt agreements are 
described below and in Note 18, 
Borrowings and Capital Leases, to the 
consolidated financial statements.
In addition, Shire also has access to 
certain short-term uncommitted lines of 
credit which are available to utilize from 
time to time to provide short-term cash 
management flexibility. As of December 31, 
2017, these lines of credit were not utilized.
The Company may also engage in 
financing activities from time to time, 
including accessing the debt or equity 
capital markets.

representations and warranties, covenants 
and events of default, including 
requirements that Shire’s (i) ratio of Net 
Debt to EBITDA in respect of the most 
recently-ended 12-month relevant period 
(each as defined in the RCF) must not, 
at any time, exceed 3.5:1 except that, 
following an acquisition fulfilling certain 
criteria, Shire may elect to increase this 
ratio to (a) 5.5:1 for the relevant period in 
which the acquisition was completed (b) 
5.0:1 in respect of the first relevant period 
following the relevant period in which the

(each as defined in the RCF) must not be 
less than 4.0:1. Shire elected to increase 
the Net Debt to EBITDA ratio in connection 
with the period ending June 30, 2016, 
following the completion of the acquisition 
of Baxalta during the period. The final 
relevant period ended June 2017.
The RCF restricts, subject to certain 
exceptions, Shire’s ability to incur additional 
financial indebtedness, grant security over 
its assets or provide loans/grant credit. 
Further, any lender may require mandatory 
prepayment of its participation if there is a 
change of control of Shire, subject to 
certain exceptions for schemes of 
arrangement and analogous schemes.
Events of default under the RCF include, 
subject to customary grace periods and 
materiality thresholds: (i) non-payment 
of any amounts due under the finance 
documents (as defined in the RCF), (ii) 
failure to satisfy any financial covenants, 
(iii) material misrepresentation in any of the 
finance documents, (iv) failure to pay, or 
certain other defaults, under other financial 
indebtedness, (v) certain insolvency events 
or proceedings, (vi) material adverse

2017 (November 2015 Facility B) and 
(iii) a $2.4 billion amortizing term loan facility 
which matures on November 2, 2018 
(November 2015 Facility C), of which $1.2 
billion remains outstanding as of December

of Net Debt to EBITDA (each as defined 
in the November 2015 Facilities Agreement) 
in respect of the most recently completed 
financial year or financial half year and 
(ii) the occurrence and continuation of an 
event of default in respect of the financial 
covenants or failure to provide a 
compliance certificate.
Revolving Credit Facilities 
Agreement
On December 12, 2014, Shire entered 
into a $2.1 billion revolving credit facilities 
agreement with a number of financial 
institutions. Shire plc and SAIIDAC are 
able to borrow under the RCF; Shire plc, 
SAIIDAC and Baxalta are guarantors under 
the RCF. As of December 31, 2017 SAIIDAC 
utilized $810.0 million of the RCF.
The RCF, which terminates on December 
12, 2021, may be applied towards financing 
the general corporate purposes of Shire. 
The RCF incorporates a $250 million U.S. 
dollar and Euro swingline facility operating 
as a sub-limit thereof.
Interest on any loans made under the RCF 
is payable on the last day of each interest 
period, which may be one week or one, 
two, three or six months at the election of 
Shire, or as otherwise agreed with the 
lenders. The interest rate for the RCF is: 
LIBOR (or, in relation to any revolving loan 
in Euro, EURIBOR); plus 0.30% per annum

prevailing ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA (each 
as defined in the RCF) in respect of the 
most recently completed financial year or 
financial half year and (ii) the occurrence 
and continuation of an event of default in 
respect of the financial covenants or the 
failure to provide a compliance certificate.
Shire also will pay (i) a commitment fee 
equal to 35% of the applicable margin on 
available commitments under the RCF for 
the availability period applicable thereto 
and (ii) a utilization fee equal to (a) 0.10% 
per year of the aggregate of all outstanding 
loans up to an aggregate base currency 
amount equal to $700.0 million, (b) 0.15% 
per year of the amount by which the 
aggregate base currency amount of all 
outstanding loans exceeds $700.0 million 
but is equal to or less than $1,400.0 million 
and (c) 0.30% per year of the amount 
by which the aggregate base currency 
amount of all outstanding loans exceeds 
$1,400.0 million.

 • Substantially all of the Company’s Cash 
and cash equivalents are held by foreign 
subsidiaries (i.e. those subsidiaries 
incorporated outside of Jersey, Channel 
Islands, the jurisdiction of incorporation 
of Shire plc). The amount of Cash and 
cash equivalents held by foreign 
subsidiaries has not had, and is not 
expected to have, a material impact 
on the Company’s liquidity and capital 
resources.
 • Net debt is a Non GAAP measure. 
The Company believes that Net Debt is 
a useful measure as it indicates the level 
of net cash/borrowings after taking 
account of the Cash and cash 
equivalents that could be utilized to pay 
down the outstanding borrowings.
Cash flow activity
Net cash provided by operating activities 
for the year ended December 31, 2017 
increased 60% to $4,256.7 million (2016: 
$2,658.9 million), primarily due to inclusion 
of a full year of Baxalta operating cash 
flows, increased cash receipts from higher 
sales and operating profitability, partially 
offset by a payment of $351.6 million 
associated with the settlement of the 
DERMAGRAFT litigation and higher 
interest payments.
Net cash provided by operating activities 
for the year ended December 31, 2016 
increased 14% to $2,658.9 million (2015: 
$2,337.0 million), primarily due to increased 
cash receipts from higher sales, partially 
offset by higher tax and interest payments, 
costs related to the Baxalta integration 
and a payment associated with the 
termination of a biosimilar collaboration 
acquired with Baxalta.
The November 2015 Facilities Agreement 
includes customary representations and 
warranties, covenants and events of 
default, including requirements that Shire’s 
(i) ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA in respect of 
the most recently ended 12-month relevant 
period, (each as defined in the November 
2015 Facilities Agreement), must not, at any 
time, exceed 3.5:1, except that following an 
acquisition fulfilling certain criteria, Shire 
may elect to increase this ratio to (a) 5.5:1 
for the relevant period in which the 
acquisition was completed, (b) 5.0:1 in 
respect of the first relevant period following 
the relevant period in which the acquisition 
was completed, and (c) 4.5:1 in respect of 
the second relevant period following the 
relevant period in which the acquisition was 
completed and (ii) ratio of EBITDA to Net 
Interest in respect of the most recently 
ended 12 month relevant period, (each as 
defined in the November 2015 Facilities 
Agreement), must not be less than 4.0:1. 
Shire elected to increase the Net Debt to 
EBITDA ratio in connection with the period 
ending June 30, 2016, following the 
completion of the acquisition of Baxalta 
during the period. The final relevant period 
ended June 2017.
The November 2015 Facilities Agreement 
restricts, subject to certain exceptions, 
Shire’s ability to incur additional financial 
indebtedness, grant security over its assets 
or provide loans/grant credit. Further, any 
lender may require mandatory prepayment 
of its participation if there is a change of 
control of Shire, subject to certain 
exceptions for schemes of arrangement

Events of default under the November 2015 
Facilities Agreement include, subject to 
customary grace periods and materiality 
thresholds: (i) non-payment of any amounts 
due under the finance documents (as 
defined in the November 2015 Facilities 
Agreement), (ii) failure to satisfy any financial 
covenants, (iii) material misrepresentation in 
any of the finance documents, (iv) failure to 
pay, or certain other defaults, under other 
financial indebtedness, (v) certain 
insolvency events or proceedings, (vi) 
material adverse changes in the business, 
operations, assets or financial condition of 
Shire as a whole, (vii) if it becomes unlawful 
for Shire (or any successor parent 
company) or any of their respective 
subsidiaries that are parties to the 
November 2015 Facilities Agreement to 
perform their obligations thereunder or (viii) 
if Shire (or any successor parent company) 
or any subsidiary thereof which is a party to 
the November 2015 Facilities Agreement 
repudiates the November 2015 Facilities 
Agreement or any other finance document, 
among others.
January 2016 Facilities Agreement
On January 11, 2016, Shire (as original 
guarantor and original borrower), entered 
into an $18.0 billion bridge facilities 
agreement with various financial institutions 
(the January 2016 Facilities Agreement). 
The January 2016 Facilities Agreement 
comprised two credit facilities: (i) a $13.0 
billion term loan facility originally maturing 
on January 11, 2017 (January 2016 Facility 
A) and (ii) a $5.0 billion revolving loan facility 
originally maturing on January 11, 2017 
(January 2016 Facility B). On April 1, 2016, 
SAIIDAC became an additional borrower 
and additional guarantor under the January 
2016 Facilities Agreement. The January 
2016 Facility A was fully repaid in 
September 2016. The January 2016 Facility 
B was canceled effective July 11, 2016, in 
accordance with its terms.
Short-term uncommitted lines of credit 
(Credit lines)
Shire has access to various Credit lines from 
a number of banks which are available to be 
utilized from time to time to provide short-
term cash management flexibility. These 
Credit lines can be withdrawn by the banks 
at any time. The Credit lines are not relied 
upon for core liquidity. As of December 31, 
2017 , these Credit lines were not utilized.
Financing
Shire anticipates that its operating cash 
flow together with available cash, cash 
equivalents, and the RCF will be sufficient 
to meet its anticipated future operating 
expenses, capital expenditures, tax and 
interest payments, lease obligations, debt 
repayments and milestone payments 
as they become due over the next 
twelve months.
If the Company decides to acquire other 
businesses, it expects to fund these 
acquisitions from cash resources, the RCF 
and through new borrowings (including 
issuances of debt securities) or the 
issuance of new equity, if necessary.

 • Calculations of expected interest payments incorporate current period assumptions for interest rates, foreign currency translation rates and 
hedging strategies (refer to Note 16, Financial Instruments to these consolidated financial statements), and assume that interest is accrued 
through the maturity date or expiration of the related instrument.
 • The Company leases certain land, facilities, motor vehicles and certain equipment under operating leases expiring through 2033.
 • Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods, investments or services (including clinical trials, contract manufacturing and 
capital equipment), and open purchase orders, that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. Shire expects 
to fund these commitments with cash flows from operating activities.
 • Unrecognized tax benefits and associated interest and penalties of $143.8 million are included within payments due in one to three years.
The following items have been excluded from the table above:
 • Cash outflows related to the assumed pension and other post-employment benefit plans, in which timing of funding is uncertain and 
dependent on future movements in interest rates and investment returns, changes in laws and regulations and other variables.
 • In connection with the Company’s acquisitions, the Company recorded contingent consideration liabilities related to development, 
regulatory and commercial milestones and royalty payments. These liabilities were recorded at fair value on the respective acquisition 
dates and revalued each reporting period. The Company may pay up to approximately $2.7 billion, which excludes royalty related payments, 
upon achieving clinical, regulatory and commercialization milestones. For additional information, see Note 14, Fair Value Measurement. 
 53 Shire Annual Report 2017
 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information As of December 31, 2017 , Shire estimates 
that a hypothetical increase and decrease 
of 100 basis points in interest rates would 
increase and decrease net interest costs on 
borrowings by approximately $30.0 million 
during 2018, and decrease and increase the 
fair value of long term interest rate sensitive 
instruments by approximately $870.7 million 
and $956.4 million, respectively, during the 
same period.
Foreign exchange risk
The Company operates in numerous 
countries and as a consequence has foreign 
exchange exposure. The main operating 
currencies of the Company are the U.S. 
dollar, Pounds sterling, Swiss franc, 
Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and the 
Euro. It is the Company’s policy that these 
exposures are minimized to the extent 
practicable by denominating transactions 
in the subsidiary’s functional currency.
Where significant exposures remain, the 
Company uses foreign exchange contracts 
(spot, forward and swap contracts) to 
manage the exposure for balance sheet 
assets and liabilities that are denominated 
in currencies different to the functional 
currency of the relevant subsidiary. These 
assets and liabilities relate predominantly 
to inter-company financing. The Company 
has not elected hedge accounting for these 
transactions. Cash flows from derivative 
instruments are presented within net cash 
provided by operating activities in the 
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, 
unless the derivative instruments are 
economically hedging specific investing 
or financing activities.
Translational foreign exchange exposure 
arises on the translation into U.S. dollars 
of the financial statements of non-U.S. dollar 
functional subsidiaries. For details refer to 
Note 16, Financial Instruments, to the 
consolidated financial statements.
 • Milestone payments to third parties 
upon the achievement of development, 
regulatory and commercial milestones, 
as well as potential royalty payments, 
associated with in-licensing and 
collaboration agreements. Potential 
future milestone payments associated 
with these arrangements was 
approximately $5.5 billion, which excludes 
potential royalty payments. For additional 
information, see Note 4. Collaborative 
and Other Licensing Arrangements.
 • Milestone payments related with 
collaboration agreements that become 
payable only if the Company chooses to 
exercise one or more of its options and 
potential contingent payments associated 
with R&D costs that may be funded by 
collaboration partners in the future.
 • An unfunded commitment of $48.9 million 
as a limited partner in multiple investment 
companies, in which the timing of future 
payments is uncertain.
Off-balance sheet arrangements
There are no off-balance sheet 
arrangements, aside from those outlined 
above, that have, or are reasonably likely to 
have, a current or future material effect on 
the Company’s financial condition, revenues 
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, 
capital expenditures or capital resources.
Foreign currency fluctuations
A number of the Company’s subsidiaries 
have a functional currency other than the 
U.S. dollar. As such, the consolidated 
financial results are subject to fluctuations 
in exchange rates, particularly in the Euro, 
Swiss franc, Japanese yen and Pound 
sterling against the U.S. dollar.
Accumulated foreign currency translation 
differences of $1,279.6 million are reported 
within Accumulated other comprehensive 
income as of December 31, 2017. Foreign 
exchange losses for the year ended 
December 31, 2017 of $97.3 million are 
reported in the Consolidated Statements 
of Operations.
As of December 31, 2017, the Company 
had outstanding foreign exchange swap 
and forward contracts that manage the 
currency risk associated with intercompany 
transactions. As of December 31, 2017 the 
fair value of these contracts was a net asset 
of $11.4 million. For the year ended 
December 31, 2017, net gains on foreign 
exchange swaps and forwards of $93.6 
million are reported in the Consolidated 
Statements of Operations.
Inflation
Although at reduced levels in recent years, 
inflation continues to apply upward pressure 
on the cost of goods and services which 
are used in the business. However, the 
Company believes that the net effect of 
inflation on its revenues and operations has 
been minimal during the past three years.
Treasury policies and organization
The Company’s principal treasury 
operations are coordinated by its corporate 
treasury function. All treasury operations are 
conducted within a framework of policies 
and procedures approved annually by the 
Board of Directors. As a matter of policy, the 
Company does not undertake speculative 
transactions that would increase its credit, 
currency or interest rate exposure.
Interest rate risk
The Company is exposed to the risk that its 
earnings and cash flows could be adversely 
impacted by fluctuations in benchmark 
interest rates relating to its debt obligations 
on which interest is set at floating rates. 
The Company’s policy is to manage this 
risk to an acceptable level. The Company 
is principally exposed to interest rate risk 
on any borrowings under the Company’s 
various debt facilities and on part of the 
senior notes assumed in connection with 
the acquisition of Baxalta. Interest on each 
of these debt obligations is set at floating 
rates, to the extent utilized. Shire’s exposure 
under these facilities is to changes in U.S. 
dollar interest rates. For details refer to Note 
15, Financial Instruments, to the 
consolidated financial statements.
The Company is also exposed to interest 
rate risk on its restricted cash, cash and 
cash equivalents and on foreign exchange 
contracts on which interest is set at floating 
rates. As the Company maintains all of 
its cash, liquid investments and foreign 
exchange contracts on a short-term basis 
for liquidity purposes, this risk is not actively 
managed. For the year ended December 31, 
2017 , the average interest rate received on 
cash and liquid investments was less than 
1.0% per annum. These cash and liquid 
investments were primarily invested in U.S. 
dollar term deposits with banks and money 
market and liquidity funds or held as cash 
on account.

54 Shire Annual Report 2017 Foreign exchange risk sensitivity
The following exchange rate sensitivity 
analysis summarizes the sensitivity of the 
Company’s reported revenues and net 
income to hypothetical changes in the 
average annual exchange rates of the Euro, 
Pound sterling and Swiss franc against the 
U.S. dollar, (assuming a hypothetical 10% 
strengthening of the U.S. dollar against each 
of the aforementioned currencies in the year 
ended December 31, 2017):
Reduction
 in revenues
$’M
Reduction in
net income
$’M
Euro (221.3) (38.7)
Pound sterling (31.0) (7.5)
Swiss franc (8.3) (2.1)
A 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar against 
the aforementioned currencies would have 
an equal and opposite effect.
For more detail of foreign exchange forward 
contracts, refer to Note 16, Financial 
Instruments, to the consolidated financial 
statements.
Concentration of credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially expose 
Shire to concentrations of credit risk consist 
primarily of short-term cash investments, 
derivative contracts and trade accounts 
receivable from Product sales and from 
third parties from which the Company 
receives royalties. Cash is invested in 
short-term money market instruments, 
including money market and liquidity funds 
and bank term deposits or held on account. 
The money market and liquidity funds where 
Shire invests are all triple A rated by both 
Standard and Poor’s and by Moody’s credit 
rating agencies.
The Company is exposed to the credit 
risk of the counterparties with which 
it enters into bank term deposit 
arrangements and derivative instruments. 
The Company limits this exposure through 
a system of internal credit limits which 
vary according to ratings assigned to 
the counterparties by the major rating 
agencies. The internal credit limits are 
approved by Shire’s Board of Directors 
and exposure against these limits 
is monitored by the Company’s corporate 
treasury function. The counterparties to 
these derivatives contracts are major 
international financial institutions.
The Company’s revenues from Product 
sales in the U.S. are mainly governed by 
agreements with major pharmaceutical 
wholesalers and relationships with other 
pharmaceutical distributors and retail 
pharmacy chains. For the year ended 
December 31, 2017 , there were three 
customers in the U.S. that accounted 
for 26% of the Company’s Product sales. 
Such customers typically have significant 
cash resources and as such the risk 
from concentration of credit is considered 
acceptable. The Company has taken positive 
steps to manage any credit risk associated 
with these transactions and operates clearly 
defined credit evaluation procedures. 
However, an inability of one or more of 
these wholesalers to honor their debts to 
the Company could have an adverse effect 
on the Company’s financial condition and 
results of operations.
A substantial portion of the Company’s 
accounts receivable in countries outside 
of the U.S. is derived from Product sales 
to government-owned or government-
supported healthcare providers. The 
Company’s recovery of these accounts 
receivable is therefore dependent upon 
the financial stability and creditworthiness 
of the relevant governments. In recent years 
global and national economic conditions 
have negatively affected the growth, 
creditworthiness and general economic 
condition of certain markets in which the 
Company operates. As a result, in some 
countries outside of the U.S., specifically, 
Argentina, Brazil, Greece, Italy, Portugal 
and Spain, the Company is experiencing 
delays in the remittance of receivables due 
from government-owned or government-
supported healthcare providers. Of those, 
the only significant accounts receivable as 
of December 31, 2017 is $91.5 million 
from Brazil. 
The Company will continue to evaluate all 
its accounts receivable for potential collection 
risks and has made provision for amounts 
where collection is considered to be 
doubtful. Any such loss could have an 
adverse effect on the Company’s financial 
condition and results of operations. The 
Company does not consider it is currently 
exposed to significant credit risk outside of 
the countries listed above.

In a year of growth,

Shire’s high standard 
of corporate 
governance remains 
critically important to 
the Board.

Governance section 
This section sets out Shire’s governance 
framework and seeks to demonstrate how 
the main principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Governance 
Code”) were applied throughout the 
financial year ended December 31, 2017. 
The Board is of the opinion that, during 
this period, the Company complied with 
the provisions of the Governance Code. 
Published by the Financial Reporting

In 2017, my fellow Directors and I have 
overseen the continued transformation of 
Shire: the integration of Baxalta, multiple 
new product launches, the expansion of 
our pipeline, and a detailed strategic review 
of the business. We have also refined the 
Company’s governance framework, 
improving a system of policies and 
procedures that utilize the best of our talent 
and resources, enabling Shire to operate 
as a lean, nimble, and ethical organization. 
This model of governance reflects our 
culture of performance, compliance, and 
accountability, and supports Shire’s core 
strategic drivers of growth, innovation, 
efficiency, and people. Further details on 
the Board’s key governance considerations 
during the year can be found on the 
opposite page.
In accordance with the Board’s 
commitment to continued improvement, 
all Directors participated in an internal 
performance evaluation in 2017. Key 
considerations of this exercise included 
effective governance, the review and 
communication of strategy, Board and 
committee composition, as well as 
information delivery and support. All 
members of the Board have committed 
to apply the learnings from this process 
as we strive to enhance our role as 
stewards of Shire. Further details on the 
evaluation process, including identified 
strengths and areas of focus, can be 
found on pages 66 to 67. 
Shire’s resilience and adaptability has made 
it a leader in an evolving and competitive 
global market. This same resilience and 
adaptability applies to Shire’s governance, 
where our focus on effective succession 
planning and personal development 
ensures that the Board remains well-
positioned to deliver guidance and support 
during times of change. In August, we 
announced that Jeff Poulton, Chief 
Financial Officer, would leave Shire at the 
end of 2017, having provided many years 
of valued service to the Company. Thomas 
Dittrich was identified as his successor and 
is expected to join the Company as Chief 
Financial Officer on March 19, 2018, 
serving as an executive member of the 
Board and as a member of the Executive 
Committee. Thomas’ wealth of experience 
within and outside the pharmaceutical 
sector, and in leading finance teams at 
numerous multinational companies, will 
be a tremendous asset for the Board and 
Shire alike.
In addition, reflecting our commitment 
to the Governance Code, the Board 
announced in August 2017 that Bill Burns, 
Senior Independent Director, and Anne 
Minto, the previous Chairman of our 
Remuneration Committee, would retire as 
Directors following the 2018 AGM, each 
having dedicated more than seven years 
to Shire. Al Stroucken, an existing Non-
Executive Director and member of the 
Remuneration Committee, replaced Anne 
as Committee Chairman in August 2017. 
In October, we appointed Sara Mathew 
Chairman of the Audit, Compliance & Risk 
Committee, replacing Dominic Blakemore. 
Both Dominic and Anne continue to serve 
as members of their respective 
Committees, to provide a smooth transition 
until their retirement from the Board. 
In February 2018, we announced that 
Dominic would retire as a Director following 
the 2018 AGM to allow him to focus on his 
new role as Chief Executive of Compass 
Group plc, and that a search for a new 
Board member with comparable 
knowledge, insight, and experience was 
under way. We also announced that Olivier 
Bohuon, an existing Non-Executive 
Director, was to be appointed Senior 
60 Shire Annual Report 2017 Independent Director following the 2018 
AGM. On behalf of the Board, I express our 
gratitude to Bill, Anne and Dominic, whose 
contributions to Shire and leadership on the 
Board have been instrumental parts of our 
growth and success.
In August, we also announced that David 
Ginsburg, Chairman of the Science & 
Technology Committee, would retire 
following the 2018 AGM. The Board, 
however, has agreed that David will remain 
in service while we continue our search for 
a new Non-Executive Director, specifically 
with scientific and/or medical experience. 
Looking ahead to 2018, the Board and 
I will continue to work closely with 
management, shareholders, and other 
stakeholders as we pursue our strategy 
for growth while evaluating all strategic 
options available to Shire. As we transition 
to a company with two distinct divisions, 
we are mindful of the importance of 
effective corporate governance to Shire’s 
future success. We will therefore continue 
to position ourselves to best serve the 
needs of the business, to support 
management in the delivery of our strategy, 
and ultimately to promote the development 
of effective therapies for the patients we 
serve, all while creating shareholder value.

the year members from the following 
internal functions attended by invitation:

64 Shire Annual Report 2017 Governance
Effectiveness
Effective stewardship is central to the development and promotion of the 
Company’s purpose, culture, and values, and therefore to the execution of its 
strategy. The Board is committed to ensuring that the Company operates in 
accordance with the highest standards of governance in order to promote its 
success for the benefit of all stakeholders.
Diversity
The Board recognizes the inherent value 
of diversity at all levels within the 
organization, and strives to foster an 
inclusive and respectful professional 
culture. In doing so, the Board promotes 
its core belief that a diverse workforce 
brings a wealth of ideas, innovation and 
drive that in turn contribute to the 
Company’s ability to anticipate, and 
adapt to, ongoing changes in its 
operating environment. 
During the year the Board reviewed its 
Diversity Policy and considered related 
external publications, including the 
Hampton-Alexander Review concerning 
gender diversity and the Parker Review 
concerning ethnic diversity. The Policy 
acknowledges that the Company, its 
shareholders and other stakeholders are 
best served by a Board diverse in skill, 
experience, background, gender and 
ethnicity. The principles of the policy are 
taken into account by both the Board and 
the Nomination & Governance Committee 
in their consideration of potential Board 
members, consistent with the Group’s 
focus on diversity. Additional disclosure 
relating to diversity within Shire is made 
on pages 38 and 39.
Appointments
The Board may appoint any individual as 
a Director either to fill a vacancy or as an 
additional member of the Board, subject 
to subsequent election and annual 
re-election by the Company’s 
shareholders. The process for new 
appointments is led by the Nomination 
& Governance Committee (procedural 
details are available on page 76) which 
ultimately makes a recommendation to 
the Board.
With the exception of Dominic Blakemore, 
William Burns, and Anne Minto, all 
Directors are seeking election or re-
election at the Annual General Meeting 
to be held on April 24, 2018. At this 
meeting, Non-Executive Director terms 
of appointment and Executive Director 
service contracts will be made available 
for inspection by shareholders.
Independence and competencies
The Board has reviewed the 
independence of the Non-Executive 
Directors, other than the Chairman, 
in accordance with the factors set forth for 
consideration in the Governance Code, 
and determined that each Non-Executive 
Director seeking election or re-election 
continues to be independent in character 
and judgment. In addition, the Board 
regards each of its members as 
possessing the skills, knowledge and 
experience necessary for it to function 
effectively. Board members’ biographical 
information can be found on pages 56 
to 58. Details of the 2017 Board 
performance evaluation can be found 
on pages 66 to 67.
Conflicts of interest
Directors are required to notify the Board 
before accepting any appointment, or 
taking any action, which may give rise to 
a conflict of interest or a potential conflict 
of interest (together a “conflict”), or on 
becoming aware of a conflict. Upon 
notification, the Board will consider 
whether to authorize the conflict and, 
if so, set any related terms and conditions. 
These may include the relevant Director 
being requested to abstain from the 
related decision and/or discussion. 
In the event of a material change to the 
circumstances relating to an authorized 
conflict, the Director concerned is 
required to inform the Nomination & 
Governance Committee and the 
Chairman of the Board. Authorized 
conflicts are reviewed annually and at 
such other times as is necessary by the 
Nomination & Governance Committee, 
which reports on its findings to the Board. 
Details on Directors’ interests in 
transactions can be found on page 109.
Commitment
Prior to appointment, Non-Executive 
Directors are required to disclose to 
the Board their existing significant 
commitments. This enables an 
assessment of their capacity to commit 
sufficient time to effectively discharge 
their anticipated duties and 
responsibilities. Each Non-Executive 
Director keeps the Board informed of any 
changes to their significant commitments. 
As part of the 2017 Board performance 
evaluation, it was determined that each 
of the Directors had committed sufficient 
time to their role.
Information and support
The Chairman, supported by the 
Company Secretary, ensures that 
effective channels of communication 
exist between the Board, its committees 
and members of management, and that 
Board members are provided with the 
information necessary for them to 
discharge their duties and responsibilities. 
Before decisions are taken at Board and 
committee meetings, consideration is 
given to the adequacy of the information 
made available, enabling the deferral of 
decision-making if necessary. Directors 
may seek clarification, additional 
information or professional advice 
necessary to the fulfilment of their duties 
and responsibilities from across the 
business, from the Company Secretary 
or from independent sources at the 
Company’s expense.
Planning and operation
At the start of the year the Chairman and 
her fellow Directors, supported by the 
Company Secretary, agree on a forward-
looking schedule of matters to be 
considered by the Board and its 
committees, with specific updates made 
throughout the year as required. In 
addition, the Chairman, assisted by the 
Company Secretary, ensures appropriate 
time-allocation at meetings and 
encourages open and balanced 
discussion with a view to achieving 
resolution by consensus. If consensus is 
not possible, decisions are to be taken by 
majority vote, with the Chairman having 
the deciding vote in the case of an 
equality of votes.

Accountability
Risk management and internal control 
The Board is responsible for Shire’s risk 
management and internal control systems, 
which include the processes for identifying, 
evaluating, mitigating, and monitoring the 
principal risks faced by the Group. These 
systems are developed in furtherance of the 
Company’s strategy and in accordance with 
applicable regulatory guidelines including the 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework 
2013, issued by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (COSO Framework), and the 
Financial Reporting Council’s Guidance on 
Risk Management, Internal Control and 
Related Financial and Business Reporting. 
Shire’s risk management and internal control 
framework has been in place for the duration 
of the financial year covered by, and to the 
date of the approval of, this Annual Report.
Risk management and internal controls 
relating to financial reporting
The Group’s internal control program 
related to financial reporting (ICFR) is 
aligned with the COSO Framework. It 
comprises a combination of manual, 
automated, preventative and detective 
controls, as well as underlying IT controls 
for key financial systems, which are 
documented, tested, and reported on 
throughout the year. The ICFR takes into 
account key policies such as the 
Controller’s Accounting Manual and the 
Delegation of Authority matrix, as well as 
pervasive entity level controls including 
those relating to integrity and ethical values, 
adherence to codes of conduct, and the 
Board’s oversight of internal control and 
organizational structure. In addition, on 
an annual basis the Internal Audit function 
develops and executes a risk-based 
audit plan covering areas of financial, 
compliance, and operational risk across 
the various Group functions and geographic 
locations. Results of these audits, together 
with results of ICFR testing, are regularly 
reviewed by the Audit, Compliance & Risk 
(ACR) Committee which, along with 
management, assesses the ongoing 
effectiveness of the ICFR against the COSO 
Framework. Furthermore, an established 
process of escalation enables the ACR 
Committee and the Board to review material 
matters on a timely basis as they arise. 
Monitoring and review
The Board, supported by the ACR Committee, is responsible for the ongoing monitoring and review of the Group’s risk management 
and internal control systems. In doing so, the Board:
 • agrees, on an annual basis, a scheduled monitoring program and identifies those aspects that will be overseen, 
on its behalf, by the ACR Committee
 • ensures that considerations of risk feature within its wider discussions, including those concerning the Company’s 
business model and strategy
 • reflects on the determination, identification, assessment, and mitigation of the Company’s principal risks, enabling 
the Board to continually evaluate whether the risk management and internal control systems remain appropriate
In addition to its ongoing appraisal, the Board is responsible for undertaking an annual review of the effectiveness of the Company’s risk 
management and internal control systems. This is achieved through: 
 • dedicated discussion concerning key aspects of the Company’s risk management and internal control regime, 
including its operation and integration, management’s oversight and related reporting, risk appetite, culture, and 
other aspects pertinent to the affairs of the Company
 • reflection on key matters that have arisen during the year and the Company’s ability to respond appropriately to 
internal and external developments as they arise, drawing on the Board’s more-regular discussions and feedback 
from the ACR Committee
 • evaluation of the principal features of the risk management and internal control systems, their composition relative 
to Shire’s strategic direction and conclusions as to their overall effectiveness
Following completion of the Baxalta acquisition, specific audit and assurance activities were undertaken with respect to the legacy 
Baxalta organization, with its principal business risks and risk management systems factored into Shire’s Enterprise Risk Management 
program and biannual enterprise risk assessment. In addition, the Board has taken into consideration risk management and internal 
controls implementation, effectiveness, and integration as part of its wider post-transaction strategic review.
Following its review in respect of the 2017 financial year and the period up to the approval of this Annual Report, the Board neither 
identified, nor was advised of, any failings or weaknesses within the Company’s risk management and internal control systems that were 
considered material to the Group as a whole. Further details on Shire’s risk management framework can be found on pages 18 and 19.

Details of the Group’s financial instruments are disclosed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. The Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus, 
they consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
Viability statement
For the purpose of assessing ongoing viability, the Board considered the Company’s prospects over a four-year period. This period is 
consistent with the relative focus within the Company’s Long Range Plan (the “LRP”), which underpins the Group’s investment and 
planning processes, supports the implementation of the Company’s strategy and enables the prioritization of our key strategic drivers: 
growth, innovation, efficiency, and people. The LRP includes the evaluation of key sensitivities that relate to certain of the Company’s 
principal risks and uncertainties (as outlined on pages 18 to 21), including the realistic availability and effectiveness of mitigating actions, 
with a view to determining their potential impact on the Company’s financial position, ability to deliver on strategy and, ultimately, its viability. 
The sensitivity analysis considers the Company’s future cash flows and funding requirements, including the ability to repay outstanding 
debt and other obligations, the contingent value rights held by the former shareholders of Dyax, maintaining compliance with ongoing loan 
covenants, the sustainability of the Company’s dividend policy, and its strategy for reinvesting in long-term growth. The sensitivity analysis 
assumes that debt maturing within the four-year period will be repaid from operating cash flows. Specific scenarios considered during the 
year included increased pricing pressure in the U.S. and Europe, competition pressure on our Hematology franchise, lower market share 
for strategic products, general demand decrease and the failure of strategic pipeline programs, such as SHP643 (lanadelumab). 
Having regard to each of these considerations, the Board has a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the four-year period of its assessment. In drawing this conclusion, the Board’s 
assessment did not include the impact of undertaking other strategic initiatives, including the possible separation and independent listing 
of each of the Rare Disease and Neuroscience divisions.

on December 3, 2015.
Committee meetings held during the year 
typically coincided with key dates in the 
Group’s financial reporting cycle (details 
of Committee members’ attendance can 
be found on page 64). At the invitation of 
the Committee Chairman, regular additional 
meeting attendees included the Chairman

Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, 
Chief Financial Officer, external auditor, 
and members from the following internal 
Group functions:
 • Finance
 • Global Compliance and Risk 
Management
 • Legal and Company Secretariat
To facilitate open and unreserved 
discussion, it is the Committee’s practice 
to set aside time for its private deliberation, 
with time also reserved for private 
discussions with the Group’s external audit 
partner, Head of Internal Audit, and Chief 
Compliance and Risk Officer.
Role of the Committee
The purpose of the Committee is to 
oversee Shire’s accounting and financial 
reporting processes, the audits of its 
financial statements and the effectiveness 
of the Company’s risk management and 
internal control framework. In doing so, 
the Committee’s principal duties are to:
 • monitor the integrity of the financial 
reports and statements of the Group 
and, where requested by the Board, 
advise on whether, taken as a whole, 
the Annual Report and Accounts is fair, 
balanced and understandable
 • make recommendations to the Board 
on matters relating to the appointment 
of the external auditor, to determine and 
agree the scope of the external audit 
engagement and to consider findings 
and recommendations arising from the 
external audit process
 • monitor and review the integrity and 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
financial controls and wider internal 
control and risk management systems
 • review the Group’s strategy for the 
management of key corporate and 
financial risks
 • review the status of the Group’s 
compliance program to ensure 
adherence to applicable legal and 
regulatory standards and to the Group’s 
internal policies 
In addition, the Committee is authorized 
to investigate any activity included within 
its terms of reference and is responsible 
for the resolution of any disagreement 
between management and the Group’s 
external auditor regarding financial 
reporting matters. The Committee is also 
permitted to seek any information it 
requires from any employee of the Group, 
and any external professional advice at the 
Company’s expense, necessary to the 
fulfilment of its duties.

Audit, Compliance & Risk Committee continued
Committee activities
In addition to the key considerations 
previously noted, the Committee’s activities 
during the year included:
Financial reporting
 • reviewing the Company’s full-year and 
half-year results, quarterly earnings 
releases, key financial reports and 
earnings guidance
 • reviewing the Company’s response to a 
comment letter from the U.S. Securities 
and Exchange Commission on its 2016 
Form 10-K
 • reviewing and assessing the Group’s 
quarterly application of its Non GAAP 
policy, including those costs incurred as 
part of its continuing integration activities 
relating to the Baxalta acquisition
 • reviewing tax matters impacting the 
Group
 • reviewing the impact of Baxalta-related 
integration activities, such as the 
establishment of a shared corporate 
services centre and the respective 
alignment of the consolidation processes 
and Information Technology systems, 
on the financial reporting process 
External audit
 • reviewing quarterly updates provided by 
the external auditor encompassing key 
areas of judgment and risk, audit 
planning, governance updates, and other 
business-related matters
 • reviewing periodic updates on the status 
of the external auditor’s testing of the 
control environment following the 
integration of the internal control 
environment of Baxalta into the 
Company’s SOX compliance program
 • conducting an assessment of the 
external audit process, including a review 
of management’s evaluation of the 
performance and effectiveness of the 
external auditor 
 • reviewing and approving the 2017 Audit 
Plan and audit fee
 • assessing the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditor
Compliance and risk management
 • reviewing periodic updates from the Chief 
Compliance and Risk Officer and the Head 
of Internal Audit, encompassing key areas 
such as the Company’s overall compliance 
program, the internal audit plan status and 
results, the Company’s compliance with its 
Corporate Integrity Agreement, the 
Company’s Enterprise Risk Management 
program, and the Company’s Internal 
Investigations program
 • assessing the Group’s principal risks and 
the associated mitigation strategy
Key considerations related to the financial statements 
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates, 
judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and 
equity at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenues and 
expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Committee reviews 
and critiques the critical accounting estimates, judgments and methodologies applied 
by management. The Committee’s review considers reports and discussions with 
management and Deloitte LLP, the Company’s external auditor, with the objective of 
confirming that the estimates, judgments and assumptions of management were 
reasonable and appropriately applied.
The significant issues considered by the Committee during the year in relation to the 
financial statements were:
Finalizing purchase accounting related to the acquisition of Baxalta
 • the valuation of acquired intangible assets and goodwill
 • the subsequent adjustments to preliminary acquisition fair values related to our unit 
of account judgments and allocation of cost of goods sold for intangible assets, 
refinements to the estimated selling price for inventory, and the corresponding 
impact of these matters on goodwill and deferred tax liabilities
Further information is available in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
Long-lived Assets, including Property, Plant and Equipment, and Intangible Assets 
 • the carrying value of long-lived intangible assets, including currently marketed 
products, and those assets’ ability to generate sufficient cash flows 
 • the assessment of events and circumstances that may indicate that the carrying 
value of a long-lived asset has been impaired. Specifically, the Committee assessed 
the positive scientific and marketing results of competing products for CINYRZE and 
FEIBA, and the temporary stock-out of CINRYZE in the U.S.
 • determining when facilities in Shire’s manufacturing footprint should be impaired or 
classified as held for sale pursuant to the Company’s Network Study 
 • ensuring the depreciation and amortization method appropriately reflects the pattern 
of economic benefit 
Further information is available in Notes 12 and 14 to the consolidated financial 
statements.
Revenue recognition
 • the amount of sales deductions and rebates recorded as liabilities on the balance 
sheet
 • the assumptions related to the return rates for products with newly launched generic 
competition, most notably those related to LIALDA 
 • the impact of implementing the new revenue recognition accounting standard and 
the conclusion that it would not have a material impact on the Company’s financial 
position or operations 
Further information is available in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.
Tax-related matters
 • the amount and timing of tax provisions related to ongoing operations
 • the amount and timing of deferred tax accounting matters related to the purchase 
accounting for Baxalta
 • the nature of tax exposures related to the Baxalta acquisition
 • the impact of tax reform in the United States 
Further information is available in Notes 3, 22 and 24 to the consolidated financial 
statements.
After due challenge and debate, the Committee concluded that, in all of the 
aforementioned areas, the estimates, judgments, and assumptions of management 
were reasonable and appropriately applied. 
72 Shire Annual Report 2017 Additional matters
 • assessing the continued impact of 
the integration of the legacy Baxalta 
business and the strategic review of 
the neuroscience business on 
management’s ability to undertake 
ongoing duties in a timely and effective 
manner 
 • reviewing the Group’s treasury policies 
and ongoing treasury activities
 • assessing the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal audit program
External audit
Independence and objectivity
The Committee recognizes both the need 
for an objective and independent external 
auditor, and how such objectivity and 
independence might be, or appear, 
compromized through the provision of 
non-audit services. Accordingly, the 
Committee oversees an established policy 
on the provision of non-audit services by 
the external auditor with a view to 
safeguarding these core attributes.
Amongst other things, this policy:
prohibits the auditor from providing a 
service that:
 • creates a mutuality of interest
 • places the auditor in a position 
where they would audit their 
own work
 • results in the auditor acting 
as a manager or employee 
of the Company
 • positions the auditor in the 
role of advocate for the 
Company
prescribes services that:
 • the external auditor is explicitly 
prohibited from providing
 • have been pre-approved by 
the Committee subject to 
individual and aggregate 
monetary limits
requires:
 • the Chief Accounting 
Officer’s review of all service 
assignments prior to the 
initiation of any related 
non-audit service by the 
external auditor
All proposed services falling outside of the 
scope of the policy, or the monetary limits 
contained therein, must receive pre-
approval from the Committee, or from its 
Chairman subject to Committee approval 
at its next scheduled meeting.
Fees relating to non-audit services provided 
by the external auditor to the Company are 
as follows:
Non-audit 
services fee; 
percentage 
of total audit 
services fee Context
2017 
$7.2 million;  
49%
A majority of these fees ($5.6 
million) relate to the completion 
of projects already under way 
at Baxalta prior to its 
combination with the Company 
in 2016. Also included in this 
amount are fees related to audit 
work that only the Independent 
Registered Public Accountant 
can reasonably be expected to 
perform, such as quarterly 
review procedures, statutory 
audits or procedures relating to 
regulatory filings.
2016  
$20.2 million;  
137%
Fees principally related to the 
continuation of projects already 
under way at Baxalta prior to its 
combination with the Company, 
and the reporting accountant’s 
services provided to the 
Company in connection with 
the combination with Baxalta.
Further details on the breakdown of 
non-audit fees paid or due to the external 
auditor as a result of services provided 
during 2017 can be found in Note 29 to 
the consolidated financial statements. 
Information regarding non-audit services 
performed during 2016 and the procedures 
performed by the Committee to ensure the 
objectivity and independence of Deloitte 
LLP can be found on pages 77, 78 and 175 
of the Company’s 2016 Annual Report.
The Committee was satisfied throughout 
the year that the objectivity and 
independence of Deloitte LLP was not 
impaired. Factors identified as contributing 
to Deloitte LLP’s objectivity and 
independence as external auditor include:
 • its impartial and questioning 
approach, particularly with 
respect to issues of 
heightened sensitivity
 • the firm’s prudent attitude 
to the consideration and 
undertaking of non-audit 
services
 • Shire’s own policy of not 
recruiting staff directly 
from the external audit 
engagement team
During the year the Committee met 
with the external auditor to consider 
independence and objectivity, ensuring 
that the relationship between the external 
auditor and members of management had 
not resulted, or appeared to result, in a lack 
of independence or objectivity. The 
Committee considers that, during 2017, 
the external auditor was sufficiently robust 
in dealings with members of management, 
and was transparent and decisive in 
dealings with the Committee.
Effectiveness
The Committee recognizes the importance 
of having a high-caliber audit and, as such, 
undertakes an annual assessment of the 
effectiveness of the external audit process. 
As part of its evaluation the Committee 
drew upon a survey of members of financial 
management that measured the external 
auditor’s performance against 
predetermined “critical success factors” 
that were designed to facilitate continuing 
and measurable improvement in the 
effectiveness of the external audit process. 
 73 Shire Annual Report 2017
 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Governance
Audit, Compliance & Risk Committee continued
In accordance with European and national 
regulation, it is the Company’s policy that 
the external audit contract be put to tender 
at least once in every ten-year period, with 
the external audit partner rotating on a 
five-yearly basis. Notwithstanding such 
policy, having regard to transitional 
arrangements regarding external audit 
tendering and rotation provided by the 
relevant regulatory authorities, it is the 
Committee’s current intention to put the 
external audit contract out to tender at a 
time that would see the process complete 
in 2020. This would result with the preferred 
external audit firm being appointed for 
the 2021 financial year. The Committee 
believes that the proposed timing of 
audit tender is in the best interests of 
shareholders as it stands to afford the 
Company continuity during the forthcoming 
years, particularly given the ongoing 
integration of the legacy Baxalta business 
and the continued strategic review of 
the Company’s neuroscience business. 
It should be noted that, despite the 
Committee’s current intention regarding 
the timing of tender, the external auditor 
is subject to ongoing effectiveness review 
and therefore the Committee may choose 
to put the external audit contract out to 
tender at any time it considers appropriate. 
In accordance with best practice, the 
Committee confirms voluntary compliance 
with the provisions of the Statutory Audit 
Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of 
Competitive Tender Processes and Audit 
Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, 
as published by the UK Competition and 
Markets Authority.
Additional matters
Internal audit
Internal audit effectiveness is monitored 
and reviewed on an ongoing basis by the 
Committee. The Internal Audit Plan is 
approved annually by the Committee, 
progression against which is reviewed 
quarterly. In addition, periodically the 
Company’s internal audit procedures 
and capabilities undergo an independent 
external assessment against global 
standards, with the ensuing report 
reviewed by the Committee Chairman.
Whistleblowing
Shire’s compliance effort is focused on 
the prevention and detection of misconduct 
through policy development, training, 
communications, monitoring, and audit. 
As part of this effort, Shire employees are 
encouraged to report suspected cases of 
misconduct, confidentially and without fear 
of retaliation, through management or 
through Shire’s Global Compliance 
Helpline. The helpline, which is overseen 
by the Chief Compliance and Risk Officer, 
is managed by an independent third-party 
in order to preserve anonymity as 
appropriate. Concerns and allegations are 
investigated with disciplinary action taken 
where necessary. Periodically, the Chief 
Compliance and Risk Officer provides the 
Committee with a summary of matters 
raised through management and the 
helpline as well as details of any resultant 
investigations.
The Committee concluded that:
 • the “critical success factors” 
had been substantially met
 • there existed a constructive 
working relationship between 
the external auditor and 
members of management
 • the audit process was 
sufficiently robust, with the 
external auditor demonstrating 
continued commitment to the 
performance of high-quality 
audit work
Areas of development were identified and 
communicated to the external audit firm, 
which in turn has committed to working 
with management and the Committee to 
address these in 2018.
Appointment and tendering
Deloitte LLP has served as Shire’s external 
auditor since 2002, with the current audit 
partner, John Adam, commencing his 
appointment in 2016. Following the review 
of Deloitte LLP’s continued objectivity, 
independence and performance relating to 
the 2017 financial year, and having received 
an expression of willingness to continue in 
office as external auditor, the Committee 
recommended to the Board the re-
appointment of Deloitte LLP as the 
Company’s external auditor for the 2018 
financial year. There existed no contractual 
obligations that inhibited or influenced the 
Committee’s recommendation.

can be found on page 64). At the invitation of 
the Committee Chairman, regular additional 
meeting attendees included the Chief 
Executive Officer and members from the 
Company’s Human Resources, Legal and 
Company Secretariat functions. 
Role of the Committee
The Committee’s responsibilities include:
 • reviewing the size and 
composition of the Board and 
its committees and making 
recommendations to the Board 
with respect to any changes
 • identifying, and nominating 
for the approval of the Board, 
candidates for new Board 
appointments and making 
recommendations with 
respect to the re-election 
and reappointment of 
existing Directors
 • reviewing succession planning 
for Executive and Non-
Executive Directors with a 
view to ensuring the long-term 
success of the Group
 • making recommendations 
to the Board on matters of 
governance, reputation, 
culture and political activity 
affecting the Company
 • maintaining the policy 
concerning Directors’ conflicts 
of interest and monitoring 
adherence to that policy
Key considerations and activities 
During the year and up to the date of 
this report, the Committee’s principal 
considerations and activities were:
Chief Financial Officer succession
In August 2017 , Shire announced that 
Jeff Poulton, Chief Financial Officer, would 
leave his position at the end of 2017 , having 
provided many years of valued service 
to the Company. Russell Reynolds 
Associates, an executive search consultancy 
with no other connection to the Company, 
was retained to lead the search for a 
successor. The Committee considered 
internal and external candidates before 
making a recommendation to the Board. 
In November 2017 , Shire announced that 
Thomas Dittrich would be appointed Chief 
Financial Officer, serving as an executive 
member of the Board and as a member 
of the Company’s Executive Committee. 
Mr. Dittrich is expected to commence 
his role on March 19, 2018. The Board 
appointed John Miller, Shire’s Senior Vice 
President of Finance, as Interim Chief 
Financial Officer, to serve until Mr. Dittrich’s 
appointment becomes effective. 
Non-Executive Director succession
In accordance with the anticipated 
reduction in Board membership following its 
previous expansion linked to the Baxalta 
acquisition, and reflective of the Board’s 
commitment to the orderly refreshment of 
its collective skill and experience, in August 
2017, Shire announced that William Burns, 
Senior Independent Director, and Anne 
Minto, prior Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, would retire from the Board 
following the 2018 AGM. The Board also 
announced that David Ginsburg, Chairman 
of the Science & Technology Committee, 
would simultaneously retire, however, the 
Board has agreed that Dr. Ginsburg will 
continue in service while it progresses its 
 75 Shire Annual Report 2017
 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Governance
Nomination & Governance Committee continued
Executive Committee succession
During the year the Committee reviewed 
ongoing succession planning for the CEO, 
CFO and other members of the Company’s 
Executive Committee, with skills, 
knowledge, and experience mapping 
undertaken for each role. With the positions 
of Head of Research & Development and 
Chief Human Resources Officer becoming 
vacant, potential successors were 
considered with recommendations made 
to the Board. An internal candidate, 
Joanne Cordeiro was appointed Chief 
Human Resources Officer in August 2017, 
having joined Shire in 2011. Andreas Busch 
was appointed Head of Research and 
Development and Chief Scientific Officer 
in January 2018, joining from Bayer AG 
where he worked for 13 years. 
Governance and culture
The Committee reviewed various matters 
concerning the development of governance 
and culture, including the Company’s 
Code of Ethics, proposed changes to the 
Company’s Articles of Association (as 
approved by shareholders at the 2017 
AGM), the Company’s ongoing compliance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
and papers dedicated to corporate culture. 
As part of its considerations, and in light of 
the ongoing development of the business, 
the Committee recommended to the Board 
that its responsibilities be expanded to 
encompass the oversight of culture-related 
strategic initiatives. The Committee’s Terms 
of Reference were subsequently updated to 
reflect this additional responsibility.
Board Diversity Policy
In the context a continued external focus on 
diversity, Committee members participated 
in the wider Board review of Shire’s Board 
Diversity Policy. Further details on the 
review, including a description of the policy, 
can be found on page 65. In undertaking 
the review, the Committee and the Board 
reaffirmed their commitment to the 
promotion of diversity, both in executive 
and non-executive appointments and in 
recruitment practice throughout the Group. 
Further details on diversity within Shire can 
be found on pages 38 and 39.
Board appointments procedure
Board composition is central to the 
effective leadership of the Group:
 • prior to commencing any 
search for prospective Board 
members, the Committee 
reflects on the Board’s balance 
of skills and experiences and 
those that would be conducive 
to the delivery of the 
Company’s strategy
 • a recommendation is then 
made to the Board in respect 
of the core attributes sought
 • an appropriately qualified 
search firm is engaged and 
informed of, amongst other 
things, the experience, 
technical skills and other 
capabilities sought, of the 
time commitment required 
of any appointee and of 
Shire’s Board Diversity Policy
 • short-listed candidates are 
interviewed by as many of the 
Committee members as is 
feasible, following which any 
preferred candidate meets 
with other Directors
 • the Board determines whether 
to appoint a new Director
search for a new Non-Executive Director, 
specifically with scientific and/or medical 
experience. In addition, the Board 
announced in February 2018 that Dominic 
Blakemore, having been appointed Chief 
Executive of Compass Group plc on 
January 1, 2018, had decided to step down 
following the 2018 AGM, and that a search 
for a new Non-Executive Director with 
comparable knowledge, insight, and 
experience was under way. We also 
announced that Olivier Bohuon, an existing 
Non-Executive Director, was to be 
appointed Senior Independent Director 
following the 2018 AGM. 
Board Committee changes
As part of its ongoing review of Board 
and committee composition, and in light 
of the appointment of Ian Clark to the 
Board in January 2017, the Committee 
recommended to the Board various 
changes to committee composition, that 
were approved and became effective in 
February 2017 (current Board committee 
composition is set out on pages 56 to 58). 
In addition, in August 2017, Al Stroucken, 
an existing Non-Executive Director and 
member of the Remuneration Committee, 
replaced Anne Minto as Remuneration 
Committee Chairman. Ms. Minto continues 
to serve as a member of the Remuneration 
Committee to enable a period of transition 
until her retirement from the Board. 
Furthermore, in October 2017, the Board 
approved the appointment of Sara Mathew 
as Chairman of the Audit, Compliance 
& Risk Committee, replacing Dominic 
Blakemore who continues to serve as 
a member of that committee.

The Committee typically meets before 
scheduled meetings of the Board (details 
of Committee members’ attendance can be 
found on page 64). At the invitation of the 
Committee Chairman, regular additional 
meeting attendees during the year included 
the Chairman of the Board and other 
Non-Executive Directors, the Chief Executive 
Officer and members of the following internal 
Group functions:
 • Research and Development
 • Corporate Development
 • Legal and Company Secretariat
Role of the Committee
The Committee’s principal responsibilities are 
to periodically review and advise the Board 
on the Company’s investment in research, 
development, and technology, the quality of 
the R&D pipeline, and the quality of R&D talent 
within the Group. In doing so, the Committee 
assesses and advises the Board in respect of:
 • the Company’s R&D strategy 
relating to strategically 
important therapeutic areas
 • emerging science and 
technology issues, trends, 
and academic partnerships
 • the overall quality and expertise 
of medical and scientific talent 
within the R&D organization
 • the quality and competitiveness 
of the Company’s R&D 
programs and technology 
initiatives from a scientific 
perspective, including the 
associated risk profile
 • the scientific, technical and 
medical merits of any potential 
significant R&D investments 
Key considerations
The Committee’s principal areas of review 
during the year included:
 • the clinical development pipeline and the 
research and non-clinical portfolio, 
including key program updates
 • “deep dives” into key therapeutic areas, 
including hematology, neuroscience, 
hereditary angioedema, gastroenterology, 
and ophthalmics
 • portfolio productivity and prioritization
 • key clinical trial/study data including 
SHP465 (MYDAYIS), SHP680 and 
SHP643 (lanadelumab)
 • R&D budget, organizational structure, 
and governance, including expertise 
within the function

targets for our teams, pushing ourselves 
to meet the highest possible financial goals 
during this time of transformation, some 
of which were clearly aspirational. While 
we are proud of our accomplishments in 
2017 and believe that we have continued 
to champion our patients, we acknowledge 
that this success is not fully reflected in 
our share price. 
Our business model continues to evolve 
as we invest in our infrastructure in order 
to continue to grow. For 2018, we anticipate 
gross margin will be impacted by a few 
factors, including start-up costs related 
to our Covington, Georgia, manufacturing 
facility, a significant strategic investment 
in immunology. This evolution has also 
formed part of our presentation to investors 
at the 2018 JP Morgan Healthcare 
conference, where we provided a revised 
outlook for sales and our anticipated tax rate 
under U.S. Tax Reform by 2020, reflecting 
this change in our business model. 
This revised outlook for sales, in 
combination with the wider changes in 
our business model, also has implications 
for our earnings and returns trajectories 
for the next three years. These implications 
are reflected in the disclosed targets for 
Net Product Sales, Non GAAP diluted 
Earnings Per ADS (Non GAAP diluted EPS) 
and Non GAAP adjusted Return on 
Invested Capital (ROIC) which are proposed 
under the 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP). The Committee has considered 
these carefully and is satisfied that the 
performance ranges set for 2018 remain 
very stretching in the context of the revised 
business expectations.
It is very important for the Committee to 
ensure that the awards and actual realized 
remuneration under the Executive Annual 
Incentive (EAI) and LTIP are reflective of

Dear shareholder, 
I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report (DRR) for the 
financial year ending December 31, 2017. 
Since becoming the new Chairman of 
Shire’s Remuneration Committee on 
August 3, 2017, I have been working 
closely with Anne Minto, its former 
Chairman, to ensure a smooth succession, 
and to gain a clear understanding of Shire’s 
shareholder views. I would like to thank 
Anne for her help in enabling a successful 
transition and for sharing the deep 
institutional knowledge she has gained 
over her tenure as Chairman.
This has been another year of significant 
growth and continued change for Shire. 
As such, I would like to provide you with 
an overview of the major decisions the 
Committee took during 2017, the context 
in which these decisions were made, and 
the changes to the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration arrangements. 
Since our last Remuneration Policy was 
approved, Shire has transformed itself 
into the leading global biotech company 
focused on rare diseases by employing 
a strategy of organic and inorganic growth. 
Acquisitions such as Baxalta, Dyax, NPS 
and ViroPharma have reshaped the 
Company dramatically in terms of size, 
global footprint, pipeline diversity and 
progress, employee headcount and talent 
profile. As a result, 2017 was Shire’s first 
full financial year as a transformed 
company: the undisputed global leader 
in treating rare diseases.
With this transformation, Shire addressed 
several challenges, including streamlining 
our business model, office consolidations 
and a strategic review of our neuroscience 
business and manufacturing locations. As 
we commenced 2017, we set aggressive 
 
Since our last 
Remuneration Policy 
was approved, Shire 
has transformed 
itself into the leading 
global biotech 
company focused 
on rare diseases. 
78 Shire Annual Report 2017 corporate performance, the Company’s 
strategy and the shareholder experience. 
For the 2017 EAI outcomes, it was 
determined that the CEO’s and CFO’s 
awards would be 123 percent of target in 
line with the overall EAI corporate funding 
score, and that no personal multiplier would 
be applied. The 2015 LTIP award vested at 
38 percent of maximum, reflecting actual 
performance over the past three years 
against the Net Product Sales and Non 
GAAP EBITDA performance metrics and 
the Non GAAP adjusted ROIC underpin. 
In the chart below, we have listed the 
CEO’s LTIP awards that have vested over 
the past three years and the current values 
of these awards as a percentage of their 
original face value at grant. These three 
years represent the performance period, 
which also has an additional two-year 
post-vest holding period for awards granted 
under our 2015 Policy, resulting in a 
five-year time horizon. As you can see from 
the chart below, the actual compensation 
delivered to the Executive Directors does 
show alignment with the shareholder 
experience, in that the current value of the 
2014 and 2015 awards is less than 50 
percent of the face value at grant.

Share Units (PSUs) subject to relevant 
performance conditions. In the case of the 2013 
and 2014 awards, no vested PSUs have been 
sold and no vested SARs have been exercised.
2  Current value is based on the Q4 2017 average 
closing ADS price of $148.21.
As Shire has transformed as a business, 
our Executive Committee has also 
changed. We are pleased to announce the 
expected appointment of a new Executive 
Director and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), 
Thomas Dittrich, who is due to commence 
his role on March 19, 2018, as well as a 
new pre-eminent Head of Research and 
Development and Chief Scientific Officer, 
Dr. Andreas Busch. These critical roles will 
help Shire continue to chart its course, 
both in the financial discipline and expertise 
needed to navigate our business strategy, 
and in successful drug discovery and 
development. 
As communicated to shareholders in last 
year’s DRR, the Committee has undertaken 
a comprehensive review of our 
Remuneration Policy within this context 
of transformation. As we considered the 
strategic drivers at Shire, coupled with 
feedback we have received from many 
of our shareholders, the Committee’s 
principles that guided its decisions 
impacting the policy were:
Simplicity
Seek transparency in design and 
communication.
Alignment
Ensure pay outcomes mirror the 
shareholder experience.
Prioritize strategic corporate 
performance
Link individual pay outcomes clearly with 
company performance. 
Integrated global business
Recognize Shire’s international business 
footprint and market for talent.
Flexibility
Enable the policy to support potential 
business changes over time.
By taking the time to consider all elements 
of the Policy carefully through this lens, the 
Committee has taken the opportunity to 
ensure that the Remuneration Policy for 
Executive Directors outlined in this report, 
supports the Company’s strategic direction 
and continues to drive growth and create 
shareholder value. As a result of this review, 
we are presenting a new Remuneration 
Policy for shareholder approval at the 2018 
Annual General Meeting (AGM).

Context for the Remuneration  
Policy review
As Shire executes its strategic plan, it 
is critical that the remuneration structure 
supports Shire’s goals over the next 
Remuneration Policy period. The imperatives 
for the business over this period include: 
Leverage rare disease platform
Performance improvement and product 
sales growth
Establish & begin operating as two 
divisions: Rare disease division and 
Neuroscience division
Pipeline progression
Expand leadership position in core 
therapeutic areas
Drive further cost efficiencies and 
margin improvement
Debt pay-down
The Board believes the achievement of 
these strategic pillars will enable Shire to 
continue to deliver long-term sustainable 
growth and shareholder value.
As we move into the detailed policy 
changes outlined below, we would like to 
thank the shareholders who engaged in 
consultation in late 2017. During this time, 
we met with more than 30 of our largest 
The proposed EAI performance measures and the rationale for their selection are set out in the table below.
Financials (80 percent) Rationale
Net Product Sales (1/3rd) • Aligned with growth strategy
 • Drives focus on balance of top-line and bottom-line performance outcomes
 • Encompasses growth commitment made under Baxalta deal
 • Use of Non GAAP diluted EPS reflects current leverage and capital intensive nature of the business
Non GAAP diluted EPS (1/3rd)
Non GAAP Free Cash Flow (1/3rd) • Drives focus on debt management 
 • Over the longer term, provides liquidity for future acquisitions and strategic investments in our 
product portfolio
Non-Financials (20 percent) Rationale
Growth
 • Focus on up to five equally weighted key corporate objectives and pipeline milestones aligned with 
Shire’s strategic pillars
Innovation
Efficiency
People
shareholders and proxy advisory bodies. 
Overall, shareholders recognized that Shire 
was evolving to the next stage as an 
organization, and positively indicated that 
the new design was best positioned to 
support Shire’s strategic agenda. The 
feedback we received was valuable and 
influenced the development of the new 
Remuneration Policy. 
New Remuneration Policy: Summary  
of key changes from current policy
The key elements of the new Remuneration 
Policy that differ from the current 
arrangements are:
1.  Simplification of LTIP vehicles 
by discontinuing the use of 
performance-based Stock 
Appreciation Rights (SARs) and 
consolidating LTIP delivery into 
one single vehicle — Performance 
Share Units (PSUs)
Shire has previously granted a blend of 
performance-based SARs and PSUs 
under the LTIP. While this mix was 
historically appropriate for the business 
based on Shire’s size and development 
stage, the Committee has determined 
that future awards under the LTIP should 
be made exclusively in PSUs to ensure 
alignment with key financial metrics. 
The consolidation of performance-based 
SARs into PSUs significantly simplifies the 
LTIP for both participants and 
shareholders. This change also responds 
to concerns that performance-based SARs 
are overly complex and lack transparency. 
The performance cycle of the proposed 
PSU program will continue to be measured 
over a three-year period followed by a 
two-year post-vest holding period. This 
means shares will only be released to 
participants five years after grant. 
2.  Alignment of performance measures 
within the EAI and LTIP to Shire’s 
strategic imperatives
Given our sharp focus on product sales 
growth, cost efficiencies and debt 
pay-down, the Committee has realigned 
the performance metrics that our Executive 
Directors’ incentives will be measured 
under in both the EAI and LTIP. 
EAI — performance measures 
 • Underscoring the importance of our 
financial performance, we have 
increased the weightings of our financial 
metrics to 80 percent; non-financial 
metrics will be weighted 20 percent.
 • Recognizing the dynamic nature of 
Shire’s business, and to provide flexibility 
in the near-term, the Committee retains 
discretion to vary the metrics of the 
performance measures as the business 
may require over the next three years.
80 Shire Annual Report 2017 A custom peer group of global life sciences 
companies will form the constituents of the 
relative TSR peer group. The use of an 
industry-specific peer group means the 
Executive Directors are rewarded only for 
strong performance relative to those peer 
companies Shire is competing against for 
investment capital. To create this focused 
list, we selected peer companies based on 
closeness of comparison to Shire in size, 
complexity and operations. Selection to 
these criteria resulted in a group of 20 peer 
companies (please see page 97 in Part 3(a) 
for the proposed TSR peer group). 
3.  Improvement of the link between 
strategic corporate performance and 
Executive Directors’ pay outcomes 
under the EAI 
Under the previous Remuneration Policy, 
we calculated the EAI for the Executive 
Directors in two parts: we determined 
corporate funding of the EAI based on 
financial performance at 75 percent 
weighting, and non-financial performance 
at 25 percent weighting. This score could 
be modified down to 0 percent or up to 
200 percent based on individual Executive 
Director performance. Given shareholder 
feedback regarding the complexity of 
how we determined Executive Directors’ 
bonuses under this model, we are 
proposing to simplify the plan, so that we 
will determine the Executive Directors’ EAI 
based solely on the outcome of corporate 
performance, with 80 percent weighted on 
financial performance and 20 percent 
weighted on non-financial performance. 
We believe this approach ties the EAI 
award more directly to overall corporate 
performance, and provides greater 
transparency to shareholders by placing 
more weighting on empirical financial data.
4.  Decrease in the maximum LTIP 
face value annual award in light 
of shareholder feedback, while 
recognizing the global talent market 
within which Shire competes
The maximum annual award under the 
proposed new LTIP is 600 percent face 
value of salary, a significant reduction 
from the previous maximum award of 840 
percent. This reduced award level reflects 
the exchange from performance-based 
SARs into PSUs, and also recognizes the 
feedback received from a number of 
shareholders on the maximum award 
opportunity under the previous LTIP. 
In setting the revised LTIP award level, 
the Committee has considered carefully 
the very real tension Shire experiences 
between our listing in the UK and our 
headquarters in the U.S., where most of 
our employees are located and where the 
majority of Shire’s operations are based. 
We believe that we are unique as a 
UK-listed business, insofar as key Executive 
Committee members are based in the U.S. 
The need to compete for talent in the U.S. 
biotech market is therefore a material reality 
for the Shire business, which is very 
different from the majority of FTSE-listed 
organizations. In this context, the 
Committee has determined the maximum 
LTIP award level recognizing the historic 
opportunity under the previous policy, the 
upper quartile of the FTSE 50 market and 
the lower quartile of our biopharmaceutical 
competitors (the majority of whom are 
based in the U.S.). The proposed amount 
is intended to balance the competitive 
tension across these two markets. 
The Committee is, however, very conscious 
of shareholder sensitivity to levels awarded 
to Executive Directors and will continue 
to consider the actual level of award to 
be made each year depending on the 
performance of the business and associated 
factors. For 2018, the Committee agreed 
upon an LTIP award for the CEO with a face 
value of 425 percent of base salary.
LTIP — performance measures 
We have listened to shareholder views, 
raised during the consultation process, 
about the importance of retaining ROIC 
as a metric within our LTIP, alongside 
the originally proposed relative Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) measure. 
We remain committed to ensuring Shire’s 
investments in the business enhance value 
Measure and weighting Rationale

 • Direct alignment with creating shareholder value and the importance of delivering returns to 
shareholders over time
 • Reflects market perspective on success of M&A strategy
 • Stock price performance against investor peers reflects real-time feedback of business results
 • Relative TSR is a more transparent market-based metric to measure performance against without 
the need to adjust for significant events when transactions occur 
for our shareholders over the long-term, 
and believe the combination of these 
metrics is directly aligned with the 
shareholder experience. The inclusion of 
a relative TSR metric in the LTIP will better 
reflect near-term feedback on the execution 
of our M&A strategy, while ROIC will reward 
continued development of our returns 
trajectory over time.

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
5.  Increase in the shareholding 
guidelines to U.S. aligned levels
Under the new Remuneration Policy 
the shareholding requirements will be 
increased to 500 percent of base salary 
for the CEO and 300 percent for the CFO, 
from 200 percent and 150 percent 
respectively. It should be noted that our 
CEO’s current shareholding is equal to 788 
percent of salary (as at December 31, 2017).
The Committee firmly believes Shire’s 
Executive Directors should have a 
significant portion of their wealth in 
Company shares, as this aligns them 
with the shareholder experience over 
the long-term. Given that shareholder 
requirements in the U.S. are generally 
more demanding than those in the UK, 
we are increasing our Executive Directors’ 
shareholding requirements to be set at U.S. 
competitive levels, to recognize the U.S. / 
UK balance we have tried to engender 
within our LTIP design, both in terms of 
quantum and structure. 
Departure of CFO
Jeff Poulton, the Company’s former 
CFO, left the Company on December 31, 
2017. Full details of the treatment of his 
remuneration on departure are set out in 
Part 3(e) of this report, and I can confirm 
that the decisions the Committee took 
were within the terms of the current 
Remuneration Policy. 
Joining arrangements for new CFO
The Committee considered in detail the 
remuneration arrangements for Mr. Dittrich, 
to ensure they were in the best interests 
of the Company and its shareholders, 
and appropriate to secure his appointment to 
Shire. These are set out below ahead of his 
expected appointment on March 19, 2018.
 • Base salary — On appointment to 
Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Dittrich’s 
remuneration will comprise an annual 
base salary of CHF 750,000, reflecting 
the deep wealth of knowledge and 
experience he brings to the role. This is 
below the lower quartile for comparable 
roles in the FTSE 50 (excluding financial 
services) and below the median of the 
Company’s global industry peer group.
 • EAI opportunity — Mr. Dittrich’s 
annual bonus opportunity for the 2018 
performance year will be 160 percent of 
base salary at maximum and 80 percent 
of base salary at target, in line with the 
previous CFO’s level. 
 • LTIP awards — Mr. Dittrich will be 
granted a 2018 LTIP award with a face 
value of 357 percent of base salary.
 • Retirement and other benefits 
— Mr. Dittrich will also be eligible for 
retirement and other benefits consistent 
with his role and location. On joining 
Shire, he will be based in Zug, 
Switzerland, before relocating to the 
U.S. During his time in Switzerland, he 
will receive retirement and other benefits 
aligned with other Swiss Executive 
Committee members. This will include 
a retirement benefits contribution of 
14 percent of base salary. Upon his 
relocation to the U.S., Mr. Dittrich will 
receive retirement and other benefits 
aligned with other U.S. Executive 
Committee members, which will 
comprise a retirement benefits 
contribution of 20 percent of base 
salary, representing a decrease from 
the previous CFO’s retirement benefits 
contribution of 25 percent of base salary.
 • Replacement awards — Mr. Dittrich 
will be entitled to the following cash 
and equity grants to reflect the awards 
forfeited by him on his departure from 
his previous employment. In determining 
the amount and structure of these 
commitments, the Committee sought 
to replicate the fair values and timing of 
the compensation foregone, in line with 
best practice and the approved 
Remuneration Policy. 
 – To replace his 2017 annual bonus 
foregone, he will receive a replacement 
award equal to the value of the bonus 
he would have received from his 
previous employer (based on the 
financial performance disclosed in 
their 2017 compensation report 
multiplied by Mr. Dittrich’s 2017 target 
bonus (less the value of any payment 
received)). The forfeited bonus would 
have been delivered fully in cash by his 
previous employer, but the Committee 
considered it would be appropriate 
to deliver the value using the same 
mechanism as Shire’s EAI, with 75 
percent payable in cash and 25 
percent deferred into Shire shares 
which would not be released for three 
years (together with shares 
representing accumulated dividends). 
 – To replace his forfeited 2015 LTIP 
award, he will be eligible to receive a 
replacement award of Shire shares 
upon joining based on the maximum 
opportunity / face value that can be 
delivered under his 2015 LTIP award 
from his previous employer. The award 
will have a face value of CHF 1,320,000 
upon grant, and will vest after one year 
(2019) based on the actual disclosed 
performance in his previous employer’s 
2018 compensation report (published in 
February 2019). 
 – To replace his forfeited 2016 LTIP 
award, he will be eligible to receive 
a replacement award of Shire PSUs 
granted upon joining based on the 
maximum opportunity / face value that 
can be delivered under his 2016 LTIP 
award, as disclosed in his previous 
employer’s 2016 compensation report. 
This award will have a face value of 
CHF 1,000,000 and will vest after 
three years (2021), subject to the 
achievement of Shire’s 2018 LTIP 
performance measures. 
 • Relocation assistance — Mr. Dittrich 
will also be eligible for relocation 
assistance in connection with his 
permanent relocation to the U.S., in 
line with the policy that applies to all 
employees across the organization. 
The details of the relocation assistance 
provided will be reported within the 
remuneration reports as appropriate,

Concluding remarks
I would like to thank my fellow members 
of the Remuneration Committee for their 
commitment and engagement in what has 
been an intensive year for the Committee, 
necessitating many additional meetings. 
I would also like to thank Anne Minto for her 
tremendous leadership of the Committee 
over the past eight years. Anne will retire 
from the Board with effect from the 
conclusion of the 2018 AGM. In addition, 
I would like to thank both the Shire and 
PwC teams for their continued hard work 
and support. I welcome the opportunity to

Overall remuneration
The structure and quantum of individual remuneration packages varies by geography, role and level of responsibility. In general, the 
proportion of variable remuneration in the total remuneration packages increases with the level of responsibility within the Company.
Fixed elements  
(base salary & benefits)  
Employees’ base salaries are 
benchmarked against the external 
market, taking into account the 
geographic location and relevant size 
of the companies with whom we are 
competing with for talent.
For example, market data for the most 
senior leadership roles, in particular 
the Executive Committee, reflects both 
the geographies in which we operate 
(with more than two thirds of employees 
as well as the majority of senior 
management based in the U.S.) and 
companies of a comparable size in the 
pharmaceutical and biotechnology 
sectors. 
Base salary increases across the 
Company are determined in light of 
similar factors as described for the 
Executive Directors.
Retirement and other benefit 
arrangements are provided to 
employees with appropriate 
consideration of market practice 
and geographical differences.
Short-term incentives 
For Executive Directors’ short-term 
incentives, assessment is made against 
a corporate scorecard of key performance 
measures built around Shire’s key 
financial goals and other strategic 
priorities for the relevant year.
This same scorecard is appropriately 
used by each business and corporate 
function to ensure alignment with 
corporate goals, and also funds short-
term incentives across the Company.
Scorecard targets are further used as 
a basis for determination of each 
employee’s performance objectives, with 
annual incentive awards payable in cash, 
strongly differentiated based on individual 
performance through linkages with the 
performance management system.
Long-term incentives 
Discretionary long-term equity awards 
are made on an annual basis dependent 
on an employee’s level of responsibility 
within the Company and individual 
performance and potential.
For Executive Directors and Executive 
Committee members, all awards vest 
at the end of a three-year period. 
For the rest of the employee population, 
phased vesting of awards occurs over 
a period of three years with the majority 
vesting at the end of the three-year 
period (except for PSU awards which 
vest at the end of a three-year period 
subject to the satisfaction of 
performance conditions).
Remuneration Policy guiding principles
The Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy has been developed in light of the following guiding principles (depicted below) which 
act as a framework for the remuneration decisions across the whole Company.

The disclosed Non GAAP adjusted ROIC target range incorporates the impact of an accounting change made in respect of depreciation during the 2017 financial 
year. The Non GAAP adjusted ROIC outcome of 6.57% also reflects this accounting treatment.
We delivered solid financial results in 2017 despite significant challenges from aggressive generic competition for LIALDA and short-term 
supply shortages for CINRYZE. These financial results, along with exceptional achievement against our non-financial strategic goals, 
including advances in our research pipeline and key commercial launches, resulted in a corporate funding level of 123 percent for the 
Company’s bonus pool. Consistent with the proposed Policy, the Remuneration Committee determined that the Executive Directors’ 
annual incentive outcomes should be aligned with overall corporate funding of the Company’s bonus pool. To that end, it was determined 
that the CEO’s and CFO’s 2017 EAI awards would be 123 percent of target, in line with the overall corporate funding score and with no 
personal multiplier applied.
Long-term incentives — LTIP
The final outcome under the 2015 LTIP resulted in a vesting level of 38 percent of maximum, reflecting actual performance over the past 
three years against the Net Product Sales and Non GAAP EBITDA performance metrics and the Non GAAP adjusted ROIC underpin. 
This outcome results in a projected vesting value of $1,126,544 for the CEO, based on the Q4 2017 average closing ADS price of $148.21. 
The CEO’s 2015 SAR awards are currently underwater, given their strike price of $245.48 and are therefore valued at $0.

 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Fixed elements — Base salary
Purpose & link to strategy Operation & Performance Assessment Opportunity
To recognize the market value of the 
role, an individual’s skills, experience 
and performance and an individual’s 
leadership and contribution to 
Company strategy.
 • Base salary is paid in cash and is pensionable.
 • A variety of factors, including individual and corporate 
performance and competitive market positioning are 
considered during the annual base salary review 
process. Any increases typically take effect on 
April 1 each year.
 • Any significant salary increases, such as in cases 
where Executive Directors are relatively new in role, 
have changes in responsibilities or significant variances 
to the market, will be appropriately explained.
 • Base salary is positioned with reference to 
a global industry peer group. Companies in 
the FTSE 50 are used as a secondary 
reference point.
 • While there is no prescribed maximum, where 
appropriate, base salary increases may be 
made in line with the average of employees’ 
salary increases, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise based on the factors 
described adjacent.
Fixed elements — Retirement and other benefits
Purpose & link to strategy Operation & Performance Assessment Opportunity
To ensure that benefits are competitive 
in the markets in which the Company 
operates.
 • Executive retirement benefit provisions are provided 
in line with market practice in the country in which 
an Executive is based.
 • The Company provides a range of other benefits which 
may include a car allowance, long-term disability and 
life cover, private medical insurance, executive physical 
program and financial and tax advisory support. These 
benefits are not pensionable. Other benefits may be 
offered and the tax thereon if considered appropriate 
by the Committee.
 • The Company may also meet certain mobility costs, 
such as relocation support, expatriate allowances, 
temporary living and transportation expenses, in line 
with the prevailing mobility policy and practice for 
other employees.
 • The maximum retirement benefit provision 
for any new Executive Director position is a 
fixed contribution of 25 percent of base salary. 
For an external recruit any retirement benefit 
contributions will be aligned with members of 
the Executive Committee, but in any event 
will not exceed 25 percent of base salary. 
 • Current legacy Company contributions for 
Dr. Ornskov are 30 percent of base salary.
 • The cost to the Company of providing other 
benefits may vary year on year depending on 
market practice and the cost of insuring 
certain benefits. The maximum potential value 
is the cost of the provision of these benefits.
Governance
Part 2: Directors’ Remuneration Policy
a)  Executive Director Remuneration 
Policy
The purpose of the Remuneration Policy 
is to recruit and retain high-caliber 
executives and encourage them to 
enhance the Company’s performance 
responsibly and in line with the Company’s 
strategy and shareholder interests. The 
proposed Policy is broadly consistent with 
the policy approved in 2015, with the most 
significant change being the operation of 
the LTIP. A summary of the changes is set 
out after the main Policy table. 
The Policy will be presented to shareholders 
for approval in a binding vote at the 2018 
AGM, and, if approved, will be effective on 
April 24, 2018, the date of the AGM, for a 
period of three years. While there is currently 
no intention to revise the Policy more 
frequently than every three years, the 
Committee will review the Policy on an 
annual basis to ensure it remains strategically 
aligned and appropriately positioned against 
the market. Where any change to the Policy 
is considered, the Committee will consult 
with major shareholders prior to submitting 
a revised policy for shareholder approval.
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy has 
been developed taking into account the 
principles of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. The overall remuneration package 
for the Executive Directors is designed to 
provide an appropriate balance between 
fixed and variable, performance-related 
components, with a significant element of 
long-term variable pay given the long-term 
nature of the business. The Committee is 
satisfied that the composition and structure 
of the remuneration package is appropriate 
and does not incentivize undue risk-taking.
86 Shire Annual Report 2017 Short-term incentives — EAI
Purpose & link to strategy Operation & Performance Assessment Opportunity
To reward individuals with an award 
based on achievement of pre-defined, 
Committee approved corporate 
objectives (the corporate scorecard).
Key performance measures are set by 
the Committee in the context of annual 
performance and ensuring progress 
towards the Company’s strategy — 
to grow and create long-term value by 
being the leading global biotech 
company focused on rare diseases.
 • EAI awards are determined solely based on the 
outcome of corporate performance with a combination 
of financial, operational and strategic objectives 
(no individual performance is taken into account).
 • Financial and non-financial measures will be based 
on other corporate strategic priorities for the relevant 
financial year.
 • At least 80 percent of the award will be based 
on financial performance.
 • The precise allocation between financial and non-
financial measures (as well as the weightings), will 
depend on the strategic focus of the Company in 
any given year.
 • The Committee reserves the right to make adjustments 
to the measures to reflect significant one-off items that 
occur during the performance period.
 • Executive Directors are required to defer 25 percent 
of any bonus earned into shares which are normally 
released after a period of three years. The release of 
deferred shares includes dividend shares representing 
accumulated dividends.
 • Malus (up to vesting) and clawback (two years post 
vesting) provisions operate in line with best practice 
corporate governance.
 • Up to 90 percent of base salary is payable for 
target performance for Executive Directors 
and up to 180 percent is payable for maximum 
performance.
 • Actual payouts can range from 0 percent 
to 200 percent of target.
Long-term incentives — LTIP
Purpose & link to strategy Operation & Performance Assessment Opportunity
To incentivize individuals to achieve 
sustained growth through superior 
long-term performance and to create 
alignment with shareholders. The LTIP 
measures, Net Product Sales, Non 
GAAP diluted EPS, Non GAAP 
adjusted ROIC and relative TSR, were 
selected by the Committee as they will 
help drive the strategic objective to 
grow and create long-term value for 
shareholders. The Committee reviews 
annually whether the performance 
measures and calibration of targets 
remain appropriate and sufficiently 
challenging taking into account the 
Company’s strategic objectives and 
shareholder interests.
 • LTIP grants consist of PSUs awarded annually.
 • PSU awards vest three years from the date of grant 
subject to the satisfaction of performance measures. 
A two-year holding period then applies to provide 
further alignment with shareholders.
 • PSU awards vest based on financial and/or share-price 
related metrics. Financial measures could include 
earnings measures, sales measures, cash flow, debt 
reduction and returns measures.
 • The exact selection and weighting of measures to be 
used each year will be determined by the Committee 
to ensure alignment with the business’s strategic plan 
and priorities. 
 • For 2018 PSU awards, the performance measures 
will be:
 – Net Product Sales: 20 percent
 – Non GAAP diluted EPS: 20 percent
 – Non GAAP adjusted ROIC: 20 percent
 – Relative TSR against industry comparator group: 
40 percent
 • Should the Committee determine that these 
performance conditions are not appropriate for future 
awards during the Policy period, for example due to the 
strategic and operational priorities of the business at 
that time, the Committee will consult with shareholders 
on any proposed changes.
 • The Committee reserves the right to make adjustments 
to the measures and/or performance targets to reflect 
significant one off items that occur during the vesting 
period.
 • The award may include dividend shares representing 
accumulated dividends on the portion of the award that 
vests. Shares may be sold in order to satisfy tax or 
other relevant liabilities as a result of vesting.
 • Malus (up to vesting) and clawback (two years post 
vesting) provisions operate in line with best practice 
corporate governance.
 • The maximum annual award for Executive 
Directors in face value terms is 600 percent 
of salary.
 • Award levels are set to reflect an individual’s 
role, responsibilities and experience.
 • Threshold vesting is equal to 20 percent of 
any award granted, target vesting is equal 
to 50 percent of any award granted and 
maximum vesting is equal to 100 percent 
of any award granted. 
 • Vesting is on a straight-line basis between 
each of these three points.

 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Governance
Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued
All Employee Share Plan
Purpose & link to strategy Operation & Performance Assessment Opportunity
To encourage long-term shareholding 
in the Company by all employees.
 • The Company operates tax-efficient all-employee share 
saving plans in various jurisdictions. The current 
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the 
Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP).
 • Under the terms of the GESPP, employees save over a 
one-year period and use the contributions to purchase 
shares at the end of the period at a maximum discount 
of 15 percent. Where required by local tax authorities, 
these terms may differ.
 • There are no performance measures attached to 
these awards.
 • Limits for all employee share plans are set 
by reference to local tax authorities in each 
jurisdiction. The Company may choose to 
set its own lower limits.
Shareholding guidelines
Executive Directors are encouraged to own shares in the Company equivalent to 500 percent (for the CEO) and 300 percent (for the CFO) 
of base salary within a five-year period following their appointment. All shares beneficially owned by an executive or deferred under the 
EAI count towards achieving these guidelines.
Notes to the remuneration policy table
Policy Element Changes to policy Rationale for change
Fixed elements — base salary • Base salary is positioned with reference to a global 
industry peer group and companies in the FTSE 50 
as a secondary reference point.
 • Previous peer groups comprised global biotech and U.S. 
biopharmaceutical companies. A FTSE 50 peer group 
was also used as a secondary reference point.
 • Creates a single primary reference point of 
relevant companies that reflect the commercial 
and international focus of Shire. The secondary 
reference point reflects the size and UK primary 
listing of Shire.
Fixed elements — Retirement and 
other benefits
 • For an external recruit any retirement benefit 
contributions will be aligned with members of the 
Executive Committee, but in any event for any new 
Executive Director promoted from within, will not exceed 
25 percent of base salary.
 • The maximum has been reduced to move the 
contribution levels towards that of the broader 
employee population while maintaining a 
competitive rate of contribution.
Short-term incentives — EAI  • Removal of the individual performance multiplier from the 
bonus assessment so the incentive is assessed based 
solely on corporate, financial and non-financial 
performance only.
 • The revised structure simplifies the approach 
to bonus assessment for shareholders and 
participants.
 • EAI awards are more directly tied to overall 
corporate performance and provide greater 
transparency to shareholders through placing 
more weighting on empirical financial data.
Long-term incentives — LTIP • Under the new policy, awards will be made as PSUs only 
and therefore the use of performance-based SARs will 
be discontinued. 
 • As a result, the maximum opportunity level has been 
reduced to 600 percent of salary from 840 percent.
 • Revised performance measures for the 2018 LTIP awards 
will include: Net Product Sales, Non GAAP diluted EPS, 
Non GAAP adjusted ROIC and relative TSR.
 • The discontinuation of performance-based 
SARs simplifies the LTIP structure for 
shareholders and participants.
 • The revised performance measures reflect the 
evolving strategic priorities of the Company and 
are aligned with the key corporate KPIs on 
which Company performance is assessed.
Shareholding guidelines • Increase in shareholding requirement to 500 percent for 
the CEO and 300 percent for the CFO, from 200 percent 
and 150 percent respectively.
 • The increase represents a market-leading 
shareholding requirement which drives and 
demonstrates a strong alignment between 
shareholders and management.
Discretion
The Remuneration Policy provides the Remuneration Committee with certain discretions in the administration and operation of current 
and legacy EAI and LTIP awards (as set out in the corresponding plan rules) including, but not limited to:
 • Any adjustments to performance conditions or awards required as a result of a corporate event such as a transaction, change in 
control, restructuring, share buybacks, special dividend or rights issue (Significant Adjusting Events (SAEs));
 • Any adjustment to the outcomes to ensure that payments are representative of the underlying corporate performance; and
 • Minor administrative matters to improve the efficiency of the operation of the plans or to comply with local tax law or regulation.
Potential SAEs are reviewed by the Committee against the guidelines as set out below and will make full and clear disclosure of any such 
adjustments in the DRR at the end of the performance period.
88 Shire Annual Report 2017 The Significant Adjusting Events guidelines consist of the following:
 • The event results from a strategic action that has a short-term impact on the performance of the Company, but is in the long-term 
interest of shareholders or the event was external and results in a significant change to the Company’s operating environment;
 • The event is a one-off (as opposed to recurring) in nature;
 • The event is ‘significant’ which is defined by reference to its impact on the financial performance of the Company relative to a 
materiality threshold; and
 • The event was not taken into account when the performance targets were set.
Performance measures and targets
The table below sets out the rationale for performance measures chosen in respect of the EAI and LTIP.
Performance 
measures Rationale How targets are set
EAI
Performance measures 
are determined on an 
annual basis with at 
least 80 percent always 
linked to financial 
performance
 • The combination of solely financial, 
operational and strategic measures provide a 
balanced assessment that is strongly aligned 
with corporate performance and allows the 
Company to focus annually on targets that 
drive towards the Company’s strategy.
 • The performance targets are determined annually by the Committee 
taking into account the Company’s business plan, market conditions 
and internal and external forecasts.
 • Targets are calibrated to reflect the Committee’s assessment of good 
to exceptional performance.
 • The Committee is of the opinion that disclosing precise targets for the 
EAI in advance would not be in shareholders’ interests. Except in 
circumstances where elements remain commercially sensitive, actual 
targets, performance achieved and awards made will be published at 
the end of the performance periods so shareholders can fully assess 
the basis for any payouts.

Relative TSR:
 • has a direct alignment with value creation for 
our shareholders
 • will reflect the market’s view of the success of 
the business
 • is straightforward for participants and 
shareholders to understand
 • Net Product Sales, Non GAAP diluted EPS and Non GAAP adjusted 
ROIC targets are determined annually by the Committee taking into 
account the Company’s business plan, market conditions and internal 
and external forecasts.
 • Relative TSR is assessed in line with UK best practice with threshold 
payout occurring for performance at the median of the peer group, 
increasing on a straight line to maximum payout for upper quartile 
performance versus the peer group.
 • The Committee has determined that a global peer group of life sciences 
companies will form the constituents of the relative TSR group. 
 • The use of an industry specific peer group means that the Executive 
Directors are only rewarded for strong performance relative to peer 
companies for which Shire is competing for investor capital. To create 
this focused list, peer companies were selected based on closeness 
of comparison to Shire in terms of size, complexity and operations. 
The precise constituents of the TSR peer group for each annual LTIP 
grant may change year on year as companies are taken over or their 
characteristics fundamentally change, but the intention is to retain as 
far as possible a consistent peer group year on year. 
 • The relative TSR results are measured on a common currency basis. 
1 Product Sales is defined as product sales from continuing operations.
2  Non GAAP diluted EPS is based upon Non GAAP net income attributable to the Company divided by the weighted average number of ordinary share equivalents 
outstanding during the period, adjusted for the dilutive effect of all potential ordinary shares equivalents that were outstanding during the year, in which one ADS is equal 
to three Ordinary Shares. The Non GAAP measures exclude the impact of certain specified items that are highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that may 
substantially impact Shire’s operations.
3  Non GAAP adjusted ROIC aims to measure the true underlying economic performance of the Company, and considers a number of adjustments to ROIC as derived 
from the Company’s Non GAAP financial results including: 
 —  Adding back to Non GAAP operating income all R&D expenses and operating lease costs incurred in the period 
 —  Capitalizing on the Group’s balance sheet historical, cumulative R&D, in-process R&D and intangible asset impairment charges and operating lease costs which 
previously have been expensed

Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued
Legacy matters in relation to Executive Director remuneration
The Committee will honor remuneration and related commitments to current and former directors (including the exercise of any 
discretions available to the Committee in relation to such commitments) where the terms were agreed prior to the approval and 
implementation of the Remuneration Policy detailed in this report.
Elements of the policy that continue to apply
The following existing arrangements will continue to operate on the terms and conditions set out in the relevant Portfolio Share Plan (PSP) 
and LTIP rules.
No further grants will be made under the LTIP on this basis. The final grant (2017 LTIP award) will vest in respect of the performance 
period ending in 2019 (with vesting in February 2020).
LTIP 
Purpose & link to strategy Operation & Performance Assessment Opportunity 
To incentivize individuals to achieve 
sustained growth through superior 
long-term performance and to 
create alignment with shareholders.
The LTIP measures, Product 
Sales and Non GAAP EBITDA, 
were selected by the Committee 
as it believes that they represent 
meaningful and relevant 
measurements of performance 
and are an important measure of 
the Company’s ability to meet the 
strategic objective to grow value 
for all our stakeholders.
The Committee reviews annually 
whether the performance 
measures and calibration of targets 
remain appropriate and sufficiently 
challenging taking into account the 
Company’s strategic objectives 
and shareholder interests.
 • LTIP grants for the Executive Directors comprised two 
types of award:
 – SAR awards. A SAR is the right to receive Ordinary 
Shares or ADSs linked to the increase in value of 
Ordinary Shares or ADSs from grant to exercise.
 – PSU awards. A PSU is the right to receive a specified 
number of Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
 • SAR and PSU awards granted to Executive Directors 
vest three years from the date of grant, subject to the 
satisfaction of performance measures and are governed 
by the LTIP rules. SAR awards can be exercised up to the 
seventh anniversary of the date of grant.
 • Vesting of awards requires the achievement of two 
independent measures:
 – Product Sales targets (50 percent weighting); and
 – Non GAAP EBITDA targets (50 percent weighting).
 • The Committee will also use a Non GAAP adjusted ROIC 
underpin at the end of the three-year performance period 
to assess the underlying performance of the Company 
before determining final vesting levels.
 • The award may include dividend shares representing 
accumulated dividends on the portion of the award 
that vests.
 • The Committee reserves the right to make adjustments 
to the measures to reflect significant one off items that 
occur during the vesting period (SAEs). Potential SAEs 
are reviewed by the Committee against pre-existing 
guidelines. The Committee will make full and clear 
disclosure of any such adjustments in the DRR at the 
end of the performance period.
 • A two-year holding period will apply following the 
three-year vesting period for both PSUs and SARs. 
Shares may be sold in order to satisfy tax or other 
relevant liabilities as a result of the award vesting.
 • Malus and clawback arrangements are in place. 
These are compliant with the Code and in line with 
best practice in this area.
 • Maximum annual awards for Executive 
Directors in face value terms were 840 
percent of salary for grants under the LTIP, 
consisting of:
 – 480 percent of base salary for SAR 
awards; and
 – 360 percent of base salary for PSU awards
 • Award levels were set to reflect an individual’s 
role, responsibilities and experience.
 • Threshold vesting is equal to 20 percent of 
any award made, with maximum vesting being 
equal to 100 percent of any award made.
90 Shire Annual Report 2017 b) Chairman and Non-Executive Director remuneration policy
Overall remuneration 
Purpose & link to strategy Operation Opportunity 
To attract and retain high-caliber 
individuals by offering market 
competitive fee levels.
 • The Chairman is paid a single fee for all of his/her 
responsibilities. The Non-Executive Directors are paid a 
basic fee. The members and Chairmen of the main Board 
committees and the Senior Independent Director are paid 
a committee fee to reflect their extra responsibilities.
 • The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors receive 25 
percent of their total fees in the form of shares. 
 • Additional fees may be paid to Non-Executive Directors 
(excluding the Chairman) on a per-meeting basis for any 
non-scheduled Board or Committee meetings required in 
exceptional or unforeseen circumstances, up to the 
relevant fee cap as set out in the Company’s Articles.
 • The Company reimburses reasonably incurred expenses 
(and tax thereon) and the Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors are also paid an additional fee in respect of each 
transatlantic trip made for Board meetings. In addition the 
Company may pay for tax support for the Chairman and 
Non-Executive Directors (and tax thereon).
 • The fees paid to the Chairman and the Non-Executive 
Directors are not performance-related. The Non-Executive 
Directors do not participate in any of the Group share 
plans, pension plans or other employee benefit schemes.
 • The Chairman’s and Non Executive Directors’ 
fees are reviewed on an annual basis.
 • Fees are determined by the Executive 
Directors and the Chairman, with the 
exception of the Chairman’s fee, which is 
determined by the Committee.
 • Fee levels, including any increases, are set 
taking into account the anticipated time 
commitment for the role, experience of the 
incumbent and competitive market levels 
among UK and global industry comparators.
 • Total fees will not exceed £3 million per the 
Company’s Articles of Association.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued
c) Recruitment remuneration policy
The following table sets out the various components which would be considered for inclusion in the remuneration package for the 
appointment of an Executive Director and the approach to be adopted by the Committee in respect of each component.
Area Policy and operation 
Overall • The Committee’s approach when considering the overall remuneration arrangements in the recruitment of a member of the 
Board from an external party is to take account of the Executive Director’s remuneration package in their prior role, the 
market positioning of the remuneration package, and to not pay more than necessary to facilitate the recruitment of the 
individual in question.
Fixed elements
(Base salary, retirement  
and other benefits)
 • Base salary is positioned with reference to a global industry peer group and companies within the FTSE 50 used as a 
secondary reference point.
 • The Executive Director shall be eligible to participate in Shire’s employee benefit plans, including coverage under all executive 
and employee pension and benefit programs in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plans, as may be 
amended by the Company in its sole discretion from time to time.
 • The Company may meet certain mobility costs, including, but not limited to, relocation support, expatriate allowances, 
temporary living and transportation expenses in line with the prevailing mobility policy and practice for senior executives.
Short-term  
incentives — EAI
 • The appointed Executive Director will be eligible to earn a discretionary annual incentive award in accordance with the rules 
and terms of Shire’s Deferred Bonus Plan (under which the EAI operates).
 • The level of opportunity will be consistent with that stated in section (a) of this Policy.
Long-term  
incentives
 • The Executive Director will be eligible for performance-based equity awards in accordance with the rules and terms of 
Shire’s LTIP. 
 • The award levels will be consistent with that stated in section (a) of this Policy.
Maximum variable 
remuneration
 • The maximum variable remuneration for a new Executive Director (excluding any replacement awards) will be 600 percent 
under the LTIP and 180 percent under the EAI, in line with section (a) of this Policy.
Replacement  
awards
 • The Committee will consider what replacement awards (if any) are reasonably necessary to facilitate the recruitment of a new 
Executive Director in all circumstances. This includes an assessment of the awards and any other compensation or benefits 
item that would be forfeited on leaving their current employer.
 • The Committee will seek to structure any replacement awards such that overall they are no more generous in terms of 
quantum or vesting period than the awards due to be forfeited.
 • In determining quantum and structure of these commitments, the Committee will seek to provide broadly equivalent value 
and replicate, as far as practicable, the timing and performance requirements of remuneration forgone.
 • The Committee will seek to ensure that a meaningful proportion of the replacement awards that are not attributable to 
long-term incentives forgone will be delivered in Shire deferred shares, released at a later date and subject to continued 
employment.
 • If the Executive Director’s prior employer pays any portion of the remuneration that was deemed forgone, the replacement 
payments shall be reduced by an equivalent amount.
 • Replacement share awards, if used, will be granted using the Company’s existing long-term incentive plan to the extent 
possible, although awards may also be granted outside of this plan if necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules.
 • In the case of an internal hire, any outstanding awards made in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out 
according to their original terms. If promotion is part way through the year, an additional top-up award may be made to bring 
the Executive Director’s opportunity to a level that is appropriate in the circumstances.
92 Shire Annual Report 2017 d) Service contracts and termination arrangements
Executive Directors
The Committee’s policy on service contracts and termination arrangements for Executive Directors is set out below. As an overriding 
principle, it is the Committee’s policy that there should be no element of reward for failure. The Committee’s approach when considering 
payments in the event of termination is to take account of the individual circumstances, including the reason for termination, performance, 
contractual obligations of both parties as well as share plan and pension scheme rules.
Notice  
period
 • The Committee’s policy is that Executive Directors’ service contracts should provide for a notice period of up to 12 months 
from the Company and the Executive Director.
 • The Committee believes this policy provides an appropriate balance between the need to retain the services of key 
individuals for the benefit of the business and the need to limit the potential liabilities of the Company in the event of 
termination.
Contractual 
payments
 • Executive Directors’ contracts allow for termination with contractual notice from the Company or termination by way of 
payment in lieu of notice, at the Company’s discretion. Neither notice nor a payment in lieu of notice will be given in the event 
of gross misconduct.
 • Payments in lieu of notice could potentially include up to 12 months’ base salary and the cash equivalent of up to 12 months’ 
pension contributions, car allowance and other contractual benefits. There is no contractual entitlement to annual incentive 
payments in respect of the notice period — any award is at the Committee’s absolute discretion, performance-related and 
capped at the contractual target level.
 • Payment in lieu of notice would be made where circumstances dictate that the Executive Directors’ services are not required 
for the full duration of their notice period. Contracts also allow for phased payments on termination, which allow for further 
reduction in payments if the individual finds alternative employment outside the Company during the notice period.
Retirement  
benefits
 • Normal treatment to apply, as governed by the rules of the relevant pension plan; no enhancement for leavers will be made.
Short-term  
incentives
 • Where an Executive Director’s employment is terminated after the end of a performance year but before the payment is 
made, the executive will remain eligible for an annual incentive award for that performance year, subject to an assessment 
based on performance achieved over the period. Where an award is made the payment may be delivered fully in cash. 
No award will be made in the event of gross misconduct.
 • Where an Executive Director’s employment is terminated during a performance year, a pro-rata annual incentive award for 
the period worked in that performance year may be payable subject to an assessment based on performance achieved over 
the period.
 • The Committee’s policy is not to award an annual incentive for any portion of the notice period not served.
 • The relevant plan rules provide that any outstanding deferred shares will vest in accordance with the regular vesting period, 
except for where an Executive Director’s employment is terminated for cause in which case they will lapse. 
 • In the event of a variation in the equity share capital of the Company, demerger, a special dividend or distribution, or any 
corporate event which might affect the value of an award, the Committee may make adjustments to the number or class 
of stock or securities subject to the award.
Long-term  
incentives
 • The treatment of unvested long-term incentive awards is governed by the rules of the relevant incentive plan, as approved 
by shareholders.
 • Where an individual’s employment terminates, the LTIP rules provide for unvested long-term incentive awards to lapse except 
as set out below.
 • Under the LTIP rules, where an individual is determined to be a ‘good’ leaver, unvested long-term incentive awards will vest 
at the normal vesting date subject to performance against applicable performance conditions and, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise, pro-rating for time. Any Committee determination will take into account a number of considerations, 
in particular performance and other circumstances relating to their termination of employment.
 • Good leaver reasons include retirement in accordance with the Company’s retirement policy, ill health, injury or disability, 
and redundancy or in other circumstances that the Committee determines.
 • Pro-rating for time will be calculated on the basis of the number of complete weeks in the relevant period during which the 
executive was employed as a proportion of the number of complete weeks in the relevant period. Where an executive does 
not work during their notice period, the Committee may apply pro-rating by reference to the date the notice period would 
have expired.
 • Where an Executive Director’s employment is terminated or an Executive Director is under notice of termination for any 
reason at the date of award of any long-term incentive awards, no long-term incentive awards will be made.
 • In the event of a variation in the equity share capital of the Company, demerger, a special dividend or distribution, or any 
corporate event that might affect the value of an award, the Committee may make adjustments to the number or class of 
stocks or securities subject to the award and, in the case of an option, the option price.
Change  
in control
 • In relation to unvested deferred annual bonus awards, the Deferred Bonus Plan rules provide that unvested awards will 
normally vest on a change in control.
 • In relation to unvested long-term incentive awards, the LTIP rules provide that unvested awards will normally only vest on 
a change in control to the extent that any performance condition has been satisfied and would be reduced where more than 
a year remains until the relevant vesting date, unless the Committee determines otherwise.
 • The Committee’s policy is that contracts of employment should not provide additional compensation on severance as a 
result of change in control.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued
Service contracts for Executive Directors
The service agreements of the Executive Directors are not fixed-term and are terminable by either the Company or the Director on the 
following bases:
Director Date of current service contract Notice period
Flemming Ornskov October 24, 2012 12 months
Jeffrey Poulton
1
April 29, 2015 12 months
Thomas Dittrich

November 19, 2017 12 months
1  Mr. Poulton left the Company on December 31, 2017.
2  Mr. Dittrich is expected to be appointed as CFO on March 19, 2018.
When setting notice periods, the Committee has regard to market practice and corporate governance best practice. All service contracts 
are available for viewing at the Company’s registered office and at the General Meeting.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment and are appointed by the Board ordinarily for a term of two years. Their initial 
appointment and any subsequent re-appointment are subject to election, and thereafter annual re-election by shareholders. Non-Executive 
Directors are not entitled to compensation for loss of office. All Non-Executive Directors are subject to a three-month notice period. In 
addition, David Ginsburg’s letter of appointment also contains specific provisions acknowledging his principal employer’s rights in respect 
of its property and proprietary information, and its policies as applicable to Dr. Ginsburg.
All service contracts and letters of appointments are available for viewing at the Company’s registered office and at the General Meeting.
External appointments
Executive Directors are permitted to hold one fee-paying external Non-Executive Directorship, subject to prior approval by the Board. 
Any fees received from such appointments are retained by the Executive Director. Dr. Ornskov was appointed to the Board of Directors of 
Waters Corporation effective June 22, 2017. During 2017, he received fees comprised of $32,000 and 594 shares, and was granted 3,042 
stock options which are exercisable on June 22, 2018.
e) Remuneration scenarios
The composition and value of the CEO’s remuneration package in three performance scenarios is set out in the charts below. The level 
of remuneration is in accordance with the Executive Director remuneration policy set out in Part 2(a) of this report. These show that the

94 Shire Annual Report 2017 f) Shareholder engagement
The Committee takes the views of shareholders very seriously and is committed to ongoing dialog with the Company’s shareholder base, 
which has a significant transatlantic element. This can take a variety of forms, including meetings with major shareholders to consider 
significant potential changes to policy or specific issues of interest to particular shareholder groups, other dialogue to update 
shareholders and receive their feedback on planned refinements to arrangements, and annual voting on the DRR.
Al Stroucken discussed the proposed changes to the Remuneration Policy with more than 30 of our largest shareholders and proxy 
advisory bodies in late 2017. The comments and suggestions made by shareholders during this engagement exercise were presented 
back to the Remuneration Committee at the October and December 2017 Remuneration Committee meetings and were instrumental in 
determining the final details of the new Remuneration Policy. Further information is set out in ‘Part One: Annual Statement’ on page 78.
g) Remuneration of other employees
The Committee recognizes that remuneration has an important role to play in supporting the implementation and achievement of 
the Company’s strategy and ongoing performance. When making remuneration decisions in respect of the Executive Directors, the 
Committee is sensitive to pay and employment conditions across the Company, in particular in relation to base salary decisions where 
the Committee considers the broader employee salary increase budget. The Committee approves the overall annual bonus funding 
for the Company each year and has oversight over the grant of all LTIP awards across the Company. In addition, annual incentive 
performance for the Executive Directors is measured against the backdrop of the same corporate scorecard that is appropriately used 
to assess performance across the organization. 
The Committee has not expressly sought the views of employees and no remuneration comparison measurements were used when 
drawing up the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. However, many of the Company’s employees are shareholders through the Company’s 
all-employee share plans, and are therefore able to express their views on director remuneration at each general meeting.
Shire has a diverse employee base, employing more than 23,000 people in more than 60 countries. To the extent possible, our 
remuneration philosophy is cascaded throughout the organization taking into account local practices where appropriate. All employees 
receive salary and benefits benchmarked to the local markets and countries in which they work. These are reviewed annually. The 
majority of employees participate in a bonus plan. The maximum opportunity available is based on role, responsibility and location, 
with the amount that can be earned based on the same corporate scorecard that is used for the Executive Directors. 
Employees who hold key strategic positions or are deemed critical to the business through their performance are also offered the 
opportunity to participate in the LTIP, with approximately 4,700 employees granted annual awards in 2017. Similar to the discretionary 
bonus plan, the maximum opportunity available is based on role, responsibility and location. Awards are assessed on the same 
performance measures as those used in the executive LTIP being Net Product Sales, Non GAAP diluted EPS, Non GAAP adjusted 
ROIC and relative TSR.
Shire operates all-employee share plans in 17 countries which allow employees to become shareholders and share in the success of the 
Company. More than 4,500 employees participate with average annual contributions of $7,000.

Part 3 — Annual Report on Remuneration
a) Implementation of Directors’ Remuneration Policy in 2018
In 2018, the Executive Director and Non-Executive Director Remuneration Policies will be implemented as follows:
Executive Director Remuneration Policy
Base salary
Implementation in 2018 — Base salaries effective April 1, 2018
CEO $1,688,000 (0 percent increase on prior year)
CFO CHF 750,000
CEO: Following the 25 percent salary increase awarded to Dr. Ornskov during 2015, the Committee has committed to freezing his salary 
at this level for the next three years. 
CFO: Upon his expected appointment on March 19, 2018, Mr. Dittrich will receive an annual base salary of CHF 750,000.
Retirement and other benefits
Implementation in 2018 — Retirement benefit contributions
CEO 30 percent
CFO 14 percent (while based in Switzerland, increasing to 20 percent upon relocation to the U.S.)
The implementation of policy in relation to retirement and other benefits is unchanged and in line with the Remuneration Policy in Part 2(a) 
of this report.
Executive Annual Incentive
Implementation in 2018 — EAI opportunity
CEO 180 percent of base salary (no change from prior year)
CFO 160 percent of base salary (no change from prior year)
A scorecard approach will continue to be used for the 2018 EAI and will be comprised of 80 percent financial and 20 percent non-
financial performance measures (representing an increase in the financial component from 75 percent in prior years). This weighting 
recognizes the critical importance of financial results to our shareholders and bonus affordability as well as the important role that 
non-financial performance plays in the success and growth of the Company. These measures are aligned with and support our four key 
strategic drivers for 2018 of Growth, Innovation, Efficiency and People. The individual performance element in the EAI has been removed 
such that awards are determined solely based on the achievement of corporate performance.
The targets themselves are considered to be commercially sensitive on the grounds that disclosure could damage the Company’s 
commercial interests. However, retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be provided in next year’s 
Annual Report on Remuneration to the extent that they do not remain commercially sensitive at that time. Financial and non-financial 
targets are set at the start of the performance year and are approved by the Committee. The Committee believes the 2018 targets are 
suitably challenging, relevant and measurable. 
The 2018 corporate scorecard and the calculation of the bonus outcome for Executive Directors is set out below:
Net Product Sales 
(1/3 weighting)
Non GAAP Free Cash Flow 
(1/3 weighting)
Non GAAP diluted EPS

96 Shire Annual Report 2017 Long-Term Incentives
Following the year-end review, the Committee made the following 2018 LTIP award decisions, which are in line with the disclosed Policy 
in Part 2(a) of this report. These awards will be made following shareholder approval of the revised Policy at the 2018 AGM:
2018 LTIP award Award type
Face value of threshold vesting 
(percentage of 2018 salary)
Face value of maximum vesting 
(percentage of 2018 salary)
Face value of maximum vesting 
(000’s)
Flemming Ornskov PSU 85% 425% $7,174
Thomas Dittrich PSU 71% 357% CHF 2,679
No 2018 LTIP award will be granted to Mr. Poulton given his departure from the Company on December 31, 2017. 
Threshold vesting is equal to 20 percent of any award granted, target vesting is equal to 50 percent of any award granted and maximum 
vesting is equal to 100 percent of any award granted. Vesting is on a straight-line basis between each of these three points. In all cases, 
awards will only vest if the Committee determines that the underlying performance of the Company is sufficient to justify the vesting of 
the award.
For the 2018 grant, the Committee has determined that LTIP awards will be tested against four independent measures at the end of 
a three-year performance period: Net Product Sales, Non GAAP diluted EPS, Non GAAP adjusted ROIC and relative TSR. 
As set out on page 78, the Company’s revised outlook for sales in combination with the wider changes in our business model has 
implications for earnings and returns trajectories for the next three years. These are reflected in the performance ranges for Net Product 
Sales, Non GAAP diluted EPS and Non GAAP adjusted ROIC. The Committee has considered this carefully and is satisfied that the 
performance ranges set for 2018 remain very stretching in the context of the revised business expectations. The weightings, threshold 
and maximum target figures are provided in the table below.
2018 LTIP targets Weighting Threshold (20 percent) Target (50 percent) Maximum (100 percent)
Net Product Sales 20 percent $16,000m $16,600m $18,000m
Non GAAP diluted EPS 20 percent $17.10 $18.20 $20.00
Non GAAP adjusted ROIC 20 percent 7.5% 8.0% 8.5%
Relative TSR (40 percent weighting)
Relative TSR will be measured against a custom peer group of global life sciences companies. To create this focused list, peer companies 
were selected based on closeness of comparison to Shire in terms of size, complexity and operations. Selection against these criteria 
resulted in the following group of 20 peer companies for the 2018 LTIP award.
AbbVie Inc. Eli Lilly and Co
Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. Gilead Sciences Inc.
Allergan plc GlaxoSmithKline PLC
Amgen Inc. Merck & Co Inc.
AstraZeneca PLC Novo Nordisk A/S
Biogen Inc. Pfizer Inc.
Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co Sanofi SA
Celgene Corp UCB SA
CSL Ltd Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Assessment against the peer group will be calibrated so that threshold payout is achieved for meeting the median TSR performance of 
the peer group, increasing to a maximum payout for meeting upper quartile TSR performance of the peer group. Any changes to the peer 
group as a result of corporate activity (e.g. a company delisting), will be reported as part of the disclosure of the LTIP vest. 
A two-year holding period will apply following the three-year vesting period. Clawback and malus arrangements are in place for awards to 
cover situations where results are materially misstated or in the event of serious misconduct.

Vesting date Deferred shares will vest in March 2021 March 2019 March 2021
The forfeited 2017 annual bonus would have been delivered fully in cash by Mr. Dittrich’s previous employer, however, the Committee 
considered it would be appropriate to deliver the value using the same mechanism as Shire’s EAI with 75 percent payable in cash and 25 
percent deferred into Shire shares which would not be released for three years (together with shares representing accumulated dividends). 
For the long-term incentive awards, the Committee considered the forfeited awards in detail and sought to structure these replacement 
awards such that overall they were no more generous in terms of quantum or vesting period than the long-term incentives due to be 
forfeited, with particular reference to the performance conditions applied to the award. The Committee aimed to ensure that they were in 
the best interests of shareholders and appropriate to secure Mr. Dittrich’s appointment to Shire. All payments are in line with the approved 
Remuneration Policy. 
Chairman and Non-Executive Director remuneration policy
2018 fee levels for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors remain unchanged for the fourth year since 2015. 
Basic fees (effective January 1, 2018) 2018
Chairman (inclusive of all committee appointments) £450,000
Senior Independent Director £98,000
Non-Executive Director £93,000
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors will continue to receive 25 percent of their total fees in the form of shares.
In addition to the basic fee, a committee fee will be paid to the members and Chairman of the Audit, Compliance & Risk, Remuneration, 
Science & Technology and Nomination & Governance Committees. 
Committee fees (effective January 1, 2018) Chairman 2018

Note: Dr. Ornskov’s and Mr. Poulton’s remuneration, which is paid through the U.S. payroll, is reported in U.S. Dollars. 
1  Mr. Poulton left the Company on December 31, 2017.
2  In the 2016 DRR, the value of LTIP awards vesting in respect of 2016 (vesting at 100 percent of maximum) was calculated using the average share price over the 
last quarter of 2016 of $177.25. These figures have been restated to reflect the actual share price at the vesting date on February 28, 2017 of $181.32. For Dr. 
Ornskov, the value of his LTIP awards vesting in 2017 represents his 2015 PSU award only (vesting at 38 percent of maximum) and has been valued using the 
average share price over the last quarter of 2017 of $148.21. His 2015 SAR award is currently underwater, given the strike price of $245.48 and is therefore valued 
at $0.
Base salary 
 • Dr. Ornskov’s base salary of $1,688,000 remains unchanged from 2015, following the Committee’s decision to freeze his salary for 
a period of three years effective July 1, 2015. 
 • Mr. Poulton’s base salary was increased by 3 percent from $592,000 to $609,760 effective April 1, 2017. 
Retirement benefits
 • Dr. Ornskov received a contribution at a rate of 30 percent of his base salary through a combination of contributions to the Company’s 
401(k) Plan and credits to his SERP account.
 • Mr. Poulton received a contribution at a rate of 25 percent of his base salary through a combination of contributions to the Company’s 
401(k) Plan and credits to his SERP account. 
Other benefits
 • The 2017 figures for Dr. Ornskov and Mr. Poulton principally include car allowance, financial and tax advisory support, long-term 
disability and life insurance and private medical, dental and vision cover.
 • The 2016 figure for Dr. Ornskov includes costs of $521,464 associated with the relocation of Dr. Ornskov’s family to join him in Boston. 
The amount includes the grossed-up cost of tax paid by the Company on behalf of the CEO.

1 25 percent of the EAI outcome is deferred into shares for three years.
The Corporate Scorecard outcome is calculated by way of a weighted average of the outcomes of the financial and non-financial 
performance measures. For each performance measure, outperformance or underperformance is measured as a percentage 
achievement against the target. Performance at target results in 100 percent of the target bonus with up to a maximum of 200 percent 
of the target bonus for maximum performance. Maximum performance is set 10 percent above target and threshold performance at 
10 percent below target, so the Committee considers the target ranges to be very challenging. The Corporate Scorecard outcome 
determines the bonus funding for all individuals within the plan.
For 2017, the Committee approved the Corporate Scorecard outcome of 123 percent set out in the table on the following page. Consistent 
with the proposed Policy, the Remuneration Committee determined that the Executive Directors’ annual incentive outcomes should be 
aligned with the overall corporate funding of the Company’s bonus pool with no additional application of any personal multiplier.

annual bonus corporate multiplier on the full-year results.
2  The disclosed Non GAAP adjusted ROIC target range incorporates the impact of an accounting change made in respect of depreciation during the 2017 financial 
year. The Non GAAP adjusted ROIC outcome of 6.57% also reflects this accounting treatment.

The table below sets out a summary of the number of shares vesting and the resulting gross estimated vesting value for the 2015 LTIP 
award for Dr. Ornskov. The 2015 LTIP award for Mr. Poulton lapsed in full upon termination as he left the Company prior to the vesting 
date on April 30, 2018. This estimate is on the basis of an average share price over the final quarter of 2017 of $148.21, given that the 
2015 LTIP award vests following the date of this report.

Directors’ shareholdings and scheme interests (subject to audit)
Under the new Remuneration Policy, the CEO, CFO and other members of the Executive Committee are required to own shares in the 
Company equivalent to 500 percent and 300 percent (previously 200 percent and 150 percent) of base salary, respectively, within 
a five-year period following their appointment. All shares beneficially owned by an executive or deferred under the EAI count towards 
achieving these guidelines. The Committee reviews share ownership levels annually for this group. Current shareholding levels for 
Directors are set out in the table below and show that the new shareholding guideline for the CEO has been significantly exceeded, 
thus demonstrating his alignment with shareholder interests.

2018. On February 13, 2018, Restricted Stock (RS) in respect of ADSs awarded to Dr. Ornskov under the EAI vested. 2,546 ADSs were released, inclusive of an 
increase, pursuant to the terms of the EAI, equivalent to the value of dividends paid by the Company in respect of the ADSs from the award date to the date of 
vesting. Of the 2,546 ADSs released, 1,572 ADSs were sold at an average price of $132.01 per ADS to satisfy personal tax liabilities arising from the vesting. 
3 This represents unvested RS and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) awarded under the EAI which are not subject to performance conditions and are forfeited in the 
case of termination for cause.
4 All unvested awards are subject to the achievement of performance conditions, adjusted at the date of vesting, with the exception of RS and RSUs awarded under 
the EAI. 
5 Vested but unexercised SARs are no longer subject to the achievement of performance conditions.
6 Mr. Poulton’s shareholding has been rounded up to the nearest whole ADS, with his precise shareholding including a fractional entitlement to an ADS as a result 
of the operation of a dividend reinvestment plan.
Awards under the Company’s long-term incentive plans and broad-based share plans are satisfied either by market-purchased shares 
held in an employee benefit trust or the issue of new shares within the limits agreed by shareholders when the plans were approved. 
These limits comply with the Investment Association’s guidelines that require that no more than 10 percent of a company’s issued share 
capital be issued in accordance with all-employee share plans in any 10-year period, with no more than 5 percent issued in accordance 
with discretionary employee share plans.

1 All awards are over ADSs. The number of ADSs for which PSU, RSU and SAR awards are granted is calculated using the average three-day closing mid-market 
ADS price at the time of grant. The number of ADSs in respect of which a RS award is granted is determined by the acquisition price per ADS at the time of grant. 
Unless otherwise indicated, all awards are granted under the Shire Long-Term Incentive Plan or its predecessor plan; the Shire Portfolio Share Plan.
2 In accordance with the rules of the respective share plans, the vested PSU, RSU and RS awards have been increased to reflect the dividends paid by Shire 
in the period from the date of grant to the date of vesting.
3 The maximum SAR and PSU awards are granted and, subject to the achievement of performance conditions, adjusted at the date of vesting. Performance 
conditions attached to SAR and PSU awards granted in 2013 and 2014 are Non GAAP adjusted ROIC and Non GAAP EBITDA targets within a performance 
matrix. Performance conditions attached to SAR and PSU awards granted from 2015 onwards are Product Sales and Non GAAP EBITDA targets with a Non 
GAAP adjusted ROIC underpin. In all cases, awards will only vest if the Committee determines that the underlying performance of the Company is sufficient to 
justify the vesting of the award.
4 25 percent of any outcome under the EAI is deferred into shares through the grant of Restricted Stock Units or Restricted Shares.
5 A two-year holding period will apply following the three-year vesting period for SAR and PSU awards granted from 2015 onwards.
On October 31, 2017, Dr. Ornskov and Mr. Poulton each exercised an option over 100 notional ADSs granted under the Shire Global 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP) at an exercise price of $123.90 per ADS. On November 1, 2017, Dr. Ornskov was granted an 
option over notional ADSs pursuant to the GESPP; electing to save $480.76 per fortnight.

104 Shire Annual Report 2017 e) Departure Arrangements for Jeff Poulton (subject to audit)
Mr. Poulton stepped down from Shire’s Board of Directors and his role as CFO on December 31, 2017. In line with the Committee’s Policy, 
the Committee considered the overall circumstances of the departure, as well as performance, contractual obligations and plan rules. 
The Committee’s determinations, which were consistent with the Executive Directors’ termination policy, are set out below.
Remuneration element Description
Salary, retirement  
and other benefits
In accordance with his employment contract and the Company’s Directors’ Remuneration Policy, Mr. Poulton will receive 
payments of salary, pension and benefits in lieu of his notice period (i.e. the period from January 1, 2018 to August 20, 
2018) with a value of $494,997. 
The payments will be reduced by the value of his salary and pension benefits from his new employment during his notice 
period following his departure from Shire and the first payments will be delayed by six months to comply with U.S. tax 
regulations. The first payment will therefore not be made until the first payroll date in July 2018.
Mr. Poulton will continue to be eligible to participate in the Company’s medical and dental benefit plans for the remainder of 
his notice period following his departure with Shire. To the extent that he becomes entitled to health coverage from his new 
employment, this benefit will cease immediately.
EAI Deferred shares granted under the EAI, will continue to vest at the normal date being the end of the respective three-year 
holding periods (further details are set out in the table below).
Date of grant Number of ADSs Release date
March 11, 2016 560 March 11, 2019
March 10, 2017 1,160 March 10, 2020
Mr. Poulton received an EAI award for the 2017 performance year, which was determined based on actual performance 
achieved against the 2017 Corporate Scorecard of 123 percent. 75 percent of this award will be paid in cash in March 
2018 in line with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy and 25 percent will be granted in Restricted Stock Units (to be 
released in March 2021). This award will be subject to malus and clawback provisions. 
Mr. Poulton will not participate in the EAI for the 2018 performance year.
LTIP All outstanding equity awards granted under the Company’s LTIP lapsed in full upon termination (i.e. those granted in 2015, 
2016 and 2017). 
Vested SAR awards, in accordance with the terms of the legacy Portfolio Share Plan (PSP), remain exercisable for a period 
of 12 months after the departure date, and if not exercised will lapse.
Mr. Poulton will not be granted an LTIP award in 2018 or any subsequent year. 
f) Payments to past Directors (subject to audit) 
No payments (other than those made to Mr. Poulton set out above) have been made to past Directors for the relevant financial year.

TSR performance graph and CEO pay
The graph below shows the TSR for Shire and the FTSE 100 Index over a nine-year period. TSR is calculated as the change (indexed) 
between the fourth quarter TSR (average for the period) in the relevant year and the base year. The FTSE 100 Index reflects the 100 
largest quoted companies by market capitalization in the UK and has been chosen because the FTSE 100 represents the broad market 
Index within which the Company’s shares are traded. The graph illustrates the change in value of a hypothetical £100 holding over nine 
years commencing December 31, 2008 and ending December 31, 2017.

1  Due to timing of the 2017 year end process, the actual short-term incentive figures for all other employees had not been finalized by the date of this report. 
Therefore, the 2017 short-term incentive figures represent target figures multiplied by the 2017 Corporate Bonus Modifier score approved by the Committee 
in early February, which represents the Company’s best estimate of actual bonus outcomes.
2  Reflects the 2016 and 2017 remuneration for Dr. Ornskov as reported in the single total figure of remuneration table in Part 2(b).
3  Reflects the average change in remuneration for all other legacy Shire employees that were eligible for annual bonuses under Shire’s corporate bonus plan. 
To help minimize distortions in the underlying data, certain adjustments have been made. In particular, the figures have been prepared on the basis of permanent 
employees who have been employed with the Company for the two preceding calendar years to provide for a consistent employee comparator group (the figures 
therefore exclude legacy Baxalta employees). This approach is consistent with the disclosure presented in the 2016 Annual Report on Remuneration.
 • The above disclosure shows a significant decrease in the CEO’s taxable benefits of 88 percent from 2016 to 2017. This is due to the 
specific support that was provided to the CEO in 2016 to relocate his family from Switzerland to Boston. The benefit provision for 2016 
is not typical and it is not intended that such support will be provided in future years. 
 • In addition, there has been a 30% decrease in short-term incentives for the CEO from 2016 to 2017 as a result of the Committee 
determining that the CEO’s 2017 short-term incentive outcome should be aligned with overall corporate funding of the Company’s 
bonus pool. As such, the CEO’s 2017 award is equal to the corporate funding of 123 percent of target (versus 175 percent of target 
in 2016).

1 Overall spend on pay figures are based on legacy Shire results for comparison purposes as 2016 data for legacy Baxalta is not readily available. 
 • Overall spend on pay increased by 6 percent in 2017 versus the prior year.
 • Non GAAP EBITDA increased by 38 percent in 2017 mainly driven by the inclusion of 12 months of financial data for legacy Baxalta 
versus only 7 months in the prior year.
 • Shareholder dividends increased by 64 percent in 2017 primarily due to the significantly increased number of shares in issue following 
the acquisition of Baxalta.
Remuneration Committee
Terms of reference
The Committee is responsible for establishing and monitoring the broad remuneration policy for the organization and the individual 
packages for the Chairman, Executive Directors and certain other senior leadership roles. Within the agreed policy, the Committee 
determines the terms and conditions to be included in service agreements, including termination payments and compensation 
commitments, where applicable. The Committee also determines performance targets applicable to the Company’s annual bonus and 
long-term incentive plans, and has oversight of the Company’s share incentive schemes. The Committee’s terms of reference were 
reviewed in February 2017 and are available in full on the Company’s website www.shire.com. Other information included on or 
accessible through our website does not constitute a part of this report and the reference to our website does not constitute 
incorporation by reference of such information, and should not be relied upon.

Advisers
In discharging its responsibilities in 2017, the Committee was assisted by Shire’s Chief Human Resources Officer and Group Vice 
President, Total Rewards. In addition, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), appointed by the Committee, continued to serve as 
independent external adviser to the Committee. PwC also provided global consultancy services to the Company in 2017, primarily 
relating to tax matters. Fees paid to PwC for services provided to the Committee totaled £355,936 in 2017.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice received by PwC related to executive remuneration matters was independent. The Committee 
assessed the potential for conflicts of interest and concluded that there were appropriate safeguards. PwC is a member of the Remuneration 
Consultants’ Group, which operates in accordance with a code of conduct related to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.

Directors
Appointment and replacement
Directors may be appointed by the Company 
by ordinary resolution or by the Board, which 
may appoint any individual either to fill a 
vacancy or as an additional member of the 
Board, subject to subsequent election and 
annual re-election by the Company’s 
shareholders. Non-Executive Directors are 
typically appointed for a term of two years. 
Re-appointment of Non-Executive Directors 
following the expiration of their term of 
appointment is subject to Board approval. 
The Board may appoint Directors for such 
period and on such terms as it may 
determine and may also revoke or terminate 
any such appointment.
The Company’s Articles of Association 
(the “Articles”) provide that at each Annual 
General Meeting (AGM) all those Directors 
who have been appointed by the Board 
since the last AGM, or who held office at 
the time of the two preceding AGMs and 
who did not retire at either of them, or who 
held office with the Company, other than 
executive office, for a continuous period 
of nine years or more at the date of the 
meeting, shall retire from office and may 
offer themselves for re-election by the 
members. Notwithstanding the provisions 
in the Articles, in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, all Directors 
will be subject to annual re-election.
Powers
Subject to the provisions of the Companies 
(Jersey) Law 1991, as amended (the 
“Companies Act”), the Articles and 
directions given by the Company in general 
meeting by special resolution, the business 
of the Company is managed by the Board 
which may exercise all the powers of the 
Company whether relating to the 
management of the business of the 
Company or not. In particular, the Board 
may exercise all the powers of the Company 
to borrow money and to mortgage or 
charge all or any part of the undertaking, 
property and assets (present and future) 
and uncalled capital of the Company and, 
subject to the Companies Act, to issue 
debentures and other securities, whether 
outright or as collateral security, for a debt, 
liability or obligation of the Company or of 
a third-party.
Liability insurance and indemnification
In the year under review, the Group 
maintained an insurance policy for its 
Directors and Officers in respect of liabilities 
arising out of any act, error or omission 
whilst acting in their capacity as Directors 
or Officers. Qualifying third-party indemnity 
provisions were also in place during the year 
under review for the benefit of Directors in 
relation to certain losses and liabilities that 
they may potentially incur to third parties in 
the course of their duties. These remain in 
force at the date of this report. 
Interests in material contracts
Other than the insurance and indemnity 
provisions disclosed under “Liability 
insurance and indemnification” above, 
and Dr. Ginsburg’s stated interest below, 
none of the Directors had a material interest 
in any contract of significance to which 
the Company or any of its subsidiary 
undertakings was a party during the 
period under review.
David Ginsburg — royalty payments 
relating to co-invention of patents / 
merger agreement with Baxalta
Dr. Ginsburg, a Non-Executive Director 
of the Company, is the co-inventor of two 
patents: (i) no. US8597910 (relating to 
the von Willebrand Factor); and (ii) no. 
US8394373 (relating to ADAMTS13). 
As such, he is entitled to receive royalties 
for the use of those patents. Dr. Ginsburg 
assigned the von Willebrand Factor patent 
to the Boston Children’s Hospital and the 
ADAMTS13 patent to the University of 
Michigan. These assignments are subject 
to ordinary course commercial terms. 
The assignee institutions on-licensed the 
patents to a subsidiary of Baxalta, prior to 
its acquisition by the Company, which in 
return paid royalties to both institutions. 
The institutions paid a proportion of those 
royalties to, among others, Dr. Ginsburg. 
Following Shire’s acquisition of Baxalta, 
a subsidiary of the Company is now the 
originator of the royalty payments received 
by Dr. Ginsburg. Moreover, as a result of 
receiving the royalty payments, Dr. Ginsburg 
was considered to be interested in the 
merger agreement pursuant to which Shire 
acquired Baxalta on June 3, 2016. This 
interest was disclosed to shareholders prior 
to completion of the transaction.
Dividends
Subject to the provisions of the Companies 
Act, the Company may by ordinary 
resolution, from time to time, declare 
dividends not exceeding the amount 
recommended by the Board. Subject to the 
Companies Act, the Board may pay interim 
dividends, and also any fixed rate dividend, 
whenever the financial position of the 
Company, in the opinion of the Board, 
justifies its payment.
The Board may withhold payment of all 
or any part of any dividends or other 
monies payable in respect of the shares 
from a person with a 0.25 percent interest 
(as defined in the Articles) if such person 
has been served with a restriction notice 
(as defined in the Articles) after failure to 
provide the Company with information 
concerning interests in those shares 
required to be provided under the Articles.
Shire has put in place income access 
share arrangements that enable 
shareholders to elect to receive their 
dividends from a Group company resident 
for tax purposes in the UK. Further 
information is available in Note 26 to 
the consolidated financial statements. 
In respect of the six months to December 
31, 2017, the Board resolved to pay an 
interim dividend of 29.79 U.S. cents (2016: 
25.70 U.S. cents) per Ordinary Share. 
Together with the first interim dividend 
payment of 5.09 U.S. cents (2016: 4.63 U.S. 
cents) per Ordinary Share, this represents 
total dividends of 34.88 U.S. cents (2016: 
30.33 U.S. cents) per Ordinary Share for the 
year ended December 31, 2017.
ACS HR Solutions Share Plan Services 
(Guernsey) Limited (the “Trustee”), trustee 
of the Shire Employee Benefit Trust (the 
“Trust”), has waived its entitlement to any 
dividends that become due and payable, 
from time to time, in respect of shares or 
other securities which are registered in the 
name of the trustee or its nominee(s). Total 
dividends waived by the Trustee during the 
year amounted to £253,888.31.

Shares
Share capital
As at the year ended December 31, 2017, 
the Company’s issued share capital 
comprised 917,140,094 Ordinary Shares 
of 5 pence each of which 7,357,283 
Ordinary Shares were held in treasury.
Rights and obligations attaching 
to shares
The rights and obligations attaching to the 
Ordinary Shares are set out in the Articles, 
which are available on the Company’s 
website: www.shire.com. The Articles may 
only be amended by special resolution of 
the members of the Company.
Variation of rights
Subject to the Companies Act, rights 
attached to any class of shares may be 
varied with written consent of the holders 
of not less than two-thirds in nominal value 
of the issued shares of that class 
(calculated excluding any shares held in 
treasury) or with the sanction of a special 
resolution passed at a separate meeting 
of the holders of those shares. At each 
such separate general meeting, except 
an adjourned meeting, the quorum shall 
be two persons holding or representing 
by proxy not less than one-third in nominal 
value of the issued shares of that class 
(calculated excluding any shares held 
in treasury).
Issuance of shares
Subject to applicable statutes and subject 
to and without prejudice to any rights 
attached to existing shares, shares may 
be issued with such rights and restrictions 
as the Company may by special resolution 
decide or, if no such resolution has been 
passed or so far as the resolution does 
not make specific provision, as the Board 
may decide. Subject to the Articles, the 
Companies Act and other shareholders’ 
rights, unissued shares are at the disposal 
of the Board.
Restrictions on transfer of shares
There are no restrictions on the transfer 
of shares in the Company, except (i) that 
certain restrictions may, from time to time, 
be imposed by laws and regulations (for 
example insider trading laws); and (ii) 
pursuant to the Listing Rules of the UK 
Financial Conduct Authority whereby 
certain Directors and employees of the 
Company require the approval of the 
Company to deal in the Company’s 
Ordinary Shares.
Voting
It is the Company’s practice to hold a poll 
on every resolution at general meetings. 
Every member present in person or by 
proxy has, upon a poll, one vote for every 
share held by him. In the case of joint 
holders of a share the vote of the senior 
who tenders a vote, whether in person or 
by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion 
of the votes of the other joint holders and, 
for this purpose, seniority shall be 
determined by the order in which the 
names stand in the register of members 
in respect of the joint holding.
Restrictions on voting
No member shall, unless the Board 
otherwise decides, be entitled to attend 
or vote at any general or class meeting in 
respect of any shares held if any call or 
other sum payable by that member remains 
unpaid. Also, a member may not be entitled 
to attend or vote if served with a restriction 
notice (as defined in the Articles).
The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between holders of securities 
that may result in restrictions on voting rights.
The Company maintains an American 
Depositary Receipt (ADR) program in 
the U.S. Each American Depositary Share 
(ADS) represents three Ordinary Shares. 
An ADS is evidenced by an ADR issued by 
Citibank, N.A. as Depositary, and is listed 
on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. 
Each ADS holder is entitled to the financial 
rights attached to such shares although the 
ADR Depositary is the registered holder of 
the underlying Ordinary Shares.
As at December 31, 2017, the Trust held 
0.11 percent of the issued share capital of 
the Company (excluding treasury shares) 
on trust for the benefit of participants in the 
Company’s employee share plans. The 
voting rights in relation to these shares are 
exercised by the Trustee. The Trustee may 
vote or abstain from voting in any way it 
thinks fit and in doing so may take into 
account both financial and non-financial 
interests of the beneficiaries of the Trust or 
their dependents. Historically the Trustee 
has not exercised its right to vote.
Purchase of own shares
At its AGM held on April 25, 2017, the 
Company was authorized, until the earlier 
of July 24, 2018, or the conclusion of the 
2018 AGM, to make market purchases of 
up to 90,625,090 of its own Ordinary 
Shares. Further details regarding 
purchases by the Company of its own 
shares can be found in Note 26 to the 
consolidated financial statements.

110 Shire Annual Report 2017 Change of control / takeover 
and contracts
As set out in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy on page 93, it is the Company’s 
policy that contracts of employment should 
not provide additional compensation or 
severance as a result of a takeover. 
However, provisions of the Company’s 
share plans may cause unvested awards 
to vest in the event of a takeover. 
The following significant agreements 
contain provisions entitling counterparties 
to exercise the following rights in the event 
of a change of control of the Company:
 • Under the $2,100 million credit facility 
agreement dated December 12, 2014, 
between, amongst others, the Company

Post year-end events
The following important events affecting 
the Company or its subsidiaries occurred 
between December 31, 2017, and the date 
of this report:
Neuroscience strategic review
On January 8, 2018, Shire announced 
that the first stage of its strategic review 
of its neuroscience business was 
completed. The Board concluded that the 
neuroscience business warrants additional 
focus and investment and that there is a 
strong business rationale for creating two 
distinct business segments within Shire: a 
Rare Disease segment and a Neuroscience 
segment. The Company expects to report 
the operational performance metrics of 
each segment separately beginning with 
the first quarter of 2018. 
AB Biosciences Inc licensing agreement
On January 25, 2018, Shire entered into 
a licensing agreement with AB Biosciences 
Inc (AB Biosciences). The license grants 
Shire exclusive worldwide rights to 
develop and commercialize a recombinant 
immunoglobulin product candidate. 
Under the terms of the agreement, 
AB Biosciences will grant Shire an exclusive, 
worldwide license to its intellectual property 
relating to its pan receptor interacting 
molecule program. AB Biosciences will 
receive an upfront license fee payment and 
is eligible to receive contingent research, 
development, and commercialization 
milestone as well as royalty payments. 
Political donations
During the year ended December 31, 2017, 
Shire made political donations equal to 
an aggregate amount of $35,000 (2016: 
$34,250). These donations were made 
to the supporting associations of various 
political state candidates within the U.S. 
who had demonstrated support for 
improving patient access to medicines 
and other medical treatments. The 
donations were made pursuant to 
commitments and arrangements already 
in place at Baxalta prior to its acquisition 
by Shire. In accordance with Shire’s 
policy concerning political donations 
and expenditure, it is anticipated that no 
further political donations will be made.

112 Shire Annual Report 2017 Directors’  
responsibilities statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America. Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Group and of the profit or loss of the 
Group for that period. 
In preparing the Group financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
 • properly select and apply accounting 
policies
 • present information, including accounting 
policies, in a manner that provides 
relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information 
 • provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific 
requirements within accounting 
principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America are insufficient 
to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the Company’s 
financial position and financial 
performance 
 • make an assessment of the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
proper accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Group and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with 
the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Responsibilities statements 
Each of the Directors confirms that to 
the best of their knowledge:
 • the financial statements, prepared 
in accordance with the accounting 
principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss 
of the Group and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole
 • the Strategic Report includes a fair 
review of the development and 
performance of the business and 
the position of the Group and the 
undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face
 • the Annual Report and financial 
statements, taken as a whole, are 
fair, balanced and understandable 
and provide the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and 
strategy
 • there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Company’s auditor is 
unaware
 • they have taken all the steps that they 
ought to have taken as Directors in 
order to make themselves aware of 
any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditor 
is aware of that information
The Responsibilities Statements and the 
Directors’ Report, which comprises pages 
2 to 113 and pages 184 to 198 of this 
Annual Report, were approved by the 
Board of Directors and signed on its 
behalf by:

Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion the consolidated financial statements of Shire 
plc (the “Company”) and subsidiaries (together the “Group”):
 • give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs 
as at December 31, 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the 
year then ended;
 • have been properly prepared in accordance with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America; and
 • have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
The financial statements that we have audited comprise:
 • the consolidated balance sheet; 
 • the consolidated statement of operations; 
 • the consolidated statement of comprehensive income; 
 • the consolidated statement of changes in equity; 
 • the consolidated statement of cash flows; and
 • the related notes 1 to 30.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law 
and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States 
of America.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described 
in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the Company in accordance 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting 
Council’s (FRC) Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest 
entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements. We confirm that the 
non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
were not provided to the Group or the Company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit  
matters
The key audit matters that we identified in the current 
year were:
 • The valuation of the CINRYZE intangible asset, 
specifically considering the potential impairment 
indicator associated with the new market entrants; 
 • Management’s estimation of rebates against revenue 
as a result of contractual and regulatory requirements 
for certain products in the United States; and
 • The pervasive risk associated with the large levels 
of change at Shire.
Within this report, any new key audit matters are identified 
with  and any key audit matters which are the same as 
the prior year identified with .
Materiality The materiality that we used in the current year was $250 
million which was determined following the consideration 
of a number different benchmarks including normalised 
profit before tax.
Scoping Our Group audit scope focused primarily on the U.S., 
European manufacturing sites, key European operating 
entities within the UK, Ireland, France, Germany and Italy, 
European royalty and research focused entities as well as 
key UK, U.S., Swiss and Jersey head office entities.
Significant 
changes in  
our approach
As a consequence of the acquisition of Baxalta in the prior 
year, and the resulting increase in revenues, the materiality 
has increased significantly in the current year and new 
components have been included in our audit scope for 
the first time.
The key audit matters included in our audit report reflect 
the nature of the Group post acquisition, with two new 
reported key audit matters being the CINRYZE impairment 
risk and a pervasive risk of change identified in the current 
year. The key audit matter associated with gross-to-net 
revenue in the U.S. is consistent with that of the prior year 
and continues to be pertinent to the overall audit.
Two key audit matters in the prior year related to Shire’s 
acquisitions of Baxalta and Dyax. No such significant 
business combinations have occurred this year and 
accordingly they are not key audit matters in 2017.
114 Shire Annual Report 2017 Conclusions relating to going concern, principal risks 
and viability statement
Going concern
We have reviewed the directors’ statement contained within the 
Corporate Governance Report on page 60 about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material 
uncertainties to the Group’s ability to continue to do so over a 
period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the 
financial statements.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add 
or draw attention to in relation to that statement required by Listing 
Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is materially inconsistent 
with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing material to report, add or 
draw attention to in respect of these matters.
Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering 
whether they were consistent with the knowledge we obtained in 
the course of the audit, including the knowledge obtained in the 
evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, we are required to state whether we 
have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
 • the disclosures on pages 18 to 21 that describe the principal 
risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
 • the directors’ confirmation on page 113 that they have carried 
out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity; or
 • the directors’ explanation on page 69 as to how they have 
assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they 
have done so and why they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement 
relating to the prospects of the Group required by Listing Rule 
9.8.6R (3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained 
in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing material to report, add 
or draw attention to in respect of these matters.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, 
were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the 
current period and include the most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. 
These matters included those which had the greatest effect on the 
overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key audit matter description How the scope of our audit responded to the key 
audit matter
Key observations
CINRYZE impairment indicator 
A description of the significant accounting policy for 
impairment of intangible assets is included at Note 
2 and the Group’s critical accounting estimate for 
valuation of intangible assets, including IPR&D, is 
included at Note 3.
Management identified an impairment trigger in Q2 
2017 with respect to the CINRYZE intangible asset 
following the positive trial results related to Shire’s 
own subcutaneous HAE product and the approval 
of HAEGARDA (a product launched by CSL Behring 
LLC), which are expected to impact CINRYZE’s 
future market share and forecast cash flows.
We identified a risk that forecasted cash flows 
associated with the asset may result in an 
unrecorded impairment. In particular, that 
inappropriate market share assumptions may result 
in a required impairment not being recorded. 
We consider the risk around market share changes 
to be a key audit matter due to the size of the 
CINRYZE intangible asset balance (December 31, 
2017 net carrying value of $1.6bn), the headroom 
included in management’s calculations and the 
subjectivity of judgments required when performing 
the impairment analysis.
The Audit, Compliance & Risk Committee’s (the 
“ACR Committee”) consideration of this key audit 
matter is included on page 71. 
In order to assess the valuation of the CINRYZE 
intangible asset, we have performed the following 
specific procedures:
 • Independently assessing the design and 
implementation, and testing the operating 
effectiveness, of the Group’s relevant financial 
controls;
 • Obtaining and assessing third party data (such 
as market analyst reports) and other available 
evidence and using it to challenge 
management’s judgments;
 • Assessing management’s historical forecasting 
accuracy; and
 • Assessing the market experts engaged by 
management, including their expertise and 
competence, and challenging them in respect 
of management’s assumed market share.
We found management’s estimates and 
judgments to be reasonable and balanced. 
We did not identify an unrecorded impairment 
in respect of CINRYZE and found management’s 
disclosures of the impairment indicators to be 
proportionate.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Shire plc continued
Key audit matter description How the scope of our audit responded to the key 
audit matter
Key observations
A description of the key accounting policy for sales 
deductions is included at Note 3 and the Group’s 
critical accounting policy and estimate in relation to 
the level of rebates and other sales deductions is 
set out at Note 3.
The directors are required to make certain 
judgments in respect of the level of rebates and 
other sales deductions that will be realised against 
the Group’s sales. 
The largest of these judgments relate to rebates for 
Medicaid and Managed Care programs, for which 
the Group held accrued rebates as at December 
31, 2017 of $1,613 million (2016: $1,431 million) 
in aggregate. Due to the nature of the Group’s 
products the risk is primarily focused on the 
Neuroscience operations in the USA.
The key elements of the judgments relating to 
Medicaid and Managed Care rebates include:
 • The proportion of the inventory pipeline that 
will attract specific rebates; and
 • The future value of rebate per unit expected 
to be applicable.
We identified a risk that these judgments are not 
appropriate and, as a result, rebate liabilities and 
sales deductions are recorded at an incorrect level.
There is a significant track record of actual rebate 
levels which informs our assessment of the level of 
risk of material misstatement. Nevertheless due to the 
manual nature and extent of the accounting process 
in this area it forms a significant part of our audit effort 
and requires a notable level of resource within the 
audit engagement and is thus a key audit matter.
The ACR Committee’s consideration of this key audit 
matter is included on page 71.
We have considered the Group’s processes for 
making judgments in this area and performed the 
following procedures:
 • Assessed the appropriateness of the process, 
including tests of the design, implementation 
and operating effectiveness of controls adopted 
by management in determining the accounting 
for rebates and other sales deductions;
 • Challenged the information used by 
management in estimating gross to net accruals 
by vouching to external source data (such as 
wholesaler inventory levels and market demand 
surveys); 
 • Conducted trend analysis and used this to 
challenge whether management’s assumptions 
were appropriate; and
 • Recomputed key calculations within 
management’s estimates.
We also evaluated the presentation and disclosure 
of the transactions within the Group’s financial 
statements.
Shire has a well established process for 
determining gross to net adjustments in the U.S. 
and have largely integrated the legacy Baxalta 
processes into it. 
Management monitor their historical accuracy 
with the largest variance in the last 12 quarters 
being $12.6 million. 
Management utilised a range of data to determine 
the key assumptions associated with the 
calculation including data from 3rd party partners, 
market survey information as well as historical 
results. Based on the procedures performed we 
found these assumptions to be balanced. 
We concluded that the accrual value has been 
appropriately recorded.
Pervasive risk of change 
116 Shire Annual Report 2017 Key audit matter description How the scope of our audit responded to the key 
audit matter
Key observations
Shire has undergone a significant period of 
organisational change driven in particular by the 
integration of the Baxalta business. Some of the 
key changes include:
 • Establishing the new Corporate Services 
accounting centre in Dublin, moving key financial 
processes from Shire’s financial operations team 
in Basingstoke and from Baxter’s shared service 
centre in Dublin, provided under TSA 
arrangements, to a newly establised team;
 • Moving legacy Baxalta financial processes 
previously performed in Costa Rica under 
TSA agreements with Baxter into the Exton 
Corporate Services team;
 • The integration of the legacy Baxalta 
consolidation into the Shire consolidation 
process;
 • Changes in senior management including 
the CFO;
 • The ongoing integration of significant functions, 
including technical operations, resulting in, 
for example, the movement of key financial 
responsibilities to new individuals and the 
announced network study in relation to Shire’s 
global manufacturing footprint; and
 • The integration of Shire and Baxala legal entities.
These changes in 2017 follow previous years of 
significant change including major acquisitions and 
the One Shire program.
The level of change in the current year, and 
cumulatively, creates a risk that key financial 
processes may fail to operate effectively.
In addition to the risk described above, there is also 
a risk related to management being in a position to 
perpetrate fraud because of management’s ability 
to manipulate accounting records and prepare 
fraudulent financial statements by overriding controls 
that otherwise appear to be operating effectively.
The ACR Committee’s consideration of this key audit 
matter is included on page 71.
We have considered management’s response to the 
increased risk and performed the following specific 
procedures: 
 • Assessed and tested management’s change 
management process for each key area of 
change;
 • increased the testing of key internal controls 
in areas of particularly significant change; and
 • increased the level of our substantive testing in 
areas with the most significant levels of change. 
We also performed the following procedures to 
address management override of controls:
 • Tested the appropriateness of, and rationale for, 
journal entries that had potentially fraudulent 
characteristics;
 • Reviewed accounting estimates for bias 
including evaluating both individually and 
collectively the impact on the financial 
statements; and
 • Evaluated the business rationale for significant 
transactions outside the normal course of 
business or that otherwise appeared unusual.
We found management’s response to the 
increased risk to be appropriate and no further 
findings have arisen as a result of our specific 
focus in this area.
 117 Shire Annual Report 2017
 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be 
changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgment, we determined materiality 
for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality $250 million (2016: $150 million)
Basis for 
determining 
materiality
The materiality was determined following the consideration 
of a number of different benchmarks, including revenue, 
Non GAAP EBITDA, Non GAAP net income, normalised 
profit before tax and total assets. Our selected materiality 
is based on a blend of these measures.
Normalised profit before tax has been adjusted by removing 
the impact of non-recurring items such as the $733 million 
unwind of the fair value uplift associated with the Baxalta 
inventory acquired and the acquisition and integration 
costs of $764 million directly associated with the Baxalta 
acquisition. In 2016, materiality was determined on the 
basis of 6% of normalised pre-tax profit.
Rationale for 
the benchmark 
applied
We have considered a number of different benchmarks as 
highlighted below, in light of differing views of investors, 
analysts and other users of the accounts. 
In addition we have considered the impact of unusual one 
off events and the significant acquisitions in recent years 
on some of the metrics and thus determined a blended 
benchmark is most appropriate.
Benchmark Materiality as a % of metric
Revenue — $15,161 million 1.7%
Non GAAP EBITDA* — 
$6,492 million 3.9%
Non GAAP Net Income* — 
$4,604 million 5.4%
Normalised PBT — 
$3,411 million 7.3%
Total assets — 
$67,757 million 0.4%
Our prior year benchmark of normalised profit before 
tax was no longer considered an appropriate benchmark 
on its own due to the significant ongoing impact on 
the Statement of Operations of the Baxalta acquisition, 
in particular the amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets. Accordingly we have chosen to supplement 
this benchmark with those set out above.
*  These items represent Non GAAP financial measures 
a reconciliation of which to the most directly comparable 
measure under U.S. GAAP is provided on pages 179 
to 183.
We agreed that we would report to the ACR Committee all audit 
differences in excess of $12.5 million (2016: $7.5 million), as well 
as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the ACR 
Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when 
assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the 
Group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the group level.
Shire has one reporting unit, one segment and is managed on a 
functional basis. However the results are reported, and consolidated, 
on an entity by entity basis rather than within functional areas. We 
have determined that each entity is a separate component for 
scoping purposes.
In order to determine the significant components we quantitatively 
assessed the proportion of key balances including revenue, inventory 
and fixed assets included in different components as these are the 
key balances that drive significance of the components. 
We also considered qualitative factors that would impact the level 
of risk in certain components. 
From this assessment we focused our group audit scope primarily 
on the U.S., European manufacturing sites, key European operating 
entities within the UK, Ireland, France, Germany and Italy, European 
royalty and research focused entities as well as key UK, U.S., Swiss 
and Jersey head office entities. 
These locations represent the principal operations and together with 
the group functions in scope account for 95% (2016: 96%) of the 
Group’s total assets and 80% (2016: 86%) of the Group’s revenues. 
They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for 
undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement 
identified above. Our audit work at the individual locations was 
performed at component materiality levels which ranged from $50 
million to $135 million (2016: $37 .5 million to $95 million), which were 
determined by reference to a proportion of group materiality 
appropriate to the relative scale of the business concerned. 
At group level we also audited the consolidation process and carried 
out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were 
no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated 
financial information of the remaining components not subject to 
audit or review procedures. 
We consider the scope to be appropriate to address the risks of 
the audit.
In executing our audit scope we performed testing at Shire’s two 
corporate services functions in Ireland and the U.S. as well as in local 
operations, at global functions primarily based in the U.S., Ireland and 
the UK, and at a group level.
The group audit team directly supervises the work performed across 
all of the components, with comprehensive instructions issued to 
each component team, and follows a program of planned site visits 
and regular remote interactions that are designed to ensure that the 
Senior Statutory Auditor or other senior members of the audit team 
spend appropriate time with the component team and in each of the 
in scope locations throughout the year.
Financial statements
Independent auditor’s report to the members of Shire plc continued
118 Shire Annual Report 2017 Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in the annual report, 
other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our 
report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material 
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a 
material misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we 
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report 
to you as uncorrected material misstatements of the other 
information include where we conclude that:
 • Fair, balanced and understandable — the statement given 
by the directors that they consider the annual report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit; or
 • ACR Committee reporting — the section describing the work 
of the ACR Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the ACR Committee; or
 • Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code — the parts of the directors’ statement 
required under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing 
provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with 
Listing Rule 9.8.10R (2) do not properly disclose a departure from 
a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with 
Listing Rule 9.8.10R (2) do not properly disclose a departure from 
a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible 
for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors 
either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have 
no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level 
of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description 
forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by our 
engagement letter
In our opinion the part of the directors’ remuneration report to 
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006 as if that Act applied 
to the Company.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of 
the audit:
 • the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ 
report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 • the strategic report and the directors’ report have been 
prepared in accordance with the applicable legal requirements 
that apply to UK companies.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and 
the Company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the 
strategic report or the directors’ report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
 • we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
 • proper accounting records have not been kept by the Company, 
or proper returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 • the financial statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Other matters
Auditor tenure

The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous 
renewals and reappointments of the firm is 15 years, covering the 
years ended December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2017.
Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to

Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the 
ACR Committee we are required to provide in accordance with 
ISAs (UK).

1. Description of Operations
Shire plc and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as either 
“Shire” or the “Company”) is the leading global biotechnology 
company focused on serving people with rare diseases.
Some of the Company’s marketed products include 
GAMMAGARD, HYQVIA and CINRYZE for Immunology, ADVATE/
ADYNOVATE, VONVENDI and FEIBA for Hematology, VYVANSE 
and ADDERALL XR for Neuroscience, LIALDA/MEZAVANT and 
PENTASA for Internal Medicine, ELAPRASE and REPLAGAL for 
Genetic Diseases, ONCASPAR and ONYVIDE for Oncology and 
XIIDRA for Ophthalmics.
The Company has grown both organically and through acquisition, 
completing a series of major transactions that have brought 
therapeutic, geographic and pipeline growth and diversification. 
The Company will continue to conduct its own research and 
development (R&D) focused on rare diseases, as well as evaluate 
companies, products and pipeline opportunities that offer a 
strategic fit and have the potential to deliver value to all of the 
Company’s stakeholders: patients, physicians, policy makers, 
payers, partners, investors and employees.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include 
the accounts of Shire plc, all of its subsidiaries and the Income 
Access Share trust, after elimination of inter-company accounts 
and transactions. They have been prepared in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of 
America (U.S. GAAP) and U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) regulations for annual reporting.
On June 3, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of 
Baxalta for $32.4 billion, representing the fair value of purchase 
consideration. The Company’s consolidated financial statements 
include the results of Baxalta from the date of acquisition. For 
further details regarding the acquisition, refer to Note 4, Business 
Combinations, to the consolidated financial statements.
Use of Estimates in Consolidated Financial Statements
The preparation of Financial Statements, in conformity with U.S. 
GAAP and SEC regulations, requires management to make 
estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported 
and disclosed amounts of assets, liabilities and equity at the date 
of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts 
of revenues and expenses during the period. On an on-going 
basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, judgments and 
methodologies. Estimates are based on historical experience, 
current conditions and on various other assumptions that are 
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the 
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, 
liabilities and equity and the amounts of revenues and expenses. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different 
assumptions or conditions.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements reflect the financial 
statements of the Company and those of the Company’s wholly-
owned subsidiaries. For consolidated entities where the Company 
owns or is exposed to less than 100% of the economics, the 
Company records net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling 
interests in its Consolidated Statements of Operations equal to the 
percentage of the economic or ownership interest retained in such 
entities by the respective non-controlling parties. Intercompany 
balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
The Company determines whether to consolidate subsidiaries 
based on either the variable interest entity (VIE) model or the voting 
interest model. The Company consolidates a VIE if it is determined 
that the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. In 
determining whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of an 
entity, management applies a qualitative approach that determines 
whether the Company has both (1) the power to direct the 
economically significant activities of the entity and (2) the obligation 
to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity 
that could potentially be significant to that entity. The Company 
consolidates entities that are not VIEs if it is determined that the 
Company holds a majority voting interest in the entity.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains 
control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses 
control of the subsidiary. Intercompany balances and transactions 
are eliminated in consolidation.
Revenue recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria 
are met:
 • there is persuasive evidence an arrangement exists; 
 • delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 
 • the price to the customer is fixed or determinable; and 
 • collectibility is reasonably assured. 
Where applicable, all revenues are stated net of value added 
and similar taxes and trade discounts. The Company’s principal 
revenue streams and their respective accounting treatments are 
discussed below:
Product sales
Revenues from Product sales are recognized when title and risk of 
loss have passed to the customer, which is typically upon delivery. 
Product sales are recorded net of applicable reserves for discounts 
and allowances.
Reserves for Discounts and Allowances
The Company establishes reserves for trade discounts, 
chargebacks, distribution service fees, Medicaid rebates, 
managed care rebates, incentive rebates, product returns and 
other governmental rebates or applicable allowances. These 
reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be 
claimed on the related sales. Management’s estimates take into 
consideration historical experience, current contractual and 
statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, 
industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment 
patterns. Actual amounts may ultimately differ from estimates. 
If actual results vary, management adjusts these estimates, which 
have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment.
 • Trade discounts are generally credits granted to wholesalers, 
specialty pharmacies and other customers for remitting 
payment on their purchases within established incentive 
periods and are classified as a reduction of accounts receivable.
 • Chargebacks are credits or payments issued to wholesalers 
and distributors who provide products to qualified healthcare 
providers at prices lower than the list prices charged to the 
wholesaler or distributor. Reserves are estimated based on 
expected purchases by those qualified healthcare providers. 
Chargeback reserves are classified as a reduction of accounts 
receivable.
128 Shire Annual Report 2017  • Distribution service fees are credits or payments issued to 
wholesalers, distributors and specialty pharmacies for 
compliance with various contractually-defined inventory 
management practices or services provided to support patient 
access to a product. These fees are generally based on a 
percentage of gross purchases but can also be based on 
additional services these entities provide. Most of these costs 
are reflected as a reduction of gross sales; however, to the 
extent benefit from services can be separately identified and 
the fair value determined, costs are classified in Selling, general 
and administrative expense. Reserves are classified within 
accrued expenses.
 • Medicaid rebates are payments to States under statutory 
and voluntary reimbursement arrangements. Reserves for 
these rebates are generally based on an estimate of expected 
product usage by Medicaid patients and expected rebate rates. 
Statutory rates are generally based on a percentage of 
selling price adjusted upwards for price increases in excess 
of published inflation indices. As a result, rebates generally 
increase as a percentage of the selling price over the life of 
the product (as prices increase). Medicaid rebate reserves are 
classified within accrued expenses.
 • Managed care rebates are payments to third parties, primarily 
pharmacy benefit managers and other health insurance 
providers. The reserve for these rebates is based on an estimate 
of customer buying patterns and applicable contractual rebate 
rates to be earned over each period. Reserves are classified 
within accrued expenses.
 • Incentive rebates are generally credits or payments issued to 
specialty pharmacies, distributors or Group Purchasing 
Organizations for qualified purchases of certain products. 
Reserves are estimated based on the terms of each individual 
contract and purchase volumes and are classified within 
accrued expenses.
 • Return credits are issued to customers for return of product 
damaged in shipment and, for certain products, return due to 
lot expiry. The majority of returns are due to expiry, and reserves 
are estimated based on historical returns experience. The 
returns reserve is classified within accrued expenses.
 • Other discounts and allowances include Medicare rebates, 
coupon and patient co-pay assistance. Medicare rebates are 
payments to certain health insurance providers of Medicare Part 
D coverage to qualified patients. Reserve estimates are based 
on customer buying patterns and applicable contractual rebate 
rates to be earned over each period. Coupon and co-pay 
assistance programs provide discounts to qualified patients. 
Reserve estimates are based on expected claim volumes under 
these programs and estimated cost per claim that the Company 
expects to pay. Reserves for Medicare and coupon and patient 
co-pay programs are classified within accrued expenses.
Royalties and Other Revenue
Royalty income relating to licensed technology is recognized when 
the licensee sells the underlying product, with the amount of royalty 
income recorded based on sales information received from the 
relevant licensee. The Company estimates sales amounts and 
related royalty income based on the historical product information 
for any period that the sales information is not available from the 
relevant licensee.
Other revenue includes revenues derived from product out-
licensing arrangements, which may consist of an initial up-front 
payment on inception of the license and subsequent milestone 
payments upon achievement of certain clinical and sales 
milestones. To the extent the license requires Shire to provide 
services to the licensee; up-front payments are deferred and 
recognized over the service period.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition 
method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, assets 
acquired, including in-process research and development (IPR&D) 
projects, and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective 
fair values as of the acquisition date in the consolidated financial 
statements. The excess of the fair value of consideration 
transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is 
recorded as goodwill. Contingent consideration obligations 
incurred in connection with a business combination (including 
the assumption of an acquiree’s liability arising from a business 
combination it completed prior to the acquisition) are recorded 
at their fair values on the acquisition date and remeasured at their 
fair values each subsequent reporting period until the related 
contingencies are resolved. The resulting changes in fair values 
are recorded in earnings.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price 
and the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net 
assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not 
amortized, but instead is reviewed for impairment. Goodwill is 
reviewed annually, as of October 1, and whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of 
goodwill may not be recoverable. Events or changes in 
circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include 
but are not limited to: unexpected adverse business conditions, 
economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or 
competitive activities and acts by governments and courts.
For the purpose of assessing the carrying value of goodwill for 
impairment, goodwill is allocated at the Company’s reporting unit 
level. As described in Note 23, Segment Reporting, the Company 
operates in one operating segment which it considers to be its only 
reporting unit. 
The Company reviews goodwill for impairment by firstly assessing 
qualitative factors, including comparing the market capitalization 
of the Company to the carrying value of its assets, to determine 
whether events or circumstances exist which indicate that it is 
more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than 
its carrying amount. If, after assessing these qualitative factors, it is 
deemed more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is 
less than its carrying value, a “two step” quantitative assessment is 
performed by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit’s 
net assets (including allocated goodwill) to the fair value of the 
reporting unit.
If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit 
exceeds the fair value of its reporting unit, then it determines the 
implied fair value of its reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value 
of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then 
an impairment loss equal to the difference is recorded.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets primarily relate to commercially marketed products 
and IPR&D projects. Intangible assets are recorded at fair value at 
the time of their acquisition and are stated in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets, net of accumulated amortization and impairments, 
if applicable.
Intangible assets related to commercially marketed products are 
amortized over their estimated useful lives. Remaining useful lives 
range from 1 year to 24 years (weighted average 19 years) and the 
Company amortizes its intangibles on an economic consumption 
method, or a straight-line basis when straight-line method 
approximates economic consumption method. 
Milestone payments made to third parties on and subsequent 
to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets, and 
amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product.
The following factors, where applicable, are considered in 
estimating the useful lives of intangible assets:
 • expected use of the asset;
 • regulatory, legal or contractual provisions, including the 
regulatory approval and review process, patent issues and 
actions by government agencies;
 • the effects of obsolescence, changes in demand, competing 
products and other economic factors, including the stability 
of the market, known technological advances, development 
of competing drugs that are more effective clinically or 
economically;
 • actions of competitors, suppliers, regulatory agencies or 
others that may eliminate current competitive advantages; and
 • historical experience of renewing or extending similar 
arrangements.
Acquired IPR&D represents the fair value assigned to research and 
development assets that have not reached technological feasibility. 
The value assigned to acquired IPR&D is determined by estimating 
the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially 
viable products, estimating the resulting revenue from the projects, 
and discounting the net cash flows to present value. The revenue 
and costs projections used to value acquired IPR&D are, as 
applicable, reduced based on the probability of success of 
developing a new drug. Additionally, the projections consider 
the relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends 
in technology, and the nature and expected timing of new product 
introductions by the Company and its competitors. The rates 
utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value are 
commensurate with the stage of development of the projects and 
uncertainties in the economic estimates used in the projections.
Upon the acquisition of IPR&D, the Company completes an 
assessment of whether the acquisition constitutes the purchase 
of a single asset or a group of assets. The Company considers 
multiple factors in this assessment, including the nature of the 
technology acquired, the presence or absence of separate cash 
flows, the development process and stage of completion, quantitative 
significance and its rationale for entering into the transaction.
If the Company acquires a business as defined under applicable 
accounting standards, then the acquired IPR&D is capitalized as 
an intangible asset. If the Company acquires an asset or group 
of assets that do not meet the definition of a business, then the 
acquired IPR&D is expensed on its acquisition date. Future costs 
to develop these assets are recorded to research and development 
expense as they are incurred.
IPR&D projects are considered to be indefinite-lived until completion 
of the associated R&D efforts. If and when development is 
complete, which generally occurs when regulatory approval to 
market a product is obtained, the associated assets would be 
deemed finite-lived and would then be amortized based on their 
respective estimated useful lives at that point in time. Intangible 
assets related to IPR&D projects are reviewed for impairment at 
least annually, as of October 1st, until commercialization, after 
which time the IPR&D is amortized over its estimated useful life.
The Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets, 
except for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amounts of the relevant assets may not be recoverable. When such 
a determination is made, management’s estimate of undiscounted 
cash flows to be generated by the use and ultimate disposition of 
these assets is compared to the carrying value of the assets to 
determine whether the carrying value is recoverable. If the carrying 
value is deemed not to be recoverable, the amount of the 
impairment recognized in the consolidated financial statements is 
determined by estimating the fair value of the relevant assets and 
recording an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying 
value exceeds the estimated fair value.
The Company calculates the fair value using significant estimates 
and assumptions including but not limited to: revenues and 
operating profits related to the products, existing competitive 
activities and acts by governments and courts. Changes in these 
estimates and assumptions could materially affect the 
determination of fair value. Should the fair value of long-lived 
assets decline, charges for impairment may be necessary.
Fair Value Measurements
The Company has certain financial assets and liabilities recorded 
at fair value which have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the 
fair value hierarchy as described in the accounting standards for 
fair value measurements:
 • Level 1 — Fair values are determined utilizing quoted prices 
(unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
that we have the ability to access;
 • Level 2 — Fair values are determined by utilizing quoted prices 
for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or other market 
observable inputs such as interest rates, yield curves and 
foreign currency spot rates; and
 • Level 3 — Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both 
significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.
The majority of the Company’s financial assets have been 
classified as Level 1 and 2. The Company’s financial assets, which 
include cash equivalents, derivative contracts, marketable equity 
and debt securities, and plan assets for deferred compensation, 
have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently 
valued, at the end of each reporting period, utilizing third-party 
pricing services or other market observable data. The Company 
utilizes industry standard valuation models, including both income 
and market-based approaches and observable market inputs to 
determine value. These observable market inputs include 
reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer 
quotes, bids, offers, current spot rates and other industry and 
economic events.
130 Shire Annual Report 2017 Accounts receivable
The Company’s accounts receivable arise from Product sales 
and represent amounts due from its customers. The Company 
monitors the financial performance and credit worthiness of its 
large customers so that it can assess and respond to changes 
in their credit profile. The Company provides reserves against 
accounts receivable for estimated losses, if any, that may result 
from a customer’s inability to pay. Amounts determined to be 
uncollectible are written-off against the reserve.
Investments
The Company has certain investments in pharmaceutical and 
biotechnology companies whose securities are not publicly traded 
and where fair value is not readily available. These investments are 
recorded using either the cost method or the equity method of 
accounting, depending on its ownership percentage and other 
factors that suggest the Company has significant influence. 
Under the equity method of accounting, the Company records 
its investments in equity-method investees in the consolidated 
balance sheet under Investments and its share of the investees’ 
earnings or losses together with other-than- temporary 
impairments in value under Equity in earnings/(losses) of equity 
method investees, net of taxes in the Consolidated Statements of 
Operations. The Company monitors these investments to evaluate 
whether any decline in their value has occurred that would be 
other-than-temporary, based on the implied value of recent 
company financings, public market prices of comparable 
companies, and general market conditions.
All other equity investments, which consist of investments for 
which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant 
influence, are accounted for under the cost method or at fair value. 
Investments in private companies are carried at cost, less 
provisions for other-than-temporary impairment in value. For 
investments in equity investments that have readily determinable 
fair values, the Company classifies its equity investments as 
available-for-sale and, accordingly, records these investments at 
their fair values with unrealized holding gains and losses included 
in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, net of 
any related tax effect. Realized gains and losses, and declines in 
value of available-for-sale securities judged to be other-than-
temporary, are included in Other income/(expense), net in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations. The cost of securities sold 
is based on the specific identification method. Interest on securities 
classified as available-for-sale is included as Interest income in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the 
first-in, first-out method, and net realizable value. The inventory 
costs are classified as long term when the Company expects 
to utilize the inventory beyond the normal operating cycle and 
includes these costs in Other non-current assets in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Capitalization of Inventory Costs
The Company capitalizes inventory costs associated with 
its products prior to regulatory approval, when, based on 
management’s judgment, future commercialization is considered 
highly probable and the future economic benefit is expected to 
be realized.
Obsolescence and Unmarketable Inventory
Inventories are written down for estimated obsolescence or 
unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the 
cost of inventory and estimated net realizable value based upon 
assumptions about future demand and market conditions. 
Amounts written down due to obsolescence and unmarketable 
inventory are charged to Cost of sales.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost, net of 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Property, plant 
and equipment are subject to review for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The cost of normal, 
recurring, or periodic repairs and maintenance activities related to 
property, plant and equipment are expensed as incurred. The cost 
for planned major maintenance activities, including the related 
acquisition or construction of assets, is capitalized if the repair 
will result in future economic benefits.
Interest costs incurred during the construction of major capital 
projects are capitalized until the underlying asset is ready for its 
intended use, at which point the interest costs are amortized as 
depreciation expense over the useful life of the underlying asset. 
The Company also capitalizes certain direct and incremental costs 
associated with the validation effort required for licensing by 
regulatory agencies of new manufacturing equipment for the 
production of a commercially approved drug. These costs primarily 
include direct labor and material and are incurred in preparing the 
equipment for its intended use. The validation costs are amortized 
over the useful life of the related equipment.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated using 
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as follows:
Asset category Estimated useful lives
Land Not depreciated
Buildings and leasehold improvements 15 to 50 years
Office furniture, fittings and equipment 3 to 10 years
Machinery, equipment and other 3 to 15 years
At the time property, plant and equipment is retired or otherwise 
disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated 
from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts. The profit 
or loss on such disposition is reflected in operating income.
Assets Held for Sale
The Company classifies long-lived assets or disposal groups to 
be sold as held for sale in the period in which all of the following 
criteria are met:
 • management, having the authority to approve the action, 
commits to a plan to sell the asset or disposal group; 
 • the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in 
its present condition; 
 • an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required 
to complete the plan to sell the asset or disposal group have 
been initiated; 
 • the sale of the asset or disposal group is probable, and transfer 
of the asset or disposal group is expected to qualify for 
recognition as a completed sale within one year, except if events 
or circumstances beyond our control extend the period of time 
required to sell the asset or disposal group beyond one year;
 • the asset or disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at 
a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and 
 • actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely 
that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan 
will be withdrawn.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
The Company initially measures a long-lived asset or disposal 
group that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying 
value or fair value less any costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this 
measurement is recognized in the period in which the held-for-sale 
criteria are met.
The Company assesses the fair value of a long-lived asset or 
disposal group less any costs to sell each reporting period it 
remains classified as held for sale and reports any subsequent 
changes as an adjustment to the carrying value of the asset or 
disposal group, as long as the new carrying value does not exceed 
the carrying value of the asset at the time it was initially classified 
as held for sale.
Upon determining that a long-lived asset or disposal group 
meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the Company 
ceases depreciation.
Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations comprise those activities that were 
disposed of during the period or which were classified as held for 
sale at the end of the period, and represent a separate major line 
of business or geographical area that can be clearly distinguished 
for operational and financial reporting purposes.
Contingent consideration payable
Contingent consideration payable represents future milestones and 
royalties the Company may be required to pay in conjunction with 
various business combinations. The amounts ultimately payable by 
the Company are dependent upon the successful achievement of 
the underlying scientific or commercial event and future net sales 
of the relevant products over applicable term. The Company 
records an obligation for such contingent payments at fair value on 
the acquisition date. The Company assesses the probability, and 
estimated timing, of these milestones being achieved and the 
present value of forecast future net sales of the relevant products 
and re-measures the related contingent consideration to fair value 
each balance sheet date. The amount of contingent consideration 
which may ultimately be payable by Shire in relation to future 
royalties is dependent upon future net sales of the relevant 
products over the life of the royalty term.
The fair value of the Company’s contingent consideration payable, 
which is considered as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, 
could significantly increase or decrease due to changes in 
certain assumptions which underpin the fair value measurements. 
Each set of assumptions and milestones is specific to the individual 
contingent consideration payable. The assumptions include, 
among other things, the probability of, and period in which, the 
relevant milestone event is expected to be achieved; the amount 
of royalties that will be payable based on forecast net sales of 
the relevant products; and the discount rates to be applied in 
calculating the present values of the relevant milestone or royalty. 
The Company regularly reviews these assumptions, and makes 
adjustments to the fair value measurements as required by facts 
and circumstances.
Derivative financial instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its 
exposure to foreign exchange risk to earnings relating to forecasted 
transactions and recognized assets and liabilities. For each 
derivative instrument that is designated and effective as a cash 
flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in 
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) and then 
recognized in earnings consistent with the underlying hedged item. 
Cash flow hedges are classified in revenues and cost of sales and 
primarily relate to forecasted third-party sales denominated in 
foreign currencies and forecasted intercompany sales 
denominated in foreign currencies, respectively.
In its application of hedge accounting, the Company assesses, 
both at inception and on a prospective basis, whether the 
derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly 
effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows or fair values 
of the hedged items. The Company also assesses hedge 
effectiveness on a retrospective basis every quarter with any 
hedge ineffectiveness recorded to the Consolidated Statements 
of Operations.
The Company uses forward contracts to mitigate the effects of 
changes in foreign exchange relating to certain of the Company’s 
intercompany and third-party receivables and payables. These 
derivative instruments generally are not formally designated as 
hedges and the terms of these instruments generally do not 
exceed three months. The fair values of these instruments are 
included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Current assets or 
Current liabilities, with changes in the fair value recognized in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations. The cash flows relating 
to these instruments are presented within Net cash provided by 
operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, 
unless the derivative instruments are economically hedging specific 
investing or financing activities.
Translation of foreign currency
The functional currency for most of the foreign subsidiaries is their 
local currency. For the non-U.S. subsidiaries that transact in a 
functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, assets and liabilities 
are translated at current rates of exchange at the balance sheet 
date. Income and expense items are translated at the average 
foreign exchange rates for the period. Adjustments resulting from 
the translation of the financial statements of the foreign operations 
into U.S. dollars are excluded from the determination of Net income 
and are recorded in AOCI, a separate component of equity. For 
subsidiaries where the functional currency of the assets and 
liabilities differ from the local currency, non-monetary assets and 
liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange in effect on the date 
assets were acquired while monetary assets and liabilities are 
translated at current rates of exchange as of the balance sheet 
date. Income and expense items are translated at the average 
foreign currency rates for the period. Translation adjustments of 
these subsidiaries are included in Other income/(expense), net.
Foreign currency exchange transaction (losses)/gains included 
in Consolidated Statements of Operations in the years ended 
December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $(97.3) million, 
$17.7 million and $(26.5) million, respectively.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes the cost of purchasing finished product 
for sale, the cost of raw materials and costs of manufacturing 
those products including shipping and handling costs, depreciation 
and amortization of intangible assets in respect of favorable 
manufacturing contracts. Royalties payable to third party 
intellectual property owners related to the sold products 
are also included in Cost of sales.
132 Shire Annual Report 2017 Research and development (R&D) expense
Research and development expenses consist of compensation 
and benefits, facilities and overhead expenses, clinical trial 
expenses and fees paid to contract research organizations (CROs), 
clinical supply and manufacturing expenses and upfront fees and 
milestones paid to collaborators. R&D expense also includes the 
impairment charges related to the IPR&D intangible assets.
Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. 
Payments that were made for research and development services 
prior to the services being rendered are recorded as Prepaid 
expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheets and are expensed as the services are provided. 
Management also accrues the costs of ongoing clinical trials 
associated with programs that have been terminated or 
discontinued for which there is no future economic benefit at the 
time the decision is made to terminate or discontinue the program.
Selling, general and administrative expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily 
comprised of compensation and benefits associated with sales and 
marketing, finance, human resources, legal, information technology 
and other administrative personnel, outside marketing, advertising 
and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs.
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs 
amounted to $210.3 million, $216.0 million and $56.1 million for 
the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Collaborative arrangements
The Company enters into collaborative arrangements to develop 
and commercialize drug candidates. These collaborative 
arrangements often require up-front, milestone, royalty or profit 
share payments, or a combination of these, with payments often 
contingent upon the success of the related development and 
commercialization efforts. Collaboration agreements entered into 
by the Company may also include expense reimbursements or 
other such payments to the collaborating partner. The Company 
records payments received from the collaborative partners for their 
share of the development costs as a reduction of research and 
development expense.
For collaborations with commercialized products, if the Company 
is the principal, it records revenue and the corresponding operating 
costs in their respective line items in the Consolidated Statements 
of Operations. If the Company is not the principal, it records 
operating costs as a reduction of revenue.
Leased assets
The costs of operating leases are charged to operations on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term, even if rental payments are 
not made on such a basis.
Assets acquired under capital leases are included in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets as property, plant and equipment 
and are depreciated over the shorter of the period of the lease or 
their useful lives. The capital element of future lease payments is 
recorded as a liability, while the interest element is charged to 
operations over the period of the lease to produce a level yield 
on the balance of the capital lease obligation.
Finance costs of debt
Financing costs relating to debt issued are recorded against the 
corresponding debt and amortized to the Consolidated Statements 
of Operations over the period to the earliest redemption date of the 
debt, using the effective interest rate method. On extinguishment 
of the related debt, any unamortized deferred financing costs are 
written off and charged to Interest expense in the Consolidated 
Statements of Operations.
Income taxes
The provision for income taxes includes Irish corporation tax, 
U.S. federal, state, local and other foreign taxes. Income taxes 
are accounted for under the liability method.
Uncertain tax positions are recognized in the consolidated financial 
statements for positions which are considered more likely than not 
of being sustained, based on the technical merits of the position 
on audit by the tax authorities. The measurement of the tax benefit 
recognized in the consolidated financial statements is based upon 
the largest amount of tax benefit that, in management’s judgment, 
is greater than 50% likely of being realized based on a cumulative 
probability assessment of the possible outcomes.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties relating to 
income taxes within Income taxes. Interest income on cash 
required to be deposited with the tax authorities is recognized 
within Interest income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
consolidated financial statements and the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts. 
The deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the 
enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which 
the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, 
in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some 
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is based upon net income attributable to 
the Company divided by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share 
is based upon net income attributable to the Company divided 
by the weighted average number of ordinary share equivalents 
outstanding during the period, adjusted for the dilutive effect of all 
potential ordinary shares equivalents that were outstanding during 
the year. Such potentially dilutive shares are excluded when the 
effect would be to increase diluted earnings per share or reduce 
the diluted loss per share.
Share-based compensation
The share-based compensation programs grant awards that 
include stock-settled share appreciation rights (SARs), stock 
options, performance share awards (PSAs), restricted stock units 
(RSUs) and performance share units (PSUs). The Company also 
operates a Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and Sharesave 
Plans in the UK and Ireland.
Share-based compensation represents the cost of share-based 
awards granted to employees. The Company measures share-
based compensation cost for awards classified as equity at the 
grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award. 
Predominantly all of the Company’s awards have service and/or 
performance conditions and the fair values of these awards are 
estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation model.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 
For share-based compensation awards which cliff vest, the 
Company recognizes the cost of the relevant share-based 
payment award as an expense on a straight-line basis (net of 
estimated forfeitures) over the employee’s requisite service period. 
For those share-based compensation awards with a graded 
vesting schedule, the Company recognizes the cost of the relevant 
share-based payment award as an expense on a straight-line basis 
(net of estimated forfeitures) over the requisite service period for 
the entire award (that is, over the requisite service period for the 
last separately vesting portion of the award). The share-based 
compensation expense is recorded in Cost of product sales, R&D, 
SG&A, Reorganization costs and Integration and Acquisition costs 
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations based on the 
employees’ respective functions.
The Company records deferred tax assets for awards that result 
in deductions on the Company’s income tax returns, based on the 
amount of compensation cost recognized and the Company’s 
statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which it will receive a 
deduction. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, 
differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial 
reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on the 
Company’s income tax returns were recorded in additional paid-in 
capital (if the tax deduction exceeds the deferred tax asset) or in 
the Consolidated Statements of Operations (if the deferred tax asset 
exceeds the tax deduction and no additional paid-in capital exists 
from previous awards). Following the adoption of new accounting 
guidance effective January 1, 2017 , for the year ended December 
31, 2017 , differences between the deferred tax assets and the actual 
tax deduction reported on the Company’s income tax returns were 
recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, including if 
the tax deduction exceeds the deferred tax asset. The Company’s 
share-based compensation plans are described in more detail in 
Note 27 , Share-based Compensation Plans.
New Accounting Pronouncements
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued 
by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or other 
standard setting bodies that the Company adopts as of the 
specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed below, 
the Company does not believe that the impact of recently issued 
standards that are not yet effective will have a material impact 
on the Company’s financial position or results of operations 
upon adoption.
Adopted during the current period
Inventory
In July 2015, the FASB issued new guidance which requires an 
entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable 
value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices 
in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable 
costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The Company 
adopted this standard as of January 1, 2017, which did not impact 
the Company’s financial position or results of operations.
Share-Based Payment Accounting
In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 
(ASU) No. 2016-09, Compensation — Stock Compensation 
(Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment 
Accounting. The new standard requires recognition of the income 
tax effects of vested or settled awards in the income statement 
and involves several other aspects of the accounting for share-
based payment transactions, including the income tax 
consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities 
and classification on the Statements of Cash Flows and allows a 
one-time accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as 
they occur. The new standard was effective January 1, 2017.
The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of 2017. 
Before adoption, excess tax benefits or deficiencies from the 
Company’s equity awards were recorded as Additional paid-in 
capital in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon adoption, the 
Company recorded any excess tax benefits or deficiencies from 
its equity awards in its Consolidated Statements of Operations in 
the reporting periods in which vesting or settlement occurs.
Amendments related to accounting for excess tax benefits have 
been adopted prospectively, resulting in recognition of excess tax 
benefits against Income taxes rather than Additional paid-in capital 
of $11.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.
As a result of the adoption, the Company recorded an adjustment 
to Retained earnings of $39.0 million to recognize net operating 
loss carryforwards attributable to excess tax benefits on stock 
compensation that had not been previously recognized to 
Additional paid-in capital.
Excess tax benefits for share-based payments are now included 
in Net cash provided by operating activities rather than Net cash 
provided by financing activities. The changes have been applied 
prospectively in accordance with the ASU and prior periods have 
not been adjusted.
Upon adoption of ASU 2016-09, the Company elected to account 
for forfeitures in relation to service conditions as they occur. The 
change was applied on a modified retrospective basis with a 
cumulative effect adjustment to Retained earnings of $10.7 million 
as of January 1, 2017.
Definition of a Business
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business 
Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. 
This new standard clarifies the definition of a business and 
provides guidance to determine when an integrated set of assets 
and activities is not a business. The Company adopted this 
standard prospectively on January 1, 2017.
To be adopted in future periods
Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles 
— Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test of Goodwill 
Impairment. This new standard simplifies how an entity is required 
to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the 
goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures a goodwill impairment 
loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s 
goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. This standard 
will be effective for the Company as of January 1, 2020, with early 
adoption permitted for annual goodwill impairment tests performed 
after January 1, 2017. The Company does not expect the adoption 
of this standard to have a material impact on its financial position 
and results of operations.
134 Shire Annual Report 2017 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue 
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes 
all existing revenue recognition requirements, including most 
industry-specific guidance. The new standard requires a 
company to recognize revenue when it transfers goods or 
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration 
that the company expects to receive for those goods or services. 
The new standard also requires additional qualitative and 
quantitative disclosures.
In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective 
Date, which delayed the effective date of the new standard from 
January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2018.
The FASB has subsequently issued five additional ASUs amending 
the guidance in Topic 606, each with the same effective date and 
transition date of January 1, 2018. This amended guidance has been 
considered in the Company’s overall assessment of Topic 606.
Shire will adopt this standard on January 1, 2018, using the 
modified retrospective transition method. The Company has 
identified two primary revenue streams from contracts with 
customers as part of its assessment: 1) product sales and 2) 
licensing arrangements.
The Company completed its assessment of implementing the 
new standard. The adoption of the new standard will not have a 
material impact to revenue recognition related to product revenue 
or licensing arrangements. The impact of the adoption will be 
recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment in the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity upon adoption on January 1, 
2018. Financial Instrument Accounting
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial 
Instruments — Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and 
Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. 
The new standard amends certain aspects of accounting and 
disclosure requirements of financial instruments, including the 
requirement that equity investments with readily determinable 
fair values be measured at fair value with changes in fair value 
recognized in the results of operations. This standard will be 
effective for the Company as of January 1, 2018. The adoption 
of this guidance will not have a material impact on its financial 
position and results of operations.
Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases 
(Topic 842). The new accounting guidance will require the 
recognition of all long-term lease assets and lease liabilities by 
lessees and sets forth new disclosure requirements for those lease 
assets and liabilities. The standard requires lessees to recognize 
right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet using 
a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest 
comparative period in the financial statements. This standard will 
be effective for the Company as of January 1, 2019. Early adoption 
is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential 
impact on its financial position and results of operations of 
adopting this guidance.
Statement of Cash Flows
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement 
of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts 
and Cash Payments. The new standard clarifies certain aspects 
of the statement of cash flows, and aims to reduce diversity in 
practice regarding how certain transactions are classified in the 
statement of cash flows. This standard will be effective for the 
Company as of January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. 
The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact 
on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of 
Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. The new guidance is 
intended to reduce diversity in the presentation of restricted cash 
and restricted cash equivalents in the statement. The guidance 
requires that restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be 
included as components of total cash and cash equivalents as 
presented on the statement of cash flows. This standard will be 
effective for the Company as of January 1, 2018. The adoption of 
this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company’s 
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Income Taxes
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income 
Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers Other than Inventory. 
This standard removes the current exception in U.S. GAAP 
prohibiting entities from recognizing current and deferred income 
tax expenses or benefits related to transfer of assets, other than 
inventory, within the consolidated entity. The current exception to 
defer the recognition of any tax impact on the transfer of inventory 
within the consolidated entity until it is sold to a third party remains 
unaffected. The Company will adopt the standard effective January 
1, 2018 using a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative-
effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the first quarter 
of 2018. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material 
impact on its financial position and results of operations.
Retirement Benefits Income Statement Presentation
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation — 
Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net 
Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit 
Cost. The standard amends the income statement presentation 
of the components of net periodic benefit cost for defined benefit 
pension and other postretirement plans. The standard requires 
entities to (1) disaggregate the current-service-cost component 
from the other components of net benefit cost (the “other 
components”) and present it with other current compensation 
costs for related employees in the income statement and (2) 
present the other components elsewhere in the income statement 
and outside of income from operations if such a subtotal is 
presented. The standard also requires entities to disclose the 
income statement lines that contain the other components if they 
are not presented on appropriately described separate lines. 
This standard will be effective for the Company as of January 1, 
2018. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact 
on its financial position and results of operations.
Share-Based Payment Accounting
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation — 
Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Modification Accounting. 
The new standard clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions 
of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as 
modifications. This standard will be effective for the Company as 
of January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of 
this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the 
Company’s financial position and results of operations.

Derivatives and Hedging
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives 
and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting 
for Hedging Activities. The standard amends its hedge accounting 
model to enable entities to better portray the economics of their 
risk management activities in the financial statements. The new 
guidance also expands an entity’s ability to hedge non-financial 
and financial risk components and reduces complexity in fair 
value hedges of interest rate risk. Additionally, it eliminates the 
requirement to separately measure and report hedge 
ineffectiveness, eases certain assessment requirements and 
modifies the accounting for components excluded from the 
assessment of hedge effectiveness. This standard will be effective 
for the Company as of January 1, 2019. Early adoption is 
permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the method of 
adoption and the potential impact on its financial position and 
results of operations of adopting this guidance.
3. Critical accounting estimates
The preparation of Financial Statements, in conformity with 
U.S. GAAP and SEC regulations, requires management to make 
estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported 
and disclosed amounts of assets, liabilities and equity at the date 
of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the period. On an on-going basis, 
the Company evaluates its estimates, judgments and 
methodologies. Estimates are based on historical experience, 
current conditions and on various other assumptions that are 
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form 
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of 
assets, liabilities and equity and the amounts of revenues and 
expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates under 
different assumptions or conditions.
Valuation of intangible assets, including In-process Research 
and Development (IPR&D)
In conjunction with the accounting for business combinations, 
the Company recorded intangible assets primarily related to 
commercially marketed products and IPR&D projects. The 
Company has intangible assets of $33,046.1 million as of December 
31, 2017 and $34,697.5 million as of December 31, 2016.
If the Company acquires an asset or group of assets that do not 
meet the definition of a business under applicable accounting 
standards, the acquired IPR&D is expensed on its acquisition date. 
Future costs to develop these assets are recorded to Research 
and development expense as they are incurred.
The identifiable intangible assets are measured at their respective 
fair values as of the acquisition date. When significant identifiable 
intangible assets are acquired, the Company engages an 
independent third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the 
fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. Discounted 
cash flow models are typically used in these valuations and the 
models used in valuing these intangible assets require the use of 
significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:
 • estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the 
products or product candidates;
 • the probability of success for unapproved product candidates 
considering their stages of development;
 • the time and resources needed to complete the development 
and approval of product candidates;
 • projecting regulatory approvals; and
 • developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates 
by project.
The Company believes the fair values used to record intangible 
assets acquired in connection with a business combination are 
based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts 
and circumstances as of the acquisition date.
Impairment and Amortization of Long-lived Assets, 
including intangible assets
Long-lived assets to be held and used include intangible assets 
and PP&E. PP&E and Intangible assets related to the Company’s 
commercially marketed products are reviewed for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. 
Management reviews intangible assets related to IPR&D product 
rights for impairment annually, as of October 1, and whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value of an asset may not be recoverable. When performing the 
impairment assessment, management calculates the fair value of 
the intangible assets using the same methodology as described 
above under “Valuation of intangible assets, including In-process 
Research and Development (IPR&D).” For PP&E, the Company 
uses a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value, 
including appraisals and discounted cash flow models, which 
estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of 
the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of long 
lived assets exceeds its fair value, then the asset is written-down 
to its fair value.
Intangible assets related to commercially marketed products 
are amortized over their estimated useful lives on an economic 
consumption method, or a straight-line basis when straight-line 
method approximates economic consumption method. Intangible 
assets related to IPR&D product rights are treated as indefinite-
lived intangible assets and not amortized until the product is 
approved for sale by regulatory authorities in specified markets. 
At that time, the Company will determine the useful life of the asset, 
reclassify the asset out of IPR&D and begin amortization.
If IPR&D projects are not successfully developed and/or the value 
of the commercially marketed products becomes impaired, fail 
during development, are abandoned or subject to significant delay 
or do not receive the relevant regulatory approvals, the Company 
may not realize the future cash flows that it has estimated nor 
recover the value of the initial or subsequent R&D investments 
made subsequent to acquisition of the asset project. If such 
circumstances occur, the Company’s future operating results 
could be materially adversely impacted.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred 
over the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed in a business combination. The Company has $19,831.7 
million and $17,888.2 million of goodwill as of December 31, 2017 
and 2016, respectively, as a result of accounting for business 
combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. 
The Company assesses the goodwill balance within its single 
reporting unit annually, as of October 1, and whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill 
may not be recoverable to determine whether any impairment in 
this asset may exist and, if so, the extent of such impairment. The 
Company reviews goodwill for impairment by assessing qualitative 
and quantitative factors, including comparing the market 
capitalization of the Company to the carrying value of its assets. 
Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation 
include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic 
factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive 
activities and acts by governments and courts.
136 Shire Annual Report 2017 The Company completed its annual impairment test in the fourth 
quarters of 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and determined in 
each of those periods that the carrying value of goodwill was not 
impaired. In each year, the fair value of the reporting unit, which 
includes goodwill, was significantly in excess of the carrying 
value of the reporting unit.
Revenue Recognition and Related Allowances
a. Product Revenue
The Company recognizes revenues from Product sales when 
there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery 
has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability 
is reasonably assured. The Company records Product sales net 
of sales deductions.
b. Other Revenue
Royalty income relating to licensed technology is generally 
recognized when the licensee sells the underlying product. The 
Company estimates sales amounts and related royalty income 
based on the historical product information. Estimates are revised 
pursuant to receiving sales information from the relevant licensee. 
If the Company is unable to reliably estimate the amount based on 
past experiences, the amount of royalty income is recorded when 
sales information from the relevant licensee is received.
c. Sales Deductions
Sales deductions consist primarily of statutory rebates to State 
Medicaid and other government agencies; Medicare Part D 
rebates; commercial rebates and fees to Managed Care 
Organizations (MCOs), Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs), 
distributors and specialty pharmacies; product returns; sales 
discounts (including trade discounts); distribution service fees; 
wholesaler chargebacks; and allowances for coupon and patient 
assistance programs. These deductions are recorded as 
reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales are 
recognized. Reserves are based on estimates of the amounts 
earned or to be claimed on the related sales. Estimates are based 
on the Company’s historical experience of existing or similar 
programs, current contractual and statutory requirements, 
specific known market events and trends, industry data and 
forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Additionally, 
certain rebates are based on annual purchase volumes which 
are not known until completion of the annual period on which 
they are based. As a result, the Company estimates the 
accruals and related reserves required for amounts payable 
under these programs.
If actual results vary, the Company may need to adjust these 
estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period 
of the adjustment.
Aggregate reserves for Medicaid and MCO rebates as of 
December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $1,612.7 million, $1,431.3 
million and $982.4 million or 11%, 13% and 16%, respectively, of 
Product sales. Historically, actual rebates have not varied 
significantly from the reserves provided.
d. Product Returns
The Company typically accepts customer product returns in 
the following circumstances: (a) expiration of shelf life on certain 
products; (b) product damaged while in the Company’s 
possession; (c) under sales terms that allow for unconditional 
return (guaranteed sales); or (d) following product recalls or product 
withdrawals. Generally, returns for expired product are accepted 
three months before and up to one year after expiration date of 
the relevant product and the returned product is destroyed. 
Depending on the product and the Company’s return policy 
with respect to that product, the Company may either refund the 
sales price paid by the customer by issuance of a credit, or 
exchange the returned product with replacement inventory. The 
Company typically does not provide cash refunds.
The Company estimates the proportion of recorded revenue that 
will result in a return by considering relevant factors, including but 
not limited to:
 • past product returns activity;
 • the duration of time taken for products to be returned;
 • the estimated level of inventory in the distribution channel;
 • product recalls and discontinuances;
 • the shelf life of products;
 • the launch of new drugs or new formulations; and
 • the loss of patent protection, exclusivity or new competition.
The accrual estimation process for product returns involves, in 
each case, a number of interrelating assumptions, which vary 
for each combination of product and customer.
As of December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015, reserves for product returns 
were $175.7 million, $1 18.4 million, and $128.3 million or 1.2%, 1. 1% 
and 2. 1%, respectively, of Product sales. Historically, actual returns 
have not varied significantly from the reserves provided.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and 
liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income 
taxes are calculated on reported pre-tax earnings based on 
current laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates 
on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which 
are the differences between the financial statement carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and 
the tax benefits of carryforwards. In the normal course of business, 
the Company is audited by the Irish and foreign tax authorities, and 
it is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due. 
These challenges primarily relate to the timing and amount of 
deductions and the transfer pricing in various tax jurisdictions. 
The Company believes its tax positions comply with applicable 
tax law and the Company intends to defend its positions.
In accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, management is 
required to develop estimates as to whether a tax benefit should 
be recognized in the consolidated financial statements, based 
on whether it is more likely than not that the technical merits of the 
position will be sustained based on audit by the tax authorities. 
In accounting for income tax uncertainties, management is 
required to make judgments in the determination of the unit of 
account, the evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information 
in respect of the tax position taken, together with the estimates of 
amounts that the Company may be required to pay in ultimate 
settlement with the tax authority.
Any outcome upon settlement that differs from the recorded 
provision for uncertain tax positions may result in a materially 
higher or lower tax expense in future periods, which could 
significantly impact the Company’s results of operations or financial 
condition. However, the Company does not believe it is possible 
to reasonably estimate the potential impact of any such change 
in assumptions, estimates or judgments and the resultant change, 
if any, in the Company’s provision for uncertain tax positions, as 
any such change is dependent on factors such as future changes 
in tax law or administrative practice, the amount and nature of 
additional taxes which may be asserted by the taxation authorities, 
and the willingness of the relevant tax authorities to negotiate a 
settlement for any such position.

3. Critical accounting estimates continued
The Company has significant deferred tax assets due to various 
tax attributes, including net operating losses (NOLs) and tax credits 
from Research and Development activities principally in the 
Republic of Ireland, the U.S., Switzerland, Belgium and Germany. 
The realization of these assets is not assured and is dependent on 
various factors. Management is required to exercise judgment in 
determining whether it is more likely than not that it would realize 
these deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation 
allowance, management weighs all available positive and negative 
evidence including cumulative losses in recent years, expectations 
of future taxable income, carry forward and carry back potential 
under relevant tax law, expiration period of tax attributes, taxable 
temporary differences, and prudent and feasible tax-planning 
strategies. A valuation allowance is established where there is 
an expectation that on the balance of probabilities management 
considers it is more likely than not that the relevant deferred tax 
assets will not be realized. If actual events differ from 
management’s estimates, or to the extent that these estimates 
are adjusted in the future, any changes to the valuation allowance 
could significantly impact the Company’s financial condition and 
results of operations.
Litigation and legal proceedings
The Company has a number of lawsuits pending. The Company 
recognizes loss contingency provisions for probable losses when 
management is able to reasonably estimate the loss. Estimates of 
losses may be developed substantially before the ultimate loss is 
known, and are therefore refined each accounting period as 
additional information becomes known. In instances where the 
Company is unable to develop a reasonable estimate of loss, no loss 
contingency provision is recorded at that time; however, disclosure 
would be made if the loss contingency is at least reasonably possible 
to occur. These estimates are reviewed quarterly and changed when 
expectations are revised. An outcome that deviates from the 
Company’s estimate may result in an additional expense (or credit) in 
a future accounting period. As of December 31, 2017 , provisions for 
litigation losses, insurance claims and other disputes totaled $76.2 
million (2016: $415.0 million). 
Contingent consideration payable
The fair value of the Company’s contingent consideration payable as 
of December 31, 2017 was $1,168.2 million (2016: $1,058.0 million).
Contingent consideration payable represents future milestones and 
royalties the Company may be required to pay in conjunction with 
various business combinations. The amounts ultimately payable by 
the Company are dependent upon the successful achievement of 
the relevant milestones and future net sales of the relevant products 
over the life of the milestone or royalty term, respectively.
The Company estimates the fair value of contingent consideration 
payable using the income approach, based on a discounted cash 
flow method. The discounted cash flow method uses inputs with 
values that may not be observable in a public trading market, 
including, but not limited to: the probability of, and period in which, 
the relevant milestone event is expected to be achieved; the amount 
of royalties that will be payable based on forecast net sales of the 
relevant products; and the discount rates to be applied in calculating 
the present values of the relevant milestone or royalty. Significant 
judgment is employed by the Company in developing these 
estimates and assumptions. If actual events differ from 
management’s estimates, or to the extent that these estimates are 
adjusted in the future, the Company’s financial condition and results 
of operations could be materially affected in the period of any such 
change of estimate.
Pension and other postemployment benefit (OPEB) plans
The valuation of the funded status and net periodic benefit cost 
is calculated using actuarial assumptions. These significant 
assumptions include the following:
 • interest rates used to discount pension and OPEB plan liabilities;
 • the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets;
 • rates of increases in employee compensation (used in estimating 
liabilities);
 • anticipated future healthcare costs (used in estimating the OPEB 
plan liability); and
 • other assumptions involving demographic factors such as 
retirement, mortality and turnover (used in estimating liabilities).
Selecting assumptions involves an analysis of both short-term 
and long-term historical trends and known economic and market 
conditions at the time of the measurement date. The use of 
different assumptions would result in different measures of the 
funded status and net cost. Actual results in the future could differ 
from expected results. A 50 basis points decrease in the discount 
rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other 
postretirement benefit expense of approximately $6.5 million and 
an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $108.2 
million. A 50 basis points increase in the discount rate would result 
in an annual decrease in pension and other postretirement benefit 
expense of approximately $7.3 million and an decrease in the 
benefit obligation of approximately $93.8 million The Company’s 
key assumptions are listed in Note 19,Retirement and Other Benefit 
Programs, to the consolidated financial statements.
Share-based compensation
The Company makes certain assumptions in order to value and 
record expense associated with awards made under the share-
based compensation arrangements. Changes in these 
assumptions may lead to variability with respect to the amount 
of expense recognized in connection with share-based payments.
The Company uses the Black-Scholes model to compute the 
estimated fair value of stock option awards. Using this model, 
fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to 
(i) expected volatility of stock price, (ii) the periods of time options 
are expected to be held prior to exercise (expected lives), (iii) 
expected dividend yield on common stock, and (iv) risk-free 
interest rates.
Restructuring costs
The Company has made estimates and judgments regarding 
the amount and timing of its restructuring expense and liability, 
including current and future period termination benefits and 
other exit costs to be incurred when related actions take place. 
Severance and other related costs are reflected in the Consolidated 
Statements of Operations as a component of Reorganization costs 
or Integration and acquisition costs. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates.
138 Shire Annual Report 2017 4. Business Combinations 
Acquisition of Baxalta
On June 3, 2016, Shire acquired all of the outstanding common 
stock of Baxalta for $18.00 per share in cash and 0.1482 Shire 
American Depository Shares (ADSs) per Baxalta share, or if a 
former Baxalta shareholder properly elected, 0.4446 Shire ordinary 
shares per Baxalta share. 
Baxalta was a global biopharmaceutical company that focused 
on developing, manufacturing and commercializing therapies for 
orphan diseases and underserved conditions in hematology, 
immunology and oncology.
The purchase price consideration for the acquisition of Baxalta 
was finalized in the second quarter of 2017. The fair value of the 
purchase price consideration consisted of the following:
Fair value
$’M
Cash paid to shareholders 12,366.7
Fair value of stock issued to shareholders 19,353.2
Fair value of partially vested stock  
options and RSUs assumed 508.8
Contingent consideration payable 165.0
Total purchase price consideration 32,393.7
The acquisition of Baxalta was accounted for as a business 
combination using the acquisition method of accounting. Shire 
issued 305.2 million shares to former Baxalta shareholders at the 
date of the acquisition. For a more detailed description of the fair 
value of the partially vested stock options and RSUs assumed, 
refer to Note 27, Share-based Compensation Plans, to the 
consolidated financial statements.
The assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from Baxalta have 
been recorded at their fair value as of June 3, 2016, the date of 
acquisition. The Company’s consolidated financial statements 
included the results of Baxalta from the date of acquisition. The 
amount of Baxalta’s post-acquisition revenues included in the 
Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year 
ended December 31, 2016 was $4,011.6 million. After the closing 
of the acquisition, the Company began integrating Baxalta and as 
such the combined business is now sharing various research and 
development and selling, general and administrative functions. As 
a result, computing a separate measure of Baxalta’s stand-alone 
profitability for periods after the acquisition date is not practical.
The purchase price allocation for the acquisition of Baxalta was 
finalized in the second quarter of 2017. The Company’s allocation 
of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
as of the acquisition date, including measurement period 
adjustments, is outlined below.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
4. Business Combinations continued 
The measurement period adjustments for Intangible assets reflect 
changes in the estimated fair value of currently marketed products 
and IPR&D. Changes are mainly related to finalizing the unit of 
account judgments and other changes in estimates including 
Cost of sales allocation and royalty expense. The measurement 
period adjustments for Inventory primarily reflect refinements 
in the estimated selling price of inventory. The changes in the 
estimated fair values primarily are to more accurately reflect 
market participant assumptions about facts and circumstances 
existing as of the acquisition date. The measurement period 
adjustments did not result from intervening events subsequent 
to the acquisition date.
As a result of measurement period adjustments related to the 
change in fair value of currently marketed products and inventory, 
a charge of $85.2 million was recognized in Cost of sales and a 
benefit of $23.3 million was recognized in Amortization of acquired 
intangible assets, respectively, in the Company’s Consolidated 
Statements of Operations. These adjustments would have been 
recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 if these 
adjustments had been recognized as of the acquisition date. 
Intangible assets
The fair value of the identifiable intangible assets has been 
estimated using an income approach, which is a valuation 
technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset 
based on market participant expectations of the incremental 
after tax cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining 
useful life. The useful lives for currently marketed products were 
determined based upon the remaining useful economic lives of 
the assets that are expected to contribute to future cash flows.
Currently marketed products totaling $21,165.0 million relate to 
intellectual property (IP) rights acquired for Baxalta’s currently 
marketed products. The estimated useful life of the intangible 
assets related to currently marketed products range from 6 to 
23 years (weighted average 21 years), with amortization being 
recorded on a straight-line basis.
IPR&D intangible assets totaling $160.0 million represent the value 
assigned to R&D projects acquired. The IPR&D intangible assets are 
capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets and 
will be subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment 
of the projects. Upon successful completion of each project, the 
Company will make a separate determination of the estimated useful 
life of the IPR&D intangible asset and the related amortization will be 
recorded as an expense over the estimated useful life. 
Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the 
development of those asset valuations include the estimated net 
cash flows for each year for each asset or product (including net 
revenues, cost of sales, R&D costs, selling and marketing costs, 
working capital/asset contributory asset charges and other cash 
flow assumptions), the appropriate discount rate to select in order 
to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the 
assessment of each asset’s life cycle, the potential regulatory and 
commercial success risks, competitive trends impacting the asset 
and each cash flow stream as well as other factors.
The discount rate used to arrive at the present value at the 
acquisition date of the IPR&D intangible assets was 9.5% to reflect 
the internal rate of return and incremental commercial uncertainty 
in the cash flow projections. No assurances can be given that the 
underlying assumptions used to prepare the discounted cash flow 
analysis will not change. For these and other reasons, actual 
results may vary significantly from estimated results.
Goodwill
Goodwill of $12,498.6 million, which is not deductible for tax 
purposes, includes the expected synergies that will result from 
combining the operations of Baxalta with Shire, intangible assets 
that do not qualify for separate recognition at the time of the 
acquisition, the value of the assembled workforce, and impacted 
by establishing a deferred tax liability for the acquired identifiable 
intangible assets which have no tax basis.
Contingent consideration
The Company acquired certain contingent obligations classified 
as contingent consideration related to Baxalta’s historical business 
combinations. Additional consideration is conditionally due upon 
the achievement of certain milestones related to the development, 
regulatory, first commercial sale and other sales milestones, which 
could total up to approximately $1.5 billion. The Company may also 
pay royalties based on certain product sales. The Company 
estimated the fair value of the assumed contingent consideration 
to be $165.0 million using a probability weighting approach that 
considered the possible outcomes based on assumptions related 
to the timing and probability of the product launch date, discount 
rates matched to the timing of first payment and probability of 
success rates and discount adjustments on the related cash flows. 
Inventory
The estimated fair value of work-in-process and finished goods 
inventory was determined utilizing the net realizable value, based 
on the expected selling price of the inventory, adjusted for 
incremental costs to complete the manufacturing process and for 
direct selling efforts, as well as for a reasonable profit allowance. 
The estimated fair value of raw material inventory was valued at 
replacement cost, which is equal to the value a market participant 
would pay to acquire the inventory.
The fair value adjustment related to inventory is expensed based 
on the expected product-specific inventory utilization, which is 
reviewed on a periodic basis and is recorded within Cost of sales 
in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Retirement plans
The Company assumed pension plans as part of the acquisition of 
Baxalta, including defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans 
in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, which had a net liability 
balance of $610.4 million. As of June 3, 2016, the Baxalta defined 
benefit pension plans had assets with a fair value of $358.5 million. 
Integration and acquisition costs
In the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company expensed 
$763.9 million relating to the acquisition and integration of Baxalta, 
which have been recorded within Integration and acquisition costs 
in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Refer to 
Note 6, Integration and Acquisition Costs, for further information 
regarding the Company’s Integration and acquisition costs for the 
year ended December 31, 2017.

Acquisition of Dyax
On January 22, 2016, Shire acquired all of the outstanding 
common stock of Dyax for $37.30 per share in cash. Under the 
terms of the merger agreement, former Dyax shareholders may 
receive additional value through a non-tradable contingent value 
right worth $4.00 per share, payable upon U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) approval of SHP643 (formerly DX-2930) in 
Hereditary Angioedema (HAE).
Dyax was a publicly-traded, Massachusetts-based rare disease 
biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development 
of plasma kallikrein (pKal) inhibitors for the treatment of HAE. 
Dyax’s most advanced clinical program was SHP643, a Phase 3 
program with the potential for improved efficacy and convenience 
for HAE patients. SHP643 has received Fast Track, Breakthrough 
Therapy, and Orphan Drug Designations by the FDA and has also 
received Orphan Drug status in the EU. Dyax’s sole marketed 
product, KALBITOR, is a pKal inhibitor for the treatment of acute 
attacks of HAE in patients 12 years of age and older.
The acquisition of Dyax was accounted for as a business 
combination using the acquisition method. The acquisition-date 
fair value consideration was $6,330.0 million, comprising cash paid 
on closing of $5,934.0 million and the fair value of the contingent 
value right of $396.0 million (maximum payable $646.0 million). 
The assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from Dyax have 
been recorded at their fair value as of January 22, 2016, the date 
of acquisition. The Company’s consolidated financial statements 
include the results of Dyax as of January 22, 2016. The amount 
of Dyax’s post-acquisition revenues included in the Company’s 
Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended 
December 31, 2016 is $77.1 million. After the closing of the 
acquisition, the Company began integrating Dyax and as such 
the combined business is now sharing various research and 
development and selling, general and administrative functions. 
As a result, computing a separate measure of Dyax’s stand-alone 
profitability for periods after the acquisition date is not practical.
The purchase price allocation for the acquisition of Dyax was 
finalized in the first quarter of 2017. The allocation of the total

intangible asset is capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived 
intangible assets and will be subject to impairment testing until 
completion or abandonment of the projects. The fair value of this 
IPR&D asset was estimated based on an income approach, using 
the present value of incremental after tax cash flows expected to 
be generated by this development project. The estimated cash 
flows have been probability adjusted to take into account the 
development stage of completion and the remaining risks and 
uncertainties surrounding the future development and 
commercialization.

Royalty rights
Intangible assets totaling $425.0 million relate to royalty rights 
arising from licensing agreements of a portfolio of product 
candidates. This portfolio includes two approved products, 
marketed by Eli Lilly & Company, and various development-stage 
products. Multiple product candidates with other pharmaceutical 
companies are in various stages of clinical development for which 
the Company is eligible to receive future royalties and/or milestone 
payments. 
The fair value of these royalty rights has been estimated using 
an income approach, based on the present value of incremental

The estimated useful lives of these royalty rights range from seven 
to nine years (weighted average eight years), with amortization 
being recorded on a straight-line basis.

5. Collaborative and Other Licensing Arrangements 
The Company is party to certain collaborative and licensing 
arrangements. In some of these arrangements, Shire and the 
licensee are both actively involved in the development and 
commercialization of the licensed product and have exposure 
to risks and rewards dependent on its commercial success.
Out-licensing arrangements
The Company has entered into various licensing arrangements 
where it has licensed certain product or intellectual property rights 
for consideration such as up-front payments, development 
milestones, sales milestones and/or royalty payments. Under the 
terms of these licensing arrangements, the Company may receive 
development milestone payments up to an aggregate amount 
of $10.3 million and sales milestones up to an aggregate amount 
of $91.0 million. The receipt of these substantive milestones is 
uncertain and contingent on the achievement of certain 
development milestones or the achievement of a specified level 
of annual net sales by the licensee. During the years ended 2017 
and 2016, the Company received cash related to up-front and 
milestone payments of $9.1 million and $10.5 million, respectively. 
During the years ended 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company 
recognized milestone income of $82.5 million, $17.4 million and 
$8.9 million, respectively, in other revenues, and $34.6 million, 
$63.0 million and $51.0 million, respectively, in product sales for 
shipment of product to the relevant licensee.
Collaboration and in-licensing arrangements
The Company is party to various collaborative and in-licensing 
arrangements. These agreements generally provide for 
commercialization rights to a product or products being developed 
by the counterparty, and in exchange often resulted in an upfront 
payment upon execution of the agreement and an obligation that 
the Company make future development, regulatory approval or 
commercial milestone payments as well as royalty payments. 
Under the terms of these licensing arrangements, the Company 
made an initial $47.5 million, $110.0 million and $nil upfront license 
payment and milestone payments during the years ended 2017, 
2016 and 2015, respectively, which were included in Research and 
development expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statements 
of Operations. As of the December 31, 2017, the Company had the 
potential to make future payments related to option fees and 
development, regulatory and commercialization milestones totaling 
up to $5.5 billion, excluding potential future royalty payments.
The following is a description of the Company’s significant 
collaboration agreements, including those that were acquired by 
the Company. The acquisition-date fair value of the collaboration 
agreements acquired from Baxalta was included in the IPR&D.
Rani Therapeutics LLC
In December 2017, Shire entered into a collaboration agreement 
with Rani Therapeutics, LLC (Rani) to conduct research on the use 
of the RANI PILL technology for oral delivery of Factor VIII (FVIII) 
therapy for patients with hemophilia A. The collaboration 
agreement grants Shire an exclusive option to negotiate a license 
to develop and commercialize the technology for delivery of FVIII 
therapy following completion of feasibility studies. Shire also made 
an equity investment in Rani.
142 Shire Annual Report 2017 Novimmune S.A.
In July 2017, Shire entered into a licensing agreement with 
Novimmune S.A. (Novimmune). The license grants Shire exclusive 
worldwide rights to develop and commercialize a bi-specific 
antibody in preclinical development for the treatment of hemophilia 
A and hemophilia A patients with inhibitors. Under the terms of the 
agreement, Shire will develop, and if approved, commercialize the 
product. Shire made an initial upfront license payment. Novimmune 
will be entitled to receive additional potential milestone payments 
based on clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones and 
single-digit royalties.
Parion Sciences Inc.
In May 2017, Shire entered into an agreement to license the 
exclusive worldwide rights to SHP659 (formerly known as P-321) 
from Parion Sciences Inc. (Parion). SHP659 is a Phase 2 
investigational epithelial sodium channel inhibitor for the potential 
treatment of dry eye disease in adults. Under the terms of the 
agreement, Shire will develop, and if approved, commercialize this 
compound. Shire made an initial upfront license payment. Parion 
will be entitled to receive additional potential milestone payments 
based on clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones and 
Parion has the option to co-fund through additional stages of 
development in exchange for enhanced tiered low double-digit 
royalties. In addition, Parion has the option to co-fund 
commercialization activities and participate in the financial 
outcome from those activities.
Pfizer Inc.
In July 2016, the Company licensed the global rights to all 
indications for SHP647 from Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) SHP647 is an 
investigational biologic being evaluated for the treatment of 
moderate-to-severe inflammatory bowel disease. Under the terms 
of the agreement, Pfizer received an upfront payment and is 
eligible to receive milestone payments based on clinical, regulatory 
and commercialization milestones and low double-digit royalties on 
any potential sales if the product is approved.
Precision BioSciences Inc.
In June 2016, the Company acquired a strategic immuno-oncology 
collaboration with Precision BioSciences Inc. (Precision). The 
Company acquired the collaboration through the acquisition of 
Baxalta. Together, Shire and Precision will develop chimeric 
antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies for up to six unique targets. 
On a product-by-product basis, following successful completion of 
early-stage research activities up to and including Phase 2 clinical 
trials, Shire will have exclusive option rights to complete late-stage 
development and worldwide commercialization. Precision is 
responsible for development costs for each target prior to option 
exercise. Precision also has the right to participate in the 
development and commercialization of any licensed products 
resulting from the collaboration through a 50/50 co-development 
and co-promotion option in the United States. Precision is eligible 
to receive option fees and milestone payments based on 
development, regulatory and commercialization milestones, in 
addition to future royalty payments.
Symphogen
In June 2016, the Company acquired a research, option and 
commercial agreement with Symphogen. The Company acquired 
the agreement through the acquisition of Baxalta. Under the 
terms of the agreement, Shire and Symphogen plan to develop 
checkpoint inhibitor therapies for up to six unique targets. On a 
product-by-product basis, following successful completion of 
early-stage research activities up to and including Phase 1 clinical 
trials, Shire will have exclusive option rights to complete late-stage 
development and worldwide commercialization. Symphogen is 
responsible for development costs for each target prior to such 
option exercise. Symphogen is eligible to receive milestone 
payments based on development, regulatory and commercialization 
milestones achieved after option exercise for all six proteins and 
future royalty payments.
Ipsen Bioscience Inc.
In June 2016, the Company acquired an exclusive license 
agreement with Ipsen Bioscience Inc.’s predecessor, Merrimack 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Merrimack) relating to the development and 
commercialization of ONIVYDE (nanoliposomal irinotecan injection) 
(nal-IRI). The Company acquired the agreement through the 
acquisition of Baxalta. The arrangement includes all potential 
indications for nal-IRI across all markets with the exception of the 
U.S. and Taiwan. The first indication being pursued is for the 
treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who were 
previously treated with gemcitabine-based therapy. Ipsen is eligible 
to receive milestone payments related to development, regulatory 
and commercialization milestones.
6. Integration and Acquisition Costs 
For the year ended December 31, 2017, Shire recorded Integration 
and acquisition costs of $894.5 million, primarily due to the 
acquisition and integration of Baxalta. A charge of $120.7 million 
relating to the change in fair value of contingent consideration 
payable is included in these costs. 
The Company entered its second phase of integration activities 
during 2017. The costs associated with this phase primarily related 
to headcount reduction as the Company advanced and completed 
certain activities related to exiting transition services agreements 
(TSA) with Baxter, integrating legal entities and rationalization of the 
Company’s manufacturing facilities. For further details on existing 
agreements with Baxter, refer to Note 28, Agreements 
and Transactions with Baxter, of these consolidated financial 
statements. The Company also drove savings through the 
continued prioritization of its research and development programs 
and continued consolidation of its commercial operations. 
The integration of Baxalta is estimated to be completed by 
mid to late 2019.
The Baxalta integration and acquisition costs include $211.6 million 
of employee severance and acceleration of stock compensation, 
$140.3 million of third-party professional fees, $89.9 million of 
expenses associated with facility consolidations and $231.7 million 
of asset impairments for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
The Company expects the majority of these expenses, except 
for certain costs related to facility consolidations, to be paid within 
12 months from the date the related expenses were incurred.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, Shire recorded Integration 
and acquisition costs of $883.9 million primarily related to the 
acquisition and integration of Dyax and Baxalta. These costs 
primarily consist of $463.4 million of employee severance and 
acceleration of stock compensation, $378.7 million of third-party 
professional fees, $58.1 million of contract terminations and a 
credit of $11.1 million relating to the change in fair value of

Viropharma, Dyax and Baxalta of $189.7 million, offset by a net 
credit relating to the change in the fair value of contingent 
consideration liabilities of $149.9 million. This net credit principally 
relates to the acquisition of Lumena, reflecting the agreement in 
the third quarter of 2015 to settle all future contingent milestones 
payable to former Lumena shareholders for a one-time cash 
payment of $90.0 million and the acquisition of Lotus Tissue 
Repair, Inc. reflecting a lower probability of success for the 
SHP608 asset (for the treatment of Dystrophic Epidermolysis 
Bullosa (DEB) as a result of certain preclinical toxicity findings.
7. Reorganization Costs 
The Company incurred Reorganization costs totaling $47.9 million 
during the year ended December 31, 2017. The costs primarily 
related to the planned closure of certain facilities and associated 
costs of $28.1 million and employee termination and other costs of 
$10.6 million. As of December 31, 2017, cash payments associated 
with these costs were not significant. Other restructuring charges 
recorded, which were not significant, during the year ended

during the year ended December 31, 2016. The costs primarily 
related to the planned closure of certain manufacturing facilities 
and associated asset impairments of $77.4 million and employee 
termination and other costs of $16.2 million. As of December 31, 
2016, cash payments associated with these costs were not 
significant. Other restructuring charges recorded, which were not 
significant for the year ended December 31, 2016, relate to the 
closure of other offices and the related employee relocation.
In October 2014, the Company announced its plans to relocate 
positions to Lexington, Massachusetts from its Chesterbrook, 
Pennsylvania site and establish Lexington as the Company’s U.S. 
operational headquarters in continuation of the One Shire efficiency 
program. During 2015, the Company incurred reorganization costs 
totaling $97.9 million, primarily related to employee involuntary 
termination benefits and other reorganization costs primarily 
related to the Company’s One Shire business reorganization. 
The One Shire reorganization was substantially completed as 
of December 31, 2015.
8. Results of Discontinued Operations 
Following the divestment of the Company’s DERMAGRAFT 
business in January 2014, the operating results associated with 
the DERMAGRAFT business have been classified as discontinued 
operations in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of 
Operations for all periods presented.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded 
a gain of $18.0 million (net of tax of $8.9 million), primarily related 
to legal contingencies related to the divested DERMAGRAFT 
business and the release of escrow to Shire.
In January 2017 , Shire entered into a final settlement agreement with 
the Department of Justice (DOJ) in the amount of $350.0 million, plus 
interest which was accrued in 2016 and paid during 2017 .
After the civil settlement with the DOJ was finalized, Shire and 
Advanced BioHealing Inc.’s (ABH) equity holders entered into a 
settlement agreement and ABH’s equity holders released the $37.5 
million escrow to Shire. Shire released the claims against ABH 
equity holders upon receiving the entire amount held in escrow.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded 
a loss of $276.1 million (net of tax benefit of $98.8 million), primarily 
related to legal contingencies related to the divested 
DERMAGRAFT business.
During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded 
a loss from discontinued operations of $34.1 million (net of tax 
benefit of $18.9 million), primarily relating to a change in estimate 
in relation to reserves for onerous leases retained by the Company.

Marketable equity and debt securities are included within 
Investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contingent 
consideration payable is included within Other current liabilities and 
Other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
For information regarding the Company’s derivative arrangements, 
refer to Note 16, Financial Instruments, to these consolidated 
financial statements.
Certain estimates and judgments were required to develop the fair 
value amounts. The estimated fair value amounts shown above are 
not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would 
realize upon disposition, nor do they indicate the Company’s intent 
or ability to dispose of the financial instrument.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate 
the fair value of each material class of financial instrument:
 • Marketable equity securities: the fair values of marketable equity 
securities are estimated based on quoted market prices for 
those investments.
 • Marketable debt securities: the fair values of debt securities 
are obtained from pricing services or broker/dealers who either 
use quoted prices in an active market or proprietary pricing 
applications, which include observable market information for 
like or same securities.
 • Derivative instruments: the fair values of the swap and forward 
foreign exchange contracts have been determined using the 
month-end interest rate and foreign exchange rates, 
respectively.
 • Joint venture net written option and contingent consideration 
payable: the fair value of the contingent consideration payable 
has been estimated using the income approach (using a 
probability weighted discounted cash flow method).
There were no changes in valuation techniques or inputs utilized or 
transfers between fair value measurement levels during the years 
ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

In 2017, the increase in contingent consideration payable was 
primarily related to the Company’s change in fair value of 
contingent consideration resulting from positive topline data for 
SHP643. In 2016, the increase in contingent consideration payable 
was related to the Company’s acquisition of Dyax and Baxalta. 
Other contingent consideration payable primarily relates to foreign 
currency adjustments.
Of the $1,168.2 million of contingent consideration payable as of 
December 31, 2017, $626.8 million is recorded within Other current 
liabilities and $541.4 million is recorded within Other non-current 
liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Joint venture net written option
In March 2017, Shire executed option agreements related to a joint 
venture that provides Shire with a call option on the partner’s 
investment in joint venture equity and the partner with a put option 
on its investment in joint venture equity. The Company had a 
liability of $40.0 million for the net written option based on the 
estimated fair value of these options as of December 31, 2017 and 
the Company re-measures the instrument to fair value through the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

the fair value hierarchy. The estimated fair value of capital lease 
obligations is based on Level 2 inputs.
The carrying amounts of other financial assets and liabilities 
approximate their estimated fair value due to their short-term 
nature, such as liquidity and maturity of these amounts, or because 
there have been no significant changes since the asset or liability 
was last re-measured to fair value on a non-recurring basis.

16. Financial Instruments 
Foreign Currency Contracts
Due to the global nature of its operations, portions of the 
Company’s revenues and operating expenses are recorded in 
currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The value of revenues and 
operating expenses measured in U.S. dollars is therefore subject 
to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The main trading 
currencies of the Company are the U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound 
sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen.
Transactional exposure arises where transactions occur in 
currencies different to the functional currency of the relevant 
subsidiary. It is the Company’s policy that these exposures are 
minimized to the extent practicable by denominating transactions 
in the subsidiary’s functional currency. Where significant exposures 
remain, the Company uses foreign exchange contracts (spot, 
forward and swap contracts) to manage the exposure for balance 
sheet assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies 
different to the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary.
The Company has master netting agreements with a number of 
counterparties to these foreign exchange contracts and on the 
occurrence of specified events, the Company has the ability to 
terminate contracts and settle them with a net payment by one 
party to the other. The Company has elected to present derivative 
assets and derivative liabilities on a gross basis in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet. The Company does not have credit risk related 
contingent features or collateral linked to the derivatives.
Designated Foreign Currency Derivatives
Certain foreign currency forward contracts were designated as 
cash flow hedges and accordingly, to the extent effective, any 
unrealized gains or losses on these foreign currency forward 
contracts were reported in AOCI. Realized gains and losses for 
the effective portion of such contracts were recognized in revenue 
or cost of sales when the sale of product in the currency being 
hedged was recognized. To the extent ineffective, hedge 
transaction gains and losses were reported in Other income/
(expense), net.
The Company did not have any designated foreign currency 
contracts as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, the 
Company had designated foreign currency forward contracts with 
a total notional value of $78.7 million with a maximum duration of 
six months; the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of 
$4.2 million.
Undesignated Foreign Currency Derivatives
The Company uses forward contracts to mitigate the foreign 
currency risk related to certain balance sheet positions, including 
intercompany and third-party receivables and payables. The 
Company has not elected hedge accounting for these derivative 
instruments as the duration of these contracts is typically three 
months or less. The changes in fair value of these derivatives are 
reported in earnings.
The table below presents the notional amount, maximum duration 
and fair value for the undesignated foreign currency derivatives:
December 31,

2016
$’M
Notional amount 1,672.3 1,309.1
Maximum duration (in months) 3 months 3 months
Fair value — net asset 11.4 6.7
The Company considers the impact of its and its counterparties’ 
credit risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as the ability of 
each party to execute its contractual obligations. As of December 
31, 2017, credit risk did not materially change the fair value of the 
Company’s foreign currency contracts.
Interest Rate Contracts
The Company is exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash 
flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in benchmark 
interest rates relating to its debt obligations on which interest is set 
at floating rates. The Company’s policy is to manage this risk to an 
acceptable level. The Company is principally exposed to interest 
rate risk on any borrowings under the Company’s various debt 
facilities and on part of the senior notes assumed in connection 
with the acquisition of Baxalta. Interest on each of these debt 
obligations is set at floating rates, to the extent utilized. Shire’s 
exposure under these facilities is to changes in U.S. dollar interest 
rates. For further details related to interest rates on the Company’s 
various debt facilities, refer to Note 18, Borrowings and Capital 
Leases, to these consolidated financial statements.
Designated Interest Rate Derivatives
As of December 31, 2017, interest rate swap contracts designated 
as fair value hedges were outstanding. The effective portion of 
the changes in the fair value of interest rate swap contracts are 
recorded as a component of the underlying Baxalta Notes with the 
ineffective portion recorded in Interest expense. Any net interest 
payments made or received on the interest rate swap contracts 
are recognized as a component of Interest expense in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The majority of the Company’s pension and OPEB plans were assumed with the acquisition of Baxalta on June 3, 2016.
The Company amended the OPEB and adopted a plan freeze effective December 31, 2017. According to the amendment, employees 
who have not met certain criteria, may not qualify as an eligible retiree regardless of such employee’s age or service at the employee’s 
date of termination. As a result, a prior service credit was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017.
On December 31, 2016, the Company amended the U.S. pension plan which eliminated the estimate of future compensation levels 
beyond December 31, 2017, the effective date. As a result, a curtailment gain of $69.4 million was recorded during 2016.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, Other primarily represents the recognition of additional defined benefit plan in Switzerland.
Accumulated Benefit Obligation Information
The pension obligation represents the projected benefit obligation (PBO) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The PBO incorporates 
assumptions relating to future compensation levels. The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) is the same as the PBO except that it does 
not include assumptions relating to future compensation levels. The ABO as of December 31, 2017 for the U.S. pension plans was $443.6 
million (December 31, 2016: $373.2 million). The ABO as of December 31, 2017 for the International pension plans was $494.2 million 
(December 31, 2016: $457.9 million).
The funded status figures and ABO disclosed above reflect all of the Company’s pension plans. The following ABO and plan asset 
information includes only those individual plans that have an ABO in excess of plan assets.

The Company establishes the expected return on plan assets 
assumption based primarily on a review of historical compound 
average asset returns, both Company-specific and the broad market 
(and considering the Company’s asset allocations), an analysis of 
current market and economic information and future expectations.
The effect of a one-percent change in the assumed healthcare 
cost trend rate would not have a significant impact on the OPEB 
plan benefit obligation as of December 31, 2017 or the plan’s 
service and interest cost during 2017.
Pension Plan Assets
A committee of members of senior management is responsible 
for supervising, monitoring and evaluating the invested assets of 
the Company’s funded pension plans. The committee abides by 
policies and procedures relating to investment goals, targeted 
asset allocations, risk management practices, allowable and 
prohibited investment holdings, diversification, use of derivatives, 
the relationship between plan assets and benefit obligations, and 
other relevant factors and considerations. In the United States, 
Goldman Sachs Asset Management acts as an outsourced chief 
investment officer (oCIO) to perform the day-to-day management 
of pension assets.
The policies and procedures include the following:
 • Ability to pay all benefits when due;
 • Targeted long-term performance expectations relative to 
applicable market indices, such as Standard & Poor’s, 
Russell, MSCI EAFE, and other indices;
 • Targeted asset allocation percentage ranges (summarized 
below), and periodic reviews of these allocations;
 • Specified investment holding and transaction prohibitions 
(for example, private placements or other restricted securities, 
securities that are not traded in a sufficiently active market, 
short sales, certain derivatives, commodities and margin 
transactions);
 • Specified portfolio percentage limits on foreign holdings; and
 • Periodic monitoring of oCIO performance and adherence to 
policies.
Plan assets are invested using a total return investment approach 
whereby a mix of equity securities, debt securities and other 
investments are used to preserve asset values, diversify risk and 
exceed the planned benchmark investment return. Investment 
strategies and asset allocations are based on consideration of plan 
liabilities, the plans’ funded status and other factors, such as the 
plans’ demographics and liability durations. Investment 
performance is reviewed on a quarterly basis and asset allocations 
are reviewed at least annually.
Plan assets are managed in a balanced equity and fixed income 
portfolio. The target allocations for plan assets are 75% in an equity 
portfolio and 25% in a fixed income portfolio. The policy includes 
an allocation range based on each individual investment type 
within the major portfolios that allows for a variance from the target 
allocations of approximately 5%. The equity portfolio may include 
common stock of U.S. and international companies, common/
collective trust funds, mutual funds, hedge funds and real asset 
investments. The fixed income portfolio may include cash, money 
market funds with an original maturity of three months or less, U.S. 
and foreign government and governmental agency issues, 
common/collective trust funds, corporate bonds, municipal 
securities, derivative contracts and asset-backed securities.
While the committee provides oversight over plan assets for U.S. 
and international plans, the summary above is specific to the plans 
in the U.S. The plan assets for international plans are managed and 
allocated by the entities in each country, with input and oversight 
provided by the committee.
The following pension assets are recorded at fair value on a 
recurring basis using quoted prices in active markets for identical 
assets (Level 1); significant other observable inputs (Level 2); and 
significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). Investments that are 
measured at fair value using the net asset value per share or its 
equivalent as a practical expedient are not classified in the fair 
value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table is 
intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy and the 
fair value of plan assets.

19. Retirement and Other Benefit Programs continued 
The assets and liabilities of the Company’s pension plans are valued using the following valuation methods:
Investment category Valuation methodology
Cash and cash  
equivalents
These largely consist of a short-term investment fund, U.S. dollars and foreign currency. The fair value of the short-term investment 
fund is based on the net asset value
Government  
agency issues
Values are based on quoted prices in an active market
Corporate bonds Values are based on the valuation date in an active market
Common stock Values are based on the closing prices on the valuation date in an active market
Mutual funds Values are based on the net asset value of the units held in the respective fund which are obtained from active markets or as reported 
by the fund managers
Collective trust funds  
and hedge funds
Values are based on the net asset value of the units held at year end
Real estate funds The value of these assets are either determined by the net asset value of the units held in the respective fund which are obtained from 
active markets or based on the net asset value of the underlying assets of the fund provided by the fund manager
Other holdings These primarily consist of insurance contracts whose value is based on the underlying assets and other holdings valued primarily 
based on reputable pricing vendors that typically use pricing matrices or models
Expected Pension and OPEB Plan Funding
The Company’s funding policy for its pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements, plus any 
additional amounts that the Company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plans, tax deductibility, 
the cash flows generated by the Company, and other factors. Volatility in the global financial markets could have an unfavorable impact 
on future funding requirements.
The Company had no obligation to fund its principal plans in the U.S. for the year ended December 31, 2017 and did not make any voluntary 
contributions for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Company is expected to make cash contributions of at least $13.0 million 
during 2018. During 2017 and 2016, the Company contributed to its international plans $20.6 million and $7 .1 million, respectively and expects 
to make cash contributions of at least $18.6 million during 2018. Cash outflows related to OPEB plan were less than $1.0 million during the 
year ended December 31, 2017 and the Company expects to have less than $1.0 million cash outflows during 2018. 
The Company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions, which could be significant in any period.
The table below details the funded status percentage of the Company’s pension plans as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 including 
certain plans that are unfunded in accordance with the guidelines of the Company’s funding policy outlined above.

U.S. Defined Contribution Plans
In addition to benefits provided under the pension and OPEB plans described above, the Company provides benefits under defined 
contribution plans. The Company’s most significant defined contribution plans are in the United States. The Company recognized expenses 
related to U.S. defined contribution plans of $60.0 million, $68.1 million and $38.9 million during 2017 , 2016 and 2015, respectively.

On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act (Tax Act) into legislation. We have recorded a tax benefit 
of $2.5 billion, related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets 
and liabilities offset by a tax expense of $90.0 million relating to the 
impact of the transition tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign 
income. Due to enactment late in the Company’s annual reporting 
period, the Company was unable to obtain all of the requisite 
information and perform computations for all consequences of the 
Tax Act. In addition, it is expected that significant guidance will be 
issued that may change how the Company has computed the 
provisional amounts included in its annual financial statements for 
the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company will continue to 
assess the impact of the Tax Act during the measurement period 
and will record any adjustments to its provisional estimates as 
needed during 2018.
The Company determines the amount of income tax expense or 
benefit allocable to continuing operations using the incremental 
approach. The amount of income tax attributed to discontinued 
operations is disclosed in Note 8, Results of Discontinued 
Operations, in these consolidated financial statements.
The reconciliation of income from continuing operations before 
income taxes and equity in earnings/(losses) of equity method

1  In addition to being subject to the Irish corporation tax rate of 25.0% in 2017, 
the Company is also subject to income tax in other territories in which the 
Company operates, including: Canada (15.0%); France (33.3%); Germany 
(15.0%); Italy (24.0%); Japan (23.4%); Luxembourg (19.0%); the Netherlands 
(25.0%); Belgium (33.99%); Singapore (17.00%); Spain (25.0%); Sweden 
(22.0%); Switzerland (8.5%); United Kingdom (19.3%) and the U.S. (35.0%). 
The rates quoted represent the statutory federal income tax rates in each 
territory, and do not include any state taxes or equivalents or surtaxes or 
other taxes charged in individual territories, and do not purport to represent 
the effective tax rate for the Company in each territory.
2  Intra-group items principally relate to the effect of intra-territory eliminations, 
the pre-tax effect of which has been eliminated in arriving at the Company’s 
consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes, 
noncontrolling interests, and equity in earnings/(losses) of equity method 
investees. The Company’s intra-group items primarily arise from its acquisition 
of third parties that result in income and expense being received and taxed in 
different jurisdictions at various tax rates.
3  The expense from the difference in taxation rates reflects the impact of the 
higher income tax rates in the United States offset by the impact of lower 
foreign jurisdiction income tax rates.
 159 Shire Annual Report 2017
 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 22. Taxation continued 
As detailed in the income tax rate reconciliation above, the 
Company’s effective tax rate differs from the Irish statutory rate 
each year due to foreign taxes that are different than the Irish 
statutory rate and certain operations that are subject to tax 
incentives. In addition, the effective tax rate can be impacted 
each period by certain discrete factors and events, which, in 
2017, included items related to U.S. tax reform.
Provisions for uncertain tax positions
The Company files income tax returns in the Republic of Ireland, 
the U.S. (both federal and state) and various other jurisdictions 
(see footnote 1 to the table above for major jurisdictions). With few 
exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax 
examinations by tax authorities for years before 2013. Tax 
authorities in various jurisdictions are in the process of auditing the 
Company’s tax returns for fiscal periods primarily after 2012, with 
the earliest being 2007; these tax audits cover primarily transfer 
pricing, but may include other areas.
While tax audits remain open, the Company also considers it 
reasonably possible that issues may be raised by tax authorities 
resulting in increases to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits, 
however, an estimate of such an increase cannot be made.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of 
unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

There is no requirement to record any reserves or other 
contingencies related to the receipt of the break fee from 
AbbVie in 2014. The relevant tax return was submitted on 
September 23, 2015.
The Company does not anticipate any material changes in the 
next 12 months to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits 
recorded as of December 31, 2017. As of the balance sheet date, 
the Company believes that its reserves for uncertain tax positions 
are adequate to cover the resolution of these audits. However, 
the resolution of these audits could have a significant impact on 
the financial statements if the settlement differs from the 
amount reserved.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related 
to unrecognized tax positions within income taxes. During the 
years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company 
recognized a charge/(credit) to income taxes of ($14.2 million), 
$4.2 million and $0.8 million in interest and penalties and the 
Company had a liability of $16.5 million, $30.8 million and 
$26.5 million for the payment of interest and penalties accrued 
as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company had a valuation allowance 
of $635.7 million (2016: $569.4 million; 2015: $416.1 million) to 
reduce its deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value. These 
valuation allowances related primarily to operating losses, capital 
losses, and tax-credit carry-forwards in Switzerland (2017: $200.0 
million; 2016: $176.8 million; 2015: $131.5 million); U.S. (2017: 
$148.9 million; 2016: $155.1 million; 2015: $125.9 million); Ireland 
(2017: $22.3 million; 2016: $22.4 million; 2015: $22.2 million); and 
other foreign tax jurisdictions (2017: $264.5 million; 2016: $215.1 
million; 2015: $136.5 million).
Financial statements
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
160 Shire Annual Report 2017 Management is required to exercise judgment in determining whether 
deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized. A valuation 
allowance is established where there is an expectation that on the 
balance of probabilities management considers it is more likely than 
not that the relevant deferred tax assets will not be realized. In 
assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management weighs 
all available positive and negative evidence including cumulative 
losses in recent years, projections of future taxable income, carry 
forward and carry back potential under relevant tax law, expiration 
period of tax attributes, taxable temporary differences, and prudent 
and feasible tax-planning strategies.
The net increase in valuation allowances of $66.3 million includes 
(i) increases of $81.4 million relating to operating losses in various 
jurisdictions for which management considers that there is 
insufficient positive evidence related to the factors described 
above to overcome negative evidence, such as cumulative losses 
and expiration periods and therefore it is more likely than not that 
the relevant deferred tax assets will not be realized in full, and 
(ii) decreases of $15.1 million primarily related to U.S. state tax 
losses, which based on the assessment of factors described 
above now provides sufficient positive evidence to support the 
losses are more likely than not to be realized.
As of December 31, 2017, based upon a consideration of the 
factors described above management believes it is more likely than 
not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible 
differences, net of the valuation allowances. However, the amount 
of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted 
in the future if these factors are revised in future periods.
The approximate tax effect of NOLs, capital losses and tax credit 
carry-forwards as of December 31, are as follows:

The Company does not provide for deferred taxes on the excess 
of the financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in foreign 
subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration. As of 
December 31, 2017, that excess totaled $14.4 billion (2016: $16.6 
billion). On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed tax reform 
legislation (HR 1) which includes a broad range of tax reform 
proposals affecting businesses, including the payment of a 
one-time tax or “toll charge” on previously unremitted earnings 
of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. Accordingly, the Company will no 
longer assert that any of the earnings that will be taxed as part of 
the toll charge are indefinitely reinvested (approximately $7.6 billion). 
23. Segment Reporting 
Shire comprises one operating and reportable segment engaged 
in the research, development, licensing, manufacturing, marketing, 
distribution and sale of innovative specialist medicines to meet 
significant unmet patient needs. This is consistent with how the 
financial information is viewed for the purposes of evaluating 
performance, allocating resources, and planning and forecasting 
future periods and how the operations are managed by the 
Executive Committee (Shire’s chief operating decision maker).
This segment is supported by several key functions: a Pipeline 
Committee, an In-Line Committee, a Technical Operations group 
and a Corporate group. The Pipeline Committee consists of R&D 
and Corporate Development and is responsible for prioritizing 
the activities towards progressing and acquiring development 
programs across a variety of therapeutic areas. The Technical 
Operations group is responsible for the Company’s global supply 
chain. The In-line Committee focuses on commercializing marketed 
products and support of the development of the Company’s 
pipeline candidates. The business is also supported by a simplified, 
centralized corporate function group. None of these functional 
groups meets all of the criteria to be considered an individual

2015, respectively, which is predominately included in Cost of sales 
and SG&A expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statement 
of Operations.
Letters of credit and guarantees
As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company 
had irrevocable standby letters of credit and guarantees with various 
banks and insurance companies totaling $224.8 million and $139.7 
million (being the contractual amounts), respectively, providing 
security for the Company’s performance of various obligations. 
These obligations are primarily in respect of the recoverability of 
insurance claims, lease obligations and supply commitments. 
Commitments
Clinical testing
As of December 31, 2017, the Company had committed to pay 
approximately $1,409.9 million (December 31, 2016: $1,037.4 
million) to contract vendors for administering and executing clinical 
trials. The timing of these payments is dependent upon actual 
services performed by the organizations as determined by patient 
enrollment levels and related activities.
Contract manufacturing
As of December 31, 2017, the Company had committed to pay 
approximately $467.2 million (December 31, 2016: $528.9 million) 
in respect of contract manufacturing. The Company expects to 
pay $216.5 million of these commitments in 2018.
Other purchasing commitments
As of December 31, 2017, the Company had committed to 
pay approximately $1,692.5 million (December 31, 2016: 
$1,745.4 million) for future purchases of goods and services,

Capital commitments
As of December 31, 2017 , the Company had committed to spend 
$328.2 million (December 31, 2016: $100.5 million) on capital projects.
Baxter related tax indemnification
Baxter International Inc. (Baxter) and Baxalta entered into a tax 
matters agreement, effective on the date of Baxalta’s separation 
from Baxter, which employs a direct tracing approach, or where 
direct tracing approach is not feasible, an allocation methodology, 
to determine which company is liable for pre-separation income tax 
items for U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. With respect to 
tax liabilities that are directly traceable or allocated to Baxalta but 
for which Baxalta was not the primary obligor, Baxalta recorded a 
tax indemnification amount that would be due to Baxter upon 
Baxter discharging the associated tax liability to the taxing authority.
25. Legal and Other Proceedings 
The Company expenses legal costs when incurred.
The Company recognizes loss contingency provisions for probable 
losses when management is able to reasonably estimate the loss. 
When the estimated loss lies within a range, the Company records 
a loss contingency provision based on its best estimate of the 
probable loss. If no particular amount within that range is a better 
estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount is recorded. 
Estimates of losses may be developed before the ultimate loss is 
known, and are therefore refined each accounting period as 
additional information becomes known. An outcome that deviates 
from the Company’s estimate may result in an additional expense 
or release in a future accounting period. As of December 31, 2017, 
provision for litigation losses, insurance claims and other disputes 
totaled $76.2 million (December 31, 2016: $415.0 million).
The Company’s principal pending legal and other proceedings are 
disclosed below. The outcomes of these proceedings are not 
always predictable and can be affected by various factors. For 
those legal and other proceedings for which it is considered at least 
reasonably possible that a loss has been incurred, the Company 
discloses the possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of the 
recorded loss contingency provision, if any, where such excess is 
both material and estimable.
MYDAYIS
On October 12, 2017, Shire was notified that Teva Pharmaceuticals 
USA, Inc. had submitted an abbreviated new drug application 
(ANDA) to the FDA seeking permission to market a generic version 
of MYDAYIS. Within the requisite 45-day period, Shire filed a 
lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against 
Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., Actavis Laboratories, Inc. and 
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (collectively the “Teva 
entities”). No dates for a Markman hearing or trial have been set.
Petitions to institute inter partes reviews (IPRs) against U.S. Patent 
numbers 8,846,100 and 9,173,857 were filed by KVK Tech. Both of 
these patents are listed in the Orange Book as covering MYDAYIS 
and are among the patents-in-suit in the infringement action 
brought against the Teva entities as noted above. A decision on 
whether to institute the IPRs is expected on or before July 10, 
2018. If one or both IPRs are instituted, a decision on the merits 
is expected on or before July 10, 2019.

LIALDA
In May 2010, Shire was notified that Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA, 
Inc. (Zydus) had submitted an ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act 
seeking permission to market a generic version of LIALDA. Within 
the requisite 45-day period, Shire filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District 
Court for the District of Delaware against Zydus and Cadila 
Healthcare Limited, doing business as Zydus Cadila. A Markman 
hearing took place on January 29, 2015 and a Markman ruling was 
issued on July 28, 2015. A trial took place between March 28, 2016 
and April 1, 2016. On September 16, 2016 the court issued its 
ruling finding that the proposed generic product would not infringe 
the asserted claims. Shire appealed the ruling to the Court of 
Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC). On May 9, 2017, the CAFC 
affirmed the ruling of the district court. Zydus’ ANDA has been 
approved and the generic product is now available in the U.S.
In February 2012, Shire was notified that Osmotica Pharmaceutical 
Corporation (Osmotica) had submitted an ANDA under the 
Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market a generic 
version of LIALDA. Within the requisite 45-day period, Shire filed a 
lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia 
against Osmotica. A Markman hearing took place on August 22, 
2013 and a Markman ruling was issued on September 25, 2014. 
The court issued an Order on February 27, 2015 in which all dates 
in the scheduling order were stayed. Osmotica’s ANDA was 
withdrawn as of March 31, 2017 and the case was dismissed.
In March 2012, Shire was notified that Watson Laboratories 
Inc.-Florida had submitted an ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman 
Act seeking permission to market a generic version of LIALDA. 
Within the requisite 45-day period, Shire filed a lawsuit in the U.S. 
District Court for the Southern District of Florida against Watson 
Laboratories Inc.-Florida and Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 
Watson Pharma, Inc. and Watson Laboratories, Inc. (collectively, 
“Watson”) were subsequently added as defendants. A trial took 
place in April 2013 and on May 9, 2013 the trial court issued a 
decision finding that the proposed generic product infringes the 
patent-in-suit and that the patent is not invalid. Watson appealed 
the trial court’s ruling to the CAFC and a hearing took place on 
December 2, 2013. The ruling of the CAFC was issued on March 
28, 2014 overruling the trial court on the interpretation of two claim 
terms and remanding the case for further proceedings. Shire 
petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari which was 
granted on January 26, 2015. The Supreme Court also vacated 
the CAFC decision and remanded the case to the CAFC for further 
consideration in light of the Supreme Court’s recent decision in 
Teva v. Sandoz. On June 3, 2015, the CAFC reaffirmed their 
previous decision to reverse the District Court’s claims 
construction and remanded the case to the U.S. District Court for 
the Southern District of Florida. A trial was held on January 25-27, 
2016. A ruling was issued on March 28, 2016 upholding the validity 
of the patent and finding that Watson’s proposed ANDA product 
infringes the patent-in-suit. Watson appealed the ruling to the 
CAFC and oral argument took place on October 5, 2016. The 
CAFC issued a ruling on February 10, 2017 reversing the trial 
court’s ruling of infringement and remanding the case to the lower 
court for entry of a ruling of non-infringement. On May 18, 2017, 
the lower court entered judgment of non-infringement.
In April 2012, Shire was notified that Mylan had submitted an 
ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market 
a generic version of LIALDA. Within the requisite 45-day period, 
Shire filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District 
of Florida against Mylan. A Markman hearing took place on 
December 22, 2014. A Markman ruling was issued on March 23, 
2015. Following a four-day bench trial in September 2016 in the 
U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, the court 
handed down a ruling that Mylan’s proposed generic version 
of LIALDA infringes claims 1 and 3 of the Orange Book listed 
patent for LIALDA. In connection with this finding of infringement, 
the court also entered an injunction prohibiting Mylan from making, 
using, selling, offering for sale and/or importing their proposed 
ANDA product before the expiration of the patent (June 8, 2020) 
and requiring that the approval date for their ANDA be on or after 
the expiration of the patent. On June 14, 2017, the U.S. District 
Court for the Middle District of Florida granted Mylan’s Motion for 
Reconsideration and entered judgment of non-infringement. Shire 
filed an appeal with the Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit on 
July 7, 2017. No date for oral argument has been set.
In March 2015, Shire was notified that Amneal had submitted an 
ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market 
a generic version of LIALDA. Within the requisite 45 day period,

requisite 45 day period, Shire filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District 
Court for the District of Maryland against Lupin Ltd., Lupin 
Pharmaceuticals Inc., Lupin Inc. and Lupin Atlantis Holdings SA. 
A Markman hearing originally scheduled to take place on

rescheduled. No trial date has been set.
VANCOCIN
On April 6, 2012, ViroPharma Incorporated (ViroPharma) received a 
notification that the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) 
was conducting an investigation into whether ViroPharma had 
engaged in unfair methods of competition with respect to 
VANCOCIN which Shire acquired in January 2014. Following the 
divestiture of VANCOCIN in August 2014, Shire retained certain 
liabilities including any potential liabilities related to the VANCOCIN 
citizen petition.
On August 3, 2012, and September 8, 2014, ViroPharma and Shire 
respectively received Civil Investigative Demands from the FTC 
requesting additional information related to this matter. Shire has 
fully cooperated with the FTC’s investigation.
On February 7, 2017, the FTC filed a Complaint against Shire 
alleging that ViroPharma engaged in conduct in violation of U.S. 
antitrust laws arising from a citizen petition ViroPharma filed in 
2006 related to Food & Drug Administration’s policy for evaluating 
bioequivalence for generic versions of VANCOCIN. The complaint 
seeks equitable relief, including an injunction and disgorgement. 
The Company filed a motion to dismiss on April 10, 2017.
At this time, Shire is unable to predict the outcome or duration 
of this case.
164 Shire Annual Report 2017 ELAPRASE
On September 24, 2014, Shire’s Brazilian affiliate, Shire 
Farmaceutica Brasil Ltda, was served with a lawsuit brought by 
the State of Sao Paulo and in which the Brazilian Public Attorney’s 
office has intervened alleging that Shire is obligated to provide 
certain medical care including ELAPRASE for an indefinite period 
at no cost to patients who participated in ELAPRASE clinical trials 
in Brazil, and seeking recoupment to the Brazilian government for 
amounts paid on behalf of these patients to date, and moral 
damages associated with these claims.
On May 6, 2016, the trial court judge ruled on the case and 
dismissed all the claims under the class action, which was 
appealed. On February 20, 2017, the Court of Appeals in Sao 
Paulo issued the final decision on merit in favor of Shire and 
dismissed all the claims under the class action. On July 12, 2017, 
the Public Prosecutor filed an appeal addressed to the Supreme 
Court. During the last quarter of 2017, the State of Sao Paulo filed 
appeals addressed to the Superior Court of Justice and to the 
Supreme Court.
26. Shareholders’ Equity 
Authorized common stock
The authorized stock of Shire plc as of December 31, 2017, was 
1,500,000,000 ordinary shares and 2 subscriber ordinary shares.
Dividends
Under Jersey law, Shire plc is entitled to fund payments of 
dividends from any source (other than a capital redemption reserve 
or nominal capital account) subject to the Directors authorizing 
the distribution making a solvency statement in the prescribed 
statutory form. As of December 31, 2017, Shire plc’s distributable 
reserves were approximately $4.2 billion.
Treasury stock
The Company records the purchase of its own shares by the 
EBT and under the share buy-back program as a reduction of 
shareholders’ equity based on the price paid for the shares. As 
of December 31, 2017, the EBT held 0.5 million in ordinary shares 
(2016: 0.5 million; 2015: 0.6 million) and 0.2 million ADSs (2016: 
0.2 million; 2015: 0.2 million) and shares held under the share 
buy-back program were 7.4 million ordinary shares (2016: 8.0 
million; 2015: 8.5 million). During the years ended December 31, 
2017 and 2016 the Company did not purchase any shares either 
through the EBT or under any share buy-back program. 
Income Access Share Arrangements
Shire has put into place income access share arrangements 
which enable ordinary shareholders, other than ADS holders, to 
choose whether they receive their dividends from Shire plc, a 
company tax resident in the Republic of Ireland, or from Shire 
Biopharmaceuticals Holdings (Old Shire), a Shire group company 
tax resident in the UK.
Old Shire has issued one income access share to the Income 
Access Trust (IAS Trust), which is held by the trustee of the IAS Trust 
(Trustee). The mechanics of the arrangements are as follows:
(i)  If a dividend is announced or declared by Shire plc on its 
ordinary shares, an amount is paid by Old Shire by way of a 
dividend on the income access share to the Trustee, and such 
amount is paid by the Trustee to ordinary shareholders who 
have elected to receive dividends under these arrangements. 
The dividend which would otherwise be payable by Shire plc to 
its ordinary shareholders will be reduced by an amount equal 
to the amount paid to its ordinary shareholders by the Trustee.
(ii)  If the dividend paid on the income access share and on-paid 
by the Trustee to ordinary shareholders is less than the total 
amount of the dividend announced or declared by Shire plc on 
its ordinary shares, Shire plc will be obliged to pay a dividend 
on the relevant ordinary shares equivalent to the amount of the 
shortfall. In such a case, any dividend paid on the ordinary 
shares will generally be subject to Irish withholding tax at the 
rate of 20.0% or such lower rate as may be applicable under 
exemptions from withholding tax contained in Irish law.
(iii)  An ordinary shareholder is entitled to make an income access 
share election such that he/she will receive his/her dividends 
(which would otherwise be payable by Shire plc) under these 
arrangements from Old Shire. This can be done by submitting 
an IAS arrangement election form containing information on 
the participating shareholders pursuant to Shire plc’s Articles 
of Association.
The ADS Depositary has made an election on behalf of all holders 
of ADSs such that they will receive dividends from Old Shire under 
the income access share arrangements. Dividends paid by Old 
Shire under the income access share arrangements will not, under 
current legislation, be subject to any UK or Irish withholding taxes. 
If a holder of ADSs does not wish to receive dividends from Old 
Shire under the income access share arrangements, he/she must 
withdraw his/her ordinary shares from the ADS program prior to 
the dividend record date set by the ADS Depositary and request 
delivery of the Shire plc ordinary shares. This will enable him/her 
to receive dividends from Shire plc.
It is the expectation, although there can be no certainty, that Old 
Shire will distribute dividends on the income access share to the 
Trustee for the benefit of all ordinary shareholders who make an 
income access share election in an amount equal to what would 
have been such ordinary shareholders’ entitlement to dividends 
from Shire plc in the absence of the income access share election. 
If any dividend paid on the income access share and or paid to 
the ordinary shareholders is less than such ordinary shareholders’ 
entitlement to dividends from Shire plc in the absence of the 
income access share election, the dividend on the income access 
share will be allocated pro rata among the ordinary shareholders 
and Shire plc will pay the balance to these ordinary shareholders 
by way of dividend. In such circumstances, there will be no 
grossing up by Shire plc in respect of, and Old Shire and Shire plc 
will not compensate those ordinary shareholders for, any adverse 
consequences including any Irish withholding tax consequences.

26. Shareholders’ Equity continued
Shire will be able to suspend or terminate these arrangements 
at any time, in which case the full Shire plc dividend will be paid 
directly by Shire plc to those ordinary shareholders (including the 
Depositary) who have made an income access share election. 
In such circumstances, there will be no grossing up by Shire plc in 
respect of, and Old Shire and Shire plc will not compensate those 
ordinary shareholders for, any adverse consequences including 
any Irish withholding tax consequences.
In the year ended December 31, 2017, Old Shire paid dividends 
totaling $245.6 million (2016: $150.6 million; 2015: $127.7 million) 
on the income access share to the Trustee in an amount equal 
to the dividend ordinary shareholders would have received from 
Shire plc.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred 
total expense of $61.6 million (2016: $223.1 million, 2015: $nil) 
related to replacement awards held by Baxalta employees as 
further described below. This includes integration related expenses 
of $14.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 (2016: 
$171.0 million, 2015: $nil), primarily due to the acceleration of 
unrecognized expense associated with certain employees 
impacted by the integration.
There were no capitalized share-based compensation costs as 
of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
As of December 31, 2017, $218.3 million (2016: $244.2 million, 
2015: $115.3 million) of total unrecognized compensation cost 
relating to non-vested awards is expected to be recognized over 
a period of three years.
Share-based compensation plans
Prior to February 28, 2015, the Company granted stock-settled 
share appreciation rights (SARs) and performance share awards 
(PSAs) over ordinary shares and ADSs to Executive Directors and 
employees under the Shire Portfolio Share Plan (PSP) (Parts A and 
B). The SARs and PSAs granted under the PSP (Parts A and B) to 
Executive Directors are exercisable subject to performance and 
service criteria. Substantially all SARs and PSAs granted to 
employees are exercisable subject only to service criteria.
The principal terms and conditions of SARs and PSAs under the PSP 
(Parts A and B) are as follows: (i) the contractual life of SARs is seven 
years, (ii) the vesting period of SARs and PSAs granted to employees 
below the level of Executive Vice President allows for graded vesting 
over three years, and (iii) awards granted to the level of Executive 
Director and Executive Vice President cliff vest after three years, of 
which awards to the level of Executive Director contain performance 
conditions based on growth in Non GAAP adjusted return on 
invested capital (Adjusted ROIC) and Non GAAP earnings before 
interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (Non GAAP EBITDA). 
In 2014, the Company granted PSAs under the PSP to employees at 
Executive Vice President level and to a select group of senior 
employees, which are exercisable subject to performance and 
service criteria. These PSAs cliff vested after three years and contain 
performance conditions as explained above.
Since February 28, 2015, the Company has granted awards under 
the Shire Long Term Incentive Plan 2015 (LTIP). Under the LTIP, the 
Company grants stock-settled share appreciation rights (SARs), 
restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance share units (PSUs) 
over ordinary shares and ADSs to Executive Directors and 
employees. The PSUs granted under the LTIP and SARs granted 
to Executive Directors are exercisable subject to performance and 
service criteria. RSUs granted under the LTIP and SARs granted to 
all other employees are exercisable subject only to service criteria.
The principal terms and conditions of SARs, RSUs and PSUs 
granted under the LTIP are as follows: (i) the contractual life of 
SARs is seven years, (ii) the vesting period of SARs and RSUs 
granted to employees below the level of Executive Vice President 
allows for graded vesting, and (iii) all SARs granted to Executive 
Directors and employees at Executive Vice President level and all 
PSUs granted cliff vest after three years and, with the exception 
of SARs granted to employees at Executive Vice President level, 
contain performance conditions based on Product sales and Non 
GAAP EBITDA targets; a Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC underpin is 
also used at the end of the three year performance period to 
assess the underlying performance of the Company before 
determining the final vesting levels for awards with performance 
conditions. In addition, a further two year holding period will 
apply to all awards granted to Executive Directors post vesting.
The Company also operates a Global Employee Stock Purchase 
Plan and UK/Irish Sharesave Plans.
Replacement Awards Issued to Baxalta Employees
In connection with the acquisition of Baxalta and pursuant to the 
merger agreement associated with the acquisition, outstanding 
Baxalta equity awards held by Baxalta employees or employees 
of Baxter were cancelled and exchanged for Shire equity awards. 
The outstanding Baxalta equity awards consisted primarily of stock 
options and RSUs and hence were replaced with Shire’s stock 
options and RSUs. The replacement Shire awards generally have 
the same terms and conditions (including vesting) as the former 
Baxalta awards for which they were exchanged.
166 Shire Annual Report 2017 The value of the replacement share-based awards granted was designed to generally preserve both the intrinsic value and the fair value 
of the award immediately prior to the acquisition. Following the acquisition, the Company records share-based compensation expense 
associated with the acquisition-date fair value of acquired Baxalta employees’ replacement options and RSUs that is attributable to 
post-acquisition service requirements, as well as share-based compensation expense for post-acquisition service requirements 
associated with certain remaining unvested Baxter share-based awards held by the acquired Baxalta employees. The portions of the 
acquisition-date fair values of the awards that are attributable to post-combination service are recognized over the remaining service 
period of the awards.
The following awards were outstanding as of December 31, 2017:

Stock-settled SARs and stock options
SARs under LTIP and PSP (Part A)
Stock-settled share appreciation rights (SARs) granted to Executive 
Directors are exercisable subject to service and performance criteria.
In respect of any award made to Executive Directors under the 
LTIP, performance criteria are based on Product sales and Non 
GAAP EBITDA targets, with a Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC underpin. 
In respect of any award made to Executive Directors under the 
PSP (Part A), performance criteria are based on growth in Non 
GAAP Adjusted ROIC and Non GAAP EBITDA. These performance 
measures are an important measure of the Company’s ability to 
meet the strategic objective to grow value for all of its stakeholders.
Awards granted to employees below Executive Director level are 
not subject to performance conditions and are only subject to 
service conditions.
Once awards have vested, participants will have until the seventh 
anniversary of the date of grant to exercise their awards.
UK/Irish Sharesave Plans (Sharesave Plans)
Options granted under the Sharesave Plans are granted with an 
exercise price equal to 80% and 75% of the mid-market price on 
the day before invitations are issued to UK and Ireland employees, 
respectively. Employees may enter into three or five year savings 
contracts. No  performance conditions apply.
Shire Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Stock Purchase Plan)
Under the Stock Purchase Plan, options are granted with an 
exercise price equal to 85% of the fair market value of a share on 
the day before the enrollment date (the first day of the offering 
period) or the day before the exercise date (the last day of the 
offering period), whichever is the lower. Employees agree to save 
for a period up to 12 months. No performance conditions apply.
Baxalta Replacement Options
The replacement stock options were issued consistent with the 
vesting conditions of the replaced award (as explained above). 
Replacement stock options had contractual terms of 10 years from 
the initial grant date. The majority of stock options outstanding 
vested in one-third increments over a three year period, although 
certain awards cliff vest or have longer or shorter service periods. 
The fair value on the acquisition date attributable to post-
combination service, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, is 
recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining 
vesting period.

The replacement RSUs were issued consistent with the vesting 
conditions of the replaced award (as explained above) and 
generally continue to vest in one-third increments over a three-year 
period. The fair value on the acquisition date attributable to 
post-combination service, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, is

Exercises of share-based awards
The total intrinsic values of share-based awards exercised, 
including those held by Baxter employees, for the years ended 
December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $147.1 million, 
$214.6 million and $198.8 million, respectively. The total cash 
received as a result of share option exercises for the period ended 
December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $134.1 
million, $169.2 million and $16.6 million, respectively. In connection 
with these exercises, the tax benefit credited to additional paid-in 
capital for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 
was $nil, $8.8 million and $31.6 million, respectively. With the 
adoption of a new accounting standard on accounting for 
stock-based compensation, effective January 1, 2017, excess tax 
benefits were recognized as a component of Income tax expense 
rather than Additional paid-in capital. 
The Company will settle future awards with either newly listed 
ordinary shares or with shares held in the EBT. The number of 
shares that the EBT will purchase in 2018 is dependent on the 
number of awards granted and exercised during the year and 
Shire plc’s share price. As of December 31, 2017, the EBT held 
0.5 million ordinary shares and 0.2 million ADSs.
Valuation methodologies
The Company estimates the fair value of its share-based awards 
using a Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions 
used to estimate the fair value of share-based awards include the 
grant price of the award, the expected stock-based award term, 
volatility of the Company’s share price, the risk-free rate and the 
Company’s dividend yield. The Company believes that the 
valuation technique and the approach utilized to develop the 
underlying assumptions are appropriate in estimating the fair 
values of Shire’s stock-based awards. Estimates of fair value are 
not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately 
realized by employees who receive equity awards, and subsequent 
events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original 
estimates of fair value made by the Company.
The fair value of share awards granted was estimated using the 
following assumptions:
Years ended December 31 2017
Weighted
 average 
grant date
 fair value
Weighted 
average 
remaining
 life
Risk-free interest rate 0.4-1.9% 0.29-1.6% 0.6-1.8%
Expected dividend yield 0.3-0.6% 0.3-0.5% 0.2-0.4%
Expected life 1-3.88 years 1-4 years 1-4 years
Volatility 25-29% 26-29% 23-26%
Forfeiture rate 0% 5-7% 5-7%
The following assumptions were used to value share-based 
awards:
 • risk-free interest rate — for awards granted over ADSs, the 
U.S. Federal Reserve treasury constant maturities rate with a 
term consistent with the expected life of the award is used. 
For awards granted over ordinary shares, the yield on UK 
government bonds with a term consistent with the expected 
life of the award is used;
 • expected dividend yield — measured as the average annualized 
dividend estimated to be paid by the Company over the 
expected life of the award as a percentage of the share price 
at the grant date;
 • expected life — estimated based on the contractual term of 
the awards and the effects of employees’ expected exercise 
and post-vesting employment termination behavior;
 • expected volatility — measured using historical daily price 
changes of the Company’s share price over the respective 
expected life of the share-based awards at the date of the 
award; and
 • forfeiture rate — estimated using historical trends of the number 
of awards forfeited prior to vesting. Upon the 2017 adoption of a 
new rule on accounting for stock-based compensation, the 
Company elected to account for forfeitures in relation to service 
conditions as they occur. As such, the estimated forfeiture rate 
was 0% starting in 2017.
 169 Shire Annual Report 2017
 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 28. Agreements and Transactions with Baxter 
In connection with Baxalta’s separation from Baxter on July 1, 
2015, Baxalta and Baxter entered into several separation-related 
agreements that provided a framework for Baxalta’s relationship 
with Baxter after the separation. These agreements, among others, 
included a manufacturing and supply agreement, a transition 
services agreement and a tax matters agreement.
Under the terms of the manufacturing and supply agreement, the 
Company manufactures certain products and materials and sells 
them to Baxter at an agreed-upon price reflecting the Company’s 
cost plus a mark-up for certain products and materials. The 
Company reported revenues associated with the manufacturing 
and supply agreement with Baxter during the year ended 
December 31, 2017 and 2016 of approximately $137.3 million and 
$81.0 million, respectively. The 2016 reported revenues were for 
the period from June 3, 2016 acquisition date through December 
31, 2016.
Under the terms of the transition services agreement, the 
Company and Baxter provide various services to each other on 
an interim, transitional basis. The services provided by Baxter to 
the Company include certain finance, information technology, 
human resources, quality, supply chain and other administrative 
services and functions, and are generally provided on a cost-plus 
basis. Certain of these services extend through June 30, 2018. 
The Company reported Selling, general and administrative 
expenses associated with the transition services agreement with 
Baxter during the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 of 
approximately $52.3 million and $54.0 million, respectively. 
The 2016 reported expenses were for the period from June 3, 
2016 acquisition date through December 31, 2016.
For a certain portion of Baxalta’s non U.S. operations, the legal 
transfer of net assets from Baxter had not occurred by the June 3, 
2016 acquisition date due to the time required to transfer marketing 
authorizations and other regulatory requirements in each of these 
countries. Under the terms of the international commercial 
operations agreement with Baxter, the Company is responsible for 
the business activities conducted by Baxter on its behalf, and is 
subject to the risks and entitled to the benefits generated by these 
operations and assets. As a result, the related assets and liabilities 
and results of operations are reported in the Company’s 
consolidated financial statements following the acquisition of 
Baxalta. The majority of these operations were transferred to the 
Company on December 31, 2016. Net sales related to these 
operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $nil (2016: 
$101.0 million). The outstanding balance of the assets and liabilities 
related to these operations was $nil as of December 31, 2017. As 
of December 31, 2016 the assets and liabilities of these operations 
consisted of $11.0 million of inventories, which were reported in 
Inventories on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, other assets of 
$50.0 million, which were reported as Prepaid expenses and other 
current assets, and liabilities of $3.0 million, which were reported in 
Other current liabilities. 
The tax matters agreement governs Baxter and Baxalta’s and now 
the Company’s respective rights, responsibilities and obligations 
after the distribution with respect to taxes for any tax period ending 
on or before the distribution date, as well as tax periods beginning 
before and ending after the distribution date. In addition, the tax 
matters agreement addresses the allocation of liability for taxes 
that were incurred as a result of restructuring activities undertaken 
to effectuate the distribution and provides for Baxalta to indemnify 
Baxter against any tax liabilities resulting from Baxalta’s action or 
inaction that causes the merger-related transactions to be taxable. 
Net tax-related indemnification liabilities as of December 31, 2017 
associated with the tax matters agreement with Baxter are 
discussed in Note 24, Commitments and Contingencies, of these 
consolidated financial statements.
As of December 31, 2017, the Company had total amounts due 
from or to Baxter of $103.1 million (2016: $189.0 million) reported 
in Prepaid expenses and other current assets, $63.2 million (2016: 
$72.0 million) reported in Other current liabilities and $59.6 million 
(2016: $92.0 million) reported in Other non-current liabilities. 
29. Auditor remuneration
The Audit, Compliance & Risk Committee reviews the scope 
and results of the audit and non-audit services, including tax 
advisory and compliance services, provided by the Company’s 
Independent Registered Public Accountants, Deloitte LLP, and 
the cost effectiveness and the independence and objectivity 
of the Registered Public Accountants. In recognition of the 
importance of maintaining the independence of Deloitte LLP, 
a process for pre-approval has been in place since July 1, 2002 
and has continued through to the end of the period covered by 
this Annual Report.
The following table provides an analysis of the amount paid to the 
Company’s Independent Registered Public Accountants, Deloitte 
LLP, all fees having been pre-approved by the Audit, Compliance 
& Risk Committee.

3 All other fees in 2017 relate to the continuation and completion of projects 
already under way at Baxalta prior to its acquisition by the Company in June 
2016. A comprehensive review and reorganization of these services was 
performed following the acquisition date to ensure the continued 
independence of Deloitte LLP as auditors for the Company.

178 Shire Annual Report 2017 Other information
Non GAAP Measures
This Annual Report contains financial measures not prepared in 
accordance with U.S. GAAP. These measures are referred to as 
“Non GAAP” measures and include: Non GAAP Total revenues; 
Non GAAP Operating income; Non GAAP income tax expense; 
Non GAAP Net income; Non GAAP diluted earnings per ADS; 
Non GAAP effective tax rate; Non GAAP CER; Non GAAP Cost 
of sales; Non GAAP gross margin; Non GAAP R&D; Non GAAP 
SG&A; Non GAAP other expense; Non GAAP free cash flow, 
Non GAAP Net debt, Non GAAP EBITDA and Non GAAP 
EBITDA margin.
The Non GAAP measures exclude the impact of certain specified 
items that are highly variable, difficult to predict and of a size that 
may substantially impact Shire’s operations. Upfront and milestone 
payments related to in-licensing and acquired products that have 
been expensed as R&D are also excluded as specified items as 
they are generally uncertain and often result in a different payment 
and expense recognition pattern than ongoing internal R&D 
activities. Intangible asset amortization has been excluded from 
certain measures to facilitate an evaluation of current and past 
operating performance, particularly in terms of cash returns, and 
is similar to how management internally assesses performance. 
The Non GAAP financial measures are presented in this press 
release as Shire’s management believes that they will provide 
investors with an additional analysis of Shire’s results of operations, 
particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.
Shire’s management uses Non GAAP financial measures to 
make operating decisions as they facilitate additional internal 
comparisons of Shire’s performance to historical results and 
to competitors’ results, and provides them to investors as a 
supplement to Shire’s reported results to provide additional 
insight into Shire’s operating performance. Shire’s Remuneration 
Committee uses certain key Non GAAP measures when assessing 
the performance and compensation of employees, including 
Shire’s executive directors.
The Non GAAP financial measures used by Shire may be 
calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable 
to, similarly titled measures used by other companies — refer to 
the section “Non GAAP Financial Measure Descriptions” below 
for additional information. In addition, these Non GAAP financial 
measures should not be considered in isolation as a substitute for, 
or as superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with 
U.S. GAAP, and Shire’s financial results calculated in accordance 
with U.S. GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements 
should be carefully evaluated.
Non GAAP Financial Measure Descriptions
Where applicable, the following items, including their tax effect, 
have been excluded when calculating Non GAAP earnings and 
from our Non GAAP outlook:
Amortization and asset impairments:
 • Intangible asset amortization and impairment charges; and
 • Other than temporary impairment of investments.
Acquisitions and integration activities:
 • Up-front payments and milestones in respect of in-licensed 
and acquired products;
 • Costs associated with acquisitions, including transaction 
costs, fair value adjustments on contingent consideration 
and acquired inventory;
 • Costs associated with the integration of companies; and
 • Non-controlling interests in consolidated variable 
interest entities.
Divestments, reorganizations and discontinued operations:
 • Gains and losses on the sale of non-core assets;
 • Costs associated with restructuring and reorganization activities;
 • Termination costs; and
 • Income/(losses) from discontinued operations.
Legal and litigation costs:
 • Net legal costs related to the settlement of litigation, 
government investigations and other disputes (excluding 
internal legal team costs).
Additionally, in any given period Shire may have significant, 
unusual or non-recurring gains or losses, which it may exclude 
from its Non GAAP earnings for that period. When applicable, 
these items would be fully disclosed and incorporated into the 
required reconciliations from U.S. GAAP to Non GAAP measures.
Depreciation, which is included in Cost of sales, R&D and SG&A 
costs in our U.S. GAAP results, has been separately disclosed for 
presentational purposes.
Free cash flow represents Net cash provided by operating 
activities, excluding up-front and milestone payments, or receipts, 
for in-licensed and acquired products, but including capital 
expenditure in the ordinary course of business.
Non GAAP Net debt represents Cash and cash equivalents less 
short and long term borrowings, capital leases and other debt.
 179 Shire Annual Report 2017
 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Other information Other information
Non GAAP Measures continued
A reconciliation of Non GAAP financial measures to the most 
directly comparable measure under U.S. GAAP is presented 
on pages 181 to 183.
Non GAAP CER growth is computed by restating 2017 results 
using average 2016 foreign exchange rates for the relevant period.
Average exchange rates used by Shire for the three months ended 
December 31, 2017 were $1.34:£1.00 and $1.18:€1.00 (2016: 
$1.26:£1.00 and $1.09:€1.00). Average exchange rates used by 
Shire for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were 
$1.29:£1.00 and $1.13:€1.00 (2016: $1.36:£1.00 and $1.11:€1.00). 
A reconciliation of 2020 Non GAAP EBITDA to U.S. GAAP Net 
income cannot be provided because we are unable to forecast 
with reasonable certainty many of the items necessary to calculate 
such comparable GAAP measures, including asset impairments, 
acquisitions and integration related expenses, divestments, 
reorganizations and discontinued operations related expenses, 
legal settlement costs, as well as other unusual or non-recurring 
gains or losses. These items are uncertain, depend on various 
factors, and could be material to our results computed in 
accordance with GAAP. We believe the inherent uncertainties in 
reconciling Non GAAP measures for periods after 2018 to the most 
comparable GAAP measures would make the forecasted 
comparable GAAP measures nearly impossible to predict with 
reasonable certainty and therefore inherently unreliable.
Non GAAP adjusted ROIC reflects the definition used by the 
Company in its corporate scorecard. This definition aims to 
measure true underlying economic performance of the Company, 
by making a number of adjustments to ROIC as derived from the 
Company’s Non GAAP financial results including:
 • Adding back to Non GAAP Operating income all R&D expenses 
and operating lease costs incurred in the period;
 • Capitalizing on the Group’s balance sheet historical, cumulative 
R&D, in process R&D and intangible asset impairment charges 
and operating lease costs which previously have been 
expensed;
 • Deducting from Non GAAP Operating income and amortization 
charge for the above capitalized costs based on the estimated 
commercial lives of the relevant products;
 • Excluding the income statement and balance sheet impact of 
non-operating assets (such as surplus cash and non-strategic 
investments); and
 • Taxing the resulting adjusted operating income at the underlying 
Non GAAP effective tax rate.

Shareholder security
Shareholders of many companies have 
received unsolicited phone calls or 
correspondence concerning investment 
matters. These are typically from overseas 
based “brokers” who target UK 
shareholders, offering to sell them what 
often turn out to be worthless or high-risk 
shares in U.S. or UK investments. 
Shareholders are advised to be very wary 
of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy 
shares at a discount or offers of free 
company reports. If you receive any 
unsolicited investment advice, you should:
 • ensure you note the name of the person 
and organization
 • check the FCA register of regulated firms 
by visiting https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/
financial-services-register
 • if you suspect a scam, report the matter 
to the FCA either by calling the FCA 
Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768 
or by completing an online form at:

Income Access Share arrangements
Holders of Ordinary Shares are reminded 
that, in order to receive UK-sourced 
dividends via Shire’s Income Access 
Share arrangements (IAS Arrangements), 
they need to submit a valid IAS 
Arrangements election form to the 
Company’s registrar, Equiniti. 
Holders of Ordinary Shares are 
advised that:
 • any previous elections made using 
versions of the IAS Arrangements 
election form in use prior to February 16, 
2016, and any elections deemed to have 
been made prior to April 28, 2016, are no 
longer valid; and
 • if they do not elect, or have not elected 
using the newly formatted IAS 
Arrangements election forms published 
on or after February 16, 2016, to receive 
UK-sourced dividends via Shire’s IAS 
Arrangements, their dividends will be 
Irish sourced and therefore incur Irish 
dividend withholding tax, subject to 
applicable exemptions

 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Cautionary statements
Other information
Statements included herein that are not 
historical facts, including without limitation 
statements concerning future strategy, 
plans, objectives, expectations and 
intentions, projected revenues, the 
anticipated timing of clinical trials and 
approvals for, and the commercial potential 
of, in-line or pipeline products, are forward-
looking statements. Such forward-looking 
statements involve a number of risks and 
uncertainties and are subject to change 
at any time. In the event such risks or 
uncertainties materialize, Shire’s results 
could be materially adversely affected. 
The risks and uncertainties include, but 
are not limited to, the following:
 • Shire’s products may not be a 
commercial success;
 • increased pricing pressures and limits 
on patient access as a result of 
governmental regulations and market 
developments may affect Shire’s future 
revenues, financial condition and results 
of operations;
 • Shire depends on third parties to supply 
certain inputs and services critical to its 
operations including certain inputs, 
services and ingredients critical to its 
manufacturing processes. Any disruption 
to the supply chain for any of Shire’s 
products may result in Shire being 
unable to continue marketing or 
developing a product or may result 
in Shire being unable to do so on a 
commercially viable basis for some 
period of time;
 • the manufacture of Shire’s products 
is subject to extensive oversight by 
various regulatory agencies. Regulatory 
approvals or interventions associated 
with changes to manufacturing sites, 
ingredients or manufacturing processes 
could lead to, among other things, 
significant delays, an increase in 
operating costs, lost product sales, 
an interruption of research activities 
or the delay of new product launches;
 • the nature of producing plasma-based 
therapies may prevent Shire from 
timely responding to market forces 
and effectively managing its production 
capacity;
 • Shire has a portfolio of products 
in various stages of research and 
development. The successful 
development of these products is 
highly uncertain and requires significant 
expenditures and time, and there is 
no guarantee that these products 
will receive regulatory approval;
 • the actions of certain customers could 
affect Shire’s ability to sell or market 
products profitably. Fluctuations in 
buying or distribution patterns by such 
customers can adversely affect Shire’s 
revenues, financial conditions or results 
of operations;
 • failure to comply with laws and 
regulations governing the sales and 
marketing of its products could materially 
impact Shire’s revenues and profitability;
 • Shire’s products and product candidates 
face substantial competition in the 
product markets in which it operates, 
including competition from generics;
 • Shire’s patented products are subject to 
significant competition from generics;
 • adverse outcomes in legal matters, tax 
audits and other disputes, including 
Shire’s ability to enforce and defend 
patents and other intellectual property 
rights required for its business, could 
have a material adverse effect on the 
Shire’s revenues, financial condition 
or results of operations;
 • Shire may fail to obtain, maintain, 
enforce or defend the intellectual 
property rights required to conduct 
its business;
 • Shire faces intense competition for

186 Shire Annual Report 2017 Risk Factors
The Company’s business and assets are 
subject to varying degrees of risk and 
uncertainty. An investor should carefully 
consider the risks described below, as 
well as other information contained in this 
Annual Report and the Company’s other 
reports and filings. Additional risks not 
presently known to the Company or that 
it currently deems immaterial may also 
adversely affect its business. If any of these 
events or circumstances occurs, the 
business, financial condition, results of 
operations, or prospects could be 
materially harmed. In that case, the value 
of the Company’s securities could decline 
and an investor could lose part or all of his 
or her investment. In addition, cautionary 
statements that are contained in this 
Annual Report or in the Company’s other 
reports, filings or statements may be 
subject to the risks described below as well 
as other risks and uncertainties. For details 
on Shire’s risk management framework, 
see pages 18 and 19.
Risks Related to the Business
The Company’s products may not be a 
commercial success
The commercial success of the Company’s 
marketed products and other new products 
that the Company may launch in the future, 
will depend on their approval and 
acceptance by physicians, patients, 
insurers and other key decision-makers, as 
well as the receipt of marketing approvals in 
different countries, the time taken to obtain 
such approvals, the scope of marketing 
approvals as reflected in the product labels, 
approval of reimbursement at commercially 
sustainable prices in those countries where 
price and reimbursement is negotiated, and 
safety, efficacy, convenience and cost-
effectiveness of the product as compared 
to competitive products.
The Company’s revenues, financial 
condition or results of operations may be 
adversely affected if any or all of the 
following occur:
 • if the Company’s products, or 
competitive products, are genericized;
 • if the prices of the Company’s products 
are reduced or if prices of competitor 
products are reduced;
 • if launches of new products or launch of 
the Company’s products in new markets 
are not successful;
 • if there are unanticipated adverse 
events experienced with the Company’s 
products or those of a competitor 
not seen in clinical trials that impact 
physicians’ willingness to prescribe 
the Company’s products;
 • if issues arise from clinical trials being 
conducted for post-marketing purposes 
or for registration in another country 
which raise questions or concerns 
about a product;
 • if the regulatory agencies in one country 
act in a way that raises concerns for 
regulatory agencies or for prescribers 
or patients in another country;
 • if there is a reduction in the use of the 
Company’s products by patients, payers 
or physicians due to the development 
of or preferences for alternative 
technologies or treatments;
 • if the Company’s products are subject 
to more stringent government regulation 
than competitor products;
 • if patent protection or other forms of 
exclusivity are lost or curtailed, or if 
competitors are able to successfully 
challenge or circumvent the Company’s 
patents or other forms of exclusivity 
(see Note 25, Legal and Other 
Proceedings, to the consolidated 
financial statements);
 • if the sizes of the patient populations 
for the Company’s products are less 
than expected;
 • if there are lawsuits filed or government 
investigations initiated against Shire, 
including but not limited to, product 
liability claims, consumer law claims, 
payer or reimbursement litigation and 
prior sales or marketing practices; or
 • if there are adverse developments in 
investigations or government proceedings.
If the Company is unable to commercialize 
its products successfully, there may be a 
material adverse effect on the Company’s 
revenues, financial condition or results 
of operations.
Increased pricing pressures and 
limits on patient access as a result of 
governmental regulations and market 
developments may affect the Company’s 
future revenues, financial condition and 
results of operations
The Company’s product revenues are 
subject to increasing pressures from 
governmental and other initiatives to 
regulate or influence prices and access 
to customers. Regulations in the U.S., 
the European Union and other jurisdictions 
mandating price controls or imposing 
constraints on patients’ ability to purchase 
Shire’s products significantly impact 
its business. In the U.S., the new 
administration has made public and 
social media statements regarding 
proposed changes to existing government 
initiatives, like the ACA, which has created 
significant uncertainty for the future of 
federal government policies that regulate 
or influence prices and access to 
customers. Any future changes in such 
laws, regulations, practices or policies may 
adversely affect the Company’s financial 
condition and results of operations.
Regulatory measures that could have a 
material adverse effect on the Company 
include the imposition of government-
approved drug pricing schedules, the 
use of drug formularies, prohibitions on 
direct-to-consumer advertising or drug 
marketing practices, new regulations or 
new interpretations of existing or historical 
regulations relating to governmental drug 
discount or rebate programs that increase 
the Company’s drug discount or rebate 
liability, and caps or limits on the level of 
reimbursement provided to the Company 
by governmental reimbursement schemes 
for its products.
These pressures have also resulted in market 
developments, such as the consolidation of 
managed healthcare organizations, private 
health insurers, distributors and pharmacies 
that have increased the relative bargaining 
power of institutional drug purchasers and 
enhanced their ability to negotiate discounts 
and extract other concessions in exchange 
for purchasing Shire’s products.
 187 Shire Annual Report 2017
 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Other Information
Risk Factors continued
Such regulatory and market developments 
create downward pressures on the prices 
at which the Company can offer its 
products and on the level of reimbursement 
its treatments receive from healthcare 
providers, private health insurers and other 
organizations, such as health maintenance 
organizations and managed care 
organizations.
Additional factors affecting the Company’s 
ability to obtain and maintain adequate 
prices and levels of reimbursement for its 
products include:
 • higher levels of controls on the use 
of the Company’s products and/or 
requirements for further price 
concessions mandated or negotiated 
by managed healthcare organizations 
or government authorities;
 • legislative proposals to reform healthcare 
and government insurance programs in 
many of the Company’s markets; and
 • price controls, unsuccessful government 
tenders, or non-reimbursement of new 
medicines or new indications.
Moreover, the cost of treatment for some 
of the Company’s products is high, 
particularly those which are used for the 
treatment of rare diseases. The Company 
may encounter difficulty in obtaining or 
maintaining satisfactory pricing and 
reimbursement for such products. The 
failure to obtain and maintain pricing and 
reimbursement at satisfactory levels for 
its products may adversely affect the 
Company’s revenues, financial condition 
or results of operations.
The Company depends on third parties 
to supply certain inputs and services 
critical to its operations including 
certain inputs, services and ingredients 
critical to its manufacturing processes
The Company relies on third-party 
suppliers, vendors and outsourcing 
partners to, among other things, research, 
develop, manufacture and commercialize its 
products, to provide certain key ingredients 
and manufacturing inputs and to manage 
certain sales, distribution, marketing, 
information technology, accounting, 
transaction-processing and other business 
services. While the Company depends on 
these third parties for multiple aspects of 
its product development, manufacturing, 
commercialization and business activities, it 
does not control these third parties directly.
As a result, there is a possibility these third 
parties may not complete activities on 
schedule or in accordance with the 
Company’s expectations, and their failure 
to meet certain contractual, regulatory or 
other obligations to Shire, or any disruption 
of Shire’s relationship with these third 
parties could delay or prevent the 
development, approval, manufacture or 
commercialization of the Company’s 
products, result in non-compliance with 
applicable laws and regulations, disrupt 
Shire’s operations, or result in reputational 
or other harm to the Company.
This outsourcing risk is of particular 
concern with respect to third-party 
suppliers of key manufacturing inputs of 
certain of Shire’s drug products, including, 
but not limited to, CINRYZE, ADVATE, 
ADYNOVATE, HYQVIA, ELAPRASE, 
FIRAZYR, REPLAGAL and GATTEX/
REVESTIVE where the Company currently 
relies on a single active ingredient source 
for each. Shire also relies on limited third 
party sources to provide the donated 
plasma necessary for the manufacture of 
CINRYZE. In addition, although the 
Company dual-sources certain key 
products and/or active ingredients, the 
Company currently relies on a single source 
for production of the final drug product for 
certain of its products, including, but not 
limited to, ADDERALL XR, CINRYZE, 
CUVITRU, FIRAZYR, LIALDA and 
PENTASA.
For many of those components and 
materials for which a sole supplier is used, 
the Company seeks to address potential 
supply disruption by, among other things, 
regularly evaluating such risk and, if 
appropriate, holding strategic inventory in 
the case of such potential supply 
disruptions. If such efforts prove 
unsuccessful, it could have a material 
adverse effect on the Company’s revenues, 
financial condition or results of operations.
Any failure by a single-source supplier to 
provide the Company with the required 
volumes on time or at all, or to provide 
products that meet quality assurance 
measures and/or regulatory requirements, 
could lead to significant delays in the 
production of Shire’s products, increases 
in operating costs, lost product sales, an 
interruption of research activities, or the 
delay of new product launches, all of which 
could have a material adverse effect on the 
Company’s revenues, financial condition or 
results of operations.
Any disruption to the supply chain for 
any of the Company’s products, or any 
difficulties or delays in the 
manufacturing, distribution and sale of 
its products may result in the Company 
being unable to continue marketing or 
developing a product, or may result in 
the Company being unable to do so on 
a commercially viable basis for some 
period of time
A disruption, delay or other difficulties 
in the manufacturing, distribution and 
sale of Shire’s products, or in the supply 
chain of any of its products, may have a 
material adverse effect on the Company 
and its revenues, financial condition and 
results of operations. Examples of such 
manufacturing and supply chain difficulties 
include, but are not limited to:
 • regulatory or enforcement actions that 
result in shut-downs, delays in or 
withdrawal of regulatory approvals 
necessary to carry on manufacturing 
activities, product recalls and penalties 
or fines resulting in unanticipated costs 
in production, whether imposed directly 
on the Company or imposed indirectly 
through one or more of its third-party 
suppliers;
 • the inability of the Company to increase 
its production capacity for certain drugs 
commensurate with market demand;
 • the possibility that the supply of incoming 
materials may be delayed or become 
unavailable and that the quality of 
incoming materials may be substandard 
and not detected;
 • the possibility that the Company may fail 
to maintain appropriate quality standards 
throughout its internal and third-party 
supply network, or to comply with current 
manufacturing best practices, rules or 
other applicable regulations;
 • disruptions to supply chain continuity as a 
result of natural or man-made disasters at 
the Company’s facilities or at one or more 
of its third-party suppliers’ facilities; and
 • failure to maintain the integrity of the 
Company’s supply chains against 
fraudulent and criminal acts, such as 
intentional product adulteration, diversion, 
theft, or counterfeiting activities.
188 Shire Annual Report 2017 Also, as noted above, the Company has 
also entered into many agreements with 
third parties for the provision of goods and 
services to enable it to manufacture its 
products. If these third parties are unable 
to manufacture products, or provide these 
goods and services, in each case in 
accordance with its respective contractual 
obligations, the Company’s ability to 
manage its manufacturing processes or to 
operate its business, including to continue 
the development or commercialization of 
its products as planned or on a commercial 
basis, may be adversely impacted.
The manufacture of the Company’s 
products is subject to extensive 
oversight by various regulatory 
agencies. Regulatory approvals or 
interventions associated with changes 
to manufacturing sites, ingredients or 
manufacturing processes could lead 
to significant delays, an increase in 
operating costs, lost product sales, 
an interruption of research activities 
or the delay of new product launches
Pharmaceutical and device manufacturing 
sites must be inspected and approved by 
regulatory agencies such as the FDA and 
similar agencies in other countries. Active 
ingredients, excipients and packaging 
materials used in the manufacturing 
process must be obtained from sources 
approved by regulatory agencies.
The development, approval and 
manufacturing of the Company’s products 
depend on the ability to procure ingredients 
and packaging materials from approved 
sources and for the manufacturing process 
to be conducted at approved sites. 
Changes of manufacturer or changes 
of source of ingredients or packaging 
materials must generally be approved by 
regulatory agencies, which will involve 
testing and additional inspections to ensure 
compliance with the applicable regulatory 
agency’s regulations and standards. 
The need to qualify a new manufacturer 
or source of ingredients or packaging 
materials can take a significant amount 
of time. Should it become necessary to 
change a manufacturer or supplier of 
ingredients or packaging materials, or to 
qualify an additional supplier, the Company 
may not be able do so quickly, or at all, 
which could delay or disrupt the 
manufacturing process.
U.S.-based manufacturers must be 
registered with the DEA and similar 
regulatory authorities in other countries 
if they handle controlled substances. 
Certain of the Company’s products, 
including VYVANSE, ADDERALL XR and 
MYDAYIS, contain ingredients which are 
controlled substances subject to quotas 
managed by the DEA. As a result, the 
Company’s procurement and production 
quotas may not be sufficient to meet 
commercial demand.
Certain of the Company’s products, 
including but not limited to CINRYZE, 
ELAPRASE, REPLAGAL, FEIBA, HYQVIA, 
CUVITRU and GAMMAGARD LIQUID and 
VPRIV are manufactured using highly 
complex biological processes. The 
complexity of the manufacturing results in 
a number of risks, including the risk of 
microbial and other types of contamination. 
Additionally, some of the Company’s 
therapies, including CINRYZE, FEIBA, 
HYQVIA, CUVITRU and GAMMAGARD 
LIQUID are derived from human plasma, 
and are therefore subject to the risk of 
biological contamination inherent in 
plasma-derived products.
The failure to obtain regulatory approvals 
promptly or at all and/or regulatory 
interventions associated with changes 
to manufacturing sites, ingredients or 
manufacturing processes could lead to 
significant delays, an increase in operating 
costs, lost product sales, an interruption 
of research activities, the delay of new 
product launches or constraints on 
manufacturing output, all of which could 
have a material adverse effect on the 
Company’s revenues, financial condition 
and results of operations.
The nature of producing plasma-based 
therapies may prevent Shire from timely 
responding to market forces and 
effectively managing its production 
capacity
The production of plasma-based therapies 
is a lengthy and complex process, and 
Shire sources its plasma both internally 
and externally through suppliers. Efforts 
to increase the collection of plasma or 
the production of plasma-based therapies 
may include the construction and regulatory 
approval of additional plasma collection 
facilities and plasma fractionation facilities. 
In connection with the combination with 
Baxalta, the Company acquired a yet to be 
completed state-of-the-art manufacturing 
facility near Covington, Georgia to support 
growth of its plasma-based treatments. 
The Company has completed construction 
of all buildings associated with the 
Covington facility and is going through 
a rigorous commissioning and testing 
process to receive licensing from the FDA 
and international regulatory agencies. 
Commercial production at the facility 
remains scheduled to begin in 2018. The 
development of such facilities involves a 
lengthy regulatory process and is highly 
capital intensive. In addition, access to 
and transport and use of plasma may be 
subject to restrictions by governmental 
agencies both inside and outside the United 
States. As a result, the Company’s ability to 
match its collection and production of 
plasma-based therapies to market demand 
is imprecise and may result in a failure to 
meet market demand for its plasma-based 
therapies or, alternatively, an oversupply of 
inventory. Failure to meet market demand 
for Shire’s plasma-based therapies may 
result in customers transitioning to available 
competitive products resulting in a loss of 
market share or customer confidence. In 
the event of an oversupply, Shire may be 
forced to lower the prices it charges for 
some of its plasma-based therapies, close 
collection and processing facilities, record 
asset impairment charges or take other 
action which could have a material adverse 
effect on the Company’s revenues, financial 
condition and results of operations.
 189 Shire Annual Report 2017
 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Other Information
Risk Factors continued
The Company has a portfolio of 
products in various stages of research 
and development. The successful 
development of these products is highly 
uncertain and requires significant 
expenditures and time, and there is 
no guarantee that these products will 
receive regulatory approval
Products that initially appear promising in 
research or development may be delayed or 
fail to reach later stages of development as:
 • preclinical or clinical tests may show the 
product to lack safety or efficacy;
 • delays may be caused by: slow 
enrollment in clinical studies; regulatory 
requirements for clinical trial drug 
supplies; extended length of time to 
achieve study endpoints; additional time 
requirements for data analysis or dossier 
preparation; time required for 
discussions with regulatory agencies, 
including regulatory agency requests 
for additional preclinical or clinical data; 
regulatory agencies due to staffing or 
resource limitations; analysis of or 
changes to study design; unexpected 
safety, efficacy, or manufacturing issues; 
shared control with collaborative 
partners in the planning and execution of 
the product development, scaling of the 
manufacturing process, or obtaining 
approval for manufacturing;
 • manufacturing issues, pricing or 
reimbursement issues, or other factors may 
render the product economically unviable;
 • the proprietary rights of others and their 
competing products and technologies 
may prevent the product from being 
developed or commercialized; or
 • submission of an application for 
regulatory approval of any of the 
Company’s product candidates may 
be subjected to lengthy review and 
ultimately rejected.
Success in preclinical and early clinical 
trials does not ensure that late stage clinical 
trials will be successful. Clinical results 
are frequently susceptible to varying 
interpretations that may delay, limit, or 
prevent regulatory approvals. The length 
of time necessary to complete clinical trials 
and to submit an application for marketing 
approval for a final decision by a regulatory 
authority varies significantly and may be 
difficult to predict. Moreover, once an 
application is submitted, additional data 
may be sought by regulators or an 
application may be rejected. The Company 
has a range of programs in its product 
pipeline that are in registration or entering 
late stage clinical development, including, 
but not limited to SHP643 for the treatment 
of HAE, which is in registration, SHP621 for 
the treatment of EOE, which is in Phase 3 
clinical trials, and SHP647 for the treatment 
of ulcerative colitis, which is in Phase 3. 
If the Company’s large-scale or late-stage 
clinical trials for a product are not 
successful, the Company will not recover 
its substantial investments in that product.
In addition, even if the products receive 
regulatory approval, they remain subject to 
ongoing regulatory requirements, including, 
for example, obligations to conduct 
additional clinical trials or other non-clinical 
testing, changes to the product label (which 
could impact its marketability and 
prospects for commercial success), new 
or revised requirements for manufacturing, 
written notifications to physicians, or 
product recalls or withdrawals.
The actions of certain customers could 
affect the Company’s ability to sell or 
market products profitably. Fluctuations 
in buying or distribution patterns by 
such customers can adversely affect 
the Company’s revenues, financial 
conditions or results of operations
A considerable portion of the Company’s 
product sales are made to major 
pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, 
as well as to large pharmacies, in both 
the U.S. and Europe. For the year ended 
December 31, 2017, 26% of the Company’s 
product sales were attributable to three 
customers: AmerisourceBergen Drug Corp, 
McKesson Corp. and Cardinal Health, Inc. 
In the event of financial failure of any of 
these customers there could be a material 
adverse effect on the Company’s revenues, 
financial condition or results of operations. 
The Company’s revenues, financial 
condition or results of operations may also 
be affected by fluctuations in customer 
buying or distribution patterns. These 
fluctuations may result from seasonality, 
pricing, wholesaler inventory objectives, 
or other factors. A significant portion of the 
Company’s revenues for certain products 
for treatment of rare diseases are also 
concentrated within a small number of 
customers. Changes in the buying patterns 
of those customers may have an adverse 
effect on the Company’s revenues, financial 
condition or results of operations.
Failure to comply with laws and 
regulations governing the sales and 
marketing of its products could 
materially impact Shire’s revenues 
and profitability
The Company engages in various 
marketing, promotional and educational 
activities pertaining to, as well as the sale 
of, pharmaceutical products and medical 
devices in a number of jurisdictions around 
the world. The promotion, marketing and 
sale of pharmaceutical products and 
medical devices is highly regulated and the 
sales and marketing practices of market 
participants, such as the Company, have 
been subject to increasing supervision by 
governmental authorities, and Shire 
believes that this trend will continue.
In the United States, the Company’s sales 
and marketing activities are monitored by 
a number of regulatory authorities and law 
enforcement agencies, including the U.S. 
Department of HHS, the FDA, the U.S. 
Department of Justice, the SEC and the 
DEA. These authorities and agencies and 
their equivalents in countries outside the 
United States have broad authority to 
investigate market participants for potential 
violations of laws relating to the sale, 
marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical 
products and medical devices, including 
the False Claims Act, the Anti-Kickback 
Statute, the UK Bribery Act of 2010 and the 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, among 
others, for alleged improper conduct, 
including corrupt payments to government 
officials, improper payments to medical 
professionals, off-label marketing of 
pharmaceutical products and medical 
devices, and the submission of false claims 
for reimbursement by the federal 
government. Healthcare companies may 
also be subject to enforcement actions or 
prosecution for such improper conduct. 
Any inquiries or investigations into the 
operations of, or enforcement or other 
regulatory action against, the Company 
by such authorities could result in 
significant defense costs, fines, penalties 
and injunctive or administrative remedies, 
distract management to the detriment of 
the business, result in the exclusion of 
190 Shire Annual Report 2017 certain products, or the Company, from 
government reimbursement programs 
or subject the Company to regulatory 
controls or government monitoring of its 
activities in the future. The Company is also 
subject to certain ongoing investigations 
by governmental agencies. For further 
information, see Note 25, Legal and 
Other Proceedings.
The Company’s products and product 
candidates face substantial competition 
in the product markets in which it 
operates
Shire faces substantial competition 
throughout its business from international 
and domestic biopharmaceutical 
companies of all sizes. Competition is 
primarily focused on cost-effectiveness, 
price, service, product effectiveness and 
quality, patient convenience and 
technological innovation.
Competition may increase further as 
existing competitors enhance their offerings 
or additional companies enter Shire’s 
markets or modify their existing products 
to compete directly with Shire’s products. 
If Shire’s competitors respond more quickly 
to new or emerging technologies and 
changes in customer requirements, the 
Company’s products may be rendered 
obsolete or non-competitive. If Shire’s 
competitors develop more effective or 
affordable products, or achieve earlier 
patent protection or product 
commercialization than the Company 
does, its operations will likely be negatively 
affected. If Shire is forced to reduce its 
prices due to increased competition, 
Shire’s business could become less 
profitable. The Company’s sales could be 
adversely affected if any of its contracts 
with customers (including with hospitals, 
treatment centers and other healthcare 
providers, distributors, group purchasing 
organizations and integrated delivery 
networks) are terminated due to increased 
competition or otherwise.
The Company’s patented products 
are subject to significant competition 
from generics
In addition to the competition referred to 
above, Shire faces significant competition 
from the manufacturers of generic drug 
products in all of its major markets and 
in the future may face competition with 
respect to its biologic and biosimilar 
products. The introduction of lower-priced 
generics by the Company’s competitors 
or their successful efforts in aggressively 
commercializing and marketing their 
alternative drug products pose significant 
challenges to maintaining Shire’s market 
share, revenues and sales growth.
For example, since 2009, generic versions 
of ADDERALL XR have been marketed in 
the United States, since 2014, generic 
versions of INTUNIV have been marketed 
in the United States and since the third 
quarter of 2017, generic versions of LIALDA 
and FOSRENOL have been marketed in the 
United States. As a result, product sales of 
ADDERALL XR, INTUNIV, LIALDA and 
FOSRENOL declined.
Factors which could cause further or more 
rapid declines in Shire’s product sales 
include:
 • the loss or earlier than expected 
expiration of intellectual property rights 
or regulatory exclusivity periods with 
respect to the Company’s branded 
products;
 • generic or authorized generic versions of 
these products capturing more of Shire’s 
branded market share than expected;
 • lower prices and the actual or perceived 
greater effectiveness or safety of generic 
drug products relative to Shire’s branded 
products;
 • the FDA approving additional ANDAs for 
these products or additional ANDAs for 
generic versions of these products 
which, if launched, would further reduce 
branded market share or impact the 
amount of Shire’s authorized generic 
product sales;
 • changes in reimbursement policies of 
third-party payers; or
 • changes to the level of sales deductions 
for branded Shire products for private or 
public payers.
Should any of the above developments 
occur, the resulting generic competition 
could reduce sales and market share of 
Shire’s branded products and have a 
material adverse effect on the Company’s 
revenues, financial condition or results 
of operations.
Adverse outcomes in legal matters and 
other disputes, including the Company’s 
ability to enforce and defend patents 
and other intellectual property rights 
required for its business, could have 
a material adverse effect on the 
Company’s revenues, financial condition 
or results of operations
During the ordinary course of its business 
the Company may be involved in claims, 
disputes and litigation with third parties, 
employees, regulatory agencies, 
governmental authorities and other parties. 
The range of matters of a legal nature that 
might arise is extremely broad but could 
include, without limitation, intellectual 
property claims and disputes, product 
liability claims and disputes, regulatory 
litigation, contract claims and disputes, 
employment claims and disputes, and 
tax or other governmental agency audits 
and disputes.
Any unfavorable outcome in such matters 
could adversely impact the Company’s 
ability to develop or commercialize its 
products, adversely affect the product 
sales and profitability of existing products, 
subject the Company to significant defense 
costs, fines, penalties, audit findings and 
injunctive or administrative remedies, 
distract management to the detriment of 
the business, result in the exclusion of 
certain products, or the Company, from 
government reimbursement programs or 
subject the Company to regulatory controls 
or government monitoring of its activities in 
the future. Any such outcomes could have 
a material adverse effect on the Company’s 
revenue, financial condition or results of 
operations. For further information, see 
Note 25, Legal and Other Proceedings.

Risk Factors continued
The Company may fail to obtain, 
maintain, enforce or defend the 
intellectual property rights required 
to conduct its business
The Company’s success depends upon 
its ability and the ability of its partners 
and licensors to protect their intellectual 
property rights. Where possible, the 
Company’s strategy is to register 
intellectual property rights, such as patents 
and trademarks. The Company also relies 
on various trade secrets, unpatented 
know-how and technological innovations 
and contractual arrangements with third 
parties to maintain its competitive position. 
The failure to obtain, maintain, enforce or 
defend such intellectual property rights, 
for any reason, could allow third parties 
to make competing products or impact the 
Company’s ability to develop, manufacture 
and market its own products on a 
commercially viable basis, or at all, which 
could have a material adverse effect on the 
Company’s revenues, financial condition or 
results of operations.
The Company intends to enforce its 
patent rights vigorously and believes that 
its commercial partners, licensors and 
third party manufacturers intend to enforce 
vigorously those patent rights they have 
licensed to the Company. However, the 
Company’s patent rights, and patent rights 
that the Company has licensed, may not 
provide valid patent protection sufficiently 
broad to prevent any third party from 
developing, using or commercializing 
products that are similar or functionally 
equivalent to the Company’s products or 
technologies. These patent rights may be 
challenged, revoked, invalidated, infringed 
or circumvented by third parties. Laws 
relating to such rights may in the future 
also be changed or withdrawn.
Additionally, the Company’s products, 
or the technologies or processes used to 
formulate or manufacture those products 
may now, or in the future, infringe the 
patent rights of third parties. It is also 
possible that third parties will obtain patent 
or other proprietary rights that might be 
necessary or useful for the development, 
manufacture or sale of the Company’s 
products. The Company may need to 
obtain licenses for intellectual property 
rights from others and may not be able 
to obtain these licenses on commercially 
reasonable terms, if at all.
The Company also relies on trade secrets 
and other un-patented proprietary 
information, which it generally seeks to 
protect by confidentiality and nondisclosure 
agreements with its employees, consultants, 
advisors and partners. These agreements 
may not effectively prevent disclosure of 
confidential information and may not provide 
the Company with an adequate remedy in 
the event of unauthorized disclosure. 
In addition, if the Company’s employees, 
scientific consultants or partners develop 
inventions or processes that may be 
applicable to the Company’s products under 
development, such inventions and processes 
will not necessarily become the Company’s 
property, but may remain the property 
of those persons or their employers.
The Company has filed applications to 
register various trademarks for use in 
connection with its products in various 
countries and also, with respect to certain 
products, relies on the trademarks of third 
parties. These trademarks may not afford 
adequate protection or the Company or 
the third parties may not have the financial 
resources to enforce their rights under 
these trademarks which may enable others 
to use the trademarks and dilute their value.
In the regular course of business, the 
Company is party to litigation or other 
proceedings relating to intellectual property 
rights. For details of material ongoing 
intellectual property litigation, see Note 25, 
Legal and Other Proceedings.
The Company faces intense competition 
for highly qualified personnel from other 
companies and organizations
The Company relies on recruiting and 
retaining highly skilled employees to meet 
its strategic objectives. The Company faces 
intense competition for highly qualified 
personnel and the supply of people with 
the requisite skills may be limited, generally 
or geographically. The range of skills 
required and the geographies in which they 
are required by the Company may also 
change over time as Shire’s business 
evolves. If the Company is unable to retain 
key personnel or attract new personnel 
with the requisite skills and experience, it 
could adversely affect the implementation 
of the Company’s strategic objectives and 
ultimately adversely impact the Company’s 
revenues, financial condition or results of 
operations. Recent acquisitions by the 
Company, including without limitation, 
the Dyax and Baxalta acquisitions, as well 
as internal reorganizations and transitions 
of our offices in Illinois, Pennsylvania, the 
United Kingdom and other locations, 
may increase the Company’s difficulty 
in recruiting and retaining employees.
Failure to successfully execute or attain 
strategic objectives from the Company’s 
acquisitions and growth strategy may 
adversely affect the Company’s financial 
condition and results of operations
The Company’s business depends to a 
significant extent on its ability to improve 
and expand its product pipeline through 
strategic acquisitions. Such improvements 
and expansions, however, are subject to 
the ability of the Company’s management 
to effectively identify appropriate strategic 
targets and effectuate the contemplated 
transactions, the availability and relative 
cost of acquisition opportunities as well 
as competition from other pharmaceutical 
companies seeking similar opportunities.
Moreover, even when such transactions 
are successfully executed, the Company 
may face subsequent difficulties in 
integrating the operations, infrastructure 
and personnel of acquired businesses 
and may experience unanticipated risks 
or liabilities that were not discovered, 
accurately disclosed or sufficiently 
assessed during the transactions’ due 
diligence process. Finally, even successfully 
acquired and integrated businesses may 
ultimately fail or fall short of achieving the 
Company’s strategic objectives for the 
transaction over the long term.
Any failures in the execution of a 
transaction, in the integration of an 
acquired business or in achieving the 
Company’s strategic objectives, including 
expected synergies, with respect to such 
transactions could result in slower growth, 
higher than expected costs, the recording 
of asset impairment charges and other 
actions which could adversely affect the 
Company’s business, financial condition 
and results of operations.
192 Shire Annual Report 2017 The Company has recently completed a 
number of strategic acquisitions, including 
Dyax in January 2016 and Baxalta in June 
2016. Furthermore, the Company is 
currently exploring, and expects to continue 
to explore, opportunities for additional 
strategic acquisitions or combinations 
in the future. Proposed and completed 
acquisitions, as well as any future 
acquisitions, each entail various risks, 
which include but are not limited to:
 • a proposed acquisition may not be 
consummated due to the occurrence of 
an event, change or other circumstances 
that gives rise to the termination of the 
applicable agreement;
 • a governmental, regulatory, board, 
shareholder or other approval required 
for a proposed acquisition may not be 
obtained, or may be obtained subject 
to conditions that are not anticipated, 
or another condition to the closing of 
a proposed acquisition may not be 
satisfied, resulting in delays or ultimate 
failure of consummating a proposed 
acquisition;
 • shareholders may initiate legal action 
to prevent or delay consummation of a 
proposed acquisition or to seek judicial 
reevaluation of a proposed acquisition’s 
consideration;
 • a lengthy, uncertain process when 
pursuing a potential combination could 
disrupt relationships between Shire and 
a target company’s customers, suppliers 
and employees, distract Shire’s or a 
target company’s management from 
operating its business, and could lead 
to additional and unanticipated costs;
 • a target company may be unable to 
retain and hire key personnel and/or 
maintain its relationships with customers, 
suppliers and other business partners 
pending the consummation of the 
proposed acquisition by Shire;
 • after the consummation of an acquisition, 
the Company may be unable to retain 
the acquired company’s key personnel, 
existing customers, suppliers and other 
business partners or attract new 
customers;
 • the businesses of an acquired company 
may be otherwise disrupted by the 
acquisition, including increased costs 
and diversion of its management’s time 
and resources;
 • failure to achieve the targeted growth 
and expected benefits of the acquisition 
if sales of an acquired company’s 
products are lower than anticipated, 
or these products cannot be successfully 
commercialized or cannot obtain 
necessary regulatory approvals;
 • any integration of an acquired company 
into Shire could be complex and 
time-consuming, and difficulties in 
effectuating these integrations may lead 
to the combined companies not being 
able to realize the expected operating 
efficiencies, cost savings, revenue 
enhancements, synergies or other 
benefits in the timeframe anticipated, 
or at all;
 • failure to successfully obtain regulatory 
approval of an acquired company’s late 
stage pipeline assets in a timely manner 
or at all, or to successfully commercialize 
such products after regulatory approval 
has been obtained;
 • undiscovered or unanticipated risks and 
liabilities, including legal and compliance 
related liabilities, may emerge in 
connection with an acquisition, or 
may be higher than anticipated; and
 • even after successfully completing an 
acquisition and integrating the acquired 
company’s businesses into Shire, the 
anticipated benefits of the combinations, 
including expected synergies, may 
ultimately prove less than anticipated.
Shire’s growth strategy depends in part 
upon its ability to expand its product 
portfolio through external 
collaborations, which, if unsuccessful, 
may adversely affect the development 
and sale of its products
Shire intends to continue to explore 
opportunities to enter into collaboration 
agreements and external alliances with 
other parties. These third party 
collaborators may include other 
biopharmaceutical companies, academic 
and research institutions, governments 
and government agencies and other public 
and private research organizations.
These third party collaborators are often 
directly responsible for clinical development 
under these types of arrangements, and 
the Company does not have the same 
level of decision-making capabilities for 
the prioritization and management of 
development-related activities as it does 
for its internal research and development 
activities. Failures by these partners to 
meet their contractual, regulatory, or 
other obligations to the Company, or any 
disruption in the relationships between the 
Company and these partners, could have 
a material adverse effect on the Company’s 
pipeline and business. In addition, the 
Company’s collaborative relationships 
for research and development extend for 
many years and may give rise to disputes 
regarding the relative rights, obligations and 
revenues of Shire and its partners, including 
the ownership of intellectual property and 
associated rights and obligations. These 
could result in the loss of intellectual 
property rights or other intellectual property 
protections, delay the development and 
sale of potential pharmaceutical products, 
and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation 
or arbitration.
Long-term public-private partnerships with 
governments and government agencies, 
including in certain emerging markets, may 
include technology transfers to support 
local manufacturing capacity and technical 
expertise. Shire cannot predict whether 
these types of transfers and arrangements 
will become more common in the future. 
These types of technology transfers and 
similar arrangements could have a material 
adverse effect on the Company’s results of 
operations as a result of lost exclusivity with 
respect to certain manufacturing and 
technical capabilities, particularly if this 
model becomes widely used. Public-private 
partnerships are also subject to risks of 
doing business with governments and 
government agencies, including risks 
related to sovereign immunity, shifts in the 
political environment, changing economic 
and legal conditions and social dynamics.

Risk Factors continued
A slowdown of global economic growth, 
or economic instability of countries in 
which the Company does business, 
could have negative consequences for 
the Company’s business and increase 
the risk of non-payment by the 
Company’s customers
Growth of the global pharmaceutical 
market has become increasingly tied to 
global economic growth. Accordingly, a 
substantial and lasting slowdown of the 
global economy, or major national 
economies, could negatively affect growth 
in the markets in which the Company 
operates. Such a slowdown, or any 
resultant austerity measures adopted by 
governments in response to a slowdown, 
could result in national governments 
making significant cuts to their public 
spending, including national healthcare 
budgets, or reducing the level of 
reimbursement they are willing and able 
to provide to the Company for its products 
and, as a result, adversely affect the 
Company’s revenues, financial condition 
or results of operations.
A slowdown of a nation’s economy could 
also lead to financial difficulties for some 
of the Company’s significant customers, 
including national governments, and result 
in a greater risk of delayed orders or 
payments, defaults or non-payments of 
outstanding payment obligations by the 
Company’s customers in that country, 
which could adversely affect the 
Company’s revenues, financial condition 
or results of operations.
Changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates and interest rates could have a 
material adverse effect on Shire’s 
operating results and liquidity
Shire reports its financial results in U.S. 
dollars, but generates a substantial portion 
of its revenue (approximately 36% of its 
total revenue in 2017) outside the United 
States. As a result, Shire’s financial results 
may be adversely affected by fluctuations 
in foreign currency exchange rates. Shire 
cannot predict with any certainty changes 
in foreign currency exchange rates or the 
ability of the Company to mitigate these 
risks. Shire may experience additional 
volatility as a result of inflationary pressures 
and other macroeconomic factors in 
certain emerging market countries. 
Shire is also exposed to changes in interest 
rates, and Shire’s ability to access the 
money markets and capital markets could 
be impeded if adverse liquidity market 
conditions occur.
For discussion of the financial impact of 
foreign exchange rate and interest rate 
fluctuations, and the ways and extent to 
which Shire attempts to mitigate such 
impact, see Note 16, Financial Instruments, 
to the consolidated financial statements.
The Company is subject to evolving and 
complex tax laws, which may result in 
additional liabilities that may adversely 
affect the Company’s financial condition 
or results of operations
The Company is subject to evolving and 
complex tax laws in the jurisdictions in 
which it operates, and routinely obtains 
advice on matters, including the tax 
treatment of the break fee received in 
connection with the terminated offer for 
Shire by AbbVie, Inc. (AbbVie) in 2014. 
Significant judgment is required in 
determining the Company’s tax liabilities, 
and the Company’s tax returns are 
periodically examined by various tax 
authorities. The Company regularly 
assesses the likelihood of outcomes 
resulting from these examinations to 
determine the adequacy of its accrual for 
tax contingencies; however, due to the 
complexity of tax matters, the ultimate 
resolution of any tax matters may result in 
payments greater or less than amounts 
accrued. In addition, the Company may be 
affected by changes in tax laws, including 
tax rate changes, new tax laws, and revised 
tax law interpretations in domestic and 
foreign jurisdictions and between 
jurisdictions, including by the EU.
If a marketed product fails to work 
effectively or causes adverse side 
effects, this could result in damage to 
the Company’s reputation, the 
withdrawal of the product and legal 
action against the Company
Unanticipated side effects or unfavorable 
publicity from complaints concerning any 
of the Company’s products, or those of its 
competitors, could have an adverse effect 
on the Company’s ability to obtain or 
maintain regulatory approvals or 
successfully market its products. 
The testing, manufacturing, marketing and 
sales of pharmaceutical products and 
medical devices entail a risk of product 
liability claims, product recalls, litigation and 
associated adverse publicity. The cost of 
defending against such claims is expensive 
even when the claims are not merited. 
A successful product liability claim against 
the Company could require the Company 
to pay a substantial monetary award. The 
Company does not carry product liability 
insurance for its products due to the 
Company’s analysis of the risk, frequency 
and severity of a loss and the cost of 
insurance for the risk. Accordingly, if the 
Company does not have sufficient financial 
resources to satisfy a liability resulting from 
such a claim or to fund the legal defense of 
such a claim, it could become insolvent. 
Moreover, an adverse judgment in a 
product liability suit could generate 
substantial negative publicity about the 
Company’s products and business and 
inhibit or prevent commercialization of other 
products. In addition, failure to effectively 
identify, aggregate, analyze, report, and 
protect adverse event data, and/or fully 
comply with relevant laws, rules, and 
regulations around adverse event reporting 
could jeopardize patient safety and expose 
the Company to penalties, fines, and 
systemic reputational damage. 
It is crucial that Shire report any adverse 
events to keep customers and patients 
informed and safe. Specifically, in regards 
to the various patient support programs, 
Shire risks noncompliance in safety-
reporting and/or reporting of incomplete 
safety information if adverse events are not 
documented as part of the patient support 
programs.
The Company is dependent on 
information technology and its systems 
and infrastructure face certain risks, 
including from service disruptions, the 
loss of sensitive or confidential 
information, cyber-attacks and other 
security breaches or data leakages that 
could have a material adverse effect on 
the Company’s revenues, financial 
condition or results of operations
The Company relies to a large extent upon 
sophisticated information technology 
systems to operate its businesses. In the 
ordinary course of business, the Company 
collects, stores and transmits large 
amounts of confidential information 
194 Shire Annual Report 2017 (including, but not limited to, personal 
information and intellectual property), and 
it is critical that the Company does so in 
a  secure manner to maintain the 
confidentiality and integrity of such 
confidential information. The size and 
complexity of the Company’s information 
technology and information security 
systems, and those of third-party vendors 
with whom the Company contracts (and 
the large amounts of confidential 
information that is stored on them), make 
such systems potentially vulnerable to 
service interruptions or to security 
breaches from inadvertent or intentional 
actions by the Company’s employees or 
vendors, or from attacks by malicious 
third parties.
The Company and its vendors’ 
sophisticated information technology 
operations are spread across multiple, 
sometimes inconsistent platforms, which 
pose difficulties in maintaining data integrity 
across systems. The ever-increasing use 
and evolution of technology, including 
cloud-based computing, creates 
opportunities for the unintentional 
dissemination or intentional destruction 
of confidential information stored in the 
Company’s systems. The Company and its 
vendors could also be susceptible to third 
party attacks on their information security 
systems, which attacks are of ever 
increasing levels of sophistication and are 
made by groups and individuals with a wide 
range of motives and expertise, including 
criminal groups, “hackers” and others. 
While the Company has taken steps to 
protect such information and invested 
heavily in information technology, there 
can be no assurance that these efforts will 
prevent service interruptions or security 
breaches in its systems, the loss of data or 
other confidential information due to a lack 
of redundant backup systems, or the 
unauthorized or inadvertent wrongful use 
or disclosure of confidential information 
that could adversely affect the Company’s 
business operations or result in the loss, 
dissemination, or misuse of critical or 
sensitive information.
A breach of the Company’s security 
measures or the accidental loss, 
inadvertent disclosure, unapproved 
dissemination, misappropriation or misuse 
of trade secrets, proprietary information, 
or other confidential information, whether 
as a result of theft, hacking, fraud, trickery 
or other forms of deception, or for any other 
cause, could enable others to produce 
competing products, use the Company’s 
proprietary technology or information, and/
or adversely affect the Company’s business 
position. Further, any such interruption, 
security breach, loss or disclosure of 
confidential information, could result in 
financial, legal, business, and reputational 
harm to the Company and could have a 
material adverse effect on the Company’s 
revenues, financial condition or results 
of operations.
In addition, legislators and/or regulators in 
countries in which the Company operates 
are increasingly adopting or revising 
privacy, information security and data 
protection laws, as well as focusing on 
increased privacy-related enforcement 
activity, that potentially could have a 
significant impact on the Company’s 
current and planned privacy, data 
protection and information security-related 
practices, its collection, use, sharing, 
retention and safeguarding of consumer 
and/or employee information, and some 
of its current or planned business activities.
Shire faces risks relating to the 
expected exit of the United Kingdom 
from the European Union
On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom 
held a remain-or-leave referendum on the 
United Kingdom’s membership within the 
European Union, the result of which favored 
the exit of the United Kingdom from the 
European Union (Brexit). A process of 
negotiation will likely determine the future 
terms of the United Kingdom’s relationship 
with the European Union, as well as 
whether the United Kingdom will be able to 
continue to benefit from the European 
Union’s free trade and similar agreements. 
The timing of the Brexit and potential 
impact of Brexit on Shire’s market share, 
sales, profitability and results of operations 
is unclear. Depending on the terms of 
Brexit, economic conditions in the United 
Kingdom, the European Union and global 
markets may be adversely affected by 
reduced growth and volatility. The 
uncertainty before, during and after the 
period of negotiation is also expected to 
have a negative economic impact and 
increase volatility in the markets, particularly 
in the Eurozone. Such volatility and negative 
economic impact could, in turn, adversely 
affect the Company’s revenues, financial 
condition or results of operations.
Our ongoing strategic review of our 
Neuroscience franchise may distract 
management and employees and 
may not lead to improved operating 
performance or financial results; there 
can be no guarantee that, once 
completed, our strategic review will 
result in any additional strategic 
changes beyond those that have 
already been announced
In August 2017, Shire announced that it 
was conducting a strategic review of its 
Neuroscience business. On January 8, 
2018, following the first stage of this review, 
Shire announced that its Board has 
concluded that the Neuroscience business 
warrants additional focus and investment 
and that there is a strong business rationale 
for creating two distinct business divisions 
within Shire: a Rare Disease division and 
a Neuroscience division. Shire expects to 
report the operational performance metrics 
of each division separately beginning with 
the first quarter of 2018. The second stage 
of the review will include continuing to 
evaluate all strategic alternatives, including 
the merits of an independent listing for 
each of the two divisions.
During the course of our strategic review, 
our management and employees may be 
distracted, which could impact our 
business. Further, we may incur additional 
costs in undertaking the strategic review or 
executing any conclusion reached as a 
result of the review. Moreover, operating 
our business as distinct divisions may not 
lead to improved operating performance or 
financial results for one or both businesses 
or meet the expectations that we have 
communicated for those businesses or the 
Company as a whole. Finally, there can be 
no guarantee that, once completed, our 
strategic review will result in any additional 
strategic changes beyond those that have 
already been announced.

Risks Related to the Combination 
with Baxalta Incorporated
The Company may not successfully 
integrate the businesses of Shire 
and Baxalta
Achieving the anticipated benefits of the 
combination of Shire and Baxalta will 
depend in part upon whether the two 
companies integrate their businesses in 
an effective and efficient manner. The 
Company may not be able to accomplish 
this integration process successfully or 
realize the expected synergies as planned. 
The integration of businesses is complex 
and time-consuming. The difficulties that 
could be encountered include the following:
 • integrating personnel, operations and 
systems, while maintaining focus on 
selling and promoting existing and newly 
acquired or produced products;
 • coordinating geographically dispersed 
organizations;
 • distraction of management and 
employees from operations;
 • changes or conflicts in corporate culture;
 • management’s inability to manage a 
substantial increase in the number of 
employees;
 • management’s inability to train and 
integrate personnel, who may have 
limited experience with the respective 
companies’ business lines and products, 
and to deliver a consistent message 
regarding diseases treated by the 
Company;
 • retaining existing customers and 
attracting new customers;
 • retaining existing employees and 
attracting new employees
 • maintaining business relationships; 
 • inefficiencies associated with the 
integration and management of the 
operations of the two companies.
In addition, there have been and will 
continue to be integration costs and 
non-recurring transaction costs (such 
as fees paid to legal, financial, accounting 
and other advisors and other fees paid in 
connection with the combination) 
associated with the combination, including 
costs associated with combining 
operations and achieving the expected 
synergies as planned, and such costs 
may be significant.
An inability to realize the full extent of the 
anticipated benefits of the combination 
of Shire and Baxalta, including estimated 
cost synergies, as well as any delays 
encountered in the integration process 
and realizing such benefits, could have 
an adverse effect upon the revenues, 
level of expenses and operating results 
of the Company, which may materially 
adversely affect the value of the Company’s 
ordinary shares and American Depository 
Shares (ADSs).
Shire has incurred significant additional 
indebtedness in connection with the 
acquisition, which has decreased the 
Company’s business flexibility and 
increased its interest expense. All of the 
Company’s debt obligations have 
priority over the Company’s ordinary 
shares and ADSs with respect to 
payment in the event of a liquidation, 
dissolution or winding up
As of December 31, 2017, Shire had gross 
debt of approximately $19.6 billion 
comprising $12.1 billion of SAIIDAC Notes 
issued in September 2016, $5.0 billion of 
Baxalta Notes assumed with the acquisition 
of Baxalta, $1.2 billion outstanding 
borrowing under the term loan facility and 
$810.0 million outstanding borrowing under 
the $2.1 billion Revolving Credit Facility and 
certain capital lease and other debt 
obligations. For further information, refer to 
Note 18, Borrowings and Capital Leases, to 
these consolidated financial statements.
The Company’s aggregate indebtedness 
could have the effect, among other things, 
of reducing the Company’s flexibility to 
respond to changing business and 
economic conditions. The Company is 
required to abide by certain covenants 
within the various financing arrangements, 
which if not adhered to, would require 
immediate repayment of the indebtedness.
Moreover, the Company may be required to 
raise additional financing. The Company’s 
ability to arrange additional financing and 
the costs of that financing will depend on, 
among other factors, the Company’s 
financial position and performance, as well 
as prevailing market conditions and other 
factors beyond Shire’s control.
In any liquidation, dissolution or winding up 
of Shire, the Company’s ordinary shares 
and ADSs would rank below all debt claims 
against Shire or any of its subsidiaries. As a 
result, holders of the Company’s ordinary 
shares and ADSs will not be entitled to 
receive any payment or other distribution 
of assets upon any liquidation or dissolution 
until after Shire’s obligations to its debt 
holders, which rank senior to the 
Company’s ordinary shares and ADSs, 
have been satisfied.
Uncertainties associated with the 
combination may cause a loss of 
employees and may otherwise affect 
the future business and operations of 
Shire and the combined company
Uncertainty about the effect of the 
combination on employees and customers 
may have an adverse effect on the 
Company following the combination. 
These consequent uncertainties may impair 
the Company’s ability to retain and motivate 
key personnel and could also cause 
customers, suppliers, licensees, partners 
and other business partners to defer 
entering into contracts with, making other 
decisions concerning, or seeking to change 
existing business relationships with the 
Company. Because the Company depends 
on the experience and industry knowledge 
of their executives and other key personnel 
to execute their business plans, the 
Company may be unable to meet its 
strategic objectives.
Baxalta only operated as an 
independent company from July 1, 2015, 
until the consummation of its merger 
with Shire on June 3, 2016, and 
Baxalta’s historical financial information 
is not necessarily representative of the 
results that Baxalta would have 
achieved as a separate, publicly traded 
company, and may not be a reliable 
indicator of future results of Baxalta. 
Moreover, any pro forma financial 
information published by the Company 
is not necessarily representative of the 
results that the Company would have 
achieved, and may not be a reliable 
indicator of future results
Any historical financial information about 
Baxalta prior to July 1, 2015, refers to 
Baxalta’s business as operated by and 
integrated with Baxter. Baxalta’s historical 
and pro forma financial information for such 
periods was derived from the consolidated 
financial statements and accounting 
records of Baxter. In addition, certain pro 
forma financial information for the Company 
has incorporated Baxalta’s historical 
financial information for such periods. 
Accordingly, such historical and pro forma 
196 Shire Annual Report 2017 financial information of Baxalta or the 
Company does not necessarily reflect the 
financial condition, results of operations or 
cash flows that Baxalta would have 
achieved as a separate, publicly traded 
company during the periods presented, or 
those that Shire would have achieved had 
the combination occurred as assumed for 
the preparation of the pro forma financial 
information. As a result, the Company’s 
pro forma financial information is not 
necessarily representative of the results 
that the Company will achieve after the 
merger with Baxalta, and may not be a 
reliable indicator of future results.
Baxter may not satisfy its obligations 
under various transaction agreements 
that have been executed as part of the 
separation or Shire may fail to have 
necessary systems and services in 
place when certain of the transaction 
agreements expire
In connection with Baxalta’s separation 
from Baxter, the parties entered into various 
agreements, including a separation and 
distribution agreement, a transition services 
agreement, a tax matters agreement, a 
manufacturing and supply agreement, 
an employee matters agreement, license 
agreements and commercial agreements. 
The separation and distribution agreement, 
the tax matters agreement and employee 
matters agreement determined the allocation 
of assets and liabilities between the 
companies following the separation for 
those respective areas and provide for 
indemnifications related to liabilities and 
obligations. The transition services 
agreement sets forth certain services to be 
performed by each company for the benefit 
of the other for a period of time after the 
separation. Baxalta and now Shire will rely 
on Baxter to satisfy its performance and 
payment obligations under these 
agreements. If Baxter does not satisfy 
its obligations under these agreements, 
including its indemnification obligations, 
Shire may not be able to meet its financial 
reporting requirements and/or could incur 
operational difficulties or losses as they relate 
to Baxalta’s businesses. If Shire is unable to 
successfully integrate the Baxalta businesses 
into Shire’s systems and services, or if Shire 
does not have agreements with other 
providers of these services once certain 
transaction agreements expire, Shire may 
not be able to operate the Baxalta 
businesses effectively and Shire’s profitability 
may decline.
The acquisition of Baxalta could result 
in significant liability to the Company 
if the combination causes the spin-off 
of Baxalta from Baxter or a Later 
Distribution, as defined below, to 
be taxable
In connection with the signing of the 
merger agreement, Baxter, Shire and 
Baxalta entered into the Letter Agreement, 
which, among other things, supplements 
certain aspects of the tax matters 
agreement referenced above. Under the 
Letter Agreement, from and after the 
closing of the merger, Baxalta agreed to 
indemnify, and the Company agreed to 
guarantee such indemnity to, Baxter and 
each of its affiliates and each of their 
respective officers, directors and 
employees against certain tax-related 
losses attributable to, or resulting from, 
in whole or in part, the merger. If the 
contribution of property by Baxter in one 
or more transfers to Baxalta in exchange 
for shares of Baxalta common stock, cash, 
and the assumption of certain liabilities, 
together with the distribution by Baxter on 
July 1, 2015, of approximately 80.5% of the 
shares of Baxalta common stock to 
shareholders of Baxter (spin-off), Baxter’s 
distribution of cash received from Baxalta 
to its creditors and/or a Later Distribution, 
collectively, the “Baxter Transactions”, are 
determined to be taxable as a result, in 
whole or in part, of the merger (for example, 
if the merger is deemed to be part of a 
plan, or series of related transactions, that 
includes the Baxter Transactions), Baxter 
and its shareholders could incur significant 
tax liabilities. Under the tax matters 
agreement, and the Letter Agreement, 
Baxalta and the Company may be required 
to indemnify Baxter for any such tax 
liabilities. Baxter’s waiver of the provisions 
under the tax matters agreement restricting 
Baxalta’s ability to enter into and 
consummate the merger will not relieve 
Baxalta or the Company of its obligation to 
indemnify Baxter if the merger causes any 
of the Baxter Transactions to be taxable.
In connection with the signing and closing 
of the merger agreement, the Company 
received an opinion from Cravath, Swaine 
& Moore LLP (Cravath), tax counsel to the 
Company, to the effect that the merger will 
not cause the Baxter Transactions to fail to 
qualify as tax-free to Baxter and its 
shareholders under Sections 355, 361 and 
368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986, as amended.
The tax opinions referred to in the 
immediately preceding paragraph are 
based upon various factual representations 
and assumptions, as well as certain 
undertakings made by the Shire, Baxter 
and Baxalta. If any of the factual 
representations or the assumptions in the 
tax opinions are untrue or incomplete in 
any material respect, an undertaking is 
not complied with or the facts upon which 
the tax opinions are based are materially 
different from the facts at the time of the 
merger, the opinions may not be valid. 
Moreover, opinions of counsel are not 
binding on the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS). As a result, the conclusions 
expressed in the tax opinions could be 
challenged by the IRS. None of Shire, 
Baxalta or Baxter has requested a ruling 
from the IRS regarding the impact of the 
merger on the tax treatment of the Baxter 
Transactions, since such rulings are not 
made by the IRS. Further, the tax opinions 
do not address all tax aspects of the 
spin-off, a Later Distribution and other 
related transactions and it is possible the 
Company may be obligated to indemnify 
Baxter despite the continuing validity of 
the tax opinions.
The Company’s indemnification obligations 
to Baxter and its affiliates, officers, directors 
and employees under the tax matters 
agreement and letter agreement are not 
limited in amount or subject to any cap. 
If Baxalta or the Company is required to 
indemnify Baxter and its affiliates and their 
respective officers, directors and employees 
under the circumstances set forth in the tax 
matters agreement, as supplemented by 
the Letter Agreement, it could have a 
material adverse effect on the Company.
The “Later Distributions” includes the 
following transactions that were undertaken 
by Baxter prior to the closing of the merger: 
(i) two debt-for-equity exchanges (and 
related underwritten offerings) with respect 
to Baxalta shares, (ii) an offer to exchange 
Baxter shares for Baxalta shares, and (iii) a 
contribution of Baxalta shares to Baxter’s 
U.S. pension fund, which, in each case, 
were undertaken prior to the earlier of any 
Baxalta or Company stockholder vote with 
respect to the merger and that were 
intended to be part of a plan that includes 
the spin-off.
 197 Shire Annual Report 2017
 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information In connection with the merger with 
Baxalta, the separation and the Later 
Distributions could result in significant 
liability to the Company due to Baxalta’s 
spin-off from Baxter
The Baxter Transactions are intended to 
qualify for tax-free treatment to Baxter and 
its stockholders under Sections 355, 361, 
and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. Completion 
of the separation was conditioned upon, 
among other things, the receipt of a private 
letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain 
issues relating to the tax-free treatment of 
the Baxter Transactions. Although the IRS 
private letter ruling is generally binding on 
the IRS, the continuing validity of such ruling 
is subject to the accuracy of factual 
representations and assumptions made in 
the ruling. Completion of the initial distribution 
of Baxalta shares on July 1, 2015, was also 
conditioned upon Baxter’s receipt of a tax 
opinion from KPMG LLP , or KPMG regarding 
certain aspects of the separation not 
covered by the IRS private letter ruling. 
The opinion was based upon various factual 
representations and assumptions, as well 
as certain undertakings made by Baxter and 
Baxalta. If any of the factual representations 
or assumptions in the IRS private letter ruling 
or tax opinion are untrue or incomplete in any 
material respect, an undertaking is 
not complied with, or the facts upon which 
the IRS private letter ruling or tax opinion are 
based are materially different from the actual 
facts relating to the Baxter Transactions, the 
opinion or IRS private letter ruling may not be 
valid. Moreover, opinions of a tax advisor are 
not binding on the IRS. As a result, the 
conclusions expressed in the opinion of a 
tax advisor could be successfully challenged 
by the IRS.
If the Baxter Transactions are determined to 
be taxable, Baxter and its stockholders 
could incur significant tax liabilities, and 
under the tax matters agreement and the 
letter agreement which were assumed by 
Shire following the merger, the Company 
may be required to indemnify Baxter for any 
liabilities incurred by Baxter if the liabilities are 
caused by any action or inaction undertaken 
by Baxalta following the separation (including 
as a result of the merger).
Certain Baxalta agreements may 
contain change of control provisions 
that may have been triggered by the 
merger that, if acted upon or not 
waived, could cause the Company to 
lose the benefit of such agreement and 
incur liabilities or replacement costs, 
which could have a material adverse 
effect on the Company
Prior to and following the merger, Baxalta 
and its affiliates are each party to various 
agreements with third parties, including 
certain license agreements, business 
development-related agreements, 
production and distribution related 
agreements, bonding/financing facilities, 
contracts for the performance of services 
material to the operations of Baxalta and/or 
its affiliates, IT contracts, technology 
licenses and employment agreements 
that may contain change of control 
provisions that may have been triggered 
upon the closing of the merger. 
Agreements with change of control 
provisions typically provide for or permit 
the termination of the agreement upon the 
occurrence of a change of control of one 
of the parties which can be waived by the 
relevant counterparties. In the event that 
there is such a contract or arrangement 
requiring a consent or waiver in relation 
to the merger for which such consent or 
waiver was not obtained, the Company 
could lose the benefit of the underlying 
agreement and incur liabilities or 
replacement costs, which could have an 
adverse effect on the Company.
New regulations issued by the U.S. 
Department of Treasury may impact 
the Company following the merger 
with Baxalta
On April 4, 2016, the U.S. Department of 
Treasury issued new regulations applicable 
to acquisitions of U.S. companies by 
non-U.S. companies. These regulations, 
among other things, change the manner 
in which thresholds contained within the 
so-called “anti-inversion” rules that govern 
how the combined company will be taxed 
are calculated. These calculations are 
affected by the merger and could impact 
any future acquisitions of U.S. companies 
funded in whole or in part by Shire 
securities. These calculations are 
complicated and depend on several factors. 
Moreover, the U.S. Department of Treasury 
also introduced proposed “earnings 
stripping” regulations as revised on October 
13, 2016 that may, among other things, 
cause certain related-party debt 
instruments issued by a U.S. corporation to 
be treated as equity, resulting in the loss of 
deductible interest payments for U.S. 
federal income tax purposes.
These regulations are newly issued and 
complex, and as such their application to 
any particular set of facts is uncertain. Shire 
believes that the regulations are not likely 
to affect the expected tax position of the 
Company following the acquisition of 
Baxalta, which belief is based on, among 
other things, facts that may change or 
judgments that may prove to be incorrect 
and, if incorrect, could have an adverse 
impact on the expected tax position of 
the Company.
Furthermore, the U.S. tax authorities 
could issue additional guidance as to the 
application of these regulations or issue 
new regulations that could have an adverse 
effect on the expected tax position of 
the Company.

 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Other Information
The Directors present their annual report and the audited financial 
statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Principal activity and business review
Shire plc (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively 
referred to as either “Shire”, or the “Group”) is the leading global 
biotechnology company focused on serving people with rare 
diseases and other highly specialized conditions. 
The Company is the ultimate parent of the Group and its principal 
activity is that of a holding company.
The Group has grown both organically and through acquisition, 
completing a series of major transactions that have brought 
therapeutic, geographic and pipeline growth and diversification. 
The Group will continue to conduct its own research and 
development (R&D) focused on rare diseases, as well as evaluate 
companies, products and pipeline opportunities that offer a 
strategic fit and have the potential to deliver value to all of the 
Group’s stakeholders: patients, physicians, policy makers, payers, 
partners, investors and employees.
The principal legislation under which the Company operates is the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and regulations made thereunder. 
The Ordinary Shares of the Company are listed on the London 
Stock Exchange in the UK, and American Depositary Shares (ADS), 
representing three Ordinary Shares of the Company, (evidenced by 
an American Depositary Receipt issued by Shire’s Depositary, 
Citibank, N.A.) are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market in 
the USA.
Business review
The Business review of the Group can be found in the consolidated 
financial statements and Annual Report and Accounts of the 
Company for the year to December 31, 2017 , prepared in accordance 
with United Kingdom Listing Authority requirements (the ”Shire 
Annual Report”); in the Chairman’s review on pages 4 and 5; the 
Chief Executive Officer’s review on pages 6 to 9; and the Review 
of the Business on pages 44 to 55. The Shire Annual Report also 
provides a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the Company and the Group, as well as the Group’s risk 
management objectives and policies that are in place to assist in 
mitigating the potential impact.
During the year, the Company continued in its capacity as the parent 
company for the Group in the management of its subsidiaries.
The Company is tax resident in the Republic of Ireland.
Key performance indicators 
The Company’s key performance indicators are the same as the 
Group’s. For details of the Group’s key performance indicators see 
page 16 in the Shire Annual Report.
Income Access Share arrangements
In 2008, Shire put in place and continues to operate Income 
Access Share (‘IAS’) arrangements enabling shareholders to 
choose whether they receive their dividends from the company, 
which is tax resident in the Republic of Ireland, or from a company 
tax resident in the UK. Further details of the IAS arrangements can 
be found in Note 26 of the Shire Annual Report.
Results and dividends
A loss on ordinary activities before taxation of $161.2 million was 
recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 (year ended 
December 31, 2016: loss before taxation of $173.3 million). The 
decrease in the loss is primarily due to a decrease in professional 
fees within administrative expenses, offset in part by an increase 
in interest payable on loans made within the group. 
The net assets of the Company increased from $31,666.1 million 
for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $31,677.6 million for the 
year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the capital 
contribution relating to share-based payments, offset in part by the 
loss recorded in the year.
Dividends paid and dividend policy
The Company paid dividends amounting to $35.8 million in the 
year (2016: $20.7 million). In accordance with IAS arrangements, 
Shire Biopharmaceuticals Holdings paid dividends totalling $245.5 
million (2016: $150.6 million) to those shareholders who choose to 
receive their dividends from a company tax resident in the UK.
A first interim dividend for the six months to June 30, 2017 of 5.08 
cents (3.85 pence) per Ordinary Share, equivalent to 15.27 cents 
per ADS, was paid in October 2017. The Board has resolved to pay 
a second interim dividend of 29.79 cents (21.58 pence) per 
Ordinary Share equivalent to 89.37 cents per ADS for the six 
months to December 31, 2017.
This is consistent with Shire’s stated policy of paying a dividend 
semi-annually, set in U.S. cents per ordinary share. Typically, the 
first interim payment each year will be higher than the previous 
year’s first interim U.S. dollar dividend. Dividend growth for the full 
year will be reviewed by the Board when the second interim 
dividend is determined.
Liquidity, cash flow and going concern
The Company and the Group’s business activities, together with 
the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out in the Chairman’s review, Chief Executive 
Officer’s review and Financial review. The financial position of the 
Company and the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the Liquidity and capital 
resources section of the Financial review of the Shire Annual 
Report and also see Note 18. The Financial review also includes 
information in respect of the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing capital; its financial risk management 
objectives; details of its hedging activity; and its exposures to 
credit risk and liquidity risk. 
Directors’ Report
For the year ended December 31, 2017
200 Shire Annual Report 2017 The Company’s funding requirements depend on a number 
of factors, including the timing and extent of its development 
programs; corporate, business and product acquisitions; the level 
of resources required for the expansion of certain manufacturing 
and marketing capabilities as the product base expands; increases 
in accounts receivable and inventory which may arise with any 
increase in product sales; competitive and technological 
developments; the timing and cost of obtaining required regulatory 
approvals for new products; the timing and quantum of milestone 
payments on business combinations, in-licenses and collaborative 
projects; the timing and quantum of tax and dividend payments; 
the timing and quantum of purchases by the Employee Benefit 
Trust (EBT) of Shire shares in the market to satisfy awards granted 
under Shire’s employee share plans; and the amount of cash 
generated from sales of Shire’s products and royalty receipts.
An important part of the Group’s business strategy is to protect 
its products and technologies through the use of patents, 
proprietary technologies and trademarks, to the extent available. 
The Company intends to defend its intellectual property and as 
a result may need cash for funding the cost of litigation.
The Company finances its activities through cash generated from 
operating activities; credit facilities; private and public offerings of 
equity and debt securities; and the proceeds of asset or 
investment disposals.
The Group’s Consolidated Balance Sheets included $472.4 million 
of Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017.
The Group has a revolving credit facility (RCF) of $2.1 billion 
which matures in 2021, $810.0 million of which was utilized as of 
December 31, 2017. The RCF incorporates a $250 million U.S. 
dollar and Euro swingline facility operating as a sub-limit thereof. 
In connection with the acquisition of Dyax, the Group entered into 
a $5.6 billion amortizing term loan facility in November 2015. As 
of December 31, 2017, $1.2 billion of this term loan facility was 
outstanding. The facility matures on November 2, 2018.
In connection with the acquisition of Baxalta, the Group assumed 
$5.0 billion of unsecured senior notes previously issued by Baxalta, 
of which $750.0 million is due within the next twelve months and 
issued $12.1 billion of unsecured senior notes in September 2016, 
of which none are due for repayment in the next twelve months. 
The details of these debt agreements are presented in Note 18, 
Borrowings and Capital Leases, to the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements.
In addition, the Group also has access to certain short-term 
uncommitted lines of credit which are available to utilize from time 
to time to provide short-term cash management flexibility. As of 
December 31, 2017, these lines of credit were not utilized.
The Company may also engage in financing activities from time 
to time, including accessing the debt or equity capital markets.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly the Directors 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements. Further details regarding the 
adoption of the going concern basis can be found in the 
accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements.

Directors’ liability insurance and indemnification
In the year under review, the Group maintained an insurance policy 
for its Directors and Officers in respect of liabilities arising out of 
any act, error or omission whilst acting in their capacity as 
Directors or Officers. Qualifying third-party indemnity provisions 
were also in place during the year under review for the benefit of 
Directors in relation to certain losses and liabilities which they may 
potentially incur to third-parties in the course of their duties. These 
remain in force at the date of this report.
Auditor
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval of this 
report confirms that:
 • so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
 • the Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have 
taken as a Director in order to make himself/herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditor is aware of that information.
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office 
as auditor and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

 201 Shire Annual Report 2017
 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Other Information
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected 
to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the 
directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that 
period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are 
required to:
 • select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 • make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 • state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements;
 • prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 • the financial statements, prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit 
or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; 
 • the Strategic Report within the Shire Annual Report includes a 
fair review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face; 
and
 • the Shire Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a 
whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.

Directors’ responsibilities in the 
preparation of the financial statements
For the year ended December 31, 2017
202 Shire Annual Report 2017 In our opinion the financial statements of Shire plc 
(the “Company”): 
 • give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of its loss for the year 
then ended;
 • have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, 
including FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard 
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland”; and
 • have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
The financial statements that we have audited comprise:
 • the statement of comprehensive income;
 • the statement of financial position;
 • the statement of changes in equity; 
 • the statement of cash flows; and
 • the related notes 1 to 18.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable Jersey law and United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice — Financial Reporting Standard 
102 (‘FRS102’).
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described 
in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements 
in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed 
public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We confirm 
that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
were not provided to the Company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We are required by ISAs (UK) to report in respect of the following 
matters where:
 • the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or
 • the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any 
identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
about the Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve 
months from the date when the financial statements are 
authorised for issue.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which 
had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation 
of resources in the audit, and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Investment in Subsidiaries
Key audit  
matter 
description 
There is a key audit matter related to the size of the 
Company’s investments of $38.4bn (2016: $38.3bn) in Shire 
Pharmaceutical Holdings Ireland Limited and Shire 
Regenerative Medicine Inc which are disclosed in note 8.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to 
the risk
We have challenged the directors’ impairment analysis and 
have considered the valuation of the Company’s subsidiaries 
against other indicators of value, such as the overall market 
capitalisation of the Shire group.
Key 
observations
The disclosures associated with this matter were found to 
be fair and balanced and there was no indication of 
impairment identified from our procedures performed.

Management override of controls
Key audit  
matter 
description 
There is a risk related to management being in a position 
to perpetrate fraud because of management’s ability to 
manipulate accounting records and prepare fraudulent 
financial statements by overriding controls that otherwise 
appear to be operating effectively.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to 
the risk
We performed the following procedures to address 
management override of controls:
 • tested the appropriateness of, and rationale for, journal 
entries that had potentially fraudulent characteristics;
 • reviewed accounting estimates for bias including 
evaluating both individually and collectively the impact 
on the financial statements; and
 • evaluated the business rationale for significant 
transactions outside the normal course of business 
or that otherwise appeared unusual.
Key 
observations
We found management’s response to the increased risk 
to be appropriate and no further findings have arisen as 
a result of our specific focus in this area.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be 
changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgment, we determined materiality for 
the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Company 
materiality
$120 million (2016: $50 million)
Basis for 
determining 
materiality
We have reconsidered materiality in the current year, and 
have determined materiality for the Company to be $120 
million (2016: $50 million). This represents 0.4% (2016: 
0.2%) of the net assets of the Company. In addition we 
consider the materiality of the Company in the context of the 
group materiality and have capped company materiality at 
48% of that of the group (2016: 33%).
Rationale for  
the benchmark 
applied
We consider net assets the key benchmark used by 
members of the Company in assessing financial 
performance.
We agreed with the Audit, Compliance & Risk Committee (the 
“ACR Committee”) that we would report to the ACR Committee all 
audit differences in excess of $6 million (2016: $2.5 million), as well 
as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the ACR 
Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when 
assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Shire plc is the parent company of the Shire plc consolidated 
group and the activities of the Company are those of a holding 
company. During the year the transactional processing previously 
conducted in Basingstoke, UK was moved to a new Corporate 
Services centre in Dublin, Ireland with other key financial processes 
and supervisory functions moving to London, UK. The group audit 
team therefore worked with an audit team based in Dublin to form 
an integrated audit team for the parent company audit, supervised 
and directed by the group audit partner
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in the annual report 
other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material 
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a 
material misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we 
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
204 Shire Annual Report 2017 Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the ‘Directors’ responsibilities in 
the preparation of the financial statements’, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such 
internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible 
for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors 
either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or 
have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This 
description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) 
Law, 1991. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
 • we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
 • proper accounting records have not been kept by the Company, 
or proper returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 • the Company financial statements are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Other matters
Auditor tenure
Following the recommendation of the ACR committee, we were 
appointed in 2002 to audit the financial statements for the year 
ended December 31, 2002 and subsequent financial periods. 
The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous 
renewals and reappointments of the firm is 15 years, covering the 
years ended December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2017.
Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the 
ACR Committee
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the 
ACR Committee we are required to provide in accordance with 
ISAs (UK).
Opinion on group financial statements
We have reported separately on the group financial statements 
of Shire plc for the year ended 31 December 2017. That report 
includes details of the group key audit matters, how we applied 
the concept of materiality in planning and performing our group 
audit, and an overview of the scope of our group audit.

(Jersey) Law 1991, and under the historical cost convention.
Monetary amounts in these financial statements are rounded to 
the nearest whole $100,000, except where otherwise indicated.

The financial statements of the Company are consolidated in the 
financial statements of Shire plc. The consolidated financial

Consolidated financial statements
Consolidated accounts prepared in conformity with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. 
GAAP), in which the financial results and cash flow statement of 
the Company and its subsidiaries are included, can be found in the 
Shire Annual Report. Consequently, these financial statements 
present the financial position and financial performance of the 
Company as a separate entity.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the Company’s accounting policies described below, which have 
been applied consistently throughout the current and preceding 
year and have been approved by the Board.
The financial statements of the Company are consolidated in 
the financial statements of Shire plc. The consolidated financial 
statements of Shire plc are available from its registered office at 
22 Grenville Street, St Helier, Jersey, JE4 8PX, Channel Islands 
or on its website, www.shire.com.
Going concern
The Group’s Consolidated Balance Sheets included $472.4 million 
of Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017.
The Group has a revolving credit facility (RCF) of $2.1 billion 
which matures in 2021, $810.0 million of which was utilized as of 
December 31, 2017. The RCF incorporates a $250 million U.S. 
dollar and Euro swingline facility operating as a sub-limit thereof.
In connection with the acquisition of Dyax, the Group entered 
into a $5.6 billion amortizing term loan facility in November 2015. 
As of December 31, 2017, $1.2 billion of this term loan facility was 
outstanding. The facility matures on November 2, 2018.
In connection with the acquisition of Baxalta, the Group assumed 
$5.0 billion of unsecured senior notes previously issued by Baxalta, 
of which $750.0 million is due within the next twelve months and 
issued $12.1 billion of unsecured senior notes in September 2016, 
of which none are due for repayment in the next twelve months. 
The details of these debt agreements are presented in Note 18, 
Borrowings and Capital Leases, to the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements.
In addition, the Group also has access to certain short-term 
uncommitted lines of credit which are available to utilize from time 
to time to provide short-term cash management flexibility. As of 
December 31, 2017, these lines of credit were not utilized.
The Company may also engage in financing activities from time 
to time, including accessing the debt or equity capital markets.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company 
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Accordingly the Directors continue to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the report and 
financial statements.
Functional and presentational currencies
The financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars which is also 
the functional currency of the Company.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are initially recorded at the exchange rate ruling 
on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated at the rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction or, if the asset or liability is measured at fair value, 
the rate when that fair value was determined.
All translation differences are taken to profit or loss, except to 
the extent that they relate to gains or losses on non-monetary 
items recognised in other comprehensive income, when the 
related translation gain or loss is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
 209 Shire Annual Report 2017
 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Other Information
Accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2017 continued
Other income
Interest income
Interest income is accrued on a time-apportioned basis, by 
reference to the principal outstanding at the effective interest rate.
Dividend income
Dividend income from investments in subsidiaries is recognised 
when the Company’s right to receive payment is established.
Borrowing costs
Finance costs relating to debt issued are recorded as a deferred 
charge and amortized to the income statement over the period to 
the earliest redemption date of the debt, using the effective interest 
rate method. On extinguishment of the related debt, any 
unamortized deferred financing costs are written off and charged 
to interest expense in the consolidated income statement.
Fixed asset investments
Interests in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities 
are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost 
less any accumulated impairment losses.
Interests in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities 
are assessed for impairment at each reporting date. Any 
impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses are 
recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax expense 
and deferred tax expense. Current tax assets are recognised when 
tax paid exceeds the tax payable.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit 
differs from total comprehensive income because it excludes items 
of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other 
periods. Current tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax 
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
reporting date.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is 
settled based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax is not discounted.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in respect of all timing 
differences that exist at the reporting date. Timing differences 
are differences between taxable profits and total comprehensive 
income that arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in 
tax assessments in different periods from their recognition in the 
financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the 
extent that it is probable that they will be recovered by the reversal 
of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
Deferred tax is recognised on income or expenses from 
subsidiaries, associates, branches and interests in jointly controlled 
entities, that will be assessed to or allow for tax in a future period 
except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the 
timing difference and it is probable that the timing difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Current and deferred tax is charged or credited in profit or loss, 
except when it relates to items charged or credited to other 
comprehensive income or equity, when the tax follows the 
transaction or event it relates to and is also charged or credited 
to other comprehensive income, or equity.
Current tax assets and current tax liabilities and deferred tax 
assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if and only if, there is 
a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and the entity 
intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and 
settle the liability simultaneously.
Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a 
liability and an expense.
Retirement benefits
The Company contributes to personal defined contribution pension 
plans of employees. Contributions are charged to the income 
statement as they become payable. Differences between 
contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid 
are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Financial instruments
The Company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 
‘Basic Financial Instruments’ and Section 12 ‘Other Financial 
Instruments Issues’ of FRS 102, in full, to all of its financial 
instruments.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the 
Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument, and are offset only when the Company currently has 
a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and 
intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and 
settle the liability simultaneously.
Financial assets
Trade debtors
Trade debtors which are receivable within one year and which do 
not constitute a financing transaction are initially measured at the 
transaction price. Trade debtors are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost, being the transaction price less any amounts 
settled and any impairment losses.
Where the arrangement with a trade debtor constitutes a financing 
transaction, the debtor is initially and subsequently measured at 
the present value of future payments discounted at a market rate 
of interest for a similar debt instrument.
A provision for impairment of trade debtors is established when 
there is objective evidence that the amounts due will not be 
collected according to the original terms of the contract. 
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss for the excess 
of the carrying value of the trade debtor over the present value of 
the future cash flows discounted using the original effective interest 
rate. Subsequent reversals of an impairment loss that objectively 
relate to an event occurring after the impairment loss was 
recognised, are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
210 Shire Annual Report 2017 Financial liabilities and equity
Financial instruments are classified as liabilities and equity 
instruments according to the substance of the contractual 
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract 
that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company 
after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments
Financial instruments classified as equity instruments are recorded 
at the fair value of the cash or other resources received or 
receivable, net of direct costs of issuing the equity instruments.
Own shares
The fair value of consideration given for shares repurchased by the 
Company is deducted from equity.
Trade creditors
Trade creditors payable within one year that do not constitute a 
financing transaction are initially measured at the transaction price 
and subsequently measured at amortised cost, being the 
transaction price less any amounts settled.
Where the arrangement with a trade creditor constitutes a 
financing transaction, the creditor is initially and subsequently 
measured at the present value of future payments discounted 
at a market rate of interest for a similar instrument.
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at the transaction price, including 
transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method. Interest expense is recognised 
on the basis of the effective interest method and is included in 
interest payable and other similar charges.
Commitments to receive a loan are measured at cost less 
impairment.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
A financial asset is derecognised only when the contractual rights 
to cash flows expire or are settled, or substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership are transferred to another party, or if some 
significant risks and rewards of ownership are retained but control 
of the asset has transferred to another party that is able to sell the 
asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party. A financial liability (or 
part thereof) is derecognised when the obligation specified in the 
contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Share based payments
The Company grants share options (equity-settled share-based 
payments) to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant by reference to the fair value of the 
equity instruments granted. Options and performance share 
awards granted without market conditions are valued using the 
Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Options and performance 
share awards granted with market conditions are valued using 
a binomial model.
The Company participates in a share-based payment arrangement 
granted to its employees and employees of its subsidiaries. The 
Company has elected to recognise and measure its share-based 
payment expense on the basis of a reasonable allocation of the 
expense for the Group.
The cost for awards granted to the Company’s subsidiaries’ 
employees represents additional capital contributions by the 
Company in its subsidiaries. An additional investment in 
subsidiaries has been recorded in respect of those awards granted 
to the Company’s subsidiaries’ employees, with a corresponding 
increase in the Company’s shareholders’ equity. The additional 
capital contribution is based on the fair value at the grant date of 
the awards issued. This accounting treatment applies as the parent 
has granted the share option rather than being subsidiary granting 
an option in the parent’s equity.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at 
the discretion of the Company.

1. Critical accounting estimates and areas of judgment
Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based 
on historical experience and other factors, including expectations 
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances.
Critical accounting estimates and areas of judgment
The Company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the 
future. The resulting accounting estimates and assumptions will, by 
definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates 
and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year are discussed below:
The only critical accounting judgments which the Directors believe 
are relevant to these financial statements are those relating to the 
treatment of share based payments in the company. Please see 
the accounting policy above for treatment of the share based 
payments in these financial statements. 
In line with the accounting policies, the Company assesses its 
subsidiaries for impairment at each reporting date. The assessment 
of the value of each investment requires estimates in respect of the 
future cash flows and an appropriate discount rate. The key inputs 
to the value in use calculations are the discount rate and the future 
earnings growth.

17. Share based payments
Group share based payment plans
The Company participates in group share-based payment plans, 
and recognises and measures its share-based payment expense 
on the basis of a reasonable allocation of the expense recognised 
for the Group in accordance with paragraph 26.16 of FRS 102. 
The allocation is based on the number of employees benefiting 
from the share-based payment plan employed by each group 
entity. During the year there were no individuals directly employed 
by the Company and the Directors of the Company referenced in 
note 5 are contractual employees of a Group undertaking.
Certain employees are contractually employed by other group 
entities with elements of their payroll costs, including the share 
based payment charge relating to those employees, recharged 
to Shire plc on the basis of the fair value of the work performed. 
Share options relating to those employees are not included in the 
disclosures given below relating to each of the schemes currently 
in use.
Stock-settled SARs and stock options 
SARs under LTIP and PSP (Part A)
Stock-settled share appreciation rights (SARs), granted to 
Executive Directors, are exercisable subject to service and 
performance criteria.
In respect of any award made to Executive Directors under the 
LTIP, performance criteria are based on Product Sales and 
Non-GAAP EBITDA targets, with a Non-GAAP Adjusted ROIC 
underpin. In respect of any award made to Executive Directors 
under the PSP (Part A), performance criteria are based on growth 
in Non-GAAP Adjusted ROIC and Non-GAAP EBITDA. These 
performance measures are an important measure of the 
Company’s ability to meet the strategic objective to grow value 
for all of its stakeholders.
Awards granted to employees below Executive Director level are 
not subject to performance conditions and are only subject to 
service conditions.
Once awards have vested, participants will have until the seventh 
anniversary of the date of grant to exercise their awards.
As at December 31, 2017 there were no open options under 
this plan.
UK/Irish Sharesave Plans (Sharesave Plans)
Options granted under the Sharesave Plans are granted with an 
exercise price equal to 80% and 75% of the mid-market price on 
the day before invitations are issued to UK and Ireland employees, 
respectively. Employees may enter into three or five year savings 
contracts. No performance conditions apply.
As at December 31, 2017 there were no open options under 
this plan.
Shire Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Stock Purchase Plan)
Under the Stock Purchase Plan, options are granted with an exercise 
price equal to 85% of the fair market value of a share on the 
enrollment date (the first day of the offering period) or the exercise 
date (the last day of the offering period), whichever is the lower. 
Employees agree to save for a period up to 12 months. 
No performance conditions apply.
As at December 31, 2017 there were no open options under 
this plan.
RSUs and PSUs under LTIP and PSAs under PSP (Part B)
PSUs and PSAs granted to Executive Directors and PSUs granted 
to certain senior employees are exercisable subject to certain 
performance and service criteria.
RSUs and PSAs granted to employees below Executive Director 
are not subject to performance criteria and are only subject to 
service conditions.
The performance criteria for PSUs granted under the LTIP is based 
on Product sales and Non-GAAP EBITDA targets, typically with a 
Non-GAAP Adjusted ROIC underpin. The performance criteria for 
PSAs under the PSP (Part B) is based on growth in Non-GAAP 
Adjusted ROIC and Non-GAAP EBITDA.
As at December 31, 2017 there were no open options under 
this plan.
Replacement Awards Issued to Baxalta Employees
In connection with the acquisition of Baxalta and pursuant to the 
merger agreement associated with the acquisition, outstanding 
Baxalta equity awards held by Baxalta employees or employees 
of Baxter were cancelled and exchanged for Shire equity awards. 
The outstanding Baxalta equity awards consisted primarily of stock 
options and RSUs and hence were replaced with Shire’s stock 
options and RSUs. The replacement Shire awards generally have 
the same terms and conditions (including vesting) as the former 
Baxalta awards for which they were exchanged.
As at December 31, 2017 there were no open options under 
this plan.
The Company estimates the fair value of its share-based awards 
using a Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions 
used to estimate the fair value of share-based awards include the 
grant price of the award, the expected stock-based award term, 
volatility of the Company’s share price, the risk-free rate and the 
Company’s dividend yield. The Company believes that the 
valuation technique and the approach utilized to develop the 
underlying assumptions are appropriate in estimating the fair 
values of Shire’s stock-based awards. Estimates of fair value are 
not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately 
realized by employees who receive equity awards, and subsequent 
events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original 
estimates of fair value made by the Company.
18. Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in Section 33 
of FRS 102 to not disclose transactions with wholly owned Group 
companies.
The Directors consider that they are the only key management 
personnel of the company and details in respect of their 
remuneration is given in Note 5 to these financial statements.
