Renold has performed robustly this year against a backdrop of challenging 
markets. We have continued to make progress on a number of the key 
objectives underpinning our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan. 
Our health and safety KPIs continue to improve. We have successfully delivered key consolidation projects, which are expected to improve 
our efficiency. We have sold two properties in the period, generating net cash proceeds of £10.2m. Significantly, this year we have also 
commenced a multi-year project which relocates our Chain manufacturing facilities in China to a new purpose built facility. Despite the 
challenging market conditions we have continued to invest in commercial and marketing activities as well as further invest in ‘state of the art’ 
machinery. These actions under the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan will generate incremental value particularly when market conditions improve.

Underlying results are retranslated to current year exchange rates.
The Group uses alternative performance measures to provide useful historical financial 
information to help investors evaluate the underlying performance of the business by 
adjusting for volatility created by one-off items and non-trading performance related 
costs such as amortisation and legacy pension costs. A reconciliation to reported results is 
included in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements.

Operational highlights
 Æ Improvement in health and safety accident rate 
KPIs. All major manufacturing sites certified to 
OHSAS 18001. 
 Æ Completion of the consolidation of the European 
Distribution Centre with the facility in Germany 
and successful transfer of all UK Couplings 
manufacturing into Cardiff.
 Æ Significant increase in the Group’s capital 
investment programme in the year to £10.9m. 
Key projects delivered in the latter part of 
the year will support further cost reductions, 
improved operational efficiency and enhanced 
product quality and service improvements.
 Æ Investment in sales and marketing activities 
in support of organic growth is demonstrating 
results, particularly in Chain Europe. 
 Æ Successful disposal of the former European 
Distribution Centre in Seclin, France. Completion 
of the sale and short-term leaseback of the 
Australian property at Mulgrave, Melbourne, 
ahead of relocating the facility. Together, these 
disposals generated net cash proceeds of £10.2m.
 Æ Successful integration of Renold Tooth Chain 
following last year’s acquisition. Renold Tooth 
Chain continues to trade ahead of expectations.
Chart shows an estimate of the average underlying monthly sales required for the 
Group to deliver a breakeven adjusted operating profit. The estimate is based on 
actual variable margin in the years in question so that when the actual fixed costs are 
deducted the resulting adjusted operating profit is £nil. The resulting sales figure is 
then divided by 12 calendar months to arrive at the level of monthly sales required 
to breakeven. The breakeven point at March 2017 reflects the increased fixed cost 
acquired with Renold Tooth Chain, along with increased commercial and marketing 
activities. These factors increase the breakeven point, but are partially offset by 
ongoing operational improvements.

CHAIRMAN
“We continue to deliver key 
elements of our STEP 2020 
Strategic Plan, invest in our future 
and produce encouraging results in 
volatile market conditions. ”
25290-04    AR 2017    Proof 3
Overview
Renold has performed robustly this year 
against a backdrop of challenging markets. 
A first half decline in revenues was followed 
by a return to underlying growth in the 
second half. Further self-help measures 
have been delivered this year which reflect 
our ongoing commitment to the core 
objectives of our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan.
These include the completion of two 
consolidation projects, the sale of two major 
properties in France and Australia and the 
successful integration of the Tooth Chain 
acquisition, which continues to trade ahead 
of expectations. We believe this sets a 
template for further successful acquisitions 
in the remaining years of the plan.
Our Markets
Renold’s global presence and extensive 
product offering result in a broad spread 
of end-customer industries. Customers 
are served either directly, or through 
distribution partners, and our products 
are used to satisfy maintenance and repair 
requirements in addition to supporting 
the manufacture of new equipment. 
Our end-customers generally operate in 
industrial markets which have continued 
to be impacted by broader macroeconomic 
factors and geopolitical uncertainty. 
During the year, market conditions proved 
particularly challenging in North America, 
impacting upon both Chain and Torque 
Transmission operations in the region 
and resulting in a combined 8% decline 
in regional revenue. Europe and China 
experienced growth, and in flat markets, 
we believe this is a result of improving 
market share arising from the various 
actions implemented in our STEP 2020  
Strategic Plan.
Conditions in certain sectors demonstrated 
early signs of improvement towards the 
end of the financial year. It is too early 
to determine whether this is a sustained 
improvement in market conditions, or 
whether this is another phase of volatility 
in the cycle. Whatever the case, our focus 
on delivering the underlying improvements 
required to deliver sustainable progress in 
operating margins continues.
Trading Performance
Revenue grew by 11.0% in the year, 
benefiting from foreign exchange tailwinds 
and continued strong performance of the 
Tooth Chain business acquired in January 
2016. On an underlying basis, and excluding 
the impact of acquisitions, revenue declined 
by 3.6% in the year. This decline reflects 
the continuation into the current year of 
the challenging market conditions which 
impacted performance in the second half of 
the prior year. 
This underlying reduction in revenue 
resulted in a decline in our adjusted 
underlying operating margin in the  
year which fell to 7.9% from 8.6% in the 
prior year.
Whilst this is disappointing, it is reflective of 
external market factors and our decision to 
make revenue investments to increase our 
sales and marketing activities. We continue 
to focus attention on delivering actions that 
will provide sustainable improvements in 
operating margins and have made good 
progress in these areas during the year.
The year to March 2017 is the fourth year 
of our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan. The Group 
has come a long way and delivered a great 
deal over these four years. The full benefit 
of the actions delivered to date have been 
diluted by challenging conditions in our 
end-user markets over the last two years. 
In spite of this, we remain confident that 
we can deliver sustainable mid-teens 
margins, the exact timing of which will be 
determined by a recovery in volumes.
STEP 2020 Strategic Plan
Further key projects have been 
successfully delivered as part of our STEP 
2020 Strategic Plan. These include the 
consolidation of the European Distribution 
Centre with the sister facility in Germany 
and the successful transfer of all UK 
Couplings manufacturing and associated 
processing into our existing Cardiff site. 
Furthermore, we have commenced a 
programme to relocate our Chain China 
manufacturing facilities from Hangzhou to 
a purpose built facility near Changzhou in 
Jiangsu province. This is a multi-year project 
which will see the construction of the new 
facility commence during the year ending 
March 2018, with the factory relocation 
expected to occur in the following year.
We have continued to invest in the 
commercial and marketing activities which 
we believe will drive organic growth. We are 
starting to see the benefit of these actions 
with underlying revenue growth in Chain 
Europe (excluding acquisitions) of 5.9%.

A number of important health and safety 
initiatives have continued through the year 
and I am very pleased that we have again 
seen further improvements in our health 
and safety culture and performance. Health 
and safety rightly remains the number 
one priority for the Board and the Group. 
Ongoing and new initiatives in this area will 
continue to drive further improvements. 
Board and People
This year saw the appointment of Ian 
Scapens as Group Finance Director after 
Brian Tenner left in order to pursue other 
opportunities.  
Ian Scapens brings extensive experience 
in all aspects of financial leadership in 
large complex organisations. He joined 
Renold from Keepmoat Group, the UK's 
leading national provider of social housing 
refurbishment and regeneration services 
and a developer of low-cost, affordable 
housing, where he was Deputy Chief 
Financial Officer.
Also during the year we welcomed David 
Landless as Non-Executive Director. He has 
significant experience at senior levels of 
international manufacturing businesses. 
Most recently, he was Group Finance 
Director of Bodycote plc from 1999 until 
his retirement earlier this year. David 
will take over the Chairmanship of the 
Audit Committee from John Allkins at the 
completion of the 2017 AGM. John will 
continue as a Non-Executive Director until 
his retirement from the Board after the 
2018 AGM.
I am delighted that both Ian and David 
have joined the Board. They bring a wealth 
of relevant experience which will stand 
the Board in good stead as we continue to 
implement our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan. 
I would also like to take the opportunity 
to thank Brian Tenner for his substantial 
contribution to Renold over the years.
The Board continues to support the 
Executive team in reviewing and monitoring 
all activities under STEP 2020. The Board 
remains closely involved in the oversight 
of the major project deliverables. All Board 
members have continued to give additional 
time and support on a wide range of issues 
during the year.
On behalf of the whole Board, I would like to 
express my gratitude and thanks to all our 
employees for their continued hard work 
during the year. The contribution of each 
employee is valued and appreciated.

Pensions
The Group's gross retirement benefit 
obligations increased to £102.0m (2016: 
£82.9m), with the largest element of 
the increase relating to changes in the 
discount rates and inflation rates applied as 
assumptions to assess future liabilities of 
the UK scheme. This is a reduction  
of £10.4m from the position at  
30 September 2016.
The Group remains committed to 
progressively de-risking this position over 
time through a combination of agreed 
contributions to the schemes and specific 
de-risking projects as they become viable.
Dividend
The Board has decided not to recommend 
the payment of a dividend. Whilst the 
Board fully recognises the importance of 
dividends to shareholders, it believes that 
the investment opportunities available to 
the Group continue to provide the optimal 
route to increasing shareholder value. This 
approach will remain under active review 
for future periods.
Summary
Market conditions remained volatile in 
the year. Trading conditions, particularly 
in North America and South-East Asia 
remained challenging. Early signs of 
recovery are evident and are supporting 
growth in order intake, but it is too soon 
for these to be considered sustainable or 
market wide.
We have not allowed a challenging market 
to stand in the way of delivery of the STEP 
2020 Strategic Plan and have delivered 
significant business change in the year. We 
are making good progress and continue to 
believe that mid-teens operating margins 
can be delivered, supported by volume 
increases.

Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 for the year ended 31 March 2017
STRA TEGIC REPORT
Automation at Einbeck
The Organic Growth phase of the STEP 
2020 Strategic Plan is supported by the 
increased automation of existing processes. 
In addition to the wide range of standard 
products manufactured at our Einbeck, 
German plant, we have an increasing 
demand for special chains which are 
designed to specific customer requirements. 
In order to economically fulfil these 
demands, Renold has chosen innovative 
automation processes in assembly and 
chain production including industrial robotic 
solutions. 
The automation department combines 
classical mechanical engineering with new 
control systems. The key is the knowledge 
of chain production, based on long 
standing experience in the Group. This is 
combined with new automation methods to 
guarantee a quick and flexible response to 
market requirements to always stay ahead 
of competition. The entire project planning, 
from development and design to assembly, 
as well as programming of new robot lines, 
is undertaken in-house. 
In addition to robotics, the Einbeck 
automation team has expanded focus 
into the wider production area. Internally 
developed camera systems are now built 
into all standard assembly lines to enhance 
the already high product quality of Renold 
chain. Visual inspection systems with 
modern industrial image processing are 
used to ensure a constant quality level 
in production. The inspection systems 
control the complete feeding and correct 
positioning of parts and guarantee process 
reliability in all steps. Speed and precision 
of camera systems make it possible to 
measure individual parts in line with the 
production process.

OUR KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
KPI Definition Strategic Objective Performance Change
Non-Financial KPIs
The four health and safety KPIs below are taken from a suite of aligned measures that our sites review on a 
continuous basis and are reviewed by the Board at every meeting. (See page 49 for more details on these KPIs).
Lost time accident 
frequency rates
Over a 12 month period this contrasts the total number of lost time accidents, irrespective of severity, 
against the hours worked. An internationally recognised standard measure.
7
Reportable injury rates Over a 12 month period this contrasts the number of accidents greater than three lost days, against the 
average number of employees in the same period. We also monitor accidents greater than seven lost days 
in the same way. Both are internationally recognised standard measures.
777
Lost time days The total number of lost days attributable to all accidents in the 12 month period. An internationally 
recognised standard measure.
190
Safety improvements As part of our annual Health and Safety Awards Scheme we drive our sites to capture and implement 
safety improvements. These are generated by, for example, employee suggested improvements and 
investigations into any reported near misses or accidents. An internationally recognised concept with 
different businesses measuring and capturing in different ways.
1,466
Financial KPIs KPIs selected as either important to our external stakeholders or because they accurately represent an 
area of management focus, often where we are trying to improve historically weaker performance.
RoS% Adjusted operating profit divided by sales. 
7.9
Adjusted EPS Earnings per share before exceptional or adjusting items. This is a key metric used by capital markets and 
stakeholders in assessing performance improvement and value generation in Renold.
4.6
Sales per employee Total sales divided by the average number of employees. A simple way to assess the efficiency of our 
business processes. 
£84.0k
Total overheads Costs that are, in theory, fixed or very inflexible. Driving these down is one way to lower our breakeven 
point and to enhance our operational gearing. This therefore has a direct impact on our RoS% target.
Up £0.5m
Cash cost of servicing 
legacy pensions
Annual cash contributions to closed legacy defined benefit pension schemes including associated 
administrative costs. Relatively large sum but adding little or no value to the business. Hence the goal to 
keep it stable or reduce.
£6.0m
Average working  
capital ratio
Working capital as a ratio of rolling 12 month sales. Calculated as the simple average of the previous 12 
months. Based on an average to prevent short-termism and reflects the need to improve upon historically 
poor performance.
22.2%
Leverage ratio Ratio of Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA. ‘Banking’ leverage means the figure reflects our banking agreements 
which differ from IFRS figures (e.g. preference shares are debt in IFRS but ignored in our banking 
agreement). Historically Renold has a poor record of cash generation and hence this is an area of focus.
0.8
Net Debt Total borrowing less cash balances.
17.4
Health and safety remains our top priority. At Renold, we make the 
connection between personal safety and sustainable value creation. A robust 
system of control for health and safety is the bedrock of a manufacturing 
business such as ours.

STRA TEGIC REPORT
Renold AR2017-Proof3.indd   15 6/7/2017   2:57:25 PM “We continue to make strong progress 
against our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan. 
Challenging market conditions have impacted 
upon trading performance during the year, 
particularly in our Torque Transmission and 
Chain Americas businesses. We have not 
allowed these challenges to delay or obstruct 
our strategic progress and continue to take 
the actions required to position the Group 
well for when markets recover. ”

STEP 2020 strategy overview
A major milestone in our STEP 2020 programme will be the delivery of sustainable mid-teens margins. We remain confident that the 
business can meet this objective and, whilst the challenging market environment has, as reported, slowed the rate of EPS progression over 
the last two years, we are pleased with the overall progress with, and benefits of, STEP 2020 which is alleviating the impact of reduced 
levels of demand. We are putting in place a number of additional self-help initiatives to mitigate the ongoing challenging environment and to 
maintain progress.
Strategic Plan Component Description Reference
Strategic Goal To deliver mid-teens net operating margins through a combination of 
restructuring the Group, delivering organic growth and completing value 
enhancing acquisitions.

Achieve

business ﬁt for future
Mid teens % 
margins
The market for industrial chain remains highly 
fragmented across geographies and sector 
niches.  As we have demonstrated from the 
successful acquisition of the Gronau based Tooth 
Chain business, selected acquisitions have the 
potential to deliver incremental shareholder 
value. This value derives from:

 consolidating volume into facilities with 
 efﬁcient business processes and efﬁcient 
 manufacturing capability; or

  accessing incremental growth   
 opportunities in new product sectors or  
 new geographies, building on the    
 strength in depth of Renold’s existing
 product range and geographic reach.
Renold has the underlying characteristics 
to make the Group a natural consolidator 
in the industrial chain market. As the 
Number 2 by sales we have the reputation, 
scale and product range to operate as a 
strong foundation for integration.
Enhanced customer service
We believe Renold’s reputation for quality and 
performance is unsurpassed in the market.  
However, historically our performance in customer 
service has not lived up to the same standards.  To 
address this, we have implemented strategies to 
introduce 24, 48 and 72 hour response times on a 
range of standard and conﬁgured chains and 
extended this concept to standard gear and 
coupling products.  We intend to continue to 
improve and evolve our offering to enhance the 
levels of service to our customers, whether in 
standard products or in highly-engineered bespoke 
solutions.
Product capability
We will leverage our existing superior products in 
Chain and Torque Transmission. We will also 
reinvigorate the development and speed to market 
of a new range of products in both divisions. We 
will leverage our product reputation to add value 
to our customers as we solve their complex power 
transmission problems.
Renold has strong market shares in certain 
geographic markets and product categories.  
However, the fragmented nature of the power 
transmission market and the extremely diverse 
end-user markets creates signiﬁcant opportunities 
for organic growth. Whilst market conditions have 
proved challenging in recent years, the activities to 
deliver future organic growth have continued.
Improved sales and marketing
We will continue to invest in the Group’s commercial 
teams, building upon the commercial coverage 
across Europe, the Americas and in Asia. We will 
increasingly target speciﬁc end-user markets where 
growth opportunities in our existing product ranges 
can help to mitigate the cyclicality experienced in 
our core industrial goods markets. Through greater 
levels of direct interaction with our end customers, 
our targeted marketing and communication 
activities, we will help to reinforce our reputation for 
quality engineering solutions and high performance 
products. These actions will position Renold to 
secure a greater share of the markets in which we 
operate and to access related markets where we 
don’t currently operate.
Right size cost base
Many of our manufacturing processes include 
manual elements that inevitably reduce any volume 
beneﬁts due to disproportionate increases in costs. 
We aim to deliver ﬂexible capacity with low 
marginal costs.
Fix product margins
We aim to achieve appropriate value for the highly 
technical products we offer to the market.
Optimise business processes
We aim to deliver support function business 
processes with the same degree of ﬂexibility that 
we are targeting in our operations. By implementing 
simple repeatable and standardised business 
processes we will lower our breakeven point.
Make the right hires to drive growth
We will invest in our people to enable them 
to match the performance of our enhanced 
manufacturing and business processes. In 
some cases this will involve new talent and 
ideas being brought into the business.
Restructuring is the area of greatest progress to 
date since the commencement of the STEP 2020 
Strategic Plan in 2013.  Whilst many projects have 
been successfully implemented, numerous 
opportunities remain to improve efﬁciency and 
enhance ﬂexibility.
Right size capacity
Historically the business suffered from excess and 
inﬂexible capacity. We aim to signiﬁcantly improve 
in this area by eliminating excess capacity and 
enhancing the ﬂexibility of existing capacity through 
increased automation. This will lead to a direct 
improvement in variable and net margins.

Our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan comprises three specific and 
overlapping phases: Restructuring in Phase I, Organic Growth in Phase II and 
Acquisitions in Phase III. These phases are steps in a programme to deliver a 
common set of Strategic Objectives. 
In order to deliver these Strategic Objectives, each business unit has developed an action plan. The individual actions make up the many 
steps and are grouped into what we call our ‘Staircases’. Together these staircases are the building blocks that combine to deliver our 
Strategic Objectives. 
The table below identifies the key linkages between the Staircases, the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan and the Strategic Objectives.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Our Strategic Objectives and Progress
Staircase Overview Progress in 2016/17
Activities for 2017/18  
and beyond
We operate a varied and wide ranging 
set of business processes which differ 
in almost all locations. All of them inter-
link in different ways with multiple 
different users and computer systems.
Our aim is to implement one global 
standard operating model. This 
will unify our people, processes 
and systems. Each of our business 
processes is being designed to be 
simple and effective while being robust 
and as automated as possible. That 
will free up management time to focus 
on value added activities. It will also 
reduce the cost and simplify support 
for our information systems.
Our intention is to create one global, 
integrated ERP system, which 
incorporates efficient and standardised 
business processes.
We continued on our journey towards 
this objective during 2016/17. Three 
operating units are now live on the new 
ERP system, including the acquired 
Tooth Chain business. This completed 
the integration into the Renold Group 
and removed reliance on vendor 
systems and support. 
The implementation of the ERP system 
is a multi-year project which will 
continue into FY17/18 and beyond. This 
programme incorporates elements 
that go beyond the base ERP system 
and includes production planning 
and scheduling, engineering and CRM 
systems.
Our manufacturing facilities have been 
underinvested over many years. This 
has led to inefficient manufacturing 
processes, long lead times, excess 
waste and increased waiting time as 
products pass between multiple work 
centres.
Our aim is to modernise our 
manufacturing capability to match 
our leading edge engineering and 
production know-how. Better equipped 
facilities will shorten lead-times to 
enhance customer service, reduce 
stock holdings to improve the balance 
sheet, and contribute strongly towards 
our objective of improving operating 
margins.
During the year, we completed the 
transfer of our European Distribution 
Centre from France to Uslar in 
Germany. This transfer permitted the 
co-location of the logistics centres for 
European manufactured product with 
that imported from our non-European 
operations. It also increases capacity 
at our manufacturing facility in Einbeck 
through the availability of additional 
space for manufacturing.
Our manufacturing facility in Malaysia 
was relocated during the year to larger 
premises, increasing capacity.
Following an employee consultation 
process, we have consolidated our UK 
Couplings manufacturing facilities into 
the existing facility in Cardiff.
During the first quarter of 2017/18, 
we have relocated our Torque 
Transmission sales and warehousing 
functions in China, in addition to 
closing the manufacturing facilities. 
The manufacturing activities will 
now be undertaken in our Torque 
Transmission facilities in Cardiff, 
Milnrow and South Africa.
We have commenced a major project 
to relocate our Chain manufacturing 
operations in China to a new facility 
being built near Changzhou in 
Jiangsu province. The new facility 
will be a purpose built 21,000m
2
 
factory, enhancing our manufacturing 
capability in China and providing a 
strong platform for organic growth in 
the growing domestic Chinese market.
Our staircases provide the groupings for the strategic activities being 
undertaken within our business units. Despite the challenging market conditions 
experienced in a number of our business units in 2016/17 , these challenges have 
not been allowed to divert our focus from continuing to deliver the strategic 
actions required to improve the underlying performance of the Group. Outlined 
below is a summary of the key areas of progress delivered during 2016/17 and 
the further actions planned for 2017 /18 and beyond.

Staircase Overview Progress in 2016/17
Activities for 2017/18  
and beyond
Our commercial business processes are 
focused on improving customer service 
and enhancing our service offering. 
Like many of our diverse business 
processes, there is much scope for us 
to standardise and simplify.
We are working hard to improve 
our customer service. We know we 
have a long way to go as this is an 
area that has been weak in the past. 
Through improved management of our 
commercial teams and resources and 
by reconnecting with customers in their 
own local markets, we aim to make our 
reputation for service as strong as that 
for our superior products.
We continued to focus on customer 
service improvements throughout the 
year. In 2015/16, we introduced 24, 48 
and 72 hour response times on a range 
of standard and configured chains. 
During 2016/17, this was extended 
across a standard range of gear and 
couplings products. We continue to 
review the breadth of these ranges to 
find the appropriate levels of inventory 
holdings to provide great customer 
service whilst not losing sight of our 
capital efficiency objectives.
Customer service levels have 
improved, particularly on standard 
products. We have further work to do 
in this area, particularly in specialist 
products where we need to ensure 
the levels of customer service match 
up to the sector leading quality of 
our products. With this in mind, we 
are implementing tailored customer 
service initiatives across the Group. 
Put simply, we want to make the best 
use of the spaces we occupy. Where 
we have too much space, we will aim to 
reduce it. Where we overpay for space, 
we will renegotiate lower rents or 
move to better priced premises. Where 
we have surplus assets or facilities, 
we will aim to realise value and avoid 
unnecessary costs.
We will, over time, de-risk the Group’s 
balance sheet exposure to legacy 
defined benefit pension schemes. At 
the same time, we will maximise the 
latent value in the Group’s recognised 
and unrecognised tax assets.
During the year, we have made good 
progress in de-risking exposure to 
surplus property or crystallising cash 
from underutilised assets. This included 
the sub-lease of our closed Bredbury 
site in the UK and the sale of freehold 
properties in Mulgrave, Australia and 
Seclin, France. We continue to trade 
from the property in Mulgrave under 
a three year lease, giving us time 
to manage the orderly transfer to a 
smaller, more suitable facility.  
In the early part of 2017/18, we have 
closed our Torque Transmission 
manufacturing facility in China, 
allowing the move to a smaller office/
warehousing facility more suitable to 
the business' needs. 
In addition, following the consolidation 
of our Halifax Torque Transmission 
facility into Cardiff, we have released a 
property for sale. The sale completed 
in May 2017 generating disposal 
proceeds of £0.5m.
Our diversity of markets is a major 
opportunity for the Group. By bringing 
greater focus to our sales activities, 
we can deliver steady and sustainable 
growth and eliminate much of our 
historical cyclicality.
Our markets typically grow in 
line with GDP. Because we are 
under-represented in a number of 
geographies, markets and industry 
sectors, we are aiming to deliver annual 
growth of GDP plus in the period 
to 2020. At the same time, we will 
leverage superior product capability 
to enhance our operating margins and 
retain value for our shareholders.
Growth is a core element of Phase II of 
our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan. Whilst 
end markets proved to be challenging 
during the year, we continue to lay 
the foundations to ensure that we are 
well positioned when end markets 
recover. During the year, this included 
strengthening our commercial teams 
and building sustainable customer 
relationships from the new sales 
locations opened in the prior year. 
Marketing spend increased by over 
50% as we re-established product 
support, particularly for our distributor 
customers.  
Certain end-user markets are showing 
early signs of recovery. Whilst it 
is too early for us to consider this 
as sustainable, it does reinforce 
our ambition to establish a strong 
commercial capability ready to 
maximise opportunity as markets 
demonstrate sustainable recovery.

Operating Performance
Underlying revenue declined only slightly 
in the year as increases in the full-year 
revenue from the acquired Tooth Chain 
business helped to offset a small reduction 
in other underlying Chain revenues and 
a larger reduction in underlying Torque 
Transmission revenues. These revenue 
reductions largely reflect challenging 
market conditions experienced by our 
customers reducing overall demand for 
Renold’s products. The North American and 
South-East Asian markets were particularly 
difficult, across both Chain and Torque 
Transmission divisions. In contrast to this, 
the European Chain operations delivered 
organic growth to supplement the growth 
from the acquired Tooth Chain business.
On a reported basis, adjusted operating 
profit increased to £14.5m (2016: £14.2m). 
However, this benefits from the foreign 
exchange movements in the year. 
Underlying adjusted operating profit 
reduced by £2.3m, of which £2.1m occurred 
in the first half of the year. 
Excluding the impact of the acquisition, 
the underlying revenue decline of £6.7m 
resulted in a £3.3m reduction in underlying 
adjusted operating profit as the revenue 
reduction experienced was not matched by 
a corresponding reduction in non-variable 
overhead costs. This was particularly 
marked in Torque Transmission, but also in 
the North American and South-East Asian 
Chain operations.
Order intake improved through the year, 
with total orders 1.9% ahead of revenue for 
the year as a whole. In the later part of the 
year, there were very early indications of 
improving conditions in certain end-user 
markets. This helped contribute towards the 
improving underlying book to bill ratio for 
the second half of the year of 103% and an 
underlying 9.0% year on year increase in the 
closing order book at 31 March 2017. 
STEP 2020 Strategic Plan   
Update on progress
During the year, we have made progress  
on all three phases of the STEP 2020 
Strategic Plan.
Phase I – restructuring
Very significant progress has been made 
during the year to relocate and reposition 
manufacturing and distribution facilities 
across the Group.
In the Chain division, the European 
Distribution Centre (EDC) was relocated 
during the year and the Malaysian 
manufacturing facility moved to new larger 
premises in Kuala Lumpur. Relocating the 
EDC from France to Germany, close to 
our main European Chain manufacturing 
site, reduces the costs of handling finished 
products and improves speed of response 
and customer service. It also created the 
opportunity to sell our premises in Seclin, 
France. In Malaysia, the decision to move 
was taken to increase the capacity of the 
site. Market conditions have been weak 
during the year, and this permitted the site 
to relocate with minimum disruption. As 
markets recover, the site now has a greater 
potential for future growth.

organic growth. Margins and profitability have reduced slightly in the 
financial year. Underlying revenue declines in the non-European Chain 
businesses and the Torque Transmission division have been offset by 
the acquired Tooth Chain business being included for the full year. 
At a margin level, the declining underlying revenue results in reduced 
variable margin. However, the full year impact of acquired margin 
includes the full year overheads and generates income at a net margin. 
The combined effect of these factors is a reduction in RoS% whilst 
revenue is largely unchanged.

Enhancing customer

Customer service improvements remain key to supporting future 
organic growth. Many of the development programmes that are 
underway support this objective, including the implementation 
of consistent business processes (supported by the ERP roll-out), 
investment in new manufacturing equipment and extending the 
product range covered by our 24, 48 and 72 hour response time 
objectives.

£79.7k £74.0k £84.0k The process of standardising core business processes continued in the

This was a key enabling factor in the consolidation of the UK Couplings 
sites at Cardiff and Halifax and the removal of reliance on vendor 
support at the acquired Gronau site. 
We have continued to standardise our engineering systems, including 
PLM, CAD and CAM packages.

in foreign exchange rates in the year had a significant impact. Adjusting 
for these factors to aid true like-for-like comparability, both overheads 
and monthly sales breakeven point were largely unchanged in the year. 
Ongoing efficiency improvements have continued through the year, 
reducing overheads. These reductions have been offset by increased 
revenue investment in the commercial teams and product marketing as 
we put in place the foundations to deliver on the organic growth phase 
of the Strategic Plan.

the year. A second year intake of six new graduates were welcomed

During the year, we took advantage of 
the opportunity to sell the premises at 
the Mulgrave site in Melbourne, Australia. 
The site is too large for our ongoing 
requirements and the leaseback period 
of three years provides sufficient time to 
find alternative premises and to relocate 
in a controlled manner. Net proceeds of 
the sale were £9.3m and have reduced net 
debt at the end of the year to £17.4m (2016: 
£23.5m).
In Torque Transmission, the UK Couplings 
manufacturing facilities were consolidated 
to a single facility in Cardiff. Following 
a period of investment in the Cardiff 
infrastructure and the commissioning of 
new equipment, all manufacturing was 
moved from the Halifax site during March 
2017. This creates a single, focused UK 
Couplings manufacturing facility where the 
volume of production justifies investment 
in efficient manufacturing equipment that 
would otherwise be underutilised. We 
also commenced the process of closing 
our Chinese Couplings manufacturing 
facility in the year; final closure completed 
in May 2017. The closure removes a small 
underinvested manufacturing facility from 
the Group, but without loss of revenue as 
the products can now be manufactured in 
Cardiff and South Africa. This reduces cost 
and avoids future capital investment.
These changes, which generally completed in 
the latter part of the financial year, build the 
platform for more efficient manufacturing 
and distribution in the future.
Overlaying these infrastructure changes 
is the programme to optimise business 
processes. The most significant element 
is the implementation of the Group's 
ERP system across all sites. This has 
been successfully implemented at our 
Cardiff, Halifax and Gronau sites, and was 
instrumental in permitting the consolidation 
of the UK Couplings operations and the 
removal of reliance on vendor support in 
the acquired Tooth Chain business. The 
process of roll-out continues and FY18 will 
see the roll-out progress to further business 
units, including the first of the major Chain 
manufacturing sites.
Phase II – organic growth
Market conditions have limited the 
amount of organic growth delivered in 
the period. However, we continue to take 
action to establish an effective commercial 
team, introduce product development 
programmes and support our existing 
brands and customers through focused 
marketing. This has included extensive 
training of our teams, distributors and 
agents along with building sustainable 
customer relationships though the new 
Spain, Thailand and Indonesia offices 
opened during 2016. We have seen early 
signs of progress in Europe and are 
replicating these processes and procedures 
across North America, China and South-
East Asia. As markets recover, we expect to 
see the benefit of these actions.
During the year, we also commenced 
a programme to relocate our Chain 
manufacturing facility in China. This is 
a significant factory move which will 
take around 18 months to two years 
to complete as we are constructing a 
purpose built facility. This will be the final 
step in delivering the Strategic Objective 
of operating all major manufacturing 
facilities from owned premises, reducing 
the risk of uncontrolled relocations in the 
future and providing the basis for long-
term investment in core manufacturing 
locations. When complete, this facility will 
increase capacity and permit greater levels 
of manufacturing efficiency. This is critical 
in targeting growth in the developing 
domestic Chinese market, where product 
quality is becoming a more important 
factor in purchasing decisions, along 
with supporting growth in the sale of our 
Chinese-manufactured chain through 
overseas markets using the Group’s 
extensive geographic reach. The overall 
programme cost is expected to be £16.0m 
over eight years, with £6.0m of construction 
costs deferred for five to eight years, and 
will be funded from existing Group facilities.

Phase III – acquisitions
The programme to integrate the acquired 
Tooth Chain business into the wider Renold 
Group completed in the year. Following 
the successful roll-out of the Group’s 
ERP system, we were able to remove all 
dependence from the vendor for back 
office and systems support. Tooth Chain 
is now a core part of the Group’s product 
offering and the greater strength in depth 
of Renold’s commercial teams across the 
world provide the potential for further 
future growth in this product category. 
Performance in the period has exceeded 
original expectations, resulting in the 
payment of the first element of the deferred 
consideration in April 2017.
This acquisition was the first step in what 
we believe will be a programme of value 
adding acquisitions in the future, targeting 
opportunities that generate new product 
or new geographical opportunities, or 
opportunities to improve manufacturing 
effectiveness, e.g. through consolidation. 
Delivering our Strategic Objectives
We continue to make good progress 
in improving our health and safety 
performance. Fewer accidents and a greater 
focus on identifying and reducing risk in 
order to avoid accidents is indicative of the 
progress being made and the behavioural 
change that we are seeking across the 
Group’s global operations.
Our objective of delivering growth in 
operating profit margins has been impacted 
by short-term trading conditions in the year. 
However, a number of other KPI measures 
provide evidence that continued progress 
on restructuring will deliver improvement 
in operating profit margins when market 
conditions improve. Average employee 
numbers during the year have reduced 
by 2.2%, improving sales per employee 
to £84.0k (2016: £74.0k; 2016 underlying: 
£82.7k). This reduction derives from the 
restructuring activities delivered, combining 
with a general focus on business efficiency. 
The underlying breakeven revenue 
(adjusted for acquisitions) has remained 
relatively unchanged in the year at £12.5m 
per month. This reflects an underlying 
decrease following the restructuring 
elements of the Strategic Plan, but offset by 
additional overheads for marketing, product 
management and commercial support 
which have been added to support the 
organic growth activities.
Developing our people remains a core part 
of improving the future prospects of the 
Group and we have made progress across 
all levels of the businesses. A number of 
new senior managers have been recruited 
in the year adding to the wider leadership 
team, including a Managing Director for 
the consolidated UK Couplings business, 
a General Manager for the Chain Europe 
manufacturing facility in Einbeck, Germany 
and a Regional MD for our South-East Asian 
businesses with the objective of increasing 
our presence in these growing markets. 
We also continued with our Future Leaders 
programme, welcoming six new graduates. 
Macroeconomic landscape and Brexit
There are a number of well-publicised 
macroeconomic risks on the horizon. We 
continue to deliver our strategy, cognisant 
of the risks, but similarly very aware that 
the impact of these risks is uncertain and 
should not delay our progress.
The vote for Brexit had a significant impact 
on the value of Sterling and the foreign 
exchange movements have impacted 
our reported trading position. However, 
this is largely a presentational issue as 
our results are reported in Sterling. Our 
revenue in the UK is limited, representing 
8% of the Group’s revenue, whilst we retain 
manufacturing facilities that supply product 
to our other global operations. These 
products have become more competitive in 
overseas markets as a result of the currency 
movements.
There are certain product categories which 
we import to the UK, particularly chain 
manufactured in our European facilities. 
Whilst this has become more expensive as a 
result of the foreign exchange movements, 
the majority of competitor products are 
sourced from Europe and the Far-East and 
are exposed to similar inflationary pressure. 
Overall, we do not believe that Brexit 
significantly impacts on our competitive 
positioning. The major risk factor to the 
Group from Brexit, other Eurozone and US 
macroeconomic risks is the impact on the 
timing of recovery of industrial production 
in general. We will continue to monitor this 
and take action as required.
Outlook
We have delivered a robust performance 
in challenging markets. The impact of 
the market headwinds on revenue and 
operating profit would have been far 
greater had it not been for the actions 
delivered to increase operating efficiencies 
as part of our STEP 2020 strategy.
Markets stabilised during the year and 
there was a return to revenue growth in 
the second half of the year along with an 
increase in order intake.
Although there are some early indications 
of improvement, macro-economic 
uncertainty remains and, in turbulent times, 
our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan remains 
relevant and critical to the long term 
delivery of value to all of our stakeholders. 
Actions already delivered as part of the plan 
will combine with on-going programmes 
to further improve the efficiency and 
effectiveness of our operations. The 
Group is positioned for organic growth 
and we continue to believe that mid-teens 
operating margins, and sustainable gains 
in adjusted earnings per share, can be 
delivered when volumes improve through 
organic growth and acquisitions.

OUR PERFORMANCE:
Chain
Renold Chain is a global market leading supplier of differentiated and value 
added chain products for a wide variety of markets and a myriad of end use 
applications. We create innovative solutions for our customers who need to 
ensure performance within increasingly challenging working environments. 
The Renold name is known for industry leading design and specification, high 
quality and exceptional service and technical support. Reducing overall cost 
of ownership is important to our customers, with extended product life and 
reduced maintenance key factors in specifying our products.
Chain performance review
Underlying revenue of £146.1m was 
£3.1m (2.2%) ahead of the prior year. 
Underlying external revenues excluding 
acquisitions were £2.3m (1.6%) behind 
prior year reflecting a backdrop of difficult 
macroeconomic conditions in many of the 
territories in which we operate. However, 
regional performance was mixed and there 
were some encouraging performances, 
particularly in Europe, Australia and India. 
Underlying European revenue increased by 
£8.3m (16.3%) in the period (£2.9m (5.9%) 
excluding acquisitions) with organic growth 
delivered in most of our major European 
markets, in addition to growth from the full 
year impact of the acquisition of the Tooth 
Chain business. 
Revenue in the Americas finished £4.4m 
(7.3%) down on an underlying basis, with 
continued soft demand in the US from 
major distributors and larger OEM accounts. 
Disappointingly, this was compounded by 
production issues during the final quarter 
of the year as orders started to recover. 
These issues are short-term in nature and 
are being resolved.  After a slow start, our 
Canadian business recovered in the second 
half to deliver underlying year on year 
growth of 3.4%. 
Domestic sales in India and China grew 
by £0.5m (7.9%) and £0.4m (12.0%) 
respectively. However, the overall 
performance of both businesses was 
depressed by lower demand in export 
markets. Underlying revenue in Australasia 
was down by £0.8m (3.9%), primarily due 
to continued weakness in palm oil markets 
in South-East Asia, being partially offset by 
growth in Australia of 4.9% where sales to 
the mining and agriculture sectors started 
to recover. 
Order intake of £149.2m was up by £11.4m 
(8.2%) on the previous year. At a regional 
level, European underlying order intake was 
up by £10.7m (21.1%) against a decline of 
£0.5m (0.9%) in the Americas. Order intake 
in Australasia was down £0.1m (0.4%) but 
up in India and China by 6.8% and 19.3% 
respectively. Order intake accelerated in the 
second half of the year with growth of 11.9% 
(compared to growth of 4.6% in the first half 
of the year) as end-user markets started 
to demonstrate signs of recovery. Orders 
for the year finished £4.1m (5.7%) ahead of 
sales.
Contribution margins, the margin after all 
variable production costs, remained flat. 
This was achieved despite increases in raw 
material costs in the second half of the year 
and reflects the continued focus on cost 
reductions, improved product quality and 
enriched business mix. 
Overheads increased year on year 
with the addition of the Tooth Chain 
business, continued upgrading of talent 
and investments in marketing and sales 
development programmes.
Underlying adjusted operating profit 
finished at £16.6m compared to £17.8m 
last year. Return on sales of 11.4% (2016: 
12.4%) was particularly impacted by the 
disappointing performance in the US during 
the year. 
Renold Tooth Chain (acquired in January 
2016) continues to trade ahead of 
expectations, delivering underlying organic 
growth in both orders and sales against 
the last comparable period under prior 
ownership. The business has been fully 
rebranded and customers transferred 
into the Renold commercial network 
with no business loss. In December, the 
final part of the integration process, the 
transfer onto the new Group ERP system, 
was successfully completed and Tooth 
Chain is now well positioned for further 
development in the global commercial and 
distribution footprint as part of the Renold 
Group. 
Commercial talent continues to be steadily 
upgraded in all regions and the team has 
been further strengthened with senior 
commercial resource added in the US, 
Australia, and India. A new Managing 
Director for the businesses in South-East 
Asia has also been appointed for the first 
time, bringing a single point of focus to our 
activities within that important growth 
region. 
Service improvements remain key
A key element of the growth strategy 
continues to centre on improvements to 
our operational effectiveness and customer 
service. A number of initiatives have been 
successfully completed during the year 
which will enable increased production 
output, shorter lead times, better inventory 
efficiency and improved levels of customer 
service. 
The largest single investment in new 
productive capability, the rotary 
machining centre (£2.5m), was successfully 
commissioned in February and is already 
boosting output in the US facility. This 
machine dramatically reduces production 
lead times on complex components whilst 
at the same time improving quality and 
removing up to ten separate manufacturing 
operations. Machine investments in 
other regions were similarly targeted on 
harnessing the latest technology in order to 
boost productive capacity and reduce lead 
times.
During the year, the European distribution 
centre was relocated from France to be 
close to the main manufacturing facility 
in Einbeck, Germany. The prime drivers 
behind this move were to reduce lead 
times, improve stock efficiency and enhance

overall customer service. The project was 
successfully delivered during November and 
also resulted in reduced headcount and the 
sale of the previous distribution centre in 
Seclin, France, resulting in proceeds from 
the sale of £0.9m. 
The Malaysian factory was successfully 
relocated during December. The new facility 
will allow up to four times more productive 
capability whilst enabling inventory 
management to be improved and response 
times reduced. It is also an enabler for the 
introduction of a rapid response cell for 
customised transmission chains, following a 
similar addition in China during this year. 
Last year, we highlighted the successful 
introduction of strategic inventory on core 
product lines. This has been enhanced and 
developed during the year, in support of 
our service commitment for 24, 48 and 
72 hour response times on standard and 
configured chains. Where appropriate, 
targeted holdings of components have also 
been introduced in order to facilitate the 
rapid assembly of product variants within 
particular chain product families. This has 
been achieved with a marginal increase in 
net inventories.. 
As we head into the new financial year, we 
have commenced the next significant phase 
in our manufacturing strategy. Using the 
end of the building lease of our existing 
Chinese factory as the trigger point for 
change, we have commenced a programme 
to relocate the business to a purpose-built 
facility near Changzhou in Jiangsu province. 
This strategy incorporates twin objectives 
of providing a platform for organic growth 
in the domestic Chinese market along with 
developing a leading manufacturing facility 
which can effectively supply Renold’s 
distribution infrastructure with certain 
standard product ranges.
Summary
Market headwinds impacted upon trading 
performance during the second half of 
2015/16 and during 2016/17. However, 
sustained investment in marketing and 
the commercial teams has driven organic 
growth in Europe during the latter part 
of 2016/17. Growing order intake arising 
as market conditions improve resulted in 
strengthened order books at 31 March 2017. 
This improving economic backdrop, along 
with the benefits of the self-help actions 
delivered over the last year, give us reason 
for optimism in 2017/18. In the longer term, 
we remain confident that the continued 
progress of the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan 
will deliver sustainable improvement in the 
division’s operating margins.

OUR PERFORMANCE:
Chain
How it all started
Way back in 1880 when the few cyclists 
on the roads were more than likely riding 
high on a Penny Farthing, young engineer 
Hans Renold achieved a significant 
technical breakthrough when he invented 
the bush roller chain. This innovative 
chain technology solved many problems 
inherent in existing solutions and brought 
a new level of performance, efficiency 
and flexibility to the transmission of 
mechanical power. Renold’s fledgling 
business grew steadily, providing power 
transmission chains to the industrial 
applications of the day. What this new 
technology really needed however, was a 
mass market application.
Enter John Kemp Starley who in 1885 
brought to market his safety bicycle. The 
‘Rover’ bicycle included many ground-
breaking features including the use of 
chain to drive the rear wheel. This synergy 
of technology and application proved a 
perfect match and resulted in the rapid 
growth of both bicycle and roller chain 
industries.
Pedal forward 130 years and the bicycle 
has been transformed – stronger, lighter 
and capable of incredible performance. 
In the chain world, Renold has built a 
global business serving a huge array of 
industries and applications. Following 
the example of its founder, Renold has 
dedicated itself to the relentless pursuit 
of better chain technologies – stronger, 
highly durable and extremely efficient.

Renold chain technology – a critical link
In 2011, British Cycling were looking for a 
drive chain that could meet the incredible 
demands of elite level competition both 
in the Velodrome and on the BMX track. 
After some discussion between British 
Cycling’s R&D Team and Renold Engineers 
it was felt that the requirements could 
be met using Renold’s Synergy chain 
technology platform. Following a great 
deal of collaborative work between 
British Cycling and Renold Chains, along 
with the University of Bristol, Renold 
engineers were able to optimise their pre-
existing chain design which culminated 
in the chain that was used to great effect 
by the Great Britain Track Cycling team in 
both the London and Rio Olympic Games.
Speaking about the relationship, 
Matt Taylor – Managing Director of 
Renold’s Chain division said: “Renold are 
immensely proud to have played a part in 
the outstanding success of British Cycling 
and the Great Britain Cycling Team.”
Likewise, Tony Purnell from British 
Cycling’s R&D Team said that: “As part 
of British Cycling’s no stone unturned 
philosophy it was obvious that chain 
design was an area of interest and we 
have been impressed by the undoubted 
expertise and obvious willingness of 
Renold to work with us on this project.”

OUR PERFORMANCE:
T orque Transmission
Renold Torque Transmission is an international 
manufacturer of high integrity torque transmitting 
products used where public safety or assured 
plant operation is critical. Renold’s products are 
integral, but generally unseen, in different facets of 
daily life from gearboxes driving heavy duty, high 
rise escalators in London and New York subway 
systems to shaft couplings in cement plants 
ensuring the uninterrupted production of a vital 
building material.
Torque Transmission performance
Underlying external revenue of £37.3m 
was £4.4m (10.6%) below the prior year 
primarily reflecting the annualised effect 
of the market headwinds that were initially 
experienced during the second half of 
2015/16. These headwinds were reduced 
demand, particularly in the Americas region, 
in the oil and gas, raw material extraction 
and steel industries. This annualising effect 
impacted upon the first half of 2016/17 
and saw revenues decline by 22.6% when 
compared with the same period in the prior 
year. During the second half of the year, 
underlying external revenue of £19.5m 
was £0.8m (4.3%) ahead of the prior year, 
benefiting from large orders for escalator 
drives in the London and New York 
undergrounds.
Underlying order intake was £3.0m (7.4%) 
below the prior year. Order intake was 9.6% 
ahead of revenue in the first half of 2016/17. 
Due to the longer lead times in the Torque 
Transmission division, these orders during 
the first half of the year delivered revenue 
growth during the second half of the year. 
Order intake for the second half of the year 
was 7.7% below revenue for the  
same period. 
Contribution margins, the margin after 
all variable production costs, improved 
by 3 percentage points during the year 
with exchange rate movements benefiting 
margins for UK manufactured products, 
although this was largely offset by direct 
labour costs not reducing in line with 
the revenue.
Underlying net overheads in the division 
decreased. The savings arising from the 
self-help measures implemented have been 
reinvested in commercial activities including 
expansion of the sales force in order to 
target non-traditional end-user sectors. 
Underlying adjusted operating profit 
finished at £3.9m, a decrease of £1.3m 
from the prior year, with a decrease of 
£2.8m for the first half of the year, offset 
by a recovery of £1.5m for the second half 
of the year. The division’s Return on Sales 
fell from 12.5% to 10.5%, largely reflecting 
the revenue decline in the period. As with 
revenue and adjusted operating profit, 
the performance in the second half of the 
year improved when compared to the first. 
Return on Sales for the first half of 2016/17 
was 6.7%, increasing to 13.8% for the  
second half.
Strategic actions
When the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan was 
originally implemented, the initial actions 
focused on the Chain division as this was 
significantly underperforming. At the time, 
the Torque Transmission division delivered 
strong margins. However, the decline 
in revenue experienced during 2015/16 
and 2016/17 impacted significantly upon 
profitability, as the protective actions were 
not sufficiently developed to mitigate the 
margin impact.
Following the CEO taking direct day-to-day 
responsibility for the division, acting as 
Divisional Managing Director, greater focus 
has been given to the elements of the STEP 
2020 Strategic Plan which impact on the 
Torque Transmission division, and a number 
of actions were delivered during the year.
As part of Phase I – Restructuring, the 
coupling manufacturing locations in the UK, 
Halifax and Cardiff, were consolidated into 
the Cardiff facility. This process completed 
in April 2017, but was the culmination of a 
number of project streams that upgraded 
the ERP systems of the businesses to 
the same platform, invested in capital 
equipment to increase capacity and trained 
the teams to ensure manufacturing ‘know-
how’ was transferred. The one-off cost of 
the transfer was £2.9m (see Note 2(c)) and 
benefits are expected to be realised during 
the next financial year.

In addition to the consolidation of the UK 
Coupling locations, the manufacture of 
couplings in Beicai, China, was transferred 
to Cardiff and South Africa, with this project 
completing in May 2017. Again, the one-off 
costs of transfer were incurred in 2016/17 
(see Note 2(c)) with the benefits expected to 
be realised in 2017/18.
As part of Phase II – Organic Growth, the 
division has re-established its focus on new 
product development, product marketing 
and commercial capability. This, along with 
a reinvigorated focus on customer service is 
expected to deliver growth, particularly in 
non-traditional sectors.
Summary
The division has a strong portfolio of niche 
products and a reputation in the market 
for product performance and quality. 
Market conditions have stabilised during 
the year, and whilst we are not yet seeing 
demand recover to historical levels, the 
self-help actions delivered during the year 
are capable of improving the performance 
of the division in the absence of market 
recovery. As market conditions improve 
over the medium term, the division will be 
better placed to maximise returns.

Renold Gears has supplied one of the largest 
worm gear sets in the Company’s history to a 
leading manufacturer of steel plate. 
Giant screw-down worm gears were 
designed and manufactured for a leading 
manufacturer of steel plate to drive two 
large rollers for rolling steel slabs to the 
required plate thickness on a quarto 
reversing mill. The steel slabs could 
initially be up to 300mm thick and are 
rolled precisely to reduce thickness and 
produce steel plate to customers’ exact 
specifications. During the rolling process 
the worm gears auto adjust by sliding on 
a special spline incorporated in the worm-
wheel hub.
The giant screw-down worm gears have 
a centre distance of over 32 inches and 
a ratio of 36:1. The worm shaft is nearly 
two metres long and together with the 
wheel they weigh in at a colossal 4,850 
kilograms, or nearly five tonnes, the 
approximate weight of three average 
sized family cars! 
The original manufacturer of the mill 
press was no longer in business and the 
steel company was finding it impossible to 
obtain spares.  A breakdown would have 
halted production and so Renold Gears 
was approached because of its unique 
ability to manufacture large worm gear 
sets of this size and specification. As only 
minimal technical drawings were available 
of the mill, it was necessary to reverse 
engineer the old worm gears to accurately 
and precisely reproduce the original 
design specifications.
The steel company is a leading supplier of 
steel plate and produces around 200,000 
tonnes annually for a wide range of uses 
including buildings, bridges, yellow goods, 
industrial machinery, wind turbines and 
general construction.

FINANCE DIRECTOR’S REVIEW
“We have taken a cautious approach  
to managing the business in the current 
volatile market conditions. Whilst operating 
margins have reduced in the year, this is 
largely due to market conditions. The self 
help actions delivered in the year provide the 
basis for a stronger recovery when market 
conditions improve. ”
IAN SCAPENS
FINANCE DIRECTOR
Overview
Challenging market conditions, first experienced in the second half of the prior year, continued into the year under review, resulting in 
reduced revenue and profit in the first half. Relative performance improved through the year as trading in Torque Transmission stabilised 
and organic growth in Chain Europe was delivered. This helped to recover some of the declines from the first half.
Positive indications from order intake during the latter part of the year suggest some early signs of improving end-customer markets as we 
move into the new financial period.

Order intake in the Chain division was 
higher than revenue with the underlying 
ratio of orders to revenue (book to bill) 
being 102.2% in the year (2016: 96.4%). All 
Chain regions had book to bill ratios greater 
than 100% for the year. Underlying order 
intake demonstrated good progress in the 
year with growth in the second half of 11.9% 
over the second half of the prior year. This 
compared to growth of 4.6% for the first 
half, and together resulted in growth for the 
full year of 8.2%. 
In Torque Transmission, the weaker demand 
from commodity related and capital goods 
markets experienced in the second half of 
the prior year continued into the first half of 
the current year. Underlying order intake in 
the first half of the year declined by 13.4% 
when compared to the same period in the 
prior year. Whilst underlying order intake in 
the second half of the year grew by 0.2%, 
this is growth over the weaker second half 
of the previous year. The book to bill ratio 
for the division was 100.8% (2016: 97.4%). 
Group revenue for the year increased by 
£18.2m (11.0%) to £183.4m, benefiting from 
foreign exchange tailwinds and continued 
strong performance of the Tooth Chain 
business acquired in December 2015.
Underlying revenue for the year was 
broadly unchanged with the small decline 
of £1.3m representing a 0.7% reduction. This 
includes the full-year benefit of the Tooth 
Chain acquisition. Excluding the effect of 
this acquisition, underlying revenue declined 
by £6.7m (3.6%). The reduction in underlying 
revenue was concentrated in the first half 
of the year with a year-on-year decline of 
4.0%, reflecting a continuation of the weak

end-customer markets experienced in the 
second half of the prior year. The Group 
returned to growth for the second half of 
the year with revenue 2.8% ahead.
On a divisional basis, the Chain division saw 
underlying revenue increase by 2.1% with 
Torque Transmission weaker, 10.5% down.
Operating profit
The Group generated £7.0m of adjusted 
operating profit in the first half (2016: 
£7.9m), £7.5m in the second half (2016: 
£6.3m) and a full year result of £14.5m 
(2016: £14.2m). 
At the half-year, we reported underlying 
adjusted operating profit down by £2.0m, 
which increased to £2.1m incorporating the 
mix effect of changing foreign exchange 
rates to March 2017. This shortfall 
significantly reduced during the second 
half of the year with underlying adjusted 
operating profit down by £0.2m, resulting in 
a full year shortfall of £2.3m.
Underlying adjusted operating margins 
fell during the year to 7.9% (2016: 9.1%). 
The Tooth Chain acquisition generated 
underlying revenue growth of £5.4m, 
delivering an incremental underlying 
adjusted operating profit of £1.6m. 
Excluding the impact of the acquisition, 
underlying revenue declined by £6.7m with 
a corresponding reduction in underlying 
adjusted operating profit of £3.3m. The 
combined effect of these elements is a small 
reduction to revenue with a reduction to the 
operating margin delivered in the year. 
Although not readily transparent from the 
consolidated Group results, we continue to 
remain focused on improving the overhead 
efficiency of the Group. The monthly 
breakeven revenue has increased to £12.8m 
(2016: £11.3m; £12.4m on an underlying 
basis). The Tooth Chain acquisition 
introduces a monthly revenue requirement 
of £0.3m to breakeven. On an underlying 
basis, excluding the acquisition, the 
monthly breakeven revenue has increased 
by £0.2m (1.6%). This reflects the fact that 
we are spending more on marketing and 
commercial headcount in order to support 
the organic growth phase of the STEP 2020 
Strategic Plan.
Foreign exchange rates
Foreign exchange rates have been 
extremely volatile during the year, reflecting 
the decline in the value of Sterling following 
the UK’s Brexit vote in June 2016. The value 
of Sterling fell significantly in June, with an 
impact on the weighted average exchange 
rates used to convert the Group’s results to 
Sterling in the first half. This fall was largely 
sustained throughout the second half of 
the year, compounding the impact on the 
weighted average rates. 
The natural hedge normally provided by the 
Group’s diverse operating territories and 
currencies therefore did not operate in the 
year as Sterling weakened against almost 
all global currencies at the same time.

Exceptional items
Net exceptional charges of £1.7m were 
£0.5m lower than the prior year figure. 
Gross charges of £4.6m (2016: £3.4m) 
related to various restructuring and 
redundancy costs incurred as part of STEP 
2020 (£4.3m) or costs of integrating the 
Tooth Chain acquisition (£0.3m). The more 
significant restructuring and redundancy 
costs were incurred in consolidating the 
UK Couplings manufacturing to Cardiff, 
relocating the European distribution facility 
to Uslar, Germany, and commencing the 
programme to relocate our Chain China 
manufacturing facility to a new purpose 
built facility.
Offsetting these gross exceptional costs 
is a net gain of £2.9m made on the sale 
and short-term leaseback of the Mulgrave 
manufacturing facility in Australia. For more 
details please see Note 2(c).
Other adjusting items
Other adjusting items include legacy 
pension scheme administration costs of 
£0.7m (2016: £0.7m) and amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets of £1.1m (2016: 
£0.2m).
Financing costs
External net interest costs in the year were 
£1.7m (2016: £1.5m). The annual charge 
includes £0.2m (2016: £0.2m charge) in 
respect of amortisation of the residual 
refinancing costs paid in 2012 and 2015. 
Financing costs also include £0.1m of 
unwinding discounts on onerous lease 
provisions established for the Bredbury 
factory site.
Certain elements of the Group’s debt 
facilities are drawn in non-sterling 
currencies and the foreign exchange factors 
which impact upon revenue and operating 
profit also impact upon financing costs. 
The movement in foreign exchange rates in 
the year have the effect of increasing the 
external net interest cost by £0.1m in the 
year.
The net IAS 19 finance charge (which is 
a non-cash item) is £2.5m (2016: £2.0m). 
In the current year, the actual return on 
assets was £11.3m higher than the return 
used in the interest calculation as specified 
in IAS 19 due primarily to stronger equity 
markets and the offsetting impact of higher 
corporate bond yields on the value of 
corporate bond portfolios. The difference 
appears as a remeasurement gain in the 
asset section of Note 18.
Result before tax
Profit before tax was £6.7m (2016: £7.4m). 
Adjusted profit before tax, which excludes 
exceptional items, IAS 19 financing costs, 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
and legacy pension scheme costs, was 
£12.8m (2016: £12.7m).
Taxation
The current year tax charge of £1.9m (2016: 
charge of £2.0m) is made up of a current 
tax charge of £2.9m (2016: charge of £1.5m) 
and a deferred tax credit of £1.0m (2016: 
charge of £0.5m). The Group cash tax paid 
was much lower at £1.0m (2016: £1.0m). 
The difference between tax charges and 
cash tax paid is due to the utilisation of tax 
losses and other tax assets in various parts 
of the Group. The last of our historical tax 
losses in Germany were utilised in the year. 
The effect of this will be to increase tax 
payments in future years in this profitable 
territory, with a double impact in the year 
ended 31 March 2018 as payments on 
account become more significant.
Group results for the financial period
Profit for the financial year ended 31 March 
2017 was £4.8m (2016: £5.4m). The basic 
and diluted adjusted earnings per share 
were both 4.6p (2016: earnings of 4.7p and 
4.6p respectively).

Balance sheet
Net assets at 31 March 2017 were £7.8m 
(2016: £10.5m). The fall was driven by the 
increase in the net pension deficit as lower 
discount rates and increasing inflation rates 
result in increased liabilities. This has only 
been partially offset by outperformance of 
asset returns in the period. 
The net liability for pension benefit 
obligations was £84.8m (2016: £68.1m) 
after allowing for a net deferred tax asset 
of £17.2m (2016: £14.8m). Overseas schemes 
now account for £25.0m (29.0%) of the post 
tax pension deficits and £26.2m of this is in 
respect of the German scheme which is not 
required to be prefunded.
Cash flow and borrowings
Cash generated from operations was £7.4m 
(2016: £10.8m). Gross capital expenditure 
was up in the year at £9.6m (2016: £9.5m). 
This investment was partially funded 
through the disposal proceeds from the sale 
of properties in the year of £10.2m (2016: 
£nil). 
Capital expenditure in the new financial 
year is expected to exceed £13.0m. 
A number of major projects totalling 
approximately £7.8m are already committed 
as at the date of this report including £6.0m 
for the relocation of our Chinese Chain 
manufacturing facility and £1.2m in respect 
of the roll out of our global IT system. 
Investments were also made in a number of 
stock lines to support new sales initiatives 
and new product launches. This in part 
explains the small rise in our working capital 
KPI (average working capital as a ratio of 
rolling 12 month sales) from 20.3% to 22.2% 
which was also adversely impacted by the 
slow down in demand. The absolute level of 
working capital was £3.4m higher than in 
the prior year.
Group net borrowings at 31 March 2017 of 
£17.4m were £6.1m lower than the opening 
position of £23.5m comprising cash and 
cash equivalents of £16.4m (2016: £13.5m) 
and borrowings of £33.8m (2016: £37.0m). 
The decrease in net debt is almost wholly 
explained by the proceeds received for the 
sale of properties in the year.
Debt facility and capital structure
The Group’s core banking facilities are 
unchanged in the year and remain a 
committed £41.0m Multi-Currency 
Revolving Credit Facility (MCRF), with a 
£20.0m accordion. The facility matures in 
May 2020.
The Group continues to operate 
comfortably within covenant limits. The Net 
Debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio as at 31 March 
2017 is 0.82 times (covenant requirement: 
2.5 times; 2016: 1.1 times), based on the 
reported figures for the period as adjusted 
for the banking agreement. The Adjusted 
EBITDA/interest cover as at 31 March 2017 
is 12.1 times (covenant requirement: 4.0 
times; 2016: 13.6 times), again on a banking 
basis.
At 31 March 2017, the Group had unused 
credit facilities totalling £5.3m and cash 
balances of £16.4m. Total Group credit 
facilities amounted to £43.3m, all of which 
were committed.
Treasury and financial instruments
The Group’s treasury policy, approved 
by the Board, is to manage its funding 
requirements and treasury risks without 
undertaking any speculative risks. Treasury 
and financing matters are assessed further 
in the section on Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties.
To manage foreign currency exchange 
risk on the translation of net investments, 
certain US Dollar denominated borrowings 
taken out in the UK to finance US 
acquisitions are designated as a hedge of 
the net investment in US subsidiaries. At 31 
March 2017 this hedge was fully effective. 
The carrying value of these borrowings at 
31 March 2017 was £6.9m (2016: £6.1m).
At 31 March 2017, the Group had 1% (2016: 
1%) of its gross debt at fixed interest rates. 
Cash deposits are placed short-term with 
banks where security and liquidity are 
the primary objectives. The Group has no 
significant concentrations of credit risk with 
sales made to a wide spread of customers, 
industries and geographies. Policies are in 
place to ensure that credit risk on individual 
customers is kept to a minimum.

Deferred tax asset 17.2 14.8
Net deficit (84.8) (68.1)
The Group’s retirement benefit obligations 
increased from £82.9m (£68.1m net of 
deferred tax) at 31 March 2016 to £102.0m 
(£84.8m net of deferred tax) at 31 March 
2017. The largest element of the increase 
relates to the UK scheme where the deficit 
increased from £53.6m to £72.0m. The 
increase in the deficit of the overseas 
schemes of £0.7m arises from an underlying 
reduction in the deficit of £1.9m, offset 
by a £2.6m increase arising from foreign 
exchange movements in the year.
 Æ UK funded scheme
The major reason for the increase in 
the deficit of the UK funded scheme is 
the impact of the actuarial assumptions 
on the value of liabilities. Reductions 
to discount rates have combined 
with increasing inflation assumptions 
to increase the value of liabilities 
by £35.8m. However, this increase 
was offset by experience gains (the 
difference between assumptions 
previously made and experience of real 
events) and asset returns delivered 
above assumed levels, which together 
generated gains of £15.3m to offset the 
deficit increase.
 Æ Overseas funded schemes
The overseas funded schemes comprise 
a number of smaller schemes around 
the world. Deficits on these schemes 
reduced in the year by £1.0m, despite a 
£0.7m increase in net liability due to the 
movement in foreign exchange rates. 
Experience gains, asset outperformance 
and contributions to the schemes 
combined to reduce the underlying 
deficits in aggregate by £1.7m.
 Æ Overseas unfunded schemes
This category largely relates to the 
unfunded German schemes. The deficit 
increased in the year as foreign exchange 
movements increased the liability by 
£1.9m. The underlying deficit reduced by 
£0.2m as increases arising from actuarial 
assumptions were offset by payments of 
benefits in the year.
The aggregate expense of administering the 
pension schemes was £0.7m (2016: £0.7m) 
and is included in operating costs but is 
excluded in arriving at adjusted operating 
profit.
The latest triennial actuarial valuation of 
the UK Scheme, with an effective date of 
5 April 2016, was recently agreed. This 
process concluded that contributions to 
the UK Scheme should continue unchanged 
and no additional contributions in excess of 
the previously agreed asset backed funding 
structure were deemed necessary. The next 
triennial valuation date will be 5 April 2019. 
The detailed structure and mechanics of 
the merger and underpinning asset backed 
funding structure are set out in Note 18 to 
the accounts.
Total cash costs for UK deficit repair 
payments and UK administrative expenses 
in the period were £3.9m (2016: £3.4m) 
which includes £0.7m (2016: £0.7m) in 
administration costs. The increase in UK 
deficit repair payments in the year of £0.5m 
reflects a one-off additional contribution as 
part of the medically underwritten buy-ins 
which completed in the prior year.
Total cash costs for the overseas pension 
schemes increased in the period to £2.1m 
(2016: £1.9m) as a result of foreign exchange 
differences.

 Æ Given the relative maturity of the scheme, and following the medically 
underwritten insured buy-ins, 58% of assets are invested in insurance 
policies, corporate bonds, liability driven investments and diversified growth 
funds. They are held primarily to generate an income stream that supports 
the ongoing annual pension payments (currently circa £9.5m including cash 
lump sums on retirement).
 Æ The overall target for UK portfolio returns is 5.5%. The actual UK return in 
the year was a gain of £15.3m (or 11.1% gain).
 Æ It should be noted that the diversified growth funds have characteristics of 
both protection assets (returns are lower and less volatile than equities) and 
growth assets (return targets are higher than simple gilts and bonds).
 Æ The chart to the left shows a comparison between expected and actual 
mortality in the UK scheme based on the assumptions underlying the March 
2017 Annual Report and the actual mortality experience.
 Æ The chart also shows the number of life years that could be expected to die 
each year (referred to as ‘Exposure’).
 Æ The fall in Exposure over the years has largely been driven by the significant 
falls in membership numbers resulting from the scheme merger and 
various small pots exercises as well as mortality itself and the age of the 
membership.
 Æ The chart clearly shows that even based on the current strong mortality 
assumptions, actual deaths have been higher than expected levels. If 
mortality continues at a higher rate than assumed, all else being equal, the 
level of future pension payments would fall.

 Æ A small pots exercise completed in 2016 and 207 members had their

 Æ The net pension deficit increased by 23% in the year to £102.0m.
 Æ Liability assumptions for discount rates and inflation in the UK scheme were 
the largest cause of deficit increase combining to increase the UK liabilities 
by £35.9m.
 Æ UK discount rates fell sharply in the early part of the year resulting in a 
significant increase in the UK deficit at 30 September 2016. 
 Æ UK discount rates increased in the second half of the year, but the expected 
reduction in liabilities did not crystalise as increases in UK inflation rates had 
an offsetting effect.
 Æ UK asset performance was strong in the year, reducing the deficit by £10.7m 
with a further £0.6m delivered on overseas schemes.
 Æ The movement in the deficit arising on overseas schemes was small as a 
reduction in the deficit was largely offset by foreign exchange movements.

Our approach to risk
The management of risk in the business is 
fundamental to the ability of the Group to 
successfully deliver the STEP 2020 Strategic 
Plan. 
Renold’s risk management framework is 
designed to identify and assess the probability 
and consequences of risks occurring, to 
manage the actions necessary to reduce those 
risks, and to mitigate their potential impact. 
OUR RISKS
Proactive risk management is a key business process at Renold and is used to 
help management create and protect value. In the current uncertain markets 
its relevance to safeguarding shareholder value is even more critical. 
RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
As described in the chart below, we consider risk across the 
organisation, blending a holistic top down view with site, functional 
and project specific assessments.
 Æ Sets the ‘Tone at the Top’ – the culture adopted in respect of risk.
 Æ Responsible for risk management and internal control processes.
 Æ Sets direction for key focus areas (e.g. health and safety).
 Æ Defines acceptable levels of risk (referred to as our ‘risk appetite’).
 Æ Monitors compliance with our risk appetite and management’s responsiveness to 
actions designed to treat excessive risk.
 Æ Maintains local risk registers and action plans.
 Æ Ongoing action management and tracking.
 Æ Embedding Group culture and risk appetite at a local level.
THE BOARD 
AUDIT COMMITTEE 
 Æ Supports the Board, reviewing the end to end risk management process.
 Æ Particular emphasis is placed upon monitoring the implementation of risk 
mitigation actions.
EXECUTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT 
AND MONITORING COMMITTEE
 Æ Oversight of risk registers and their 
maintenance.
 Æ Challenge and review of completed 
actions.
 Æ Review and critique of risk profiles 
presented by senior business leaders 
and challenge of risk mitigation plans.
 Æ Shares best practice risks and 
solutions across the Group.
BUSINESS UNITS
GROUP RISK FUNCTION 
 Æ Facilitates the maintenance of risk 
registers and action plans.
 Æ Reviews status of risk management 
actions.
The Board has overall responsibility and 
oversight of the risk management framework 
and is also responsible for setting the 
parameters of acceptable and unacceptable 
risk (referred to as ‘risk appetite’). 
Renold’s risk appetite
The Board acknowledges that the Group is 
exposed to risk during the normal course 
of business. Renold must be willing to 
accept an appropriate level of risk in order 
to achieve its Strategic Objectives. The 
Board’s attitude to risk management and 
its appetite for risk can be described as 
‘tending to risk averse’. 
Our risk management process: 
The Executive Risk Management and 
Monitoring Committee
The Group Audit Committee reviews the 
principal risks and uncertainties together 
with the actions taken and relevant 
mitigating controls. The Group Executive 
Risk Management and Monitoring 
Committee (ERMMC) is a sub-committee 
of the main Board. The ERMMC is chaired 
by the Group Chief Executive and meets at 
least four times per year.
The ERMMC is comprised of the Executive 
Directors. Senior members of the business 
attend by invitation and are required to 
present risk profiles for their functional 
areas and the aligned action plans to 
manage or mitigate risk. The Group 
Business Systems Director, the Group 
HR Director, the Group Head of Risk and 
Assurance and the Group Legal Manager 
and Company Secretary also attend each 
meeting.
Each ERMMC meeting is informed by a 
detailed risk management status report. 
This report provides an insight on new risks 
and progress on mitigating actions on all 
risks. Other topical risk issues also feature 
on the standing agenda e.g. there is focus 
on the Group’s response and management 
of important health and safety related 
events. The ERMMC is also provided with 
information in the form of reports on health 
and safety, treasury, insurance, material 
litigation and whistle blowing. 
All ERMMC minutes and the risk status 
reports are reviewed and discussed by the 
Audit Committee. The Audit Committee 
reports on these discussions to the Board.

How we assess risk
Our approach combines sharing best 
practice across sites, expert guidance from 
the Group Head of Risk and Assurance, 
and local ‘on the ground’ experience and 
knowledge of specific risk factors.
Risk workshops involving local and 
functional staff are used to develop risk 
profiles and action plans. The Group Head 
of Risk and Assurance facilitates the end 
to end risk management process, ensuring 
consistency of approach and compliance 
with Group Policy.
Risks are assessed against the framework 
defined in the Group Risk Management 
Policy. Our risk assessment model 
considers: 
 Æ The probability of a risk crystallising.
 Æ The potential impact if the risk 
crystallised – impact definitions cover 
a range of criteria including direct 
financial impact, reputational impact, 
people impact, e.g. in the event of an 
accident, regulatory censure and adverse 
movement of the share price. 
These are scored and then placed on the 
risk heat map above, which is a matrix 
of probability and impact and shows our 
principal risks and uncertainties. Our model 
also considers each risk from two different 
perspectives:
 Æ The extent of inherent risk (i.e. before 
any mitigating controls or actions).
 Æ The extent of residual risk (i.e. after 
mitigating controls and actions). 
This allows us to assess the positive impact 
of control on the underlying inherent risk.
The Group has deployed an online 
Integrated Risk Management System 
(IRMS) across all locations. This is used 
to capture risk profiles and actions under 
management. Action plans are maintained 
across the Group, with all system updates 
subject to review by the Group Head of Risk. 
How we manage risk
Having identified the risks the business 
faces and having scored them against the 
Risk Appetite set by the Board, our Group 
Policy then provides guidance on how to 
manage those risks, depending on where 
they sit on the risk heat map. 
The ‘heat map’ shows the four bandings 
in the different shades of risks as set out 
below as well as expected actions and 
responses to risks in these areas: 
 Æ Green: within appetite. Ongoing 
monitoring in place.
 Æ Amber: out of appetite. Some actions 
are required to treat the risk to bring this 
within acceptable levels. 
 Æ Red: significantly out of appetite. High 
combination of residual probability and 
impact. Management actions required, 
with some urgency, to treat the risk, 
reducing this to acceptable levels. 
 Æ Grey/black: risks that are deemed to 
have such an impact that they could 
theoretically impact the ability of the 
business to continue in existence. If 
any, they would need consideration 
in assessing the Directors’ Viability 
Statement. 
The IRMS is used to track actions and 
automatically links these to the associated 
risks. The IRMS therefore operates as a 
live management tool that assists staff 
in actions management and also in the 
production of real time risk status reports. 
Risk reports for the various Executive 
committees derive data from the IRMS.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Board continues to carry out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the business. The Executive Risk Management 
and Monitoring Committee monitors the ongoing identification 
and assessment of risks, reviews all risks in the IRMS and reports 
material risks to the Audit Committee. 
Set out on pages 42 to 46 are the principal risks and uncertainties 
which could have a material impact on the Group. The numbers 
correspond to the risk identified on the heat map.
These risks are continually monitored. The Board has critically 
reassessed the risks we face in light of the Group’s progress on its 
STEP 2020 Strategic Plan coupled with the volatility in our end 
markets. 
We indicate whether or not we consider the probability or impact of 
the risks materialising are increasing, decreasing or unchanged and 
set out the corresponding mitigating actions that have been taken 
by the Group. We also show which of our Strategic Objectives could 
be impacted by the risk.

   Strategy Execution
Detailed risk
The Group’s strategy requires the co-ordinated delivery of a number 
of complex projects e.g. during the year we have rationalised certain 
production facilities. 
LINK TO STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
2 3 4 5 6 7
Potential impact
Whilst these projects are designed to deliver  
targeted benefits, if not appropriately managed,  
they have the potential to negatively impact the  
Group’s operations. 
Existing mitigation controls
 Æ The STEP 2020 Strategic Plan has been developed to deliver a turnaround in performance and to make that performance more stable and 
less exposed to revenue volatility.
 Æ The Board reviews progress against the different STEP 2020 projects in each of its meetings. This is based on a regularly updated report 
from the CEO which groups the individual projects into themes linked directly to our Strategic Objectives.
 Æ Major projects are all managed in accordance with best practice project management techniques with at least one member of the Executive 
team on the relevant Steering Committees.

Macroeconomic and Political Volatility
 
Detailed risk
 Æ Material changes in prevailing macroeconomic or political 
conditions could have a detrimental impact on business 
performance. We operate in 19 countries and sell to customers in 
over 100 and therefore we are necessarily exposed to economic 
and political risks in these territories.
7
LINK TO STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
 2 7
Potential impact 
Potential touchpoints include:
 Æ Commodity prices which have a  
negative impact on demand in the  
whole supply chain.
 Æ Foreign exchange volatility can impact customer buying patterns, 
leading to lower demand or the need to rapidly switch supply 
chains.
 Æ The political issues affecting the UK and Europe are also 
impacting business performance and confidence.
Existing mitigation controls
 Æ Our diversified geographic footprint inherently exposes us to more countries where risks arise but conversely provides some degree of 
resilience.
 Æ Actions to lower the Group’s overall breakeven point also serve to reduce the impact of any global economic slowdown.
 Æ A focus on 'predict and respond', e.g. sales forecasting and raw material price monitoring.
 Æ Strong core banking group with multi-currency debt facility.
 Æ Operation of a net cash flow hedging strategy approved by the Board.

   Acquisitions/Business Development
Detailed risk
Part of the Group’s strategy is to grow through 
selective acquisitions. Performance of acquired 
businesses may not reach expectations, impacting 
Group profitability and cash flows.
LINK TO STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
 2 5 7
Potential impact
Any acquisition involves risks at various stages of the project life cycle.
During the Acquisitions phase, value can be lost through over-paying,  
missing key issues in due diligence or potential value leakage through  
poor contract negotiation. Value can also be lost through a poorly planned or executed 
integration phase. Finally, failure to deliver anticipated benefits during the ‘business as 
usual’ phase can also lead to a loss of value.
Existing mitigation controls
 Æ Monitoring of specific acquisition targets: Business Acquisition Process incorporating Concept Evaluation, Business Case, Indicative Offer/
Heads of Terms, Due Diligence (covering a range of criteria), Integration Planning and Execution and Post Integration Appraisal which in turn 
feeds back to the Business Acquisition Process.
 Æ Use of third party specialists to address risks specific to each acquisition.
 Æ Formation of top-down cross functional business integration project teams and plans. These specifically address any issues or risks 
identified during the Acquisitions phase.
 Æ Deployment of detailed benefits realisation plans.

 Health and Safety in the Workplace 
Detailed risk
The risk of death or serious injury to employees or third parties 
associated with Renold’s worldwide operations. 
We are proud of the progress we have made in recent years, but 
recognise that we have more to do. 
LINK TO STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
 1  
Potential impact
Accidents caused by a lack of robust safety  
procedures could result in life changing impacts  
for employees, visitors or contractors. This will  
always be unacceptable. In addition, accidents could result in civil or 
criminal liability for both the Group and the Directors and officers of the 
Group and Group companies, leading to reputational damage. 
Existing mitigation controls
 Æ Group policies and a Groupwide management system known as the Framework, to set control expectations, with a support training 
programme for all managers.
 Æ The Group operates a rolling programme of Internal Audits to assess compliance against the Framework.
 Æ Continual hazard assessments to ensure awareness of risks.
 Æ Live tracking of accident rates and root cause analysis via the IRMS plus monthly Board reporting focused on a range of KPIs.
 Æ Specific initiatives include the BAT safety logo and the Annual Health and Safety Awards Scheme to recognise success.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
5
  
Effective Deployment and Utilisation of Information Technology Systems
Detailed risk
We seek to leverage the use of IT to achieve competitive advantage. 
The Group continues to implement a global ERP system to replace 
numerous legacy systems which inherently brings with it the risks 
associated with a large scale change programme.
LINK TO STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
3 4 5 
Potential impact
Interruption or failure of IT systems  
(including the impact of a cyber attack) would  
negatively impact or indeed prevent some business  
activities from occurring. If the interruption was long lasting, significant 
damage could be done to the business. 
It is essential that we are able to rely on the data derived from 
our business system to feed routine but fundamental business 
performance monitoring.
An unsuccessful implementation of the global ERP system has the 
potential to materially impact that site’s and possibly the Group’s 
performance.
The risk is assessed as stable as we have already successfully 
implemented the ERP at two locations.
Existing mitigation controls
 Æ Short-term stabilisation of existing hardware and legacy software platforms.
 Æ Governance and control arrangement operating over the Group’s ERP implementation programme.
 Æ Use of specialist external consultants and recruitment of experienced personnel.
 Æ Phased implementation rather than ‘big bang’.
 Æ Project assurance and 'lessons learned' reviews to continuously improve the quality of successive roll outs.
 Æ Template blueprint agreed to form the basis of the implementations.
 Æ Steering Committee in operation with cascading project management disciplines.
 Æ A range of preventative and detective controls to manage the risk of a cyber attack.
6
  
Prolonged Loss of a Manufacturing Site 
Detailed risk
A catastrophic loss of the use of all or a significant portion of a 
strategic production facility. This could result from an accident, a 
strike by employees, fire, severe weather or other cause outside of 
management control. 
LINK TO STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
5 7
 
Potential impact
In the short or long-term, a related risk event 
could adversely affect the Group’s ability to 
meet the demands of its customers.
Specifically, this could entail significant repair 
costs or costs of alternate supply while repairs 
are made. A significant proportion of the 
Group’s revenue is on relatively short lead 
times and a break in our supply chain could 
result in loss of revenue. All of this translates 
into lower sales and profits.
Existing mitigation controls
 Æ Preventative maintenance programmes and new investments to reduce risk of interruption of manufacturing.
 Æ A Group Fire Safety Policy, mandating preventive, detective and containment controls.
 Æ Alternate manufacturing capacity exists for a substantial portion of the Group’s product range.
 Æ Core sites are required to maintain a Business Continuity Plan for use in the event of a serious business disruption.
 Æ Inventory maintained to absorb and flatten out raw material supply and production volatility.
 Æ The Group has comprehensive insurance policies to mitigate the impact of a number of these risks.

People and Change
Detailed risk
The Group’s operations are dependent upon the ability to attract 
and retain the right people with an appropriate range of skills and 
experience. 
Succession planning and the ability to swiftly replace staff retiring or 
leaving is also critical.
LINK TO STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
1 4 6 
Potential impact
Failure to retain, attract or motivate the required  
calibre of employees will negatively impact  
business performance. The delivery of the STEP  
2020 Strategic Plan and our strategic goals may also be delayed.
Existing mitigation controls
 Æ Competitive reward programmes, focused training and development, and a talent retention programme.
 Æ Ongoing reviews of succession plans based on business needs.
 Æ Performance management introduced and training programmes, both being extended in the new financial year. Formal personal 
development review process to be rolled out in the new financial year.
 Æ Management team strengthened with new capability from external hires and internal promotions.
 Æ The Renold Values, launched in 2015, continue to be embedded.

Liquidity, Foreign Exchange and Banking Arrangements
Detailed risk
A lack of sufficient liquidity and flexibility in banking arrangements 
could inhibit the Group’s ability to invest for the future or, in 
extremes, restrict day to day operations. 
In the past, banking markets and Renold’s own performance have 
made access to debt facilities difficult. 
LINK TO STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
4 5 7
Potential impact
 Æ Potentially cause under-investment and  
sub-optimal short-term decision making.
 Æ Limiting investment could prevent efficiency savings  
and reduce competitiveness.
 Æ In an extreme situation, the Group’s ability to operate as a Going 
Concern could also be jeopardised.
Existing mitigation controls
 Æ The Group’s primary banking facility expires in May 2020 and is fully available given current levels of profitability.
 Æ The facility includes additional draw down capability, accessible as long as financial covenants are complied with.
 Æ Six quarters of rolling forward FX cover.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
9
  
Pensions Deficit Volatility
Detailed risk
The principal pensions risk is that short-term cash funding 
requirements of legacy pension scheme diverts much needed 
investment away from the Group’s operations. 
Secondly, the size of the reported balance sheet deficit can operate 
as a disincentive to potential investors or other stakeholders. 
Thirdly, balance sheet deficits can fluctuate based on market 
conditions outside the control of management.
LINK TO STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
7
Potential impact
Given the Group’s cash needs to invest in the  
business, the pace of performance improvement  
could be slowed if cash has to be diverted to the  
pension schemes.
The balance sheet pension deficit and its volatility could act as a 
disincentive to potential investors and could reduce the Group’s ability  
to raise new equity or debt financing.
Existing mitigation controls
 Æ The Pension Strategy has been updated to 2020.
 Æ The major UK pension cash flows (50% of all defined benefit pension cash costs) are stable under the 25 year asset backed funding scheme 
put in place during 2013. A further 25% of the annual cash flows are pensions in payment in Germany in a mature scheme that has passed 
its peak funding requirement. All pension risks are actively managed in line with the Group’s risk management system covering investment 
and liability management issues.
10
  
Regulatory and Legal Compliance
Detailed risk
The risk of censure, fine or business prohibition as a result of any part 
of the Group failing to comply with regulatory or legal obligations.
Risks related to regulatory and legislative changes include the inability 
of the Group to comply with current, changing or new requirements.
Many of the Group’s business activities are subject to increasing 
regulation and enforcement by relevant authorities.
LINK TO STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
7
Potential impact
Failure by the Group or its representatives  
to abide by applicable laws and regulations  
could result in:
 Æ Administrative, civil or criminal liability.
 Æ Significant fines and penalties.
 Æ Suspension of the Group from trading.
 Æ Reputational damage.
Existing mitigation controls
 Æ Communication of a clear compliance culture.
 Æ Risk assessments and ongoing compliance reviews at least annually at all major locations.
 Æ Published up to date policies and procedures with clear guidance and training issued to all employees.
 Æ Monitoring of compliance with nominated accountable managers in each business unit.

Viability Statement
The UK Corporate Governance Code 
requires the Directors to assess the 
prospects of the Group over a period 
significantly longer than 12 months from the 
date of approval of the financial statements. 
The 12 month requirement was the basis for 
assessing the Going Concern basis.
The Group’s STEP 2020 Strategic Plan 
covers the three year period to March 2020. 
The Group’s core financing facility expires 
in May 2020 but, following normal market 
practice, is likely to be renegotiated at least 
12 months earlier. The Board determined 
that the period to March 2020 was the 
appropriate and relevant period over which 
to perform the viability review as it would 
be based on a set of forecasts already 
contained in the Group’s Strategic Plan. 
The Board is not aware of any reason why 
the Group would not be able to refinance 
its core financing facility prior to expiry on 
comparable market based terms at that 
time.
As in prior years, the Board and Audit 
Committee have continued to review and 
assess the Group’s ongoing risk appetite, 
register of principal risks and progress 
on actions to mitigate the probability and 
impact of risks crystallising. The internal 
control structures and processes described 
on pages 66 to 68 also serve to mitigate 
overexposure to single risk events that 
could threaten the Group’s longer term 
viability. While all risks have the potential 
to impact longer term viability, the 
principal risks deemed more relevant for a 
reasonable assessment of viability are set 
out below:
 Æ Strategy Execution: the risk of the 
Group’s inability to successfully 
implement the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan 
which could lead to the Group continuing 
to experience volatile financial results 
and weak levels of cash generation. This 
has the additional potential impact of 
making it difficult to refinance the Group 
in 2019.
 Æ Macroeconomic and political volatility: 
uncertainty driven by global events is 
undoubtedly suppressing demand. These 
events range from Brexit, pressure 
on the stability of the Eurozone and 
volatility in the US. As an international 
manufacturing business the Group 
is dependent on stable trading 
environments to deliver our products 
and shareholder value. A catastrophic 
failure in the Eurozone or the European 
Union, e.g. could seriously undermine the 
Group’s longer term prospects.
The Board has continued to review the 
STEP 2020 Strategic Plan during the 
current year. This included an additional 
detailed review of our markets, competitors 
and product strategies in addition to 
financial forecasts. The detailed review 
assessed the results of stress tests on 
financial forecasts and also financing 
options around our acquisition strategy in 
Phase III of the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan. 
In these stress tests a number of scenarios 
were reviewed including one in which 
sales levels were a further 10% below the 
year ended 31 March 2017 and a second in 
which sales growth was limited to being 
50% below future growth plans. The Board 
thereby assessed the potential impact of 
the risks noted above which could affect 
solvency or liquidity in 'severe but plausible' 
scenarios over the three year period and 
concluded that the business would remain 
viable.
The Group maintains a conservative 
approach to borrowing and while our 
banking covenants have leverage limits of 
2.5x Adjusted EBITDA, the Board makes a 
point of seeking always to operate within 
an internally imposed 2.0x leverage limit 
which ensures there is access to a short-
term borrowing buffer to cope with any 
short-term financial shocks. 
The Group’s currently expanded capital 
investment programme was also included 
in viability assessments to confirm the 
degree and period for which it could be 
curtailed without doing permanent long-
term damage to the business. Current 
capital spend plans are significantly ahead 
of what could reasonably be described 
as ‘maintenance’ capital spend and hence 
provide additional comfort.
Based on the results of the processes 
described above and the Board’s overall 
comprehensive and proactive approach 
to risk management, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will 
be able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of assessment.

HEALTH AND SAFETY
Key Strategic Objective
Renold’s locations across the world operate 
against a simple philosophy expressed in 
the Group Health and Safety Management 
Framework (the Framework) by our Group 
Chief Executive: “Everyone who works at 
Renold should expect to return home at 
night in the same fit and healthy state in 
which they came to work. Very simply, 
safety is our top priority.” 
Significantly improving our health and 
safety performance remains Renold’s 
number one Strategic Objective. Health 
and safety features prominently in 
our assessment of Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties. 
Health and safety governance
Governance structures are clearly defined. 
These include a Group Health and Safety 
policy which is reviewed annually. 
Cascading from this is the Framework 
which defines the Board’s expectations 
regarding health and safety control and 
performance. Management across all 
locations are required to adhere to the 
Framework. This contains principles and 
expectations describing a set of outcomes 
and provides a structure to manage health 
and safety. The Framework is consistent 
with recognised standards, including the 
internationally adopted model of Plan-Do-
Measure-Learn and OHSAS 18001, with 
accredited certification held by all of our 
major production facilities.
The Framework consists of seven core 
components, which include setting a 
supportive leadership tone, with sub-
processes, covering e.g. hazard assessment, 
incident management and the management 
of third parties. 
We use a web based Integrated Risk 
Management System (IRMS) which 
provides aligned processes and data mining 
functionality. This allows sites to manage 
accident reporting, opportunities for 
improvement, hazard assessment and all 
action tracking. Performance data to inform 
monthly Board reporting and site reviews 
are derived from the system. 
An independent programme of audits is 
in place, which requires all material sites 
to be audited within a 12 month period. 
This assesses compliance and performance 
against the Framework. Each audit typically 
takes a week to perform, to allow a robust 
assessment of compliance against the 
Framework. The assurance results along 
with other typical KPIs are reported each 
month to the Board and reviewed under a 
standing agenda item. There is particular 
focus on any serious accidents and the 
quality of accident investigations, ensuring 
that true root causes are identified and 
addressed.
Improvement initiatives
The following examples of health and safety 
initiatives and specific site improvements 
are indicative of the broad range of positive 
changes which continue to be made:
 Æ Renold’s Health and Safety Awards 
scheme is now an important part of the 
calendar for all sites.
 Æ The BAT logo (shown on page 49) 
continues to be used by all sites to 
reinforce the message: Be safe; Act safe; 
Think safe.
 Æ Personal protective equipment 
requirements are regularly reviewed 
and we have ensured that clear 
communication of standards is observed.
A safe business 
provides the 
foundations for a 
profitable business. 
Our health and safety 
KPIs show considerable 
improvement and 
are the result of the 
considerable focus 
in this area in recent 
years. That focus 
will continue as we 
strive for further 
improvement.

 Æ All core production sites have introduced 
a new standardised health and safety 
information board, which includes 
themes which align to the Framework 
and the Health and Safety Awards.
 Æ Replacement guarding has been fitted 
to machinery to prevent strike hazards 
from materials.
 Æ Mandated standards relevant to fire 
safety have been developed and are 
being rolled out.
 Æ Guidance has been issued regarding 
workplace transport hazard 
management. 
 Æ Following a review of accident root 
causes and trends, at our Einbeck, 
Germany site, 5,000 parts bins have 
been replaced and new glove protection 
is being trialled, designed to reduce the 
risk of finger injuries.
Improved Groupwide performance 
The Group uses a number of KPIs to 
monitor performance. Each Board meeting 
considers a comprehensive report from the 
Group Risk Management function, which 
includes a rolling analysis of a range of KPIs 
along with other relevant criteria. Examples 
are provided on this page showing 
performance for the five years to 31 March 
2017. Some key highlights during the year 
include:
 Æ A year on year reduction of 13% in our 
reportable accident rate (greater than 
three lost days).
 Æ Continuation of an exercise started 
in the prior year to develop hazard 
assessments against a standardised 
methodology – 3,541 assessments 
completed to date.
 Æ A total of 1,416 employee generated 
safety improvement opportunities.
 Æ In recognition of the improvements, we 
are working with our insurers to leverage 
a further reduction in related insurance 
premiums. A £50k bursary allowance has 
been made available to help deliver future 
improvement initiatives.

Renold Health and Safety  
Awards Scheme
The annual Health and Safety Awards  
scheme was launched in 2014. The scheme  
rules encourage continuous improvement and  
align to the Framework. During the year, we refined  
the rules to implement stretch targets as part of a programme of 
continuous improvement. There is now an increased emphasis on 
innovative initiatives which are aimed at winning hearts and minds. 
Recognising the further improvements made across the Group, eight 
awards were made during 2016 (eight in 2015). 
The images show awards being presented by Chief Executive, Robert 
Purcell, to our teams in Milnrow (left) and South Africa (above). 
LOST TIME DAYS
1 Lost time accident frequency rate = (no. of lost time accidents in the 12 month period/total hours worked in the 12 month period) x 1,000,000.
2 Trend of reportable injury rates = (no. of accidents greater than three lost days divided by average number of employees in the 12 month period) x 100,000. Note that 
whilst accidents greater than seven days are reportable events in the UK, Renold monitors both three and seven lost day categories.

The Board is mindful of the importance 
to the business of its responsibility to 
stakeholders and the wider community. We 
recognise our duty to behave responsibly 
towards all stakeholders in our business, 
including shareholders, employees, 
customers, suppliers and communities in 
which we operate. 
Our approach to corporate social 
responsibility has three key elements: 
our people, our community and our 
environment. The commitment to our 
people includes the provision of a rewarding 
and safe environment for our employees 
and the way in which we work according to 
our Values.
Detailed information in relation to health 
and safety matters is reported upon at 
pages 48 and 49 of this Annual Report. 
The Board has overall responsibility for 
corporate social responsibility with the 
Chief Executive taking direct leadership 
responsibility supported by the regional and 
business unit Executive teams.
Aligned to this is our continuous 
commitment to uphold good corporate 
governance principles, in respect of which 
further details are set out in our Corporate 
Governance Report on pages 58 to 59.
Our employees 
The Group requires motivated, talented 
employees, with a clear understanding 
of their role within the business in order 
to deliver our Strategic Objectives. 
Consequently, Renold remains actively 
focused on the delivery of actions in the 
following areas:
 Æ Talent acquisition and optimisation of 
organisation structures 
 — Attracting, recruiting and retaining 
talented individuals and optimising 
our organisational structures to 
enable them to operate effectively.
 Æ Values, behaviours and engagement
 — Establishing a values driven working 
environment that actively engages 
employees.
 Æ Creating a high performance culture
 — Recognising and rewarding strong 
performance and identifying 
opportunities for learning and 
development.
 Æ Compliance
 — Ensuring compliance with 
employment regulations wherever we 
operate.
In line with the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan, 
the Group has continued to build upon the 
foundation laid down in previous years and 
to make progress in each of these key areas.
Talent acquisition and optimisation of 
organisation structures 
As in previous years, the Group has 
continued to review and strengthen the 
management team and organisation 
structures, with new appointments 
into key roles including Group Finance 
Director, Managing Director – Couplings 
and Managing Director Chain – South East 
Asia. The business has increasingly been 
able to focus on clarifying, developing 
and strengthening the capability of 
management and staff at deeper levels in 
the organisation. 
Our recruitment processes to enable 
the sourcing and assessment of high 
calibre people at the right time into well-
defined roles with clear deliverables and 
accountabilities continues to evolve. As 
our understanding of what it takes to be 
successful in our business develops we 
are able to focus on the key competencies 
and capacities that are critical to identify 
in future hires. In particular, a more 
rigorous use of skills assessments in areas 
such as numerical and verbal reasoning, 
and the insistence on standards of high 
performance in these areas is beginning 
to bear fruit. The Company will continue 
to refine and standardise our capability 
in this area in the coming financial year, 
particularly with the introduction of a 
consistent methodology for definition, 
activation and assessment of roles and 
candidates across the Group globally. 
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

to corporate social 
responsibility is

protection of the long-
term interests of our 
shareholders.

As in the past, Renold continues to 
implement programmes to develop 'home 
grown' talent. 
We continue to operate our apprenticeship 
programmes, particularly in the UK and 
Germany. 
The UK currently has seven apprentices 
within our Torque Transmission business 
and is planning to add several more in 
the coming year. Our Chain business in 
Einbeck, Germany, has 21 apprentices 
working across a broad range of levels and 
disciplines including engineering, technical, 
administration and logistics functions. 
From the coming financial year onwards, 
Renold will be making a contribution to the 
Apprenticeship Levy. In order to ensure that 
we are in a position to fully maximise our 
utilisation of the funds from the levy we are 
working with an external organisation (The 
Skills Company) to develop a bespoke action 
plan, specifically tailored to the future 
needs of Renold. We anticipate, for the 
UK in particular, that this will enhance the 
uptake in apprenticeships and the delivery 
of training to apprentices.
Renold has also continued to develop the 
Future Leaders Graduate Programme in the 
past year. Through an assessment process 
designed to objectively identify graduates 
with future leadership potential, we 
employed six additional graduates onto the 
programme in the UK.
Each of these graduate Future Leaders 
has had a real job in the organisation from 
their first day of employment and are 
participants in a structured programme of 
training and development with 12 training 
modules being delivered by external experts 
over a two year period. These modules aim 
to provide participants with a broad range 
of skills and knowledge to act as a base 
upon which they can further develop as 
their careers progress. Additionally, they 
have the opportunity to be involved in 
critical business projects and have regular 
exposure to the senior leadership team. 
The new graduates were recruited in 
September 2016 into diverse functions, 
including business systems, engineering, 
commercial and manufacturing operations. 
Including the Future Leaders we recruited 
in September 2015 we now have eleven 
employees in this important programme. 
It is particularly pleasing that, to date, we 
have had no turnover in our Future Leaders 
cohort. 
We expect this programme to be one of the 
key processes through which the business 
continues to ensure that we internally 
develop our leaders of the future. The 
intention in the next financial year is to seek 
to broaden the geographic scope of the 
programme beyond Europe. 
Finally, this year we defined and selectively 
deployed a Talent Review Process. The 
process focused on a review of staff in key 
areas of the business and assesses both the 
performance and the longer term potential 
of those individuals and teams. Based on 
those evaluations, senior management 
teams were able to prioritise the key actions 
required in order to address both the short 
and longer term issues that were identified. 
This process will be repeated each year, 
enabling us to create a straightforward and 
practical continuous improvement ethos in 
the area of talent development.

Values, behaviour and engagement 
The Renold Values and Behaviours continue 
to act as an important standard to which 
we hold both ourselves and our employees. 
Since the launch of the Renold Values we 
have continued the work of embedding 
these in the business.
The Values and Behaviours are clearly 
communicated across the Group and are 
increasingly becoming integrated into the 
way in which we do things. In particular, 
we have focused on ensuring that our 
recruitment methodology incorporates 
our Values and Behaviours and that we 
specifically seek future hires who are able to 
demonstrate alignment with these desirable 
traits. The Company has also incorporated 
an evaluation of senior manager 
awareness and adherence to our Values 
and Behaviours into our Performance and 
Development Review Process. 
Across our global locations we continue 
to align the requirement to embed 
Organisational Values and Behaviours in 
the terms and conditions of employment. 
The importance of our Values is emphasised 
during the induction process for new 
employees.
We plan to continue to focus on the 
process of further embedding our Values 
and Behaviours in the business as Renold 
continues to develop, ensuring that, for the 
long-term, our Values and Behaviours shape 
our evolving culture. 
Creating a high performance culture 
Given the importance of setting clear 
expectations and targets for employees 
and regularly reviewing them, the Company 
launched in 2016, a new Performance and 
Development Review process. The process 
initially focused on senior managers and 
other key role holders and has generated 
positive feedback from both groups.
The process supports the setting and 
recording of goals and expectations and 
provides a consistent mechanism for 
measuring and monitoring employee 
performance against these expectations. 
Simultaneously, this process will encourage 
the identification of development needs 
(including coaching, training and other 
development opportunities) to enable 
enhanced performance against expectations 
in the future. Straightforward action plans 
to address issues arising from these reviews 
will be created and regularly reviewed to 
ensure progress.
Renold will continue to develop the process, 
cascading it throughout the business. We 
will also seek ways of gathering feedback to 
refine and improve the process.
The Company has developed a bespoke 
management skills programme designed to 
provide our managers with the necessary 
knowledge and skills to be able to more 
effectively manage their teams and deliver 
their business objectives. This programme 
will be implemented over the coming 
months in a modular fashion. Action plans 
for each individual will be created within 
each module to ensure that the learning is 
embedded in the day to day activity of the 
attendees. The line managers of attendees 
will also be given training to ensure that 
they are in a position to support the 
development of managers as they return 
from each training session. 
The pilot will be evaluated as it is 
implemented with the intention to further 
refine the content and delivery and enable 
continued roll out of the programme to a 
wider audience.
The delivery of targeted development 
activities and programmes designed to 
enhance the capability and performance 
of our employees is clearly a growing 
priority as we strive to develop our high 
performing culture. During the coming 
financial year we will further develop our 
capability to identify and deliver a broader 
suite of programmes for a wider geographic 
audience.
Compliance 
Arrangements for consulting and involving 
Group employees on matters affecting 
their interests at work are developed 
in ways appropriate to each business. 
A variety of approaches is adopted, 
aimed at encouraging the involvement of 
employees in effective communication 
and consultation, and the contribution of 
productive ideas at all levels.
The Group's intranet site enables access 
to the latest Group information as well as 
Group policies. We also undertake regular 
presentations to employees throughout 
the Group where the half year and year-
end financial results are presented and 
explained by senior management. This helps 
to achieve a common awareness amongst 
employees of the financial and economic 
factors affecting the performance of the 
Group. 
Employment policies are designed to 
provide equal opportunities irrespective 
of race, caste, national origin, religion, age, 
disability, gender, marital status, sexual 
orientation or political affiliation. 
Group policy is to ensure that disabled 
applicants for employment are given full 
and fair consideration having regard to their 
particular aptitudes and abilities, and that 
existing disabled employees are given equal 
access to training, career development 
and promotion opportunities. In the event 
of existing employees becoming disabled, 
all reasonable means would be explored 
to achieve retention in employment in the 
same or an alternative capacity, including 
arranging appropriate training.
We monitor developments in employment 
law that may affect our employees in the 
regions in which we operate and make 
adjustments as necessary. 
We are also aware of the necessity to 
develop proposals to enable the Group to 
be compliant with gender pay gap reporting 
legislation requiring employers to calculate 
their gender pay gap from April 2017 and 
formally report the details by April 2018.
Business integrity and ethics 
We operate the business in an ethical and 
responsible manner and we expect our 
employees and business operations to 
conduct themselves ethically, and to be 
honest, fair and courteous in their dealings.
The highest standards of ethical business 
conduct are required of our employees in 
the performance of their duties. Employees 
may not engage in conduct or activity that

may raise questions as to Renold’s honesty, 
impartiality, reputation or otherwise 
cause embarrassment to the Group. Our 
employees are required to neither offer 
nor accept improper and/or illegal gifts, 
hospitality or payments in accordance with 
the Group Gifts and Hospitality policy.
Every Renold employee has the 
responsibility to ask questions, seek 
guidance and report suspected violations 
of the Group’s code of ethics. A free of 
charge, independent whistle blowing hotline 
continues to be available to all employees 
across the Group, enabling them to report 
any concerns about theft, fraud and other 
malpractice in the workplace.
The Group is also committed to compliance 
with anti-corruption laws in all countries 
and operates a zero tolerance policy. 
The Group Anti-Corruption policy forms 
part of that commitment, together with the 
Gifts and Hospitality policy, both of which 
are designed to assist Renold employees 
in meeting corporate and individual 
obligations under anti-corruption laws. 
Implementation of these policies followed 
the coming into force of the UK Bribery Act 
in 2011. 
Each business unit is required to maintain 
a register of gifts and hospitality which 
is submitted and reviewed by the Group 
Finance and Legal functions on a biannual 
basis. Sites will be challenged where any 
gift or hospitality appears in the first 
instance to have been given or received 
outside of the terms of the Gifts and 
Hospitality Policy. 
Other control processes and updates to 
formal contractual arrangements with 
agents and distributors have been put 
in place to ensure compliance with the 
requirements of the UK Bribery Act. 
In addition, an annual training programme 
is in place for all members of staff whose 
roles involve working in environments or 
activities where there is a perceived risk. 
The training is also undertaken by external 
parties, such as agents. 
The underlying objective in all these 
measures is to maintain the highest 
standards of integrity throughout the 
business and ensure that all business 
dealings are transparent. 
Human rights
The Group is required to make a disclosure 
in relation to human rights. The Board has 
overall responsibility for ensuring the Group 
upholds and promotes respect for human 
rights and has adopted the definition 
of human rights within the European 
Convention on Human Rights: the concept 
of human beings as having universal rights, 
or status, regardless of legal jurisdiction or 
other localising factors, such as ethnicity, 
nationality, and sex. 
The Group respects all human rights and in 
conducting its business regards the right 
to non-discrimination and fair treatment 
as the most relevant to its key stakeholder 
groups, these being customers, employees 
and suppliers. The Group’s employment 
policies and procedures reflect principles of 
equal treatment. Respect for the individual 
is also enshrined in Renold’s statement of 
Values and Behaviours.
The Group has not been made aware of 
any incident in which the organisation’s 
activities have resulted in an abuse of 
human rights.
Following the introduction of the UK 
Modern Slavery Act 2015, we have 
published a statement on our website 
which sets out the steps being taken by the 
Group to ensure that slavery and human 
trafficking are not taking place in the 
business or the supply chain relating to our 
goods. The Group is committed to ensuring 
that our business and business partners 
do not undertake any activity which 
contravenes the Modern Slavery Act.
Diversity
The Group is committed to equal 
opportunities and operates a non-
discriminatory working environment. 
We expect staff and job applicants to be 
treated equally regardless of age, race, 
religion, disability, gender or sexuality.
As at 31 March 2017, the Group 
employed 2,139 people including 
348 in the UK. Of the total number 
of employees 368 (17%) are female. 
The Company recognises the need to 
encourage and support more gender 
diversity throughout the employee 
population as well as at Board level.
Set out in the charts opposite is a 
breakdown of the gender of our Board 
members, and, in accordance with new 
reporting requirements introduced last 
year, the number of ‘senior managers’ 
(including directors of the Company’s 
subsidiary companies) and employees 
as at 31 March 2017. A senior manager is 
defined in the legislation as an employee 
who has responsibility for planning, 
directing or controlling the activities of 
a company or a strategically significant 
part of a company. Whilst falling within 
the definition of ‘senior manager’, the 
most senior leadership population 
(below the Board), the Group Executive, 
is shown in a separate chart.

Our community 
We aim to be a part of the communities 
in which we work and seek to assist local 
projects with support where possible. 
Although the Group is limited in our ability 
to provide extensive financial support to 
projects, we do seek to provide support 
where we can in a number of ways. 
During this financial year the Company 
agreed to support The Outward Bound 
Trust. The Trust is an educational charity 
that uses the outdoors to help develop 
young people from all walks of life. They 
run adventurous and challenging outdoor 
learning programmes that equip young 
people with valuable skills for education, 
work and life. This helps participants to 
become more confident, more effective 
and more capable at school, college and 
in the workplace. Although in the early 
stages of this partnership, in addition to 
providing some financial support to the 
Trust, we are in discussions with them 
about how we can arrange for a number of 
our employees to become involved in the 
activities of the Trust, in particular acting as 
mentors to the young people attending the 
outdoor learning programmes. As well as 
supporting the amazing work that the Trust 
does, this will help with the engagement 
and development of our own employees, 
particularly those that participate in the 
mentoring opportunities. 
We plan to continue our relationship with 
The Outward Bound Trust into the next 
financial year. 
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 
Also this year, in a pro-active response 
to the Broad-Based Black Economic 
Empowerment (BBBEE) legislation in 
South Africa, Renold South Africa has 
implemented its own BBBEE trust. Renold 
South Africa has sold a new special 
class of share to the trust, the Renold 
SA Development Trust, by way of loan 
funding.
The BBBEE Act 2003 was introduced as a 
form of economic empowerment initiated 
by the South African Government in 
response to criticism of earlier statutory 
changes that had failed to lead to the 
enrichment of disadvantaged individuals. 
The goal of BBBEE is to distribute wealth 
across as broad a spectrum of previously 
disadvantaged South African citizens as 
possible.
Companies operating in South Africa are 
required to transform their businesses 
by operating according to the Codes of 
Good Practice implemented to give force 
to the BBBEE Act. Based on the Codes, 
companies receive a rating indicating the 
level of compliance. 
The objectives of the Renold SA 
Development Trust are to provide 
training and development and/or further 
education in industrial manufacturing, 
engineering and general business fields 
and to assisting other BBBEE initiatives 
of Renold SA’s customers. Beneficiaries 
can therefore be employees (e.g. paying 
for studies or training of employees) and 
customers' own BBBEE initiatives.
We are delighted to be a supporter of 
the Museum of Science and Industry in 
Manchester, having been involved in the 
Manchester Science Festival Supporters’ 
Circle for a further year. 
The Museum of Science and Industry is 
one of the most visited cultural attractions 
in the North West, with 700,000 visitors 
a year. A member of the Science Museum 
Group’s family of world-class museums, 
its mission is to inspire all visitors with the 
story of how ideas can change the world, 
from the industrial revolution to today and 
beyond.
One of the flagship events in the Museum’s 
cultural calendar, bringing science to 
life for people of all ages, is the eleven 
day Manchester Science Festival, which 
takes place across the city. Each October, 
it attracts the best scientists from 
Manchester and beyond to showcase 
current research and promote the region’s 
rich heritage of innovation.
As a supporter, the Company provides 
financial support to enable the Museum 
to deliver a programme of exciting events, 
exhibitions, talks and performances. In 
2016, the Festival celebrated its ten year 
anniversary and set a new visitor record.

Notes
1 
Scope 1 emissions are from those direct sources that are owned by the Group (e.g. from direct combustion of natural 
gas within our facilities’ boilers and heaters). Fugitive gases are not included. 
2 
Scope 2 emissions comprise those emissions for which the Group is indirectly responsible, excluding transmission 
and distribution losses (e.g. from the electricity we purchase to operate machinery or equipment). An amendment 
made during 2015 to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol incorporates two calculation methodologies for scope 2 
emissions. There are no contractual instruments in place for the purchase of renewable energy. Hence, we report the 
same figure when applying the market and location based methodologies.
3 
The UK Government guidance was considered when selecting the Company’s chosen intensity measurement which is 
total emissions reported normalised to £m external revenue for the financial year ending 31 March 2017.
4 
The calculation methodology is based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol developed jointly by the World Resources 
Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. 
Our environment
The environmental impact of our activities 
is at the forefront of our strategy. Across 
all our operations, we meet all legislative 
requirements concerning environmental 
issues, including those relating to energy 
usage. As a part of the Group’s commitment 
to minimising the impacts of its business 
operations on the environment, we 
co-operate with regulators, suppliers, 
neighbours and customers to develop 
and achieve improved standards of 
environmental protection. All of our 
production facilities either hold or are 
working towards ISO 14001.
During the year, a range of projects 
have delivered further environmental 
improvements. These include emission 
reductions at our Hangzhou site, waste 
reduction initiatives across a number of 
sites and insulation improvements from 
new and modified roofing structures. Our 
ongoing programme of investment in new 
equipment will bring further efficiencies 
over the coming year. 
Energy Saving Opportunities Scheme 
(ESOS)
ESOS is a mandatory energy assessment 
scheme for organisations in the UK 
that meet the qualification criteria. The 
Environment Agency is the UK scheme 
administrator.
Renold qualifies for ESOS and must carry 
out ESOS assessments every four years. 
These assessments are audits of the energy 
used in our buildings, industrial processes 
and transport to identify cost-effective 
energy saving measures. 
To deliver our obligations under phase 1 of 
the ESOS legislation, we opted to undertake 
an ESOS Energy Survey. A specialist 
consultancy was appointed to assist the 
Company in completing the survey in June 
2015. The reported findings are being used 
to inform the development of a series 
of energy reduction and management 
measures.
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
Renold continues to comply with its 
obligations under the carbon reporting 
requirements of The Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) 
Regulations 2013.
Energy usage across the Group is collated 
using data captured through the Group’s 
Integrated Risk Management web based 
IT system. This energy consumption 
database makes data readily available. 
Data is actively reviewed in order to target 
additional energy reduction programmes.
The main contributors to GHG emissions 
arise from our use of electricity and fuels, 
such as natural gas and fuel oil, burnt on 
our premises.
The table below shows the Group’s GHG 
data in tonnes for the last four financial 
years across all locations, derived from the 
consumption data collected and the DEFRA 
and International Energy Agency published 
conversion factor tables.
Renold continues to sustain an underlying 
reduction in energy usage. Related cross 
site initiatives include:
 Æ New roof and insulation projects;
 Æ Low energy lighting; and
 Æ More efficient production arising from 
investment.

As reported last year, legislation in India 
requires companies of a certain size to spend 
a percentage of profit on Corporate Social 
Responsibility initiatives. As a result, this 
year Renold India has been working with 
communities and relevant stakeholders 
to assist local government schools in 
the provision of better infrastructure 
and educational facilities. Renold India’s 
'Corporate Social Responsibility Vision' has 
been formulated in connection with the 
statutory requirement in India. The areas 
listed in the statute include promoting 
education.
Renold India believes that education is the 
tool for creating an empowered, enlightened 
society. More than 60% of children in India 
are enrolled in government schools, however, 
the infrastructure and facilities and quality 
of the education are often below acceptable 
levels. Through better facilities and higher 
quality education all round it is anticipated 
there will be a reduction in the dropout rate 
of students.
The programme has been developed 
following discussions with local school 
management and covers the following:
 Æ To support government schools with 
basic access to infrastructure.
 Æ To support government schools with 
digital learning and teaching systems, 
capacity building of teachers, career 
orientation and counselling.
 Æ Life skills and spoken English projects, 
supporting the vocational skills 
sessions in the schools.
 Æ Providing lighting facilities for schools 
through solar energy.
 Æ Contributions have been made to 
change certain basic infrastructures 
including the building of walls to 
improve security, installation of 
electrical facilities such as fans and 
lights and the building of rest rooms 
for female students which are often 
lacking in local schools.

Governance in Action
The UK Corporate Governance Code is based on 
underlying principles of accountability, transparency, 
probity and focus on the success of a company 
over the longer term. These principles are equally 
applicable to effective board practice as they are to 
all aspects of our business.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Chairman's Letter
Introduction 
I am pleased to present the Corporate Governance report for the 
year ended 31 March 2017 on behalf of the Board. 
The Board continues to give priority to consideration of corporate 
governance matters, good and effective corporate governance 
being critical to long-term business success.
A detailed list of contents of the Corporate Governance report can 
be found on page 57. The Group’s principal risks and uncertainties 
are described in the Strategic Report and this section of the Annual 
Report and Accounts also forms part of the Corporate Governance 
report. 
Board changes
This year has seen significant changes to the Board which 
demonstrate the Board’s commitment to orderly succession 
planning. In January 2017, we welcomed our new Group Finance 
Director, Ian Scapens, to the Board and a further Non-Executive 
Director, David Landless. Both new Directors will play vital roles as 
we continue to implement our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan.
Ian joined the Company from Keepmoat Group and brings 
extensive experience in all aspects of finance in large complex 
organisations. David was most recently Group Finance Director of 
Bodycote plc for 17 years and has significant experience at senior 
levels of international businesses in the industrials sector. David’s 
appointment was a successful step in Renold’s succession planning 
process for Board members which was outlined in the Nomination 
Committee Report in the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts.
David will become Chairman of the Audit Committee on completion 
of the AGM on 19 July 2017, succeeding John Allkins who will step 
down after nine years in the role. John is also currently Senior 
Independent Director and Ian Griffiths will step into this role after 
the AGM. John will continue as a Non-Executive Director until the 
conclusion of the 2018 AGM, facilitating a valuable handover period 
to David in particular. I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
John for his extremely valuable contribution to the Board and his 
Chairmanship of the Audit Committee to date.
Tone from the top
The Board will continue to set the right ‘tone from the top’ and 
firmly believes in operating to the highest standards of ethical 
business conduct. These principles are reflected in the statement of 
our Values and Renold requires the same from all employees in the 
performance of their duties. 
Aside from matters of corporate governance and ethics, the key 
priority for the Board remains the delivery of the STEP 2020 
Strategic Plan. At page 64 of our Corporate Governance report 
we set out the areas of focus for the Board this year and highlight 
the links between the issues considered and the Group’s Strategic 
Objectives. 
Annual General Meeting 
Our AGM will be held at 11.00am on Wednesday 19 July 2017 at the

Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
The Group is committed to high standards of corporate 
governance in order to facilitate efficient, effective and 
entrepreneurial management of the Company. The Board 
acknowledges its contribution to achieving management 
accountability, improving risk management and ultimately to 
creating shareholder value over the longer term. 
In this report, we explain the Group’s approach to corporate 
governance and provide the information required of us by 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 (2014 Code) which 
applies to the Company for this reporting period. The Board’s 
compliance statement is therefore provided against the 
requirements of the 2014 Code. 
The 2014 Code sets out guidance for companies with a 
premium listing in the form of main principles and specific 
provisions of good governance. The rules of the FCA require 
UK listed companies to disclose how they have applied those 
principles and whether they have complied with the provisions 
throughout the financial year.
The obligation of all listed companies is to comply with the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, or to explain 
why it has not done so. The Board considers that the Company 
has complied with all provisions set out in the 2014 Code that 
are applicable to it throughout the year ended 31 March 2017, 
except where highlighted in this report. 
The 2014 Code is available to view on the FRC’s website at  
www.frc.org.uk.
The Board continues to be mindful of the requirements of 
corporate governance and reviews its compliance regularly 
along with all revisions to the UK Corporate Governance Code 
made by the Financial Reporting Council. During the year, 
the Board has considered the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2016, which applies to reporting periods 
commencing after 17 June 2016, and therefore against which 
disclosure will be given in the 2018 Annual Report.

Board and Committee membership and attendance
The Board meets on a regular basis with an agenda and necessary 
papers for discussion distributed electronically in advance of each 
meeting via board portal software, Diligent. Agenda items are 
agreed in advance and set out in an annual planning schedule. 
The meetings are scheduled to coincide with the internal financial 
reporting timetable of the Company and key events including 
interim and final results, and the AGM.
The Board’s responsibilities are discharged by way of scheduled 
Board meetings. In addition, the Board reviews written reports in 
months where there is no meeting and convenes ad hoc meetings 
during the year in order to resolve matters by written resolutions to 
deal with specific business requirements.
The table below shows the number of meetings of the Board and 
its Committees during the year and individual attendance by Board 
and Committee members at those meetings. Eight core meetings 
have been held this year. In addition, the Board met for a separate 
full day to discuss the further evolution of the STEP 2020 Strategic 
Plan. All Directors attended all core scheduled Board meetings, as 
can be seen in the table of attendance below, other than the March 
2017 meeting: David Landless joined the Board in January 2017 
and was unable to attend the March meeting due to a pre-existing 
schedule conflict.

Risk monitoring 
The Board has overall responsibility for implementing the Group’s

regulatory compliance controls and risk management systems. 
The Board is also responsible for reviewing internal control 
effectiveness and compliance in accordance with the FRC’s ‘Internal 
Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code 
(October 2005)’.
The ongoing process for the review of the system of internal 
controls by the Directors has been in place for the whole of the year 
ended 31 March 2017 and up to the date of approval of this report 
and the financial statements. 
Internal controls and the risk management processes are reviewed

Risk Management and Monitoring Committee (ERMMC) after each 
meeting to the Audit Committee.

 Æ Review of governance structures for major projects including the

Director induction and development
The training needs of the Board are discussed as part of the Board 
performance evaluation process. Updates are provided to the Board 
at regular intervals in order to refresh the Directors’ knowledge. 
Training is arranged primarily by the Company Secretary in 
consultation with the Chairman. During the period, the Board has 
received an update from the Company Secretary in relation to 
the 2016 Code. Remuneration advisers, PwC, have also presented 
updates to the Remuneration Committee in relation to market 
trends in executive remuneration.
The Company has a detailed framework for the induction of new 
Directors. This includes the issuing of all key documents relating 
to the new Director’s role on the Board, as well as site visits and 
face-to-face meetings with senior executives. Throughout the 
year the Executive Directors have continued to visit Renold sites 
around the world including: the USA, India, France, South Africa, 
Germany and Australia. The Board itself also met during the year 
at both of Renold’s manufacturing sites in Germany and at a UK 
manufacturing site.
Non-Executive Director independence
The Non-Executive Directors are considered to be independent 
in character and judgement, notwithstanding in the case of John 
Allkins that he has served on the Board for more than nine years. 
The Board is of the opinion that all of the Directors take decisions 
objectively and in the best interests of the Company and that no 
individual or small group of individuals can dominate the Board’s 
decision making. The balance between Non-Executive and Executive 
Directors allows independent challenge to the Executive Directors 
and senior management.
Board evaluation and effectiveness
The Board is supportive of the principle of evaluation of the Board, 
as set out in paragraph B.6 of the 2014 Code, and recognises 
that evaluation of its performance is important in enabling it to 
realise its maximum potential. A formal process for evaluating 
the performance of the Board, its members and its Committees 
is planned and is conducted annually. This process gives the 
Directors the opportunity to identify areas for improvement both 
jointly and individually through the use of questionnaires and/or 
open discussion. An evaluation of the Chairman is also carried out 
annually, led by the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. 
In addition, evaluations of the Audit Committee, the Nomination 
Committee and the Remuneration Committee were also carried out 
during the year.
The evaluation process commences with the completion of a 
written questionnaire for each separate review, compilation of a 
summary of the results and feedback obtained and then discussion 
between the participants. The subsequent Board discussion 
highlighted a number of areas where objectives might be set by 
the Board and practical issues for consideration. The Board has 
continued to allocate separate time for review and consideration of 
the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan.
In accordance with the 2014 Code, the evaluation process also 
included a number of discussions during the year between the 
Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors, without the Executive 
Directors present, to discuss feedback arising from the process 
and the performance of each Executive Director. The Senior 
Independent Director also met with the other Directors as part of 
the Chairman’s performance evaluation process.
Election of Directors
The 2014 Code recommends that all Directors of FTSE 350 
companies should be subject to annual election by shareholders. 
This provision is not applicable to the Company. However, with a 
view to complying voluntarily with all terms of the Governance 
Code where practical, all Non-Executive Directors are subject to 
annual election.

Internal control 
During the year ended 31 March 2017, the responsibility to 
review internal control effectiveness was delegated to the Audit 
Committee and reported to the Board as follows: 
 Æ Receiving and considering regular reports from the internal audit 
function on the status of internal control across the Group;
 Æ Reviewed the internal audit function’s findings, annual audit plan 
and the resources available to it to perform its work; 
 Æ Reviewing the external Auditor’s findings on internal financial 
control; and 
 Æ Monitoring the adequacy and timeliness of management’s 
response to identified audit findings.
The executive team is accountable to the Directors for 
implementing Board policies on internal control and for monitoring 
and reporting to the Board that it has done so. 
Group internal controls are designed to mitigate rather than 
eliminate the risks identified and can provide only reasonable and 
not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
In addition, the Renold Internal Control Statement (summarised 
in the chart on page 67) contains details of such matters as Group 
signing authorities, contracting principles and an ethics policy to 
ensure that all Group employees conduct business on behalf of the 
Group on the same basis and in accordance with approved policies 
and procedures. This has been approved by the Board and has 
been fully rolled out across the Group. Separate Group policies also 
address anti-corruption and gifts and hospitality.
Financial reporting
There are also established internal control systems in relation to 
the Company’s financial reporting process and the Group’s process 
for preparation of consolidated accounts. These systems include 
policies and procedures that: relate to the maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions 
and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with IFRS; require 
representatives of the businesses to certify that their reported 
information gives a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
business and its results for the period; and review and reconcile 
reported data. The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing 
these internal control systems.
Governance in action: Fair, balanced and understandable 
The Annual Report and Accounts taken as a whole must be 
fair, balanced and understandable. The fair, balanced and 
understandable requirement is reviewed in the first instance by the 
Disclosure Committee and subsequently the Audit Committee and 
the Board as shown below.

Communications with shareholders
Communications with shareholders
Communications with shareholders are given high priority 
and are made in a number of ways. The Board is accountable 
to shareholders and therefore it is important for the Board to 
appreciate the requirements of shareholders and equally that 
shareholders understand how the actions of the Board and short-
term financial performance relate to the achievement of longer 
term goals. The Non-Executive Directors make themselves available 
to meet shareholders on request, can attend shareholder visits at 
Company sites and are available for discussions with analysts and 
the Company’s broker.
The reporting calendar is driven by the publication of interim and 
final results each year, in which the Board reports to shareholders 
on its management of the Company. Formal regulatory news 
service announcements are also made in accordance with the 
Company’s reporting obligations. Comments on Group financial 
performance in the context of the business risks faced and 
objectives and plans for the future are set out in the Strategic 
Report on pages 40 to 46.
The Company continues to keep shareholders informed of its 
strategy and progress at other times during the year, with updates 
provided to the London Stock Exchange and shareholders via 
the Company’s website at www.renold.com. The Board receives 
feedback from the Company’s brokers throughout the year. In 
addition, the Chief Executive and Finance Director meet with major 
shareholders and potential investors to discuss Group strategy 
and performance and update the Board as a whole accordingly at 
each meeting. The Board also receives reports prior to each Board 
meeting which set out the main changes to the composition of the 
Company’s share register. 
The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director does not generally 
attend meetings with shareholders although he makes himself 
available to attend such meetings if and when required. Whilst 
the Company is not in compliance with paragraph E1.1 of the 2014 
Code, the Chairman ensures that the Chief Executive and Finance 
Director provide feedback to the Board following presentations 
to investors, and meetings with shareholders and analysts’ and 
brokers’ briefings are circulated to all Directors in order to ensure 
that Board members, and in particular Non-Executive Directors, 
develop an understanding of the views of major shareholders about 
their Company. 
Annual General Meeting 
The AGM provides an opportunity for communication with private 
and institutional investors. shareholders are encouraged to attend 
the AGM and we welcome their participation.
At the AGM, the Chairman of the Board and the three Non-
Executive Directors (including therefore the chairmen of the Audit 
and Remuneration Committees), together with the Executive 
Directors, will be available to answer questions. The Chairman 
of the Board is also Chairman of the Nomination Committee and 
the Chief Executive chairs the Executive Risk Management and 
Monitoring Committee.
Notice of the AGM is sent to shareholders at least 20 business 
days before the meeting. Details of the proxy votes lodged on each 
resolution are made available and shareholders are invited to talk 
informally to the Directors after the formal proceedings.
The AGM will be held at 11.00am on Wednesday 19 July 2017 at the 
Manchester International Office Centre, Styal Road, Wythenshawe, 
Manchester, M22 5WB. 
The Notice of Meeting will be sent to shareholders prior to the AGM. 
This will set out a detailed explanation of each item of business for 
consideration at the AGM. Shareholders who are unable to attend 
the AGM are encouraged to vote before the meeting by using the 
Proxy Card which will be sent with the Notice of Meeting.
All resolutions were passed at last year’s AGM with votes in  
support all exceeding 91%, the majority receiving votes in support 
exceeding 99%.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Key objectives
In support of the Board’s duty of stewardship, the Committee 
aims to ensure appropriate corporate governance is applied to the 
Group’s systems of internal control, risk management, financial 
reporting, internal audit and other compliance matters such as 
UK anti-bribery legislation. We monitor the integrity of financial 
information published externally for use by shareholders. We also 
ensure that the integrity of the financial statements is supported by 
an effective external audit.
We monitor that effective control structures operate over major 
change initiatives and targeted benefits are delivered. We also 
support the efforts of the executive team to continuously improve 
the financial control and risk monitoring environment. Our approach 
is to ensure that risk management operates to pre-empt potential 
business issues and that embedded proactive financial controls 
prevent or mitigate unnecessary losses that may arise if a business 
risk does crystallise.

Composition
The Committee was chaired by me during the year. Ian Griffiths, 
also an independent Non-Executive Director, was a member of the 
Committee throughout the year. Upon joining the Board in January 
2017, David Landless became the third member of the Committee.
On his appointment, David received an extensive induction tailored 
in particular to his future role as Chairman of the Committee.
As a result of David’s appointment, the composition of the 
Committee changed during the year, but at all times complied 
with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code for 
a smaller company, this being to have two independent Non-
Executive members. 
“We continue to focus on enhancements 
to the control environment within 
our business and to the governance 
principles applied to the major business 
change programmes of the STEP 2020 
Strategic Plan. ”

Biographical details and experience of members are set out on  
pages 60 and 61.
Expertise
The Committee members have been selected to give an appropriate 
range of financial, operational, commercial and risk management 
expertise to allow the Committee to fulfil its duties. The Board 
considers that I have recent and relevant financial experience as 
required by the UK Corporate Governance Code to perform the role 
of Committee Chairman.
Committee meetings
The Committee meets at least four times each year. During the year 
ended 31 March 2017 the Committee met five times. This was one 
fewer meeting than was held in the prior year when an additional 
meeting took place to complete the tender process for global 
audit and tax advisory services. The meetings are attended by the 
independent Non-Executive Directors (the members), the Company 
Secretary and, by invitation, the Chairman, the Chief Executive, the 
Group Finance Director and the Group Head of Risk and Assurance. 
Full details of Director attendance during the year are set out in the 
table of all Committee meetings on page 63.
From time to time, other members of the Group’s management 
team are invited to attend to present or respond to queries on 
particular areas of focus. Our external Auditor, Deloitte, also 
attended the majority of Committee meetings and receives all 
papers submitted to the Committee. Each meeting so attended 
includes an opportunity for the external Auditor to raise any 
matters in confidence which they consider should be brought to 
the attention of the Committee without the Executive Directors 
being present. Similarly, the Group Head of Risk and Assurance 
has a regular opportunity to address the Committee without the 
Executive Directors being present.
Main activities of the Committee during the year
Significant issues considered in relation to the financial statements
The Committee monitors the integrity of the Company’s financial 
information and other formal documents relating to its financial 
performance and makes appropriate recommendations to the 
Board before publication.
A key factor in the integrity of financial statements is ensuring 
that suitable and compliant accounting policies are adopted and 
applied consistently on a year-on-year basis and across the Group. 
In this respect, the Committee also considers significant estimates 
and judgements made by management in preparing the financial 
statements. 
The Committee’s considerations are supported by input from other 
assurance providers, e.g. the Group’s actuarial advisers, the Group 
Internal Audit and Assurance team as well as our external Auditor.
Summarised in the table below are some of the significant issues 
the Committee considered during the year in relation to the 
financial statements. These are separated into items of particular 
focus this year and recurring items that the Committee regularly 
addresses. The table also sets out the KPIs impacted by each of 
these issues in the financial statements, their relevance to the 
financial statements and an assessment of the degree of judgement 
required in concluding on each item.

Defined benefit pension accounting 
(recurring annual item: see Note 18 to the financial statements)
Defined benefit pension scheme accounting is a complex matter. 
The values disclosed can fluctuate materially, particularly in a 
period of significant changes in gilt yields and interest rates. The 
values disclosed are also sensitive to a range of assumptions where 
judgement is required. This is illustrated in the table below.
Assumption sensitivity Change in liability
Impact of 0.25% increase in UK discount rates £7.7m decrease
Impact of 0.25% decrease in UK discount rates £8.7m increase
Impact of 0.25% increase in UK inflation rates £5.0m increase
Impact of 0.25% decrease in UK inflation rates £4.6m decrease
Impact of 1 year higher life expectancy in UK £10.3m increase
As has been the case for a number of years, the Committee reviews 
management estimates which are produced following independent 
actuarial advice and are compared to third party benchmarks 
on the reasonableness of the assumptions used. We ensure the 
Group’s underlying assumptions and methodology used in deriving 
them are consistent year on year or are justified by experience of 
the scheme or by third party metrics. In respect of the relatively 
high mortality assumption, the Committee considered extensive 
scheme specific data which underpins and supports the level of 
mortality assumed by the Group. The Committee was satisfied that 
the assumptions are within an acceptable range and no changes 
were made to management assumptions.
The Committee has also encouraged additional disclosure of 
forward looking financial information in respect of defined benefit 
pension schemes. Largely graphical in nature, this is designed to 
give greater clarity of the risks, issues and opportunities in what is 
a complex area of accounting: see pages 38 and 39 of the Finance 
Director’s Review. 
The Committee considered again but continues to conclude that the 
financing charges and administration costs of the closed defined 
benefit pension schemes should, for the purposes of assessing 
underlying performance as reported in adjusted operating profit 
and adjusted EPS, be excluded from these calculations. The costs 
involved relate to closed legacy pension schemes that have no 
bearing or relevance to understanding the underlying performance 
of the ongoing business: see Note 18 to the financial statements.
Whilst the judgements on assumptions used in arriving at the 
deficit numbers is judged to be low as these use known published 
data/indices, there is more judgement in the nature of the 
disclosure hence the overall judgement required is viewed as 
moderate.
Review of carrying value of intangible assets, deferred tax 
assets and investments in subsidiary undertakings 
(recurring annual item: see Note 7, Note 8 and Note 17 to the 
financial statements)
The Group holds a number of valuable intangible assets such as 
goodwill and deferred tax. In addition, the parent company and 
other subsidiary holding companies hold investments in various 
subsidiaries (which are relevant in their individual statutory 
accounts as opposed to the consolidated financial statements). 
The judgements on the carrying value of these assets are normally 
a key area for Committee scrutiny as carrying values are based on 
discounted estimates of future profitability over a number of years 
and hence are highly sensitive to the assumptions used. 
These are areas where management estimates play a key role in 
supporting the carrying values reported in the balance sheet. The 
Committee reviews the assumptions underlying the discounted 
cash flow calculations and the likelihood of long-term recovery of 
the asset values. The details of the impairment reviews performed 
are in Note 7. Short-term cash flows are confirmed by reference 
to the Board approved budget for the following year and sense 
checked against the longer term Strategic Plan. This is also a key 
area of focus for the external Auditor.
As part of the review of defined benefit pension accounting the 
Committee also reviews the carrying value and recoverability of the 
deferred tax assets, the corollary of the gross pension deficit. The 
Committee was satisfied that the extended duration of the pension 
liabilities in Germany and the UK, and their priority in recognition, 
justified the extended recovery periods for the associated deferred 
tax assets which were also fully supported by expectations of 
future taxable profitability.
Review of inventory valuation and provisioning 
(recurring annual item: see Note 11 to the financial statements)
As a manufacturer, the Group adds value to raw materials as part 
of its normal production processes. In order to provide shorter lead 
times and better customer service the Group also holds a significant 
amount of stock. Inventory therefore represents a material 
component of the Group’s balance sheet. The basis of valuation 
always includes the allocation of amounts for labour and overhead 
costs which require the exercise of management judgement. 
The overall process is governed by understood accounting 
methodologies for the absorption of labour and overheads into 
stock. Whilst these methodologies help to reduce risk, based on the 
scale of inventory holdings and the extensive product range, the 
overall level of judgement required is assessed as moderate.
The Committee reviews in some detail both the valuation bases 
and the application of the Group’s policy on providing for slow 
moving and obsolete stock. The Committee reviews both the rules 
governing the automatic generation of provisions based on the 
age of stock and any management judgemental overrides. The 
Committee is satisfied that the net book value shown in Note 11 
is appropriate and that any management judgements formed in 
arriving at those values are reasonable.

Review of the Viability Statement
(recurring annual item: see page 47)
In accordance with provision C2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Board is required to assess the prospects of the Company 
over a period longer than 12 months from the approval of the 
financial statements.
In addition to the Going Concern report, the Committee has helped 
the Board prepare the viability statement and the period over 
which it will apply. The Committee considered the STEP 2020 
Strategic Plan and sensitivities against the Plan in preparing the 
Viability Statement as well as the appropriateness of the three year 
review period. The Company’s current position and principal risks 
were also reviewed in detail by the Committee prior to advising the 
Board. 
The Company’s full Viability Statement can be found on page 47 of 
the Strategic Report. 
Other matters reviewed by the Committee:
 Æ Corporate risk reporting processes and action plans;
 Æ The annual process for control self-assurance and reporting;
 Æ Reviewing medium term financial planning assumptions; and
 Æ The ongoing programme to improve the efficiency of financial 
control processes in the business.
Reporting of exceptional items
(current year focus item: see Note 2(c) to the financial statements)
The STEP 2020 Strategic Plan envisages and requires a number 
of years of restructuring activity within the Group. Each year the 
Committee focuses on and challenges management’s allocation of 
costs and credits between exceptional items and ordinary items. 
We ensure that the exceptional charges genuinely need to be 
excluded so as to allow users of the accounts to form an accurate 
assessment of the performance of the underlying business. 
We concluded that the net charges were sufficiently material and 
not related to the underlying business so as to require separate 
disclosure.
Internal control, risk and compliance
We regularly evaluate the integrity of financial reporting and 
the robustness of internal controls to ensure compliance with 
applicable legal and internal requirements. We also review the 
Group’s policies and procedures for identifying material business 
risks and action plans aimed at reducing the likelihood of risks 
crystallising and mitigating the impact if they do.
The ERMMC receive regular reports from the Group Head of Risk 
and Assurance, to convey the status of risk profiles and actions 
arising from the risk assessment process. The ERMMC reports the 
results of its discussions to the Committee. 
Further details of our internal control and risk management 
systems, including the financial reporting process, can be found on 
pages 40 and 41 and page 68. Our primary risk factors are shown in 
the Strategic Report on pages 42 to 46. Even though cyber security 
is not considered a key risk, due to the devolved and diffuse nature 
of the systems environment and the IT estate, the Committee 
did review cyber security risk. It reviewed policies and current 
mitigation strategies as well as third party testing of aspects of 
cyber security.   
Confidential reporting procedures and whistle blowing
The stewardship of the Group’s assets and the integrity of the 
financial statements are further supported by confidential reporting 
and whistle blowing procedures. The Committee reviews these 
procedures once a year to ensure that appropriate processes 
are in place to treat complaints confidentially and implement 
proportionate and independent investigation in all cases. The 
Committee is diligent in ensuring a high degree of visibility and 
accessibility of whistle blowing communications methods to all 
staff, including first hand inspection during site visits.
The Committee considers the number and nature of reports 
received in the year to be small in number and scale of risk in 
comparison to businesses of a similar size and geographical 
distribution.
Internal audit
The Committee receives and considers reports on the control 
environment from the Group Head of Risk and Assurance. These 
reports highlight key improvement themes and recommend areas 
for business focus, with additional observations provided around 
root cause analysis and cultural and behavioural themes. In 
addition, the Committee has visibility of management responses 
and action tracking via the Group’s IRMS at each meeting. The audit 
plan, which contains mandatory, risk-based and cyclical reviews, 
was approved by the Committee in March 2016, and was built 
around focus areas such as organisational change, major projects, 
IT security, business resilience and capital spend.
In the new financial year, the plan will include site financial control 
audits, site health and safety audits and project assurance.
External audit
The Committee is responsible for overseeing relations with 
the external Auditor, including the approval of fees, and makes 
recommendations to the Board on their appointment and, 
where appropriate, reappointment based upon reviews of audit 
effectiveness.
Details of total remuneration for the Auditor for the year, including 
audit services, audit related services and other non-audit services, 
can be found in Note 2(b) to the consolidated financial statements.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
Auditor independence and objectivity
The independence of the external Auditor is essential to the 
provision of an objective opinion on the true and fair view 
presented in the financial statements. Auditor independence and 
objectivity is safeguarded by limiting the nature and value of non-
audit services performed by the external Auditor. The Group has a 
policy of not recruiting senior employees of the external Auditor, 
who have worked on the audit in the past two years, to senior 
financial positions within the Group, and the rotation of the lead 
engagement partner at least every five years. The current lead 
engagement partner was appointed during the audit tender process 
in June 2015 and this is therefore the second year end they have 
been in post.
Non-audit services provided by the external Auditor
The Committee is responsible for ensuring that an appropriate 
relationship is maintained between the Group and the external 
Auditor. Non-audit services can only be provided by the external 
Auditor if there is no potential conflict of interest or material risk 
of values being included in the financial statements that have been 
both advised on and audited by the external Auditor. 
To safeguard the independence and objectivity of the Auditor, the 
Committee has approved a policy on non-audit services provided by 
the Auditor in line with professional practice and in accordance with 
ethical standards published by the Audit Practices Board. Control 
of non-audit services is exercised by ensuring that all non-audit 
services where fees exceed an agreed limit are subject to the prior 
approval of the Committee. The policy is available on the website at 
www.renold.com.
During the year ended 31 March 2017, the Committee continued 
with the appointment of other accountancy firms to provide non-
audit services to the Group and anticipates that this will continue 
during the year ending 31 March 2018.
Total non-audit services provided by Deloitte during the year ended 
31 March 2017 were £nil (2016: £nil). Total audit and audit related 
fees include the statutory audit fee and fees paid to Deloitte for 
other services which the external Auditor is required to perform. 
Examples might include reporting to banking partners in territories 
where no statutory accounts are required to be prepared. Non-
audit fees represent all other services provided by Deloitte not 
included in the above. There were no significant non-audit services 
provided by Deloitte in the year.
The Committee also discussed the overall level of fees and 
considered them appropriate given the current size of the Group. 
The Committee is satisfied that the level and scope of non-audit 
services undertaken by the external Auditor does not impair its 
independence or objectivity and considers that the Company 
receives particular benefit from the advice provided by its external 
Auditor, given its wide and detailed knowledge of the Group and its 
international operations. 
Audit focus
To ensure appropriate focus on key risk areas identified by the 
Committee, the proposed external audit plan is challenged before 
the audit commences to ensure that Deloitte have developed 
appropriately targeted audit procedures. These are closely aligned 
with the current year focus items noted above in the section Main 
activities of the Committee during the year. They also reflect the 
relative changes in profitability and materiality of each of the 
Group’s operating units during the year (in some cases as a result of 
the ongoing restructuring activities). 
Assessment of effectiveness of external audit 
The Committee has a formal system for evaluating the performance 
and independence of the external Auditor. This system involves 
active dialogue with the Lead Engagement Partner, a formal 
questionnaire and feedback process involving senior management 
in direct contact with the audit team, and Deloitte’s response to 
accounting, financial control and audit issues as these arise.
The Committee conducts an annual review of the structure and 
approach taken in the external audit, the level of non-audit fees, 
and the effectiveness, independence and objectivity of the external 
Auditor. This includes consideration of:
 Æ The global external audit process.
 Æ The Auditor’s performance.
 Æ The expertise of the firm and our relationship with them.
 Æ The results of the questionnaire process noted above.
The results of the review are discussed with the external Auditor. 
Following this year’s annual review, the Committee was satisfied 
with the effectiveness, independence and objectivity of the 
external Auditor. As noted below, the Committee has made a 
recommendation to the Board to reappoint Deloitte as the Group’s 
external Auditor and a resolution to that effect will be included in 
the ordinary business of the AGM scheduled on Wednesday 19 July 
2017. There are no contractual obligations restricting the choice of 
external Auditor nor has the Company entered into any Auditor 
liability agreements.
Audit information
Having made the requisite enquiries, so far as the Directors in 
office at the date of the approval of this report are aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which the Auditor is unaware and 
each Director has taken all reasonable steps to make themselves 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Auditor is aware of that information.

Fair, balanced and understandable: the role of the 
Disclosure Committee
As part of the process of ensuring that all disclosures made by 
the Company are timely, accurate and importantly meet the ‘fair, 
balanced and understandable’ requirement arising under the FCA’s 
Listing and Disclosure and Transparency Rules, the Group maintains 
a Disclosure Committee whose membership includes the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee (as Chair), the Group Finance Director, the 
Group Chief Accountant and the Company Secretary.
The consideration of the fair, balanced and understandable 
requirement is shown in the graphic on page 68. In summary, the 
Disclosure Committee carried out the following activities:
 Æ All those contributing to the Annual Report and Accounts were 
briefed on the requirements of the Governance Code with 
specific emphasis on the fair, balanced and understandable 
requirement;
 Æ A number of senior managers who were knowledgeable about 
the business but otherwise not significantly involved in the 
preparation of the Annual Report and Accounts, each performed 
an independent review of the draft Annual Report. The 
feedback and comments received as a result were reviewed and 
amendments made accordingly; and
 Æ As in previous years, a documented verification file of all 
substantive facts and assertions is maintained and reviewed 
for completeness prior to finalisation of the Annual Report and 
Accounts.
The Disclosure Committee presents its findings and 
recommendations to the Audit Committee as part of its review 
of processes to enable the fair, balanced and understandable 
statement to be made.
Committee evaluation
The Committee’s effectiveness is assessed annually and on the 
basis of a programme of continuous improvement. Lessons from 
the assessment are used to try to improve the process, but the 
Committee has concluded that it acts within its terms of reference 
and carried out its responsibilities effectively.
We welcome feedback from shareholders on this report and I will 
be available at the AGM to answer questions.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
I am pleased to present the Nomination Committee Report for the 
year ended 31 March 2017 and to provide shareholders with an 
overview of the work carried out during the year under review. 
This year has seen the first changes to our Board since 2012 and 
the Committee has led the recruitment processes for a new Group 
Finance Director and new Non-Executive Director in accordance 
with provision B2.1 of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance 
Code (2014 Code). Comprehensive recruitment processes were 
undertaken for both posts and are described below.
The Committee and the Board believe that the appointments of Ian 
Scapens and David Landless will be key to support the achievement 
of the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan. 
Succession planning and recruitment of new Directors
David Landless’ appointment to the Board forms a part of Renold’s 
orderly succession planning process for Board members which I 
outlined in the Committee’s report last year. David will become 
Chairman of the Audit Committee on completion of the 2017  
AGM succeeding John Allkins who will step down after nine years  
in the role.
An independent recruitment consultancy, Odgers Berndston 
(Odgers), was retained to assist in the recruitment of the new 
Non-Executive Director. At the commencement of the recruitment 
process a role description was defined and agreed by the 
Committee detailing the skills and experience required for the 
position. The requirements for the role were finalised following my 
meetings with Odgers, who also considered the criteria proposed 
by the Chief Executive. A list of candidates was identified and 
interviewed. This ultimately led to the appointment of David 
Landless.
Following the resignation of Brian Tenner, Odgers was also retained 
to assist in the recruitment of his replacement. Again, at the 
commencement of this recruitment, the Committee agreed the 
requirements for the role with Odgers. A longlist of candidates 
was refined to a shortlist and interviews were held with the 
Chief Executive and Group HR Director in the initial stages and 
subsequently myself as Chairman of the Nomination Committee 
and the Audit Committee Chairman. The Committee considered 
Ian Scapens to be the most suitable candidate for the role and 
accordingly made a recommendation of appointment to the Board.
Extension of John Allkins’ appointment
John Allkins was first appointed to the Board and as Chairman of 
the Audit Committee in 2008. He completed a nine year term in 
April 2017 and, after rigorous review, the Committee proposed 
that his appointment as Non-Executive Director be extended for a 
further year from the 2017 AGM. John Allkins will at the same time 
step down from the roles of Chairman of the Audit Committee and 
Senior Independent Director. 
Having given careful consideration to the matter, the Committee 
and the Board concluded that John Allkins continues to 
demonstrate the qualities of independence in character and 
judgement notwithstanding the fact that the extension to his 
appointment means he will serve a term of more than nine 
years. Whilst service on the Board for more than nine years is a 
circumstance listed in provision B1.1 of the 2014 Code, none of 
the other relationships or circumstances listed in B1.1 exists. John 
Allkins has made a significant and valued contribution to the Board 
during his tenure and his continued appointment is considered to 
be in the best interests of the Company.
Appointment of Senior Independent Director
As a result of the above changes, the Committee also considered 
the appointment of a new Senior Independent Director. The 
Committee recommended to the Board the appointment of Ian 
Griffiths to this role which will commence from the completion of 
the 2017 AGM.
Ian Griffiths has been an independent director since his 
appointment in 2010 and has chaired the Remuneration Committee 
since that date.
John Allkins and Ian Griffiths did not participate in the discussions 
or voting in the Committee which related to their own positions.
Other succession planning
I reported last year that the Board is mindful of its obligations 
under the 2014 Code in relation to succession planning and a 
detailed review of succession planning for the Board and senior 
management took place. The discussion, as it relates to senior 
management, concluded that good progress had been made on 
succession planning as a result of the continued strengthening of 
the management team led by the Chief Executive but that further 
progress was required. This will continue to be an area of focus for 
the Committee.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN
“The Nomination Committee’s 
primary focus during the year 
has been to lead the process 
for the appointment of two 
new directors. ”

Board composition 
The Committee considers that the current capability and financial 
burden imposed by the Board has been appropriate in the current 
reporting period. This view reflects the need to deliver excellent 
corporate governance while balancing the need for cost control as 
we continue to progress the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan. 
Diversity
The Board is aware of the need to consider the benefits of diversity 
on the Board in all its aspects and the Board and Committee 
undertook both recruitments this year mindful of the issue of 
diversity, including gender, the formal Board diversity policy having 
been adopted and set out in the 2015 Annual Report. The overriding 
objective has and will always be to appoint the best possible 
candidate for the role. This year, the new appointments have not 
changed the Board’s diversity profile. 
The Board continues to believe that it is not appropriate to set 
measurable objectives for the implementation of the Diversity 
policy at this time. 
Effectiveness review
During the year, the Committee has also carried out its annual 
evaluation. Again, this has proved a useful exercise in reviewing 
the Committee’s work and concluding that it continues to work 
effectively.

Role of the Nomination Committee
The Committee has delegated authority from the Board. In 
accordance with the 2014 Code, the Committee is responsible 
for the following:
 Æ Reviewing the structure, size and composition of the 
Board. This includes assessing skills, knowledge, experience 
and diversity of Board members and any resulting 
recommendations for change;
 Æ Where new appointments of Executive and/or Non-
Executive Directors are to be made, to lead that process 
and identify and nominate candidates to the Board; and
 Æ Giving full consideration to succession planning for 
Directors and other senior executives, taking account of the 
challenges and opportunities facing the Company.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
Company website at www.renold.com.
Composition of the Nomination Committee
 Æ The Committee is chaired by Mark Harper, Chairman of the 
Board.
 Æ The three Non-Executive Directors are members of the 
Committee and have been so throughout the year or since 
their appointment.
 Æ The Committee meets during the year as required.
Nomination Committee members and meetings attended

Ian Griffiths Non-Executive Director 4 of 4
David Landless* Non-Executive Director 1 of 4
*  David Landless joined the Board in January 2017. There has been one Committee 
meeting since his appointment.
Appointments to the Board
In accordance with the provisions of the 2014 Code, when 
reviewing the Board’s structure, the Committee’s primary 
objective is to ensure that the Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors have the relevant skills, knowledge and experience 
to create a balanced and effective Board and to support the 
Group in delivering its overall Strategic Objectives. This is in 
parallel with ensuring that the costs and composition of the 
Board reflect the size of business and also the current stage of 
development of the business. Our policy extends to ensuring 
that the various sub-committees of the Board also have an 
appropriate range of skills and experience to deliver their 
terms of reference. 
In addition to skills and experience, we will also consider 
factors such as how an individual’s personal attributes would 
complement and enhance the diversity on the Board. For the 
appointment of Non-Executive Directors, additional factors for 
consideration include independence and time commitment.
In selecting candidates for the shortlist for any appointment, 
the Board always considers candidates from a wide range of 
backgrounds and on merit and against objective criteria. 
Other than in relation to gender and ethnicity, the current 
Board is diverse in terms of the different skill sets of each 
member. These include professional qualifications and 
career work experience but also wider experience relevant 
to our global business; most of the Board members having 
worked and lived overseas for significant periods. For further 
information, see the chart on page 62. 
A formal and rigorous process is followed during the 
recruitment process for a new Director. The process for 
making appointments commences with the evaluation process 
described in the recent Board recruitments. The Board 
supports the engagement of executive search firms who have 
signed up to the Voluntary Code of Conduct on gender diversity 
and best practice. Odgers is a signatory to the Voluntary Code 
of Conduct. Odgers does not have any other connection to the 
Company.

DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT 
Annual Statement
As Chairman of the Remuneration Committee I present the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report
1
 for the year ended 31 March 2017. 
I summarise the main outcomes in the year for the remuneration 
of the Executive Directors and also the continued application of the 
remuneration policy.
Key remuneration outcomes for the year
All fixed elements of pay were unchanged for the Executive 
Directors for a further year, with base salaries having not increased 
since 2013 and 2010 in relation to the Chief Executive and Group 
Finance Director respectively. This continues to further the strategic 
aim of lowering the Group’s breakeven point and also reflects the 
ongoing Group wide pay restraint.
The key outcomes under the elements of variable pay for the year are:
 Æ Annual bonus: The Company has again faced challenging market 
conditions during the year which resulted in a performance 
below the levels required to trigger bonus payments. As a 
result, no annual bonus payments were earned by the Executive 
Directors for the year ended 31 March 2017. 
The Committee determined this outcome having formally 
assessed performance against EBITDA and Net Debt targets set 
at the beginning of the year as follows. The adjusted EBITDA
2
 
for the year ended 31 March 2017 of £20.3m was below the 
threshold of £24.24m required for any payment of bonus. 
Average Net Debt
2
 during the year was £30.4m, which was also 
above the threshold of £29.81m. 
 Æ Performance Share Plan (PSP): The first awards granted under 
the PSP, which was approved by shareholders at the 2013 AGM, 
vested in full in July 2016. The awards granted in 2013 required 
50% growth per year in adjusted EPS
3
 for maximum vesting. 
Growth of 50% per annum in adjusted EPS was achieved in 
the three year period ended 31 March 2016 and therefore the 
awards vested in full.
 Æ The performance period for the second tranche of PSP awards 
made in June 2014 ended on 31 March 2017. The performance 
conditions required growth of 20% per year in adjusted EPS for 
threshold vesting. Growth of 12.9% per annum in adjusted EPS 
was achieved in the three year period ended 31 March 2017 and 
therefore the awards will not vest.
Remuneration policy
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy was amended last year and 
approved by over 90% of voting shareholders at the 2016 AGM. The 
remuneration policy will continue to apply until its expiry in July 
2019 unless otherwise amended. As I stated in last year’s Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, it is the Committee’s intention to undertake a 
full review of the remuneration policy prior to its expiry. 
The Committee continues to believe that the remuneration policy 
ensures remuneration arrangements are aligned with the interests 
of our shareholders and current best practice whilst supporting the 
delivery of the Company’s STEP 2020 Strategic Plan.
Market conditions remain challenging; however, the Committee 
firmly believes that the focus on LTIP opportunity appropriately 
incentivises the Executive Directors and aligns with the delivery 
of the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan. In addition, the shareholding 
requirement (which was increased last year for the Chief Executive 
from 100% of salary to 200% of salary to reflect the increased LTIP 
award) continues to align management’s interests with those of 
shareholders.
The Committee believes that the total remuneration package is 
market competitive with companies of a similar size, while avoiding 
worsening the Company’s cash position through higher salaries 
and/or bonuses. The LTIP opportunity will only become payable if 
the minimum threshold EPS improvement target is delivered. This 
is consistent with the Group’s objective of delivering improving 
operating margins.
The Committee continues to focus on clear reporting of past 
remuneration and future policy. We are also aware that the 
landscape for executive pay is changing and we will respond 
appropriately to changes and best practice as they develop.
I will be available at the AGM to answer any questions about the 
Committee and its work. I would be pleased to welcome feedback 
from shareholders.

DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
The Committee and its Activities
Adviser to the Committee 
During the year, the Committee received independent advice 
from PwC in relation to remuneration reporting, operation of the 
Company’s share plans, advice on long-term incentive performance 
measurement and information on market trends in executive 
remuneration. Total fees for services provided over the year 
amounted to £21,250. 
PwC was appointed by the Committee in 2014 following an 
assessment and interview process and has advised on various 
issues including remuneration policy, the regulations governing 
reporting on remuneration and updating the Committee on trends 
in compensation matters. Fees charged have been on a time-spent 
basis. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group 
and adheres to that group’s Code of Conduct. PwC has provided 
internal audit, tax and pensions related services to the Company. 
The Committee has chosen to retain PwC as its adviser. 
The Committee is satisfied that the advice given on executive 
remuneration is objective and independent and that no conflict of 
interest arises as a result of these services. 
In addition to external advice received from PwC, the Committee 
consulted and received reports from the Group Finance Director 
and the Group HR Director. At all times, the Committee recognises 
the need to identify and manage conflicts of interest when 
receiving reports from, or consulting with, the Executive Directors 
or members of senior management.
Committee activities
The Committee’s terms of reference require meetings to be held at least twice a year. This year, the Committee met on seven occasions to 
discuss the following themes and agenda items in accordance with its terms of reference:

DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT 
Directors' Remuneration Policy
Introduction
This section of the Directors’ Remuneration Report (from pages 82 
to 88) sets out the Company’s policy for the remuneration of its 
Directors. The application of the policy is set out in the next section 
on pages 89 to 94. 
Following a review of remuneration carried out during the year 
ended 31 March 2016, the Directors’ Remuneration Policy was 
approved by shareholders at the AGM on 20 July 2016 and took 
effect from that date. The Directors’ Remuneration Policy will 
therefore apply for three years beginning on that date. 
Remuneration principles for Executive Directors
Our Directors’ Remuneration Policy has been designed to deliver 
two key aims, which remain unchanged since the policy was first 
approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM:
To attract, motivate and retain executives who will deliver high 
performance for all our stakeholders.
We believe the mix of our remuneration package provides an 
appropriate and balanced set of rewards. Executive reward at 
Renold is relatively modest compared to our peer group and this 
has been validated by independent third parties. 
This is consistent with the key Strategic Objective of lowering 
our breakeven point – this applies to executive pay as much as 
it does to any business expenditure. However, we are careful to 
ensure appropriate incentive opportunities remain for sustainable 
improvements in business performance.
To ensure a close alignment of executive pay to the Company’s 
Strategic Objectives and performance.
We review our incentive plans each year to ensure they remain 
closely aligned with the Company’s Strategic Objectives and 
shareholders’ interests, while continuing to motivate and engage 
the Executive team to achieve stretching targets. 
In addition, we aim to make the remuneration framework for 
Executive Directors relatively simple – the incentive plans are 
therefore limited to an annual bonus and the PSP.
Policy table
Based on our view of current market practice, and the principles 
of our remuneration policy, we have established the remuneration 
policy set out in this report. The following table summarises the 
fixed and variable elements of remuneration for the Executive 
Directors.
Purpose and link to corporate strategy Operation of the element
Maximum potential value  
and payment at threshold/review basis Performance metrics
Base salary
Competitive salaries to attract, 
retain and motivate those 
responsible for executing 
strategy while ensuring the 
Company pays no more than is 
necessary.
Paid in 12 equal monthly 
instalments during the year. 
The policy is to provide 
fourth quartile base salary 
for comparable jobs in 
manufacturing companies of a 
similar size, influenced by:
 Æ Role, experience and 
performance;
 Æ Changes in broader 
workforce salary; and
 Æ Salaries payable in similar 
companies.
Reviewed annually and 
typically set on 1 August  
each year.
Annual rate for each Executive 
Director is set out in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
Salaries have been frozen for 
a number of years and this will 
continue compared to modest 
inflation linked increases for 
the wider employee population. 
Higher increases may be 
awarded following recruitment 
into a role at a below-market 
rate until the individual is 
aligned with market levels 
or due to a change in role or 
responsibilities.
None.

Maximum potential value  
and payment at threshold/review basis Performance metrics
Benefits
As base salary above. Benefits 
are non-pensionable.
Paid monthly or as required for 
one-off events, consisting of: 
 Æ Fully expensed company car 
(or cash equivalent).
 Æ Private medical insurance.
 Æ Lump sum death-in-service 
benefit of five times base 
salary. 
The same level of death-in-
service benefit is available to 
most UK staff and at two times 
for those opting out of the 
Company pension scheme.
Reasonable relocation 
expenses will be provided in 
line with market practice.
The Committee may change 
the benefits offered in line 
with local market practice or 
business needs.
Car benefit is reviewed annually 
and set on 1 August each year 
to a maximum of £11,000 
per annum cash allowance or 
equivalent lease value.
The maximum opportunity 
for other benefits is defined 
by the nature of the benefit 
itself and the cost of providing 
it. As the cost of providing 
such insurance benefits varies 
according to premium rates 
and the cost of other benefits is 
dependent on market rates and 
other factors, there is no formal 
maximum monetary value. 
None.
Pension
As base salary above. The Executive Directors are 
not members of the Company 
pension scheme and have their 
own pension arrangements. 
The Company makes pension 
provision in the form of annual 
contributions to personal 
pension arrangements or cash 
supplements in lieu of pension.
Cash allowances equivalent to 
15% of base salary.
None.
Annual bonus
To incentivise delivery of 
the corporate strategy and 
reward delivery of superior 
performance.
Bonuses are not pensionable.
Annual bonuses are paid shortly 
after the end of the financial year 
end to which they relate.
Bonuses are normally payable 
in cash but the Committee 
has flexibility to introduce a 
share based deferral if deemed 
appropriate.
Maximum bonus payments are 
made only on the achievement 
of outstanding performance. 
Performance targets are set at 
the start of the financial year 
and the level of bonus paid is 
determined by the Committee 
after the year end based on 
performance against target.
Part or all of the cash bonus 
may be forfeited or clawed 
back should exceptional 
circumstances occur. Such 
circumstances would include: 
fraud, misconduct, significant 
misstatement of financial 
results or incorrect calculation of 
performance conditions.
Maximum annual bonus 
payable is 100% of base salary.
No bonuses will be payable 
unless a minimum level of 
financial performance has been 
achieved. 
Threshold performance results 
in nil bonus being awarded and 
on-target performance results 
in up to 50% of the maximum 
bonus being awarded.
The bonus may be based on 
a range of financial, non-
financial and personal targets 
as set by the Committee from 
year to year. Financial targets 
will comprise at least half of 
the bonus.
Details of the targets will be 
set out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration following the 
end of each financial year.
The Committee has the right 
to exercise its discretion fairly 
and reasonably in assessing 
the bonus outcome, including 
making adjustments for 
exceptional events occurring 
during the year.
The Committee has the 
discretion to vary the 
performance metrics over the 
life of this policy.

Purpose and link to corporate strategy Operation of the element
Maximum potential value  
and payment at threshold/review basis Performance metrics
PSP
To incentivise delivery of long-
term shareholder value.
Key features of the PSP are:
 Æ Conditional share awards or 
nil-cost options.
 Æ Outstanding commitments 
to issue new shares under 
all share plans are subject 
to a maximum of 10% of 
the Company’s issued share 
capital in any ten year 
period.
 Æ The PSP includes the ability 
to grant options under an 
HM Revenue & Customs 
approved schedule.
 Æ Part or the whole of the PSP 
award can be recovered 
prior to vesting should 
exceptional circumstances 
occur. Such circumstances 
would include: fraud, 
misconduct, significant 
misstatement of financial 
results or incorrect 
calculation of performance 
conditions.
A maximum annual grant is 
permitted of 200% of base 
salary each year. 
Vesting is dependent on 
performance conditions. On 
achievement of threshold 
performance 25% of the award 
vests.
For the Chief Executive, there 
is an absolute TSR condition 
that will account for 50% of 
the total award. The adjusted 
EPS minimum targets will be 
a threshold trigger for the TSR 
condition to be measured. 
The performance condition for 
the Group Finance Director is 
based on growth in adjusted 
EPS which must be met over a 
three year period. 
In exceptional circumstances, 
the Committee has discretion 
to change the performance 
measures, targets and 
weightings between measures 
during the performance period 
if there is a significant event 
which causes the Committee 
to believe that the original 
conditions are no longer 
appropriate. Any amendments 
would be such that the new 
conditions are not materially 
less difficult to satisfy than the 
original conditions.
The Committee also has 
discretion to reduce the 
percentage that vests in cases 
where it believes the outcome 
of the performance conditions 
is not a fair reflection of the 
Company’s performance.
Shareholding requirement
To strengthen the alignment 
between the interests of 
Executive Directors and those 
of shareholders.
Executive Directors have five 
years to build the minimum 
holding.
Unvested PSP or deferred 
shares are not taken into 
account. Share price is 
measured at the end of each 
financial year.
All PSP or deferred share 
awards vesting (net of income 
tax and National Insurance 
contributions) must be 
retained until the shareholding 
requirement is met.
Chief Executive – 200% of 
base salary. Other Executive 
Directors – 100% of base 
salary.
None.

Notes to the Policy table
Performance measures and targets for the annual bonus plan and the PSP
The performance targets are determined annually by the Committee. The following table sets out the performance measures for the 
annual bonus and PSP, together with relevant definitions and how each measure supports strategy.
Performance measure Definition How measure supports strategy 
Annual bonus
Adjusted EBITDA Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, 
amortisation, closed defined benefit 
pension scheme charges and costs and 
excludes exceptional items.
 Æ Central to overall strategy.
 Æ Aligned to Strategic Objective of 
delivering improving operating margins.
 Æ Driver of shareholder value.
 Æ Adjustments ensure areas outside 
management control are excluded.
Average net debt The net sum of external borrowings, 
finance leases and cash and cash 
equivalents, measured each month end to 
produce a simple annual average (excludes 
preference stock from targets and results)
 Æ Ensures continuous focus on cash 
and working capital management 
throughout year.
PSP
Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) in 
adjusted EPS
EPS excluding exceptional items, pension 
administration costs, IAS 19 financing 
charges and the tax thereon.
 Æ Align executives with goals for long-
term growth.
 Æ EPS is a driver of shareholder value.
Total shareholder returns Based on absolute share price targets. Æ TSR is a measure of increases in 
shareholder value.
 Æ Transparent and accessible measure for 
assessing corporate performance.
 Æ Award in shares ensures further 
alignment with shareholders
The Committee considers that the annual bonus performance targets are commercially and price sensitive in respect of the Group and that 
it would be detrimental to the interests of the Group to disclose them in advance. Performance targets will be disclosed retrospectively.

DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT 
Directors' Remuneration Policy 
Shareholder views
The Committee constantly welcomes the views of shareholders 
in respect of pay policy as well as those views expressed on 
behalf of shareholders by their respective proxy advisers. The 
Committee documents all remuneration related comments made 
at the Company’s AGM and feedback received during consultation 
with shareholders throughout the year. Any feedback received 
is fully considered by the Committee and amendments made to 
remuneration policy where thought necessary.
Discretion of the Committee
The Committee has discretion in various areas of policy as set out 
in this report. The Committee may also exercise operational and 
administrative discretions under relevant plan rules approved by 
shareholders as set out in those rules. In addition, the Committee 
has the discretion to amend the implementation of policy with 
regard to minor or administrative matters where it would be, in 
the opinion of the Committee, disproportionate to seek or await 
shareholder approval.
Differences in remuneration policy for all employees
All employees of the Group are entitled to base salary and benefits. 
The Group operates a number of pension plans for employees 
which it operates in line with local market practice. Some 
employees in senior roles are entitled to participate in an annual 
bonus scheme. The maximum opportunity available is based on the 
seniority and responsibility of the role.
Conditional share awards or nil-cost options are only available to 
senior executives and Executive Directors. 
Statement of consideration of employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Group
The Committee invites the Group HR Director to present at a 
meeting on the proposals for salary increases for the employee 
population generally and on any other changes to remuneration 
policy within the Group. The Committee has frozen any salary 
increases for Executive Directors which is therefore lower than the 
increases available to employees.
The Group HR Director consults with the Committee on the 
performance metrics for Executive Directors’ bonuses and to the 
extent to which these should be cascaded to other employees. The 
Committee approves the overall annual bonus cost to the Group 
each year. The Committee has oversight over the grant of all PSP 
awards across the Group.
The Group does not specifically invite employees to comment on 
the Directors’ Remuneration Policy but any comments made by 
employees are taken into account.
The Committee is provided with data on the remuneration structure 
for senior management in the three tiers below Executive Director 
and uses this information to work with the human resources team 
to ensure consistency of approach throughout the Group.
Total remuneration opportunity
The chart below demonstrates the total amount of remuneration 
payable to the Chief Executive, Robert Purcell and Group Finance 
Director, Ian Scapens, under the proposed remuneration policy 
for the year ending 31 March 2018 should they achieve minimum, 
on-target or maximum performance. The amounts shown represent 
£’000s and for share related elements are the face value of awards.
The chart shows that at minimum levels of performance the 
Executive Directors’ only form of remuneration is the fixed element 
of base pay, benefits in kind and pension contributions. 
The Executive Directors’ base salaries are assessed independently 
of the ability to earn variable awards under the annual and long-
term incentive plans and hence future bonus opportunities are not 
a consideration when setting base pay.

Service contracts, remuneration and exit payments
As a matter of policy, the length of service contracts and notice periods is determined by the Committee at the time of appointment in  
light of prevailing market practice. Details of the Executive Directors’ terms of appointment and notice periods are as follows:
Date of contract Expiry date of current term/notice period
Robert Purcell 21 January 2013 No specified term/terminable on  
12 months’ notice
Ian Scapens 3 September 2017 No specified term/terminable on  
12 months’ notice
Other than normal payments due during notice periods, there are no express provisions for compensation on early termination of the 
Executive Directors’ contracts. In the event of early termination, the Company’s policy is to act fairly in all circumstances. The Committee 
has noted the Association of British Insurers’ and National Association of Pension Funds’ joint statement on Executive Contracts and 
Severance. None of the Executive Directors’ contracts provide for compensation in the event of a change of control of the Company. Copies 
of the service contracts are available for inspection by shareholders at the Company’s registered office.
Change of control
In the event of a change of control, any outstanding awards under the PSP may vest. Awards will become exercisable immediately. The 
proportion of award vesting will be determined by the Committee based on the proportion of the performance period completed and the 
extent to which the performance condition has been met at the date the change of control occurs. 
The Committee has discretion to waive any performance condition if it considers this appropriate in the particular circumstances.
Leavers
The Committee’s policy for exit payments on a leaver event involving an Executive Director is:
Item Policy Details
Salary, pension  
and benefits
A maximum of 12 months’ salary, pension and benefits 
may be payable.
Payments may be subject to mitigation if the leaver finds 
alternative employment.
Annual bonus No annual bonus normally payable, unless the Committee 
uses its discretion to treat as a good leaver.
Good leavers are entitled to receive a bonus based on 
performance to date of termination, pro-rated for the period of 
service to termination.
PSP The Committee will use its discretion to determine 
whether the individual should be treated as a good leaver 
or a bad leaver.
 
In the event of death, retirement, ill-health or disability, an 
individual will be treated as a good leaver.
 
 
Bad leavers will forfeit outstanding PSP awards.
Good leavers’ awards shall ordinarily vest at the normal vesting 
date, pro-rata based on the proportion of the vesting period 
completed and based on the extent to which the performance 
condition has been met. 
In the event of death, awards vest immediately subject to time 
pro-rating and assessment of performance. The Committee has 
discretion to accelerate vesting to date of cessation for other 
good leavers.
Awards may be exercised within a six month period following 
date of leaving or vesting if later. In the case of death, the award 
may be exercised within a 12 month period following death.
In determining whether an individual should be treated as a good leaver or a bad leaver, and in assessing the extent to which any award 
will vest, the Committee will consider the specific circumstances of the departure, the individual’s performance prior to departure and the 
performance of the Company.

DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT 
Directors' Remuneration Policy 
Approach to recruitment remuneration
In the event of the appointment of a new Director the same principles would apply as they do today to the existing Directors.
The remuneration package of any new Executive Director would therefore include the elements and maximum award size set out on pages 
82 to 85 in accordance with the Company’s remuneration policy and be subject to the same discretions.
The Committee’s approach to recruitment remuneration is to set the base salary level in accordance with the remuneration policy and 
having taken into account the individual’s experience, the nature of the role and their existing remuneration package.
Where it is necessary to ‘buy out’ an individual’s awards from a previous employer, the Committee will seek to match the value, timing of 
vesting and type of these awards with replacement awards. Any buy out awards would be an additional element of remuneration to the 
normal maxima as set out in the Policy table on pages 82 to 85.
Details of the Company’s approach to the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors are set out below.
External Non-Executive Directorships
The Board encourages Executive Directors to broaden their experience outside the Company by taking up a non-executive directorship.
Non-Executive Directors
Appointment details and fees of the Non-Executive Directors are set out below:

The Company’s policy for Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration is managed by the Board. Their remuneration is confined to fees alone, 
with no performance-related element. Reasonable expenses are also reimbursed as incurred.
Fees for the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors. The level of fees is reviewed from 
time to time with regard to fees paid in comparable organisations and the time commitment required. The Chairman’s remuneration is 
determined by the Committee and the Board and is subject to the same basis of review as the other Non-Executive Directors.
The last substantive review of Non-Executive Directors’ fees took place in 2011. Given the period since the last review, a full review of the 
fees for Non-Executive Directors will be undertaken by the Board during the financial year ending 31 March 2018; the results of that review 
will be reported in the 2018 Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The letters of appointment for each of the Non-Executive Directors confirm that their appointment is for a specified term and that 
reappointment is not automatic. When making a decision on reappointment, the Board reviews the Non-Executive Director’s attendance 
and performance at meetings and the composition and skill of the Board as a whole. Each Non-Executive Director is appointed for an initial 
period of three years, subject to earlier termination by either party. Thereafter, the appointment may be renewed, provided that both the 
Non-Executive Director and the Board agree. Their respective appointments continue on an annual basis, subject to re-election at each 
AGM. The letters of appointment contain no provision for payment or compensation on early termination. Copies of the individual letters of 
appointment are available for inspection by shareholders at the Company’s registered office.

Introduction
This section of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration paid to Directors for the financial year ending 31 March 2017. 
This section, together with the description of the composition of the Committee, which is set out on page 79 of the report, constitutes the 
Annual Report on Remuneration. The Annual Report on Remuneration will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the AGM on  
19 July 2017.

(1) Fixed elements of pay 
(i) Base salary
Consistent with the key strategic goal of lowering the Group’s breakeven point and the pay restraint that continued across the Group, there 
were no pay rises for Executive Directors during the period. The Chief Executive’s annual salary therefore remained at £300,000 and the 
Group Finance Director’s annual salary at £185,000. These figures are outlined in the Total remuneration table above. 
The proportion of the Group’s basic salary bill attributable to the Executive Directors’ base salaries for the year ended 31 March 2017 was 
0.80% (2016: 0.95%).
(ii) Pension
The Executive Directors’ only pension entitlements are Company contributions equivalent to 15% of base salary. During the year ended 31 
March 2017, a cash payment of £45,000 (2016: £45,000) was made by the Company to Robert Purcell. Cash payments of £17,682 (2016: 
£27,750) and £6,866 were made to Brian Tenner, the outgoing Group Finance Director, and his successor, Ian Scapens, respectively. These 
figures are shown in the Total remuneration table above.

Further details in relation to the annual bonus arrangements in place for the Executive Directors in the year ended 31 March 2017 are on page 90 within the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
2 
Further details of awards to the Executive Directors under the 2004 Option Plans and PSP are on pages 90 and 91. The LTIP uses the closing share price on the day of 
vesting less the option exercise price to calculate the value of the award.
3 
(a) Of the 1,145,038 options awarded to Robert Purcell on 21 January 2013 under the 2004 Options Plan with an exercise price of 26.20p, 100% (the maximum award) 
vested on 21 January 2016 as the mid-market price of the Company’s shares on the five preceding trading days was 49.70p. The closing mid-market price on  
20 January 2016, which was the last trading day prior to vesting on 21 January 2016, was 46.75p, the total value therefore being £235,000. 
3 
(b) Of the 1,065,089 options awarded to Robert Purcell on 25 July 2013 under the PSP, 100% (the maximum award) vested on 25 July 2016, the performance 
conditions measured to 31 March 2016 having been achieved in full. The figure has been restated in the table above to be the actual value of the awards on vesting of 
£419,326. This is based on the closing mid-market share price of 39.37p on 22 July 2016 which was the last trading day prior to vesting.
4 
The figure has been restated to include the actual value of the vested LTIPs in 2016: further details are in footnote 3 above.
5 
Of the 656,805 options awarded to Brian Tenner on 25 July 2013 under the PSP, 100% (the maximum award) vested on 25 July 2016, the performance conditions 
measured to 31 March 2016 having been achieved in full. The figure has been restated in the table above to be the actual value of the awards on vesting of £258,584. 
This is based on the closing mid-market share price of 39.37p on 22 July 2016 which was the last trading day prior to vesting.

The figure has been restated to include the actual value of the vested LTIPs in 2016: further details are in footnote 4 above.

Non-Executive Directors do not receive any benefits.
(2) Variable elements of pay – awards vested in year
(i) Annual bonus (payable in cash) 
The annual bonus, which is payable in cash, provides the Executive Directors with the opportunity to receive an annual bonus of up to 
100% of base salary on achievement of adjusted EBITDA and average net debt targets. For the year ended 31 March 2017 the annual bonus 
targets for Executive Directors were based upon the matrix below.
Average Net Debt (£m)
Adjusted EBITDA (£m) 29.8 29.3 28.8 28.5 28.3
22.7 – 10.0% 20.0% 30.0% 40.0%

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, closed defined benefit pension scheme charges and 
exceptional items. Average net debt is the net sum of external borrowings, finance leases and cash and cash equivalents, measured at each 
month end to produce a simple annual average. The impact of acquisitions are excluded.
The two metrics shown were structured as a matrix such that failure to deliver a minimum result in either metric led to no bonus being 
achievable in the other. Similarly, in order to achieve the maximum award, superior performance would be required against both metrics. 
For the year ended 31 March 2017, the Adjusted EBITDA for the year was £20.3m and the Average Net Debt was £30.4m (measured at 
budget exchange rates in accordance with the annual bonus rules). As both metrics were below the threshold targets, no bonus was 
payable.
(ii) PSP awards performance testing 
The performance period for PSP awards granted on 5 June 2014 completed on 31 March 2017. The performance conditions applying to 
these awards are as follows:
Threshold Maximum
Award date EPS CAGR % Vesting EPS CAGR % Vesting Performance period
5 June 2014 20% 25% 30% 100% 3 years to 31 March 2017
The annual growth in EPS between 2014 and 2017 was 12.9%. As this is below the threshold growth of 20% p.a., none of the awards will 
vest.
(3) Variable elements of pay – awards made in year
Awards made to Executive Directors during the year under the PSP and associated performance conditions are set out below. Awards 
equal to 200% and 100% of salary were made respectively to the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director. No award was made to Brian 
Tenner in the year ended 31 March 2017.

Ian Scapens Nil price Option £185,000 368,465 16 January 2017
The year ended 31 March 2017 was the fourth year in which awards were made under the PSP. The performance conditions attaching to 
options granted under the PSP during the year are:
 Æ For the Group Finance Director, 100% of the award is based on the compound annual growth rate in adjusted EPS over a three year 
period (EPS CAGR).
 Æ For the Chief Executive, 50% of the award is based on this EPS condition and 50% is based on TSR.

The number of shares is based on the average mid-market share price for the three business days preceding the date of grant (36.50 pence and 50.21 pence 
respectively).

performance.
(4) Payments to past Directors
No payments were made to past Directors during the year in respect of services provided to the Company as a Director. 
(5) Payments made for loss of office
Brian Tenner resigned and left the Company on 18 November 2016. By mutual agreement, the requirement for Brian Tenner to serve 
a 12 month notice period was waived and he was paid six months’ basic salary, car allowance and pension allowance (a cash payment 
of £111,375 in total : £92,500, £5,000 and £13,875 respectively) in lieu of notice upon leaving the Company. He did not receive a bonus 
payment for the financial year ending 31 March 2017. Brian Tenner held 807,422 share options under the Company Share Option Plan 
2004 (CSOP) which had already vested in full in June 2014. The Committee agreed that, in accordance with the CSOP Plan rules, Brian 
Tenner would have six months from the end of his employment with the Company to exercise these options. Brian Tenner also held three 
PSP share awards. The Committee used its discretion and agreed that, in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, Brian 
would be treated as a good leaver. The first PSP award made on 24 July 2013 of 656,805 nil cost options had already vested in full in 
March 2016 and the Committee agreed that, in accordance with the PSP Plan rules and the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, Brian Tenner 
would have six months from cessation of employment to exercise these options. In exercising its discretion, the Committee agreed that 
the second subsisting PSP award of 283,887 nil-cost options made on 4 June 2014 would be pro-rated from the date of the grant to the 
date of cessation (232,601 nil cost options); vesting will remain subject to the original performance conditions measured over the original 
performance period. The Committee agreed that, due to the short length of time elapsed from the date of award to the date of cessation of 
employment, and, the extent to which the performance condition has been met at the date of cessation of employment, and in accordance 
with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy and the PSP Plan rules, the subsisting award of 241,830 nil-cost options, made on 4 June 2015, 
would lapse in their entirety upon cessation.

The performance conditions for the share options are disclosed on pages 90 and 91 and are included in this audited information section by 
reference. None of the terms and conditions of the share options were varied in the year.
Performance graph and table 
The graph on page 93 shows the Company’s total shareholder return (share price growth plus dividends reinvested where applicable) for 
each of the last eight financial years of a holding of shares in the Company against a hypothetical holding of shares in the FTSE All-Share 
Industrial Engineering Index. The Committee considers this index to be an appropriate index for total shareholder return and comparison 
disclosure as it represents a broad equity index of which the Company is a constituent.

Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in next financial year
The Committee intends to operate the remuneration policy as set out in the Policy table and notes on pages 82 to 85 for three years from 
the date of the 2016 AGM. 
Base salary
Consistent with the timing of annual employee pay reviews across the Group, which are implemented with effect from 1 August, the 
Committee reviews base salaries for the Executive Directors annually. The next review will take place in July 2017 and any change 
implemented from 1 August 2017. The current base salaries for the Executive Directors are set out on page 89 and below:

The values use the same methodology as that shown in calculating the single figure basis of remuneration in the table on page 89.

The Group uses the UK workforce as an appropriate comparator group as the Executives are based in the UK and the structure of remuneration varies considerably 
based on local market practice in other countries in which the Group operates.

The figures include only those employees who were not promoted and did not change role during the year to provide a like-for-like comparison.

Annual Report on Remuneration 
Annual bonus
The performance measures for the 2016/17 annual bonus are unchanged from 2015/16. As set out on page 90, the performance measures 
are based upon a metric of EBITDA and net debt performance conditions.
The performance targets for the annual bonus are based on internal targets and considered commercially sensitive. Performance targets 
will continue to be disclosed retrospectively in the Remuneration Report in the interests of transparency.
Long-Term Incentive Plan – PSP 
The performance conditions attaching to options that will be granted under the PSP in the year commencing 1 April 2017 are in line with 
those granted during 2016 and are as follows:
 Æ For the Group Finance Director, 100% of the award will be based on the compound annual growth rate in adjusted EPS over a three 
year period (EPS CAGR).
 Æ For the Chief Executive, 50% of the award will be based on this EPS condition and 50% will be based on TSR.
The targets applying to the award will be as follows:

DIRECTORS' REPORT 
The Directors submit their report and the financial statements as 
set out on pages 100 to 155.
The Directors’ Report, which comprises pages 95 to 97, sets out 
certain information in relation to the Company in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and the FCA’s Listing 
and Disclosure and Transparency Rules.
The Strategic Report provides an overview of the performance 
of the business in the year ended 31 March 2017 and covers likely 
future developments in the business of the Company and the 
Group.
In accordance with section 414C (11) of the Companies Act 2006, 
information about the employment of disabled persons, employee 
involvement and greenhouse gas emissions, which is required 
to be included in the Directors’ Report, has been included in the 
Strategic Report. The Corporate Governance report also forms part 
of the Directors’ Report. Where statutory disclosures have been 
made elsewhere in the Annual Report and Accounts, they are cross 
referenced in the table on page 97 and therefore incorporated by 
reference.
Group
The Company is a public limited company incorporated in England, 
registered number 249688, with its registered office at Trident 2, 
Trident Business Park, Styal Road, Wythenshawe, Manchester,  
M22 5XB. 
The Group is an international engineering group, producing a wide 
range of high quality engineering products which are sold in over 
100 countries worldwide. 
Results
Profit before tax for the year ended 31 March 2017 is £6.7m 
compared with a profit of £7.4m for the year ended 31 March 2016.
Dividends
Details about dividend policy are set out in Note 6 of the Group 
financial statements.
The Board has decided to recommend that no ordinary dividend be 
paid in respect of the year ended 31 March 2017, but it will consider 
future dividend policy in the light of results from the business going 
forward.
Dividend payments in respect of the 6% cumulative preference 
stock in the Company were made on 1 July 2016 and 1 January 2017.
Directors’ appointment and replacement
The appointment and replacement of Directors of the Company 
is governed by its Articles of Association and legislation. The 
Company’s Articles of Association give power to the Board to 
appoint Directors to fill a vacancy or as additional Directors, but 
also require Directors to retire and submit themselves for election 
at the first AGM following their appointment. In addition, all Non-
Executive Directors are subject to annual election: please refer to 
the Corporate Governance report on page 65 for further details. 
As a result, Mark Harper, John Allkins, Ian Griffiths, Ian Scapens  
and David Landless will be standing for election/re-election at the 
2017 AGM.
Under the terms of reference of the Nomination Committee, 
appointments to the Board are recommended by the Nomination 
Committee for approval by the Board. For a full description of 
the Company’s policy on appointments to the Board, see the 
Nomination Committee report at pages 76 and 77.
Shareholders may also appoint a Director by ordinary resolution.
Directors’ interests
Details of the interests of the Directors and their connected persons 
in the Company’s share capital and in options held under the 
Company’s share option schemes, along with any changes in such 
interests since the end of the year, are detailed in the Directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 89 to 94. No Director had any 
interests in contracts of significance in relation to the Company’s 
business during the year.
Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
Liability insurance for directors and officers was maintained 
throughout the year. No qualifying third party indemnity provision 
or qualifying pension scheme indemnity provision was in force 
when this Directors’ report was approved or was in force during the 
year.
Conflicts of interest
The Company’s Articles of Association were amended at the 2008 
AGM, in line with the Companies Act 2006, to allow the Board to 
authorise potential conflicts of interest of Directors, on such terms 
(if any) as the Board thinks fit when giving any authorisation. Any 
decision of the Board to authorise a conflict of interest is only 
effective if it is approved without the conflicted Directors voting or 
without their votes being counted and, in making such a decision, 
the Directors must act in a way they consider in good faith will 
be most likely to promote the success of the Company. The Board 
considers that the procedures it has in place for reporting and 
considering conflicts of interest are effective and a review of 
previously approved conflicts is carried out annually.
Shares
Share capital
As at 31 March 2017, the issued share capital of the Company 
was £27,264,309 divided into 225,417,740 ordinary shares of 
5p each, 580,482 units of 6% cumulative preference stock of £1 
each and 77,064,703 deferred shares of 20p each. The increase 
in the issued share capital (2016: £27,146,657) follows the issue of 
2,353,037 ordinary shares of 5p each in July 2016 to the Company’s 
Employee Benefit Trust to facilitate the exercise of share options by 
employees across the Company. 
The ordinary shares represent 41.34% of the Company’s total share 
capital, the preference stock represents 2.13% and the deferred 
shares represent 56.53%. The Company’s ordinary shares and 
preference stock are listed on the London Stock Exchange.

The deferred shares have no voting or dividend rights and are not 
able to be traded. As stated in the Company’s interim results for 
the half year ended 30 September 2016, it is intended that the 
deferred shares be cancelled given they have had no value or voting 
rights since their issue. In accordance with the rights granted to 
the Company in 2009 when the shares were issued in connection 
with a placing, it is proposed that the Company will purchase all 
the deferred shares for 1p in aggregate and they are subsequently 
cancelled. Shareholder approval will be sought accordingly at the 
2017 AGM. 
The Company obtained shareholder authority at the 2016 AGM 
to make market purchases of up to 22,306,470 ordinary shares 
in the Company, which remains outstanding until the conclusion 
of the 2017 AGM. The minimum price which must be paid for any 
ordinary share is the nominal value of such share at the time of the 
purchase and the maximum price is that permitted under the FCA’s 
Listing Rules or, in the case of a tender offer, 5% above the average 
of the middle market quotations of the Company’s ordinary shares 
as derived from the London Stock Exchange’s Daily Official List for 
the five business days immediately preceding the date on which 
the tender offer is announced. As at the date of this report, the 
Company had not purchased any of its own ordinary shares in the 
market pursuant to such authority. The Directors will seek authority 
from shareholders at the forthcoming AGM for the Company to 
purchase, in the market, up to 22,541,774 of its own ordinary shares 
(which represents approximately 10% of the Company’s ordinary 
share capital as at the date of this report) either to be cancelled or 
retained as treasury shares. 
Details of the Company’s share capital are also set out in Note 19 to 
the Group financial statements.
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s shares are 
contained in the Company’s Articles of Association, a copy of which 
is available at www.renold.com or can be obtained upon request 
to the Company Secretary. The Articles of Association were first 
adopted on 30 July 2008 and last amended on 15 July 2010. A 
special resolution will be proposed at the 2017 AGM to change the 
current articles in order to reflect developments in practice and 
legislation, including shareholder association guidance, which have 
arisen since they were last amended.
Voting rights
The Directors confirm that no person has any special rights of 
control over the Company’s share capital and that no shares have 
been issued that carry any special rights with regard to control of 
the Company. 
Participants in employee share schemes have no voting or other 
rights in respect of the shares subject to those awards until the 
options are exercised, at which time the shares rank pari passu in 
all respects with shares already in issue. No such schemes carry any 
special rights with regard to control of the Company. 
No member shall, unless the Directors otherwise determine, be 
entitled to vote at a general meeting either personally or by proxy, 
or to exercise any other right conferred by membership in relation 
to meetings of the Company, if any call or other sum presently 
payable by him to the Company in respect of such shares remains 
unpaid. The Directors also have powers to suspend voting rights 
in certain limited circumstances when a shareholder has failed to 
comply with a notice issued under section 793 of the Companies  
Act 2006.
Full details of the deadlines for exercising voting rights and 
appointing a proxy or proxies in respect of the resolutions to be 
considered at the AGM are set out in the Notice of AGM.

In addition, the Directors have authority to allot shares up 
to a maximum nominal amount of £7,428,054, representing 
approximately two thirds of the issued ordinary share capital 
as at the date of the Notice of the Company’s 2016 AGM. The 
authority will expire at the forthcoming AGM. The Directors will 
seek authority from shareholders at the AGM to allot shares 
up to a maximum nominal amount of £7,506,410, representing 
approximately 66.6% of the issued ordinary share capital as at the 
date of the Notice of the AGM.
Transfer of shares
The registration of transfers may be suspended at such times and 
for such periods as the Directors may determine. The Directors 
may refuse to register the transfer of any share which is not a fully 
paid-up share and may refuse to register any transfer in favour 
of more than four persons jointly. The Directors may also refuse 
to recognise any instrument of transfer unless it is in respect of 
any one class of share, is lodged at the requisite place and, where 
appropriate, is accompanied by any relevant share certificate and 
such other evidence as the Directors may reasonably require to 
show the right of the transferor to make the transfer. 
The Directors may suspend transfers where a shareholder has 
failed to comply with a notice issued under section 793 of the 
Companies Act 2006. 
There are no other restrictions on the transfer of shares in the 
Company other than certain restrictions which may from time to 
time be imposed by laws and regulations (e.g. insider trading laws 
and market requirements relating to close periods) and pursuant to 
the FCA’s Listing Rules whereby certain employees of the Company 
require the approval of the Company to deal in the Company’s 
securities.
The Directors are not aware of any agreements between holders 
of securities which may result in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities or voting rights.
Donations
During the year, the Group made no political donations.
Contracts: Change of control provisions
The Company’s main UK banking facilities agreement with Lloyds 
Bank plc and Svenska Handelsbanken AB contains a change of 
control provision. This requires the Company to provide notification 
to the agent in the event of a change of control. The banks may 
then demand cancellation and repayment of the commitments and 
the loans. 
The share subscription and shareholders’ agreement between L. G. 
Balakrishnan & Bros Ltd, Renold International Holdings Limited and 
Renold Chain India Private Limited dated 24 June 2008 contains 
certain change of control provisions. On the change of control of a 
shareholder (being one of the parties to the agreement), the other 
shareholder has a right to terminate the agreement and/or to 
require the shareholder suffering the change of control to sell, at a 
fair price, all of its equity shares to the terminating shareholder or a 
nominee of such shareholder. 
No other material contracts contain change of control provisions. 
There are no agreements between the Company and its Directors 
or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or 
employment (whether through resignation, purported redundancy 
or otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover bid. 
Note 18 to the Group financial statements on pages 132 to 137 
details the Group’s obligations to contribute to the UK defined 
benefit pension schemes.
Details of the effect of any change of control in relation to awards 
under the long-term incentive plan are set out on page 87 within 
the Directors’ remuneration report.
Going Concern
After making enquiries, we, the Directors, have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. We therefore 
continue to adopt the Going Concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements.
The basis on which this conclusion has been reached is set out on 
page 113 which is incorporated by reference here.

DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have 
elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable 
law), including FRS 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework'. Under 
company law, the Directors must not approve the accounts unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for 
that period. 
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
 Æ Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 Æ Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 Æ State whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
 Æ Prepare the financial statements on the Going Concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
 Æ Properly select and apply accounting policies;
 Æ Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
 Æ Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
 Æ Make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a 
Going Concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 Æ The financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of 
the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole;
 Æ The Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and
 Æ The Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a 
whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.

Directors on 30 May 2017 and is signed on its behalf by:

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
The Company’s website at www.renold.com, which presents 
additional information about the Group, is regularly updated and 
includes the posting of the interim and final preliminary results and 
interim management statements on the day they are announced. 
If you wish to advise a change of name, address, or dividend 
mandate, please contact the Company’s registrar, Capita Asset 
Services, whose contact details appear on page 156. Alternatively, 
you can view up-to-date information and manage your 
shareholding through Capita’s share portal where you will be able 
to access and maintain your holding at your own convenience. You 
will require your unique investor code, which can be found on your 
share certificate. The URL for the portal is:

Beware of share fraud
Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure 
investors into scams. They may offer to sell shares that turn out to 
be worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price 
in return for an upfront payment. While high profits are promised, 
if you buy or sell shares in this way you will probably lose your 
money.
How to avoid share fraud
 Æ Keep in mind that firms authorised by the FCA are unlikely to 
contact you out of the blue with an offer to buy or sell shares. 
 Æ Do not get into a conversation, note the name of the person and 
firm contacting you and then end the call. 
 Æ Check the Financial Services Register (the Register) from  
www.fca.org.uk to see if the person and firm contacting you is 
authorised by the FCA. 
 Æ Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised firm, 
copying its website or giving you false contact details. 
 Æ Use the firm’s contact details listed on the Register if you want 
to call it back. 
 Æ Call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the firm does not have contact 
details on the Register or you are told they are out of date. 
 Æ Search the list of unauthorised firms to avoid at  
www.fca.org.uk/scams. 
 Æ Consider that if you buy or sell shares from an unauthorised firm 
you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or 
Financial Services Compensation Scheme. 
 Æ Think about getting independent financial and professional 
advice before you hand over any money. 
 Æ Remember: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is! 
Report a scam 
If you are approached by fraudsters please tell the FCA using the 
share fraud reporting form at www.fca.org.uk/scams, where you 
can find out more about investment scams. 
You can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768. 
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters you should 
contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.

STEP 2020 in Action
Manufacturing efficiency
During the year we completed the transfer of our European 
Distribution Centre from France to a new logistics centre near 
the Einbeck facility in Germany. This increases manufacturing 
capacity in the Einbeck facility through the availability of 
additional space for manufacturing. We also completed the 
consolidation of our two UK Couplings facilities into one site 
in Cardiff. Both of these projects should realise significant 
savings going forward further lowering the breakeven point.

 Æ the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2017 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 Æ the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union;
 Æ the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, including FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’; and
 Æ the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements that we have audited comprise:
 Æ the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
 Æ the consolidated and parent company balance sheets;
 Æ the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity;
 Æ the consolidated statement of cash flows;
 Æ the related Group accounting policies and Notes 1 to 26; and

financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice), including FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’.
Summary of our audit approach
Key risks The key risks that we identified in the current year were:
 Æ The carrying value of inventory
 Æ Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
 Æ Defined benefit pension scheme accounting
 Æ Deferred tax asset recognition
Materiality We determined materiality for the Group to be £455,000 which is 5% of adjusted pre-tax profit.
Scoping We focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at 14 locations (2016: 14 locations). 7 (2016: 
7) of these were subject to a full audit, 5 (2016: 5) were subject to an audit of specified account balances and 
the remaining 2 (2016: 2) were subject to review procedures.
Significant changes in our 
approach
Apart from the acquisition risk from the prior year which has not been included in the current year, there 
have been no significant changes in our audit approach.

Going Concern and the directors’ assessment of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity  
of the Group
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement regarding 
the appropriateness of the Going Concern basis of accounting contained within the 
Accounting Policies on page 113 to the financial statements and the Directors’ statement 
on the longer-term viability of the Group contained within the Strategic Report on page 
47.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to 
in relation to:
 Æ the Directors’ confirmation on page 47 that they have carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
 Æ the disclosures on pages 40 to 47 that describe those risks and explain how they are 
being managed or mitigated;
 Æ the Directors’ statement in the accounting policies to the financial statements about 
whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the Going Concern basis of accounting 
in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s 
ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements; and
 Æ the Directors’ explanation on page 47 as to how they have assessed the prospects of 
the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to 
be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall 
due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We confirm that we have nothing material to 
add or draw attention to in respect of these 
matters.
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption 
of the Going Concern basis of accounting 
and we did not identify any such material 
uncertainties. However, because not all 
future events or conditions can be predicted, 
this statement is not a guarantee as to 
the Group’s ability to continue as a Going 
Concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards for 
Auditors and confirm that we are independent of the Group and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.
We confirm that we are independent of 
the Group and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
those standards. We also confirm we have 
not provided any of the prohibited non-audit 
services referred to in those standards.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
The acquisition of Aventics Tooth Chain is a risk which we commented on in our 2016 report which we have not included in 2017 due to no 
further acquisitions being made by the Group.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
to the Members of Renold plc
The carrying value of inventory
Risk description As shown in Note 11 the Group holds inventory of £40.4m (2016:£36.3m). As discussed on page 72, management 
judgement is applied to the cost of inventories in order to accurately reflect the manufacturing costs incurred in 
bringing them to their current condition and physical location.  This primarily relates to the assessment of direct 
labour costs incurred, manufacturing overheads to be absorbed and other relevant production costs.
A risk surrounding the carrying value of inventory when compared to the net realisable value as a result of 
inadequate provisioning has also been identified. Establishing a provision for slow-moving, obsolete and damaged 
inventory involves estimates and judgements, taking into account forecast sales and historical usage information. 
How the scope of our 
audit responded to 
the risk
We evaluated the design and implementation of key controls relating to the assessment of inventory valuation 
and inventory provisioning; 
On a sample basis, we have performed the following audit procedures:
 Æ Agreed the cost of raw materials to third party supplier invoices;
 Æ For work in progress and finished goods, we obtained the bill of material and tested the underlying costs 
within each stock item. We challenged the key assumptions concerning overhead absorption by assessing the 
appropriateness of costs included in the calculation;
 Æ Reviewed the overheads absorbed to determine whether they were allowable under IAS 2 and appropriately 
recognised. We agreed the estimated overheads to actual overheads incurred in the year to assess whether 
they were materially different;
 Æ Assessed the net realisable value (NRV) on a sample basis of stock items by agreeing their subsequent sales 
price to customer invoices to ensure that the items were being held at the lower of cost and NRV;
 Æ Gained an understanding of the movements in the inventory provision year on year and an assessment of the 
scale of the provision in comparison to the gross stock value, to determine whether there are any unusual 
transactions;
 Æ Recalculated the value of the provision based on a sample of items; and
 Æ Where manual adjustments have been made to the provision, we have understood these by gaining supporting 
documentation. 
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
Risk description The goodwill £26.4m (2016: £22.7m) and intangible assets £9.7m (2016: £10.3m) balance shown in Note 7 
principally relates to Jeffrey Chain and are supported by an annual impairment review. Other intangibles as shown 
in Note 8 amount to £9.7m comprising largely of computer software of £6.5m (2016: £6.1m). 
As discussed on page 72, the risk identified is in respect of Management’s judgements in relation to the financial 
forecasts of the business units, discount rates and perpetuity growth rates used to determine the value in use of 
the cash generating units which are subjective and could lead to an impairment charge if incorrect.  
How the scope of our 
audit responded to 
the risk
 Æ We assessed the design and implementation of key controls concerning management’s impairment review 
process; 
 Æ We have evaluated the future cash flow forecasts and the process by which they are drawn up, including 
confirming the accuracy of the underlying calculations and checking whether the forecasts are consistent with 
the latest Board approved forecasts;
 Æ We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s budgets and forecasts by comparing them to actual 
performance and verifying the mathematical accuracy of the cash flow models;
 Æ We utilised our specialists to assess the appropriateness of the discount rate derived from a Weighted Average 
Cost of Capital (WACC) applied by management in their discounted cash flows; 
 Æ We challenged the underlying assumptions and significant judgements used in management’s impairment 
model by examining the results of management’s sensitivity analysis around long-term growth rates 
and discount rates to ascertain the extent of change in those assumptions that would be required for an 
impairment to be recognised; and
 Æ We also assessed whether the disclosures in the accounting policies of the financial statements appropriately 
disclose the key judgements taken so that the reader of the financial statements is aware of the impact of the 
financial statement of changes to key assumptions that may lead to impairment.

Defined benefit pension scheme accounting 
Risk description The Group have a number of defined benefit pension schemes that are in a net deficit position of £102.0m as 
shown in Note 18 which is significant both in the context of the overall balance sheet and the results of the Group. 
As described on page 72, the valuation of the pension liability requires significant levels of judgement and 
technical expertise in choosing appropriate assumptions, a number of which can be volatile. Changes in the 
number of the key assumptions (including salary increases, inflation, discount rates and mortality) can have a 
material impact on the calculation of the liability. 
How the scope of 
our audit responded 
to the risk
 Æ We assessed the design and implementation of key controls concerning management’s valuation process; 
 Æ We challenged the discount rate and inflation rates used in the valuation of the pensions liabilities by 
comparison to our internally developed expectations using our actuarial expertise and compared the 
assumptions around salary increases and mortality to national and industry averages; and
 Æ We evaluated the sensitivity of the pension scheme deficits to differences between our independent 
judgements and those made by the Directors, both individually and in aggregate. 
Deferred tax asset recognition 
Risk description The Group has a net deferred tax asset (DTA) of £20.6m (2016: £16.7m) and an unrecognised DTA of £26.2m (2016: 
£21.7m).  IAS 12 states that a DTA shall be recognised for the carry forward of unused tax losses and unused tax 
credits to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax 
losses and unused tax credits can be utilised. 
As described on page 72, the key judgement in this area is that there will be sufficient future taxable profits 
available against which the unused tax losses and future pension deductions can be utilised.  
How the scope of 
our audit responded 
to the risk
 Æ We evaluated the design and implementation of key controls relating to the assessment of the future 
profitability of the Group; 
 Æ We challenged management’s assumptions used in the forecast model by using our knowledge of the Group 
and the industry in which it operates; 
 Æ In assessing Management’s judgements we have considered, amongst other things, historical levels of taxable 
profits, the historical accuracy of forecasts, and the growth forecasts used by the Group. This included critically 
assessing the assumptions and judgements made by the Directors in those growth forecasts, by using our 
knowledge of the Group and the industry in which it operates;
 Æ We used our own tax specialists to assist in assessing and challenging the assumptions and judgements made 
by the Directors; and
 Æ We also assessed the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures setting out the basis of the deferred tax balance and 
the level of estimation involved.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and 
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of 
a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and 
in evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality £455,000 (2016: £480,000)
Basis for determining 
materiality
5% of adjusted pre-tax profit (as defined on page 108) was the basis for which materiality was determined, 
which is consistent with the prior year. Pre-tax profit has been adjusted for exceptional items of £1.7m 
(2016: £2.2m) which are considered to be one-off in nature as per Note 2(c).
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
We have used adjusted pre-tax profit as we deem this an appropriate benchmark which better reflects the 
underlying performance of the business and reduces the risk of volatility.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
to the Members of Renold plc
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £23,000 (2016: £20,500), 
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.  The change in the reporting 
threshold has been made following our reassessment of what matters require communicating. We also report to the Audit Committee on 
disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope primarily on 
the audit work at 14 locations (2016: 14 locations). 7 (2016: 7) of these were subject to a full audit, 5 (2016: 5) were subject to an audit of 
specified account balances where the extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the 
materiality of the Group’s operations at those locations. The remaining 2 (2016: 2) were subject to review procedures. These 14 locations 
represent the principal business units and account for 100% (2016: 100%) of the Group’s revenue. They were also selected to provide an 
appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. Our audit work at the 14 
locations was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than Group materiality and ranged 
from £225,000 to £247,500.
At the Parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that 
there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject 
to audit or audit of specified account balances.
The Group audit team follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that a senior member of the Group audit team visits 
each of the locations where the Group audit scope was focused at least once every two years and the most significant of them at least 
once a year. In years when we do not visit a significant component we will include the component audit team in our team briefing, discuss 
their risk assessment, and review documentation of the findings from their work. During the current year audit, a senior member of the 
Group audit team visited two locations in the US and Germany.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 Æ the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
 Æ the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 Æ the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not 
identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 Æ we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 Æ adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our 
audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
 Æ the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns.
We have nothing to report in 
respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of 
directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report 
arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review part of the Corporate Governance Statement 
relating to the company’s compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report 
arising from our review.

Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, information in the annual report is:
 Æ materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
 Æ apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group 
acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
 Æ otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our 
knowledge acquired during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is 
fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters 
that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider should have been disclosed.
We confirm that we have 
not identified any such 
inconsistencies or misleading 
statements.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also comply with International 
Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are 
effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards review team and 
independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
To aid the reader of the financial statements, certain accounting 
policies can be found in the relevant notes.
Basis of preparation
Statement of compliance
Renold plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled 
in the United Kingdom. The consolidated financial statements of 
the Company comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together 
referred to as the Group). The Company's financial statements 
present information about the Company as a separate entity 
and not about the Group. The consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU. In addition, the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable 
to groups reporting under IFRS.
The Parent Company has elected to prepare its parent company 
financial statements in accordance with FRS 101; these are 
presented on pages 147 to 155. The financial statements were 
approved by the Board on 30 May 2017.
Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention, except where otherwise indicated. 
The accounting policies as set out below have been applied 
consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial 
statements.
Functional and presentation currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds 
Sterling which is the Group’s functional currency.
Foreign currency translation
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the 
transaction or average rates where applicable. Foreign exchange 
gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions 
and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
recognised in the income statement, except for monetary items 
that form part of the net investment in foreign operations which 
are taken to other comprehensive income.
Assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated into 
Pounds Sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the end of the 
financial year. Income statements and cash flows are translated 
at the appropriate average rates of exchange for the year. 
Differences on exchange arising on the retranslation of net assets 
in overseas subsidiaries, borrowings used to finance or provide a 
hedge against those investments and from the translation of the 
results at average rates are taken directly to other comprehensive 
income. On loss of control of a foreign entity, related exchange 
differences previously recognised in other comprehensive income 
are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss 
on sale.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company and the entities controlled by the 
Company made up to 31 March each year.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition 
method. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a 
subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities 
incurred and equity interests issued by the Group in exchange 
for control of the acquired entity. Consideration transferred also 
includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a 
contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition related costs are 
expensed in operating costs as incurred. All identifiable assets and 
liabilities acquired and contingent liabilities assumed are initially 
measured at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any 
non-controlling interest and the acquisition date fair value of any 
previously held equity interest in the acquired entity as compared 
with the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets are recognised 
as goodwill. Where the Group’s share of identifiable net assets 
acquired exceeds the total consideration transferred, a gain from 
a bargain purchase is recognised immediately in the income 
statement after the fair values initially determined have been 
reassessed.
(a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities that are controlled by the Group. Control 
is exerted where the Group has the power to govern, directly 
or indirectly, the financial and operating policies of the entity 
so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities. Typically, a 
shareholding of more than 50% of the voting rights is indicative of 
control. However, the impact of potential voting rights currently 
exercisable is taken into consideration.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
consolidated financial statements of the Group from the date that 
control is obtained to the date that control ceases. The accounting 
policies of new subsidiaries are changed where necessary to align 
them with those of the Group.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated 
subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity 
therein. They are initially measured at the non-controlling interest's 
share of the net fair value of the assets and liabilities recognised or 
at fair value, as determined on an acquisition by acquisition basis. 
Subsequent to acquisition, non-controlling interests consist of 
the amount of those interests at the date of the original business 
combination and the non-controlling interest’s share of the changes 
in equity since the date of the combination.

The results and financial position of Renold Scottish Limited 
Partnership (SLP) have been consolidated in the consolidated 
financial statements of Renold plc. Renold plc is the parent 
undertaking of the general partner in the SLP (see Note (xiv) to the 
Company financial statements). To determine that Renold plc has 
control over the SLP, we considered the following activities, benefits 
and risks:
Activities – The SLP was established by Renold plc as a means of 
funding its pension obligation in an efficient manner.
Benefits – During the 25 year period, the Renold Pension Scheme 
will receive substantially all of the SLP’s income. However, after 
this period, the Renold Group is entitled to any remaining income 
generated in the SLP, together with any other residual value  
in the SLP.
Risks – The Group bears the risks incidental to the activities of the 
SLP because it retains the obligation to ensure the pension scheme 
is appropriately funded.
Accordingly, advantage has been taken of the exemption conferred 
by paragraph 7 of the Partnerships (Accounts) Regulations 2008 
from the requirements for preparation, delivery and publication of 
the partnership’s accounts.
(b) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income 
and expense arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised 
gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investments 
are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in that 
investment. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as 
unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of 
impairment.
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern 
basis. In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the 
financial statements, the Directors are required to consider whether 
the Group can continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future.
Further information in relation to the Group’s business activities, 
together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position is set out in the Strategic Report on 
pages 8 to 55.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are described in the Strategic Report on 
pages 8 to 55. In addition, Note 25 to the financial statements 
includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing 
its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its 
financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposure to 
foreign exchange, credit and interest rate risk. Further details of the 
Group’s cash balances and borrowings are included in Notes 13, 14 
and 25 of the financial statements. There were no significant post 
balance sheet events to report (see Note 26). 
The Directors have assessed the future funding requirements of 
the Group and the Company and compared them to the level of 
available borrowing facilities. The assessment included a detailed 
review of financial and cash flow forecasts, financial instruments 
and hedging arrangements for at least the 12 month period from 
the date of signing the Annual Report and Accounts. The Directors 
considered a range of potential scenarios within the key markets 
the Group serves and how these might impact the Group’s cash 
flow, facility headroom and banking covenants. The Directors also 
considered what mitigating actions the Group could take to limit 
any adverse consequences. The Group’s forecasts and projections 
show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of 
its borrowing facilities and covenants.
Having undertaken this work, the Directors are of the opinion that 
the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
consolidated financial statements.
Revenue
Revenue comprises the invoiced value for the sale of goods net of 
sales rebates, discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes and after 
eliminating sales within the Group. Revenue is recognised when the 
outcome of a transaction can be measured reliably and when it is 
probable that the economic benefits from the transaction will flow 
to the Group. Revenue is recognised on the following basis:
(a) Sale of goods
Revenue is recognised on the sale of goods when the risks and 
rewards of ownership have transferred from the Group to the 
customer. This is normally the point of despatch to the customer 
when title passes.
(b) Sales rebates and discounts
These comprise customer discounts and rebates which are sales 
incentives to customers to encourage them to purchase increased 
volumes and are related to total volumes purchased and sales 
growth or incentives for early payment. They are recognised in 
the same period as the sales to which they relate based upon 
management’s best estimate of the amount necessary to meet 
claims made by the Group’s customers in respect of these rebates 
and discounts.
(c) Discounts received from suppliers
These comprise rebates and discounts received from suppliers as 
incentives to purchase increased volume or early settlement of 
amounts payable. They are recognised within operating costs over 
the period to which the contract or purchase relates.

Significant accounting judgements, estimates and 
assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and 
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
Although these estimates are based on management’s best 
knowledge of current events and actions, actual results ultimately 
may differ from those estimates.
However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could 
result in outcomes that could require a material adjustment to the 
carrying value of the Group’s assets or liabilities in the future.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a potential risk 
of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows:
(a) Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment 
for all non-financial assets at each reporting date. Goodwill is tested 
for impairment annually and at other times when such indicators 
exist.
When value in use calculations are undertaken, management must 
estimate the expected future cash flows from the asset or cash 
generating unit and choose a suitable discount rate in order to 
calculate the net present value of those cash flows. Further details 
are included in Note 7.
(b) Deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets in respect of pension liabilities are recognised in 
full (with the exception of Germany where the amount recognised 
is offset by a deferred tax liability in relation to the German 
tax base of the pension liability) given the business has a legal 
obligation to make the underlying pension contributions and it 
is probable that adequate taxable profit will be available to take 
advantage of the associated taxable deductions. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised for all unused tax losses to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is 
required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can 
be recognised, based upon the likely timing and level of future 
taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies. Actual 
outcomes may vary which could require a material adjustment to 
the carrying amounts. Further details are contained in Note 17.
(c) Retirement benefit obligations
The valuation of the Group’s defined benefit plans are determined 
by using actuarial valuations. These involve making assumptions 
about discount rates, future salary increases, mortality rates and 
future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these 
plans such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. Net 
interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net 
defined benefit liability. Further details are given in Note 18.
(d) Onerous lease
The Group has assessed an existing operating lease obligation at 
the Bredbury facility and concluded that an onerous lease provision 
is required following the cessation of significant manufacturing 
activity at the site. This involves making assumptions upon future 
sub-let income streams and the discount rate used. An additional 
onerous lease provision was created in the year following the sale 
and leaseback of the Australian Mulgrave facility. For further details 
refer to Notes 2(c) and 16.
(e) Inventory valuation
Manufactured inventory and work in progress include amounts of 
attributable indirect costs incurred in the production process. The 
Group employs a standard cost methodology which, while including 
judgements and assumptions, seeks to allocate the allowable 
indirect production costs in a logical and appropriate manner.
Adoption of new and revised standards
(i) New and revised accounting standards adopted by the Group
During the year, the Group has adopted the following new and 
revised standards and interpretations. Their adoption has not had 
any significant impact on the amounts or disclosures reported in 
these financial statements.
 Æ IAS 1 (amended) ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’. The 
amendment addresses perceived impediments to preparers 
exercising their judgement in presenting their financial reports.
 Æ IAS 16 (amended) ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’. This 
amendment clarifies that depreciation methods based on 
revenue are inappropriate and adds guidance that expected 
future reductions in the selling price of an item produced 
using an asset could indicate the expectation of technological 
or commercial obsolescence, which, in turn, might reflect a 
reduction of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.
 Æ IAS 19 (amended) ‘Employee Benefits’. As part of the 2012–2014 
cycle of the Annual Improvements Project, this standard was 
amended to clarify that the high quality corporate bonds used 
in estimating the discount rate for post-employment benefits 
should be denominated in the same currency as the benefits to 
be paid. 
 Æ IAS 27 (revised) ‘Separate Financial Statements’. This revision 
introduces new disclosure requirements for investment entities.
 Æ IAS 28 (amended) ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures 
(2011)’. This amendment clarifies that, when applying the equity 
method to an associate or a joint venture, a non-investment 
entity investor in an investment entity may retain the fair value 
measurement applied by the associate or joint venture to its 
interests in subsidiaries.
 Æ IAS 38 (amended) ‘Intangible Assets’. This amendment clarifies 
that amortisation methods based on revenue are inappropriate 
except in limited circumstances.
 Æ IFRS 5 (amended) ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations’. As part of the 2012–2014 cycle of the 
Annual Improvements Project, this standard was amended to 
add specific guidance for cases in which an entity re-classifies an 
asset from held for sale to held for distribution or vice versa and 
cases in which held for distribution accounting is discontinued.

 Æ IFRS 7 (amended) ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’. As part of 
the 2012–2014 cycle of the Annual Improvements Project, this 
standard was amended to clarify whether a servicing contract is 
continuing involvement in a transferred asset, and clarification 
on offsetting disclosures in condensed interim financial 
statements.
 Æ IFRS 10 (amended) ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’. 
This amendment clarifies the exemptions from preparing 
consolidated financial statements for a parent entity that is a 
subsidiary of an investment entity. 
 Æ IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’. This standard establishes the 
principles for financial reporting by entities that have an interest 
in arrangements that are controlled jointly.
 Æ IFRS 12 (amended) ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’. This 
amendment clarifies that a subsidiary that provides services 
related to the parent’s investment activities should not be 
consolidated if the subsidiary is an investment entity. In addition, 
the amendment clarifies that an investment entity measuring 
all of its subsidiaries at fair value should provide the disclosures 
relating to investment entities.
(ii) New and revised accounting standards and interpretations 
which were in issue but were not yet effective and have not been 
adopted early by the Group
At the date of publishing these financial statements the following 
new and revised standards and interpretations were in issue 
but were not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been 
adopted by the EU). None of these new and revised standards and 
interpretations have been adopted early by the Group: 
 Æ Annual improvements 2012–2014 cycle 
 Æ Annual improvements 2014–2016 cycle 
 Æ IAS 7 (amended) ‘Statement of Cash Flows’ 
 Æ IAS 12 (amended) ‘Income Taxes’ 
 Æ IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’ 
 Æ IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ 
 Æ IFRS 14 ‘Regulatory Deferral Accounts’ 
 Æ IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ 
 Æ IFRS 16 (amended) ‘Leases’
 Æ IFRIC 22 ‘Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance 
Consideration’.
The Directors are in the process of assessing the potential impact 
of IFRS 15 on both revenue recognition and disclosure requirements 
and the impact of IFRS 16 on liability recognition and disclosure 
requirements. With the exception of IFRS 15 and 16, the Directors 
do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will 
have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in 
future periods.

1. Segmental information
For management purposes, the Group is organised into two operating segments according to the nature of their products and services and 
these are considered by the Directors to be the reportable operating segments of Renold plc as shown below:
 Æ The Chain segment manufactures and sells power transmission and conveyor chain and also includes sales of torque transmission 
products through Chain National Sales Companies (NSCs); and
 Æ The Torque Transmission segment manufactures and sells torque transmission products such as gearboxes and couplings.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable segments.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) for the purposes of IFRS 8: ‘Operating Segments’ is considered to be the Board of Directors 
of Renold plc. Management monitor the results of the separate reportable operating segments based on operating profit and loss which 
is measured consistently with operating profit and loss in the consolidated financial statements. The same segmental basis applies to 
decisions about resource allocation. Disclosure has not been included in respect of the operating assets of each segment as they are 
not reported to the CODM on a regular basis. However, Group net financing costs, retirement benefit obligations and income taxes are 
managed on a Group basis and therefore are not allocated to operating segments. Transfer prices between operating segments are on an 
arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

1. Segmental information continued
The Group uses a variety of alternative performance measures, which are non-IFRS, to assess the performance of its operations. The 
Group considers these performance measures to provide useful historical financial information to help investors evaluate the underlying 
performance of the business by adjusting for volatility created by one-off items and non-trading performance related costs such as 
amortisation and legacy pensions costs.
The two consistently applied performance measures which are disclosed within this annual report and accounts include adjusted results 
and underlying results.
Adjusted results exclude the impact of exceptional items, pension financing charges, pension administration costs and the amortisation 
of acquired intangible assets and the tax thereon. A reconciliation of these results is shown on the face of the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income and in the tables opposite. Adjusted profit of £14.5m is derived from the statutory profit of £11.0m.
Underlying results are retranslated to current year exchange rates and therefore only prior year comparatives would be deemed an 
alternative performance measure. A reconciliation is provided below.

As part of the acquisition of the Renold Tooth Chain business completed in the prior year, the Group was obliged to pay for some 
transitional services provided by the seller’s group until the business migrated to Renold's IT systems. Costs of £0.3m were incurred until 
migration was completed in December 2016 and have now ceased.
Various restructuring costs were incurred in the year as part of the STEP 2020 Strategic Plan. The European distribution and sales 
operations were relocated with the sales functions transferred to a nearby rented office in Lille, France and the European distribution 
operations moved to a new warehouse in Uslar, Germany located close to the Einbeck Chain manufacturing factory. These moves resulted 
in redundancy and restructuring costs of £0.6m. The former European distribution site at Seclin, France was sold for £1.0m resulting in no 
gain or loss on disposal following the £0.5m impairment charge incurred in the prior year.
Also in the year, redundancy and restructuring costs of £2.5m were incurred transferring the HiTec Couplings business, located in Halifax, 
to our existing Couplings facility in Cardiff. As a result of this transfer, the Halifax property is now held for sale at a value of £0.3m (sold on 
15 May 2017 - see Note 10). The increased manufacturing capability at the Cardiff site permitted the closure of the China Couplings facility 
with manufacturing moving to Cardiff and South Africa. This incurred redundancy and restructuring costs of £0.6m in the year.
A further restructuring cost of £0.4m was incurred in the year as we commenced a multi-year project to transfer the China Chain 
manufacturing facility from leased premises in Hangzhou to a purpose-built facility near Changzhou in Jiangsu province. Other 
restructuring costs included £0.1m incurred following the relocation of the Malaysian manufacturing facility into larger premises and £0.1m 
of other STEP 2020 restructuring incurred in the year.
In March 2017, the Mulgrave manufacturing facility in Australia was sold realising net proceeds of £9.3m resulting in a gain on disposal net 
of associated costs of £2.9m. As part of the sale agreement, Renold can remain as a tenant and retain full use of the property for three 
years until March 2020 at which point the property must be vacated. 
Prior year restructuring costs included £0.5m incurred at the Milnrow facility, where the business was downsized following the end of a 
long-term supply agreement (offshored by the customer), £0.6m of costs related to the relocation of the head office and £1.4m of other 
STEP 2020 restructuring costs incurred in the year.
Also in the prior year, a past service credit of £1.3m arose in Germany following the confirmation that the pension scheme was properly 
closed to future accrual with effect from 2014. This was offset by a £0.1m settlement loss relating to the liquidation of the Australian 
pension scheme.

Share-based payments (57) 531
Social security costs 114 144
Total 949 1,452
The remuneration listed in the table above differs from the single total figure table in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 89 for 
the following reasons:
 Æ Only pensions payable directly to pension schemes are included in the post employment benefits in the table on page 89. £70,000 
(2016: £73,000) of additional cash payments for pensions paid indirectly were included in Directors’ remuneration; 
 Æ it excludes LTIPs vested in the form of share options; and
 Æ it includes £111,375 in respect of payments on leaving the Company.
Further details of the remuneration of Directors are provided in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 78 to 94.
A geographical split of the Group’s average number of employees during the year is included in Note 1. The total number of employees 
employed by the Group at 31 March 2017 was 2,139 (2016: 2,187).

4. Taxation
Accounting Policy
The tax charge included in the income statement comprises current tax payable and deferred tax.
The Group is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. The current tax charge represents an estimate of the amounts payable to tax 
authorities in respect of taxable profits. It is based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method, providing for temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. The amount of deferred tax provided is calculated 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised or taxable profit will be available against which unused tax losses can be utilised before they expire.
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income 
and not the income statement. Similarly, income tax is charged or credited to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged 
directly to equity. Otherwise, income tax is recognised in the income statement.
Deferred tax balances are analysed in Note 17.

Factors affecting the Group tax charge for the year
The UK Government announced that it intends to reduce the main rate of corporation tax to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020. This change 
was substantively enacted in September 2016. Accordingly, deferred tax balances have been revalued to the lower rate of 17% in these 
financial statements which has resulted in a £0.5m deferred tax charge to the statement of other comprehensive income. 
The Group’s tax charge in future years will be affected by the profit mix, effective tax rates in the different countries where the Group 
operates and utilisation of tax losses. No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
The actual tax on the Group’s profit before tax differs from the theoretical amount using the UK corporation tax rate as follows:
2017
£m
2016
£m
Profit on ordinary activities before tax 6.7 7.4
Theoretical tax charge at 20% (2016: 20%) 1.3 1.5
Effects of:
Permanent differences 0.5 0.9
Overseas tax rate differences – 0.7
Prior year adjustments 1.5 0.2
Deferred tax utilised (1.4) (1.3)
Total tax charge 1.9 2.0
Effective tax rate
The effective tax rate of 28% (2016: 27%) is higher than the UK tax rate of 20% (2016: 20%) due to the following factors:
 Æ Permanent differences including items that are disallowed from a tax perspective such as entertaining and certain employee costs;
 Æ Prior year adjustments arising as tax submissions are finalised and agreed in specific jurisdictions; and
 Æ Differences in overseas tax rates, typically being higher than the rates in the UK.
Tax payments
Cash tax paid in the year of £1.0m (2016: £1.0m) is lower than the total tax charge due to the utilisation of tax losses in various jurisdictions.

The adjusted EPS numbers have been provided in order to give a useful indication of underlying performance by the exclusion of 
exceptional items. Due to the existence of unrecognised deferred tax assets, there was no associated tax credit on some of the exceptional 
charges and in these instances exceptional costs are added back in full. 
6. Dividends
Accounting Policy
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are paid or approved by the Company’s shareholders.
No ordinary dividend payments were paid or proposed in either the current or prior year.

7. Goodwill
Accounting Policy
(i) Initial recognition
Goodwill arises on business combinations and represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the Group’s share of the identifiable 
net assets of the acquiree at the acquisition date. Where the cost is less than the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets, the difference 
is immediately recognised in the income statement as a gain from a bargain purchase.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being 
tested for impairment at that date.
(ii) Subsequent measurement
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of equity accounted investments, goodwill acquired directly 
is included in the carrying amount of the investment.
(iii) Impairment
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill 
is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The cash generating units to which the goodwill has been 
allocated is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from 
other assets or group of assets. Any impairment charge is recognised immediately in the income statement.

The Group performed its annual impairment test of goodwill at 31 March 2017 which compares the current book value to the recoverable 
amount from the continued use or sale of the related business. No impairment charge has been recognised in the period.
The recoverable amount of each Cash Generating Unit (CGU) has been determined on a value in use basis. Value in use is calculated as the 
net present value of cash flows derived from detailed financial plans for the next two financial years as approved by the Board. Cash flows 
beyond this are extrapolated using the long-term country growth rates disclosed below:

7. Goodwill continued
Key assumptions used in the value in use calculations:
Sales volumes, selling prices and cost changes
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts based on the latest management estimates for the next two financial years. The expected sales 
prices and volumes reflect management’s experience of how sales will develop at this point of the economic cycle. The expected profit 
margin reflects management’s experience of each CGU’s profitability at the forecast level of sales and incorporates the impact of any 
restructuring that took place during the year ended 31 March 2017.
Cash flows beyond the period of projections are extrapolated using long-term growth rates published by the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development for the territory in which the CGU is based. The discount rates applied to the cash flows of each of the CGUs 
are based on the risk free rate for long-term bonds issued by the government in the respective market. This is then adjusted to reflect 
both the increased risk of investing in equities and the systematic risk of the specific CGU (using an average of the betas of comparable 
companies).
Management believe that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would cause the carrying values to materially 
exceed each CGU’s recoverable amount. 
Provisional fair value adjustment – Renold Tooth Chain
During the year, the provisional fair values calculated at the Tooth Chain acquisition date have been reassessed, resulting in an adjustment 
to the provisional fair values of inventories (£0.2m reduction) and provisions (£0.2m increase) calculated at the date of acquisition. 
Furthermore, the contingent consideration paid in the year was lower than the provisional amount anticipated at the acquisition date 
(£0.1m). These adjustments have been reflected in goodwill arising upon acquisition resulting in a £0.3m increase.
8. Intangible assets
Accounting Policy
(i) Computer software
Computer software that is not integral to an item of plant and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset. Amortisation 
is charged on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost of software to the income statement over its expected useful life which is 
between three and seven years. Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as 
incurred.
(ii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets, such as those identified on acquisition by the Group that have finite useful lives, are recognised at fair value and 
measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The estimated useful lives for the Group’s finite life intangible 
assets are between one and seven years.
Intangible assets are reviewed, at least annually, to ensure that assets are not carried above their recoverable amounts. Where some 
indication of impairment exists, calculations are made of the discounted cash flows resulting from continued use of the assets (value 
in use) or from their disposal (fair value less costs to sell). Where these values are less than the carrying amount of the assets, an 
impairment loss is charged to the income statement.

The acquisition of the Tooth Chain business in January 2016 brought significant benefit to the Group in terms of new customers, 
relationships and technical 'know-how'. These benefits have been valued under IFRS 3 using estimates of useful lives and discounted cash 
flows of expected income. The values are being amortised as follows:
Customer orderbook
Customer orderbook is amortised when the orderbook at the date of acquisition has been fulfilled. This is now fully amortised.
Customer lists and technical know-how
Customer lists and technical know-how is being amortised over five years as the benefits are likely to crystallise over a longer period.
No brand names were acquired as part of the acquisition.

9. Property, plant and equipment
Accounting Policy
Tangible assets are stated at cost, being purchase cost plus any incidental costs of acquisition, less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis so as to charge the depreciable amount of the respective assets to the income 
statement over their expected useful lives. No depreciation has been charged on freehold land. The useful lives of assets are as follows:
 Years
Freehold buildings 50
Leasehold properties 50 years or the period
of the lease if less
General plant and equipment 15
Fixtures 15
Precision cutting and grinding machines 10
Motor vehicles 3
Useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and where adjustments are required these are made prospectively. Where the 
carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down immediately to its recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amounts and are included in operating profit.
Tangible assets held under finance leases, which are those where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have 
passed to the Group, are capitalised in the balance sheet at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset or the present value of the 
minimum lease payments and are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term. The corresponding liability 
to the leasing company, net of finance charges, is included as an obligation under finance leases in creditors. The interest element of the 
lease payment is charged to the income statement on a basis which produces a constant rate of charge over the period of the liability.

During the year, the HiTec Couplings business was transferred from the manufacturing facility based in Halifax to the existing UK Couplings 
facility in Cardiff. The Halifax site was sold on 15 May 2017 for net proceeds of £0.5m realising a gain of £0.2m to be recognised in the first 
half of the next financial year.
11. Inventories
Accounting Policy
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value, after due allowance for obsolete or slow moving items. 
Cost includes all direct expenditure and attributable overhead expenditure incurred in bringing goods to their current state under normal 
operating conditions. The first in, first out method of valuation is used. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business, less the costs of completion and selling expenses. In the Group accounts, unrealised profit on sales within the Group is 
deducted from inventories.

12. Trade and other receivables
Accounting Policy
Trade and other receivables are recognised and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for any identified impairment. 
The impairment allowance is charged to the income statement when there is objective evidence that the Group will not collect all amounts 
due under the original terms of the transaction. Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as remote.

Core banking facilities
On 13 May 2015 the Group agreed a revision to its existing banking facilities with its current banking partners, Svenska Handelsbanken 
AB and Lloyds Bank plc. The revised facility replicates the previous £41m Multi-Currency Revolving Facility (MCRF) but also adds a £20m 
accordion feature that can be accessed by the Group to fund investment or acquisition opportunities. The revised facility has been 
extended to mature in May 2020 whereas the original maturity was in October 2016. The MCRF is fully committed and available until 
maturity.
At the year end the undrawn facility was £5.3m (2016: £3.4m). The Group pays interest at LIBOR plus a variable margin in respect of this 
facility. The average rate of interest paid in the year was LIBOR plus 1.91% for Sterling denominated facility and LIBOR plus 1.82% for the 
Euro and US Dollar denominated facility (2016: LIBOR plus 1.79% for Sterling denominated facility and LIBOR plus 1.81% for the Euro and 
US Dollar denominated facility). This facility has two primary financial covenants which are tested on a six monthly basis. The first is net 
debt as a ratio of rolling annual EBITDA with a maximum ratio of 2.5 times. The second is interest cover with a minimum ratio of 4.0 times 
(rolling annual EBITDA divided by net financial interest cost). The Group also benefits from a number of  overseas facilities totalling £2.2m. 
Secured borrowings
Included in Group borrowings are secured borrowings of £32.3m (2016: £35.0m). Security is provided by fixed and floating charges over 
assets (including certain property, plant and equipment and inventory) primarily in the UK, USA, France, Germany and Australia.
Finance leases
The Group has no obligations under finance leases.
Preference Stock
At 31 March 2017 there were 580,482 units of Preference Stock in issue (2016: 580,482).
All payments of dividends on the Preference Stock have been paid on the due dates. The Preference Stock has the following rights:
(i)  a fixed cumulative preferential dividend at the rate of 6% per annum payable half yearly on 1 January and 1 July in each year;
(ii)   rank both with regard to dividend (including any arrears on the commencement of a winding up) and return of capital in priority to all     
other stock or shares in the Company, but with no further right to participate in profits or assets;
(iii)   no right to attend or vote, either in person or by proxy, at any general meeting of the Company or to have notice of any such meeting, 
unless the dividend on the Preference Stock is in arrears for six calendar months; and
(iv)  no redemption entitlement and no fixed repayment date.
There is no significant difference between the carrying value of financial liabilities and their equivalent fair value.

Accounting Policy
Provisions are recognised when the Group: (i) has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; (ii) it is more likely 
than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and (iii) a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. 
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, e.g. under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate 
asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
Costs related to ongoing activities of the Group are not provided in advance.

Business restructuring
This provision relates to the reorganisation and restructuring of various parts of the business: £0.6m relates to the Chinese Torque 
Transmission facility closure initiated in March 2017 and £0.8m relates to the remaining UK HiTec Couplings redundancy costs due to be 
paid in the first half of the next financial year. See Note 2(c) on exceptional charges for more details.
Onerous lease
This provision relates to onerous lease costs in respect of the lease of the Bredbury plant in the UK and the Mulgrave facility in Australia. 
The Bredbury lease expires in May 2030. A lease was agreed in August 2016 to sublet a significant part of the property for a five year term 
for an annual rent of £0.6m. £0.9m of the provision was utilised in the year leaving a provision of £3.2m in respect of this lease.
In addition, as part of the sale agreement of the Mulgrave facility in Australia completed in March 2017, it was agreed that the business 
could remain in the property for a maximum of three additional years for an annual rent of £0.5m. This lease was deemed to be onerous 
and as a result a provision was established in relation to the total lease cost of £1.6m. This charge was included in the net exceptional gain 
on the sale of the property of £2.9m (see Note 2(c)).

Contingent consideration
Renold (Hangzhou) Co Limited: China
A provision of £0.8m (2016: £0.7m) was established for the purchase of the outstanding 10% of the equity following the acquisition of  
90% of the equity interest in Renold (Hangzhou) Co Limited in the period ended 31 March 2008 and is due to be paid at the latest by  
15 June 2017.
Renold Tooth Chain, Germany
A provision of £1.1m was established on the acquisition of the Tooth Chain business in January 2016. The contingent consideration is 
expected to be paid over the first two years based upon achieving certain sales targets (up to a maximum of €1.5m). The first year target 
resulted in consideration of £0.5m (€0.6m) becoming payable. This was paid in April 2017. The reduction has been adjusted though goodwill 
(see Note 7). Management expect that the second year target will be met and therefore the amount has been provided in full.
17. Deferred tax
Accounting Policy
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised 
deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that 
future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current income tax 
assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable authority and taxable entity, or 
where deferred tax relates to different taxable entities, the tax authority permits the Group to make a single net payment.

During the year the Group has reported an adjusted operating profit of £14.5m (2016: £14.2m). The businesses in all jurisdictions where 
deferred tax assets have been recognised will, more likely than not, generate suitable profits based on approved management forecasts 
from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets amount to £26.2m (2016: £21.7m) arising from unrecognised losses of £20.7m (2016: £14.5m) 
(representing losses of £83.2m (2016: £52.3m)) and other timing differences of £5.5m (2016: £7.2m). Based on available evidence, it is 
considered unlikely that these amounts will be recovered within the foreseeable future. The significant majority of these losses are not 
subject to time limits.
18. Pensions
Accounting Policy
The Group operates a number of defined benefit plans around the world. The costs are calculated by independent actuaries using 
the projected unit credit method. Any past service costs resulting from enhanced benefits are recognised immediately in the income 
statement as a normal operating cost. Administration costs, including the Pensions Protection Levy, are charged to operating costs. 
However, plan asset management costs are included in the actual return on plan assets. 
Remeasurement gains and losses, comprising actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net 
interest), are recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Actuarial gains and losses arise when actual 
results differ from the assessment outcomes which are used to calculate defined benefit assets and liabilities at a particular point in time.
The defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet represents the net total for each plan of the present value of the 
benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of plan assets (for funded schemes) at the balance sheet date. If a plan 
is in surplus, the asset recognised is limited to the value of any amount expected to be recoverable by the Group by way of refunds or 
reduction in future contributions.
Under the Group’s UK pension scheme rules, any surplus arising on payment of agreed contributions is fully recoverable.
For defined contribution plans, the Group’s contributions are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due. Once 
the contributions have been paid, the Group has no further payment obligation.

Background information
In a defined benefit plan the members are guaranteed a certain level of benefits that depend on a number of factors such as service, salary 
and inflation. Defined benefit plans can be supported by an asset fund that will be used to pay member benefits or can be unfunded in 
which case obligations to members are paid by the sponsoring employer as they fall due. In a defined benefit plan, because the level and 
duration of the members’ benefits are uncertain, the risk of any increase or decrease in the cost of providing those benefits stays with 
the employer. This contrasts with a defined contribution plan where the employer’s only obligation is to pay the amount agreed in the 
employment contract into a pension plan.
Any change in the total expected cost of providing defined benefits can produce either funding shortfalls or surpluses. In the case of an 
expected funding shortfall, the Company is usually required to agree a deficit recovery plan which can vary from country to country. This 
is usually a combination of additional contributions to make good the shortfall over an agreed period of time sometimes referred to as 
a funding plan or a minimum funding requirement and can also include an allowance for future asset returns. In the case of a surplus, 
mechanisms are available in all of the Renold schemes to return that surplus to, or utilise it for the benefit of, the Group.
UK Pension Plans
The principal UK fund is the Renold Pension Scheme (RPS). The RPS was formed in June 2013 by the merger of three predecessor plans, all 
of which were already closed to future accrual and to new members. The RPS is a funded defined benefit plan with assets held in separate 
administered funds.
The Trustees are chaired by an independent professional trustee firm and have access to a range of professional advisers. The Trustee 
Board is required to consult the Company in matters such as investment policy and to obtain agreement to any amendments to benefits. 
The Company can make proposals to the Trustees on a range of issues but cannot insist on their adoption. The majority of Trustees are 
either independent or member nominated with Company nominated Trustees being in the minority. To mitigate the risk of potential 
conflicts of interests, no Directors of Renold plc are Trustees of the RPS.
The RPS is underpinned by a 25 year asset backed partnership structure (the Scottish Limited Partnership ‘SLP’). The partnership holds an 
intercompany loan from Renold International Holdings Limited, the holding company for most of the Group’s overseas trading companies. 
The capital rights to the assets in the SLP belong to Renold plc except in the event of a corporate insolvency of the pension scheme 
sponsor (Renold plc). The income rights in the SLP belong to the RPS. The loan generates interest income that provided an annual cash 
contribution of £2.7m to the pension fund in the current year, with annual increases linked to RPI plus 1.5% and capped at 5%. The income 
stream is used to fund deficit repair payments and the first £0.5m of annual administrative expenses (with the Company bearing the 
excess, if any arises). In the event that the RPS becomes fully funded on a buyout basis, the income stream will instead accrue to Renold 
plc. The SLP was put in place with the expectation that the period to recover the funding shortfall was 25 years from the time of merger 
in June 2013. The SLP therefore helps reduce the volatility in short-term cash funding by following an agreed payment plan over a longer 
period of time. The interest in the SLP held by the RPS is not reported as a plan asset in the Group’s consolidated financial statements as it 
is a non-transferable interest issued by the Group.
This arrangement replaced all other existing funding arrangements for the RPS. The SLP therefore represents the entirety of the 
committed cash element of the funding plan for the RPS. The funding plan also assumes an allowance for asset outperformance of 1.0% 
(that is, assets are expected to return an amount of 1.0% more than the discount rate applied to the liabilities). Separately to the SLP but 
put in place at the same time, the Group has also agreed that if adjusted operating profits reach £16.0m in any year following the year 
ended 31 March 2017, additional annual contributions of £1.0m will become payable (monthly in arrears) while profits remain above this 
level. Prior to the SLP, the contributions had been at a higher level. However, the Trustees agreed to lower contributions for longer under 
the SLP. The £1.0m increase matches the approximate £1.0m reduction agreed when the SLP was established. Finally, as part of the overall 
agreement, Renold plc is not constrained from paying a dividend, other than by normal legal considerations. Renold has agreed to make 
additional contributions equal to 25% of the value of any dividend paid in order to accelerate the deficit recovery plan. The deficit will be 
reduced as the cash contributions under the scheme are made, enhanced or offset by actual performance compared to asset returns and 
actuarial assumptions.
Following the implementation of the two medically underwritten insured buy-ins that fully de-risked approximately 25% of current 
pensioner liabilities implemented in the year ended 31 March 2016 the growth assets of the RPS represented over 90% of the remaining 
invested assets of the scheme. Following review, a revised investment strategy has been adopted by the Trustees (with the agreement of 
the Company)  which will redress the balance to circa 67% growth assets and 33% protection assets whilst further diversifying the risk with 
the introduction of multi-asset credit (MAC) and liability driven investments (LDI) to the portfolio. 
Total cash costs for UK deficit repair payments and UK administrative expenses in the period were £3.7m (2016: £3.4m). The current year 
figure includes the £2.7m noted above in connection with the SLP, £0.5m in respect of an additional payment from the Company towards 
the medically underwritten buy-ins and a further £0.5m in respect of the costs of other pension projects that were carried out or initiated 
during the year.

The latest triennial actuarial valuation of the RPS, with an effective date of 5 April 2016, was recently agreed. This process concluded that 
contributions to the scheme should continue unchanged and no additional contributions in excess of the previously agreed asset backed 
funding structure were deemed necessary. The next triennial valuation date will be 5 April 2019. 
Overseas Pension Plans
Germany
In Germany, in addition to participating in the state backed pension scheme, the Group operates an unfunded defined benefit scheme 
(no other Group company operates such a scheme). 'Unfunded' means that the scheme has no asset backing to pay benefits and instead 
the Group pays member benefits as they fall due. The scheme closed to new members on 1 April 1992. A German court confirmed that 
the pension scheme was properly closed to future accrual with effect from 31 March 2014. Following the acquisition of the Tooth Chain 
business in the year, the unfunded defined benefit scheme operated by that business transferred to our German subsidiary. The IAS 19 
liability at the acquisition date was £0.4m.
In aggregate, the two (2016: two) German pension schemes have a net liability of £25.5m (2016: £23.8m). The change in the net deficit is 
due to a reduction in the discount rate 1.9% (2016: 2.0%) and the adverse impact of the change in the Euro foreign exchange rate.
United States of America
In the US the Group operates three defined benefit pension schemes in the US Torque Transmission business. In 2015, one of the three 
schemes was formally terminated and members benefits secured in full. The remaining two schemes are closed to new members and 
one is also closed to future accrual. Only the hourly paid scheme remains open to future accrual. Funds that had been earmarked for the 
terminated scheme are now being used to accelerate making good the deficit in the second fully closed US scheme with a similar intention 
to terminate and secure member benefits in the next two years. The US Chain business operates a defined contribution scheme.
In aggregate, the two (2016: two) defined benefit schemes in the US have combined assets of £11.2m (2016: £8.8m) and liabilities of £15.0m 
(2016: £13.4m), giving a net deficit of £3.8m (2016: £4.6m). The change in the net deficit was due to an increase in the discount rate to 3.8% 
(2016: 3.6%) offset by the adverse impact of the change in the US Dollar foreign exchange rate.
Other overseas schemes
In aggregate the other overseas defined benefit schemes have combined assets of £2.4m (2016: £2.0m) and liabilities of £3.0m (2016: 
£2.7m) giving a net deficit of £0.6m (2016: net deficit of £0.7m).
Other overseas employees participate in a variety of different pension arrangements of the defined contribution or defined benefit type, 
funded in accordance with local practice.
The pension disclosures in the financial statements are based on the most recent actuarial valuations. Where material, these have been 
updated to the balance sheet date by qualified independent actuaries. The disclosures provided are presented on a weighted average basis 
where appropriate. Plan assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates.
The weighted average durations for the UK pension scheme is 15 years (2016: 15 years) and 14 years (2016: 14 years) for the German 
schemes. They can therefore be regarded as mature schemes.
Significant assumptions
The principal financial assumptions used to calculate plan liabilities as at 31 March 2017 are presented below. The assumptions adopted 
represent the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not 
necessarily be borne out in practice. The present values of the plans’ liabilities are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and 
are thus inherently uncertain.

The inflation assumption used for UK schemes is a blend of RPI and CPI as well as reflecting that members have the option to take a one-off increase in pension at 
retirement in exchange for surrendering future increases. Approximately 25% of members took this option.

The predominant defined benefit obligation for funded plans within the Group resides in the UK (£218.4m of the £236.4m Group obligation 
for funded plans). In addition to the assumptions shown previously, mortality assumptions have a significant bearing on the calculated 
obligation. The assumed life expectancy for the RPS members on retirement at age 65 is as follows:
2017 2016
Males
 Currently aged 45 21.2 21.4
 Currently aged 65 20.3 20.4
Females
 Currently aged 45 23.4 23.7
 Currently aged 65 22.3 22.6
The post-retirement mortality tables used for the UK plan are the S2PA series tables published by the UK actuarial profession with a 20% 
uplift in mortality reflecting scheme specific experience. The RPS experiences mortality significantly in excess of the national average. The 
mortality rates for the RPS are based on average year of birth for both non-pensioners and pensioners with an allowance for future annual 
improvements in life expectancy.
In Germany, the mortality expectations for the scheme are in line with the local national averages as is the case in the United States.
Sensitivity analysis on UK scheme:
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on plan liabilities
Discount rate Increase/decrease by 0.25% Decrease by £7.7m/increase by £8.7m
Rate of inflation Increase/decrease by 0.25% Increase by £5.0m/decrease by £4.6m
Rate of mortality Increase/decrease by 1 year
1
Increase by £10.3m/decrease by £10.5m

This is broadly equivalent to an increase in life expectancy of one year at age 65.
The market values of assets of the principal defined benefit plans of the Group, together with the present value of plan liabilities, are 
shown below. It should be noted that the market values of the plans’ assets are stated as at the Group’s year end and since it is not

The medically underwritten insurance policies are shown at a value that exactly matches the estimated associated insured liabilities. 
Equities are investments in quoted equities only. Hedge funds and diversified growth funds hold a range of assets which aim to deliver 
returns above those of bonds but at lower volatility than equities. The assets held materially reflect the underlying liabilities, in that lower 
risk assets such as gilts and bonds are deemed to be a match for pensioner liabilities whereas equities are deemed a better match for the 
liabilities associated with scheme members not yet in retirement.
Liability Driven Investments (LDI) are a portfolio of assets that are linked to the drivers of movements in pension liabilities such as inflation 
and interest rates. These are assets designed to deliver geared movements in the underlying liabilities as they reflect changes to inflation 
and interest rates.

The past service credit of £1.3m in the prior year arose in Germany following the confirmation that the pension scheme was properly 
closed to future accrual with effect from 31 March 2014. Also in the prior year, the £0.1m settlement loss relates to the liquidation of the 
Australian scheme when the net surplus was £0.1m. See Note 2(c) for further details.
The cost for the period of the various defined contribution schemes was £1.3m (2016: £1.3m) and was fully paid up.

deferred shares of 20p each (2016: 77,064,703). The deferred shares noted above have had no value or voting rights since the Rights 
Issue in late 2009 and it is intended to cancel these following approval at the 2017 AGM. The balance above will be transferred to a non-
distributable Capital Reserve at that time.
In July 2016, the Company issued 2,353,037 fully paid ordinary shares of 5p each (2016: nil) at a cost of £117,651.85 to its Employee Benefit 
Trust to facilitate the exercise of share options by employees across the Company.
20. Share-based payments
Accounting Policy
The Group operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for 
the grant of the options is calculated using a Black–Scholes pricing model and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period. The 
total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options or performance shares 
granted. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. 
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity 
over the remaining vesting period. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest except for awards where vesting is 
conditional upon market or non-vesting conditions which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting 
condition is satisfied provided that all other performance or service conditions are satisfied. The market-based conditions are linked to the 
market price of shares in the Company.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the 
cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense is recognised 
over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair 
value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification. No reduction is 
recognised if this difference is negative.

21. Reserves
The currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of financial statements of foreign 
operations and the proportion of the gains or losses on hedging instruments used to hedge against movements in net investments in 
foreign operations that are determined to be effective.
Other reserves record the portion of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge that is determined to be an  
effective hedge.
Cumulative goodwill written off directly to Group reserves at 31 March 2017 amounted to £3.5m (2016: £3.5m).
Included in retained earnings is an amount of £3.5m (net of tax) (2016: £5.4m) relating to the revaluation of freehold property that was 
undertaken at the date of IFRS adoption. The amount is not distributable until it is realised.
22. Operating lease obligations
Accounting Policy
Leases where a significant portion of the risk and reward of ownership is retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
The Group has entered into leases on commercial properties and plant and equipment. Minimum rental commitments under non-
cancellable operating leases at the year end are as follows:
2017 2016
Properties 
£m
Equipment
£m
Properties
£m

£m
Within one year 2.8 1.0 1.7 0.8
Between two and five years 8.3 2.5 6.5 2.5
Over five years 10.2 – 10.8 0.1
21.3 3.5 19.0 3.4
Certain of the leased properties have been sublet and the future minimum sublease payments expected to be received under non-
cancellable sublease agreements is £5.0m (2016: £2.7m).
An onerous lease provision of £3.2m (2016: £4.0m) (see Note 16) was established in 2014 following the closure of the Bredbury 
manufacturing facility. The lease expires in May 2030 at a rental cost of £0.8m per annum and is included in the analysis above. A 
significant proportion of this site is now sublet for a term of five years for a rent of £0.5m per annum. 
An additional onerous lease provision of £1.6m was established in the year following the sale of the Mulgrave manufacturing facility. The 
lease expires in March 2020 at a cost of £0.5m per annum.
23. Contingent liabilities and commitments
Performance guarantees given to third parties in respect of Group companies were £nil (2016: £nil).
Various UK Group companies have given guarantees to the merged UK pension scheme to cover the full cost of buying out the liabilities 
in the event that the sponsoring employer's defaulted on the agreed deficit repair plan. As one of the sponsoring employer's of the UK 
scheme is Renold plc, the continuing obligation is effectively unchanged and is to fully fund the member’s accrued benefits.

25. Financial instruments
Accounting Policy
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency 
and interest rate fluctuations. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative 
contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive 
and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar 
maturity profiles.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is formally designated 
and documented at its inception. This documentation identifies the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, 
the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured 
throughout its duration. Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and 
are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the reporting period for which 
they were designated.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:
 Æ Cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a 
recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction; or
 Æ Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.
There are no fair value hedges.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the income 
statement. The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing derivatives designated as hedging instruments depends on the 
nature of the hedging relationship, as follows:
(a) Cash flow hedges
For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive 
income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement. Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are 
transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects the income statement, such as when a forecast sale occurs.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred 
to the income statement. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its 
designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income remain in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs and are transferred to the income statement or to the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as 
above. If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to the income statement.
(b) Hedges of a net investment
Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, including a hedge of a monetary item that is accounted for as part of the net 
investment, are accounted for in a way similar to cash flow hedges. Gains or losses relating to the effective portion are recognised in 
other comprehensive income while any gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised in the income statement. On loss 
of control of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of any such gains or losses recognised directly in other comprehensive income is 
transferred to the income statement.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not stated at its fair value with changes in its 
fair value recognised in the income statement.
The Group’s 6% cumulative preference stock of £1 each ‘Preference Stock’ has been classified as a liability. Dividends payable are included 
within net finance costs.
These notes should be read in conjunction with the narrative disclosures in the Finance Director’s review on pages 34 to 39.

Foreign currency risk and sensitivity
As a result of the significant operations in the US and Europe, the Group’s balance sheet can be affected significantly by movements in the 
US Dollar/Sterling and Euro/Sterling exchange rates.
The following table demonstrates the impact of reasonably possible changes in the US Dollar (US$) (with all other variables held constant) 
on the Group’s result before tax (due to the effect of foreign exchange on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a different 
currency to the functional currency of operation) and the Group’s equity (due to the effect on other comprehensive income of changes in 
the fair value of forward exchange contracts and the effect of hedging borrowings). The impact of translating the net assets of foreign 
operations into Sterling is excluded from the sensitivity analysis.

The cash flow hedges of the expected future transactions in US Dollars and Euros were assessed to be highly effective. In the period £nil 
(2016: £nil) was transferred to operating costs in the income statement.
(b) Short-term receivables and payables
The carrying amount of short-term receivables and payables (being those with a remaining life of less than one year) is deemed to 
approximate to their fair value.
(c) Hedge of net investment in foreign entity
The Group has US Dollar denominated borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of the net investment in its subsidiaries in the US. 
The carrying value of the US Dollar borrowings at 31 March 2017 was £6.9m (2016: £6.1m). £0.9m of exchange loss (2016: £0.2m loss) on 
translation of the borrowings into Sterling is included as part of the hedging reserve movement in other comprehensive income as the 
hedge was deemed to be effective.

Floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates based on relevant national base rate equivalents, which can fluctuate on a daily 
basis. The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not 
subject to interest risk.
Interest rate risk
Exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s Sterling, US Dollar and Euro debt obligations.
Credit risk
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. It is the Group’s policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit 
terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that 
the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. The maximum exposure is the carrying amount as disclosed in Note 12. There are no 
significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents and certain 
derivative instruments, the Group’s exposure to credit risk has a maximum exposure equal to the carrying value of these instruments.

Fair value hierarchy
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or 
indirectly; and
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable financial 
market data.
As at 31 March 2017, the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value:

profiles.
(i) Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a satisfactory credit rating and capital ratios in 
order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the 
capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to the shareholders or issue new shares. No 
changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016.
The Group monitors capital using two gearing ratios, one of which is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt and the other is the 
ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA.
