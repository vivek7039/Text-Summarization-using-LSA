 All items are shown before amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
which, in 2017, was £0.1 million (2016: £0.2 million) as defined in the 
financial review and before exceptional costs which were £nil million 
(2016: £0.4 million).
AMS continues to progress as a leading international provider of high quality, high value, 
innovative and technologically advanced products for the surgical and advanced wound 
care markets. We are pleased to report another year of strong revenue growth, profit 
performance and cash generation. 
Our revenues increased 16% to £96.9 million (2016: £83.2 million), representing growth 
of 12% on a constant currency basis and our adjusted
7
 profit before tax increased by 
29% to £25.4 million (2016: £19.7 million) and our profit before tax increased by 32% 
to £25.3 million (2016: £19.1 million). The continued strong cash generation of the 
business has resulted in the Group ending the year with net cash of £62.5 million 
(2016: £51.1 million).
As reported at the half year, at the beginning of 2017 we reviewed our business 
structure and consolidated our Business Units from four to two. Our Branded Business 
Unit focuses on the distribution, marketing and innovation of all the Group’s branded 
products. Our OEM business focuses on the distribution, marketing and innovation of 
all the Group’s products that are supplied to our medical device partners and marketed 
under their brands. This new structure is designed to enhance focus and improve 
marketing efficiencies for the Group. We have restated our segmental prior year 
financials in line with this new reporting structure.
Good progress has been made with all of our brands. LiquiBand
®
 continues to do 
well in the US and we have gained a further 2% market share since we last reported to 
take our market share by volume to 26%. Revenue from our RESORBA
®
 brands grew 
steadily across all territories and has grown by 15% and by 6% at constant currency 
to £20.8 million (2016: £18.1 million), while ActivHeal
®
 grew by 4% to £6.3 million 
(2016: £6.0 million).
We were pleased to announce in October 2017 that we had agreed a patent out-
licensing agreement with Organogenisis for a collagen based wound dressing 
containing Polyhexamethylene Biguanide (“PHMB”). Under this agreement, we receive 
royalties from Organogenesis’ net sales in the US on the product. The agreement is in 
place for the life of the patent which expires in October 2026. 
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 0.75p per share, making a total dividend for 
the year of 1.10p per share, an increase of 20% (2016: 0.92p). If approved at the Annual 
General Meeting, this dividend will be paid on 15 June 2018 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 25 May 2018.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of our employees for their contributions 
during the past year. We would not have been able to achieve our strong performance 
without their commitment and effort. I would also like to thank our customers, 
suppliers, business partners and shareholders for their continued support in helping AMS 
achieve its goals.
We ensure that the Group is managed in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code as far as is reasonably practicable, although it is not a requirement 
for an AIM quoted company. The Board believes that effective corporate governance 
will assist in the delivery of sustainable shareholder value and safe-guard shareholders’ 
long-term interests.
AMS continues to be in robust financial health and we are continuing to grow our 
international footprint and scale. The Group is well positioned to increase investment 
in internal innovation and to actively pursue external opportunities in line with our  
long-term strategy and growth objectives.

Chief Executive’s Statement
I am pleased to report another strong set of results across the 
Group. Our revenue has increased 16% to £96.9 million and we have 
improved our adjusted
2
 profit before tax by 29% to £25.4 million 
and our reported profit before tax by 32% to £25.3 million 
(2016: £19.1 million).
Our strategy for growth remains unchanged. We continue to expand 
into new geographies, increase our distribution of surgical products 
through our direct sales forces, and enhance our product portfolio 
by developing high quality products that add value to patients and 
payors in our advanced woundcare and surgical markets.
As reported at the half year, we have streamlined our reporting 
structure and now operate under two Business Units: Branded 
and OEM.
Branded 
The Branded Business Unit reports the sales of all our own brands. 
Branded reported revenue was 22% higher at £55.2 million 
(2016: £45.4 million) and 16% higher at constant currency. 
LiquiBand
®
 topical adhesives 
LiquiBand
®
 is our range of medical adhesives based on 
cyanoacrylate, and is our largest brand with sales of £26.0 million, 
(2016: £19.3 million) up 35% on the prior year and 30% at 
constant currency. 
Our LiquiBand
®
 range of products utilises different formulations of 
cyanoacrylate in innovatively designed applicators. They are designed 
to meet the requirements of the clinician and to treat the full 
spectrum of wounds that they need to close and protect. They have 
several key attributes that compare favourably with the existing 
market leader, including wound closure strength, tensile strength, set 
time, surface area coverage and adhesive yield.
Sales in the US, which remains our largest market, increased by 47% 
to £18.2 million (2016: £12.4 million) at reported currency and by 
40% at constant currency. We access this market through distributors 
who target both hospitals and non hospitals, helping us to identify 
customers and convert opportunities into sales following surgeon 
evaluation. We support our partners with marketing and clinical data 
demonstrating the efficacy of our products. We continue to grow our 
volume market share which is now at 26%, up 2% from June 2017 
and 3% over the full year.

In the UK and Germany good progress has been made. 
Revenues have increased 12% to £5.3 million (2016: £4.7 million) 
and 10% at constant currency with new hospitals being accessed. 
In the EU and ROW, sales of LiquiBand
®
 increased by 19% to 
£2.5 million (2016: £2.1 million) at reported currency and 18% at 
constant currency. 
We are now targeting new geographic markets for LiquiBand
®
. 
Following on from establishing distribution agents in Asia, we have 
also identified opportunities for LiquiBand
®
 in a number of Central 
American markets and anticipate first sales in this region in 2018. 
Our primary focus for R&D is to extend our LiquiBand
®
 product range 
to compete in the growing market for combined glues and tape used 
for larger wound closure. We expect to receive approval to market 
this in the US around the end of 2018. 
Hernia Mesh Fixation device – LiquiBand
®
 Fix8™
LiquiBand
®
 Fix 8™ is used to hold hernia meshes in place within 
the body instead of tacks and staples. This accurate laparoscopic 
application of adhesive is expected to both reduce surgical 
complications and reduce the potential pain associated with the use 
of tacks and staples. It also provides the ability to attach mesh in areas 
where tacks and staples cannot be applied, helping to improve the 
patient experience and surgical outcomes.
As reported at the half year, sales growth of LiquiBand
®
 Fix8™ 
has been restricted due to design enhancements we have made 
following surgeon feedback. Further feedback has been received 
on the updated device and modifications have been completed. 
We have chosen not to actively promote the device while the 
modifications were ongoing, nevertheless sales increased by 3% 
to £1.7 million (2016: £1.7 million) and 1% at constant currency. 
We expect to see a return to sales growth this year.
At present, the device is approved for use within Europe and those 
markets that accept European approval standards. We have started 
the process to get LiquiBand
®
 Fix8™ approved in the US market. 
This necessitates a full Pre Market Approval (PMA) involving clinical 
trials with patient enrolment expected to start in mid 2018 and 
enrolment completing by the end of the year. We expect the total 
cost of completing the approval process will be around £3 million 
with the majority of the spend being incurred in 2018 and 2019. 
In R&D, we are also working on broadening the claims on the use of 
the device for hernia mesh fixation as well as for a number of other 
laparoscopic surgical applications and developing a device suitable 
for hernia mesh fixation in open surgery which we expect to launch 
in Europe in the first half of 2019. 
RESORBA
®
Our RESORBA
®
 branded products portfolio is comprised of a 
comprehensive range of sutures which are used to close wounds 
and a range of bio-surgical products that include collagens, cellulose 
and bone substitutes that can be used as haemostats or scaffolds 
for tissue growth. Sales of RESORBA
®
 products increased by 15% to 
£20.8 million (2016: £18.1 million) and by 6% at constant currency. 
Within this, sales of sutures increased by 15% to £13.0 million 
(2016: £11.3 million) and by 6% at constant currency and sales of  
bio-surgical products increased by 16% to £7.9 million 
(2016: £6.8 million) and by 8% at constant currency. 
During 2016, we renegotiated the supply agreement with an OEM 
partner for collagen products in order to go direct. We are pleased 
that we have started to sell these products into a number of 
new territories. 
Germany remains our largest market with £13.0 million of sales 
(2016: £12.0 million), up 8% on the prior year and up by 1% at 
constant currency while sales to markets outside Germany 
accessed by our distributors increased by 30% to £7.5 million 
(2016: £5.8 million) and 19% at constant currency. Our initiative to 
offer a range of dental sutures into the US market is developing 
and following launch in 2016, sales have increased to £0.3 million. 
The total US surgical suture market is estimated to be in excess of 
$1 billion and is dominated by a few major brands and provides a 
significant opportunity for the Group in the medium term.
We continue to access new markets, in particular Asia Pacific, and 
have recently hired a new sales manager to target Australasia for both 
our RESORBA
®
 and LiquiBand
®
 brand ranges. 
In R&D we continue to work on preparing a range of different 
antibiotics that can be incorporated in our bio-surgical products. 
We expect to file for European approval in the second half of 2018.
ActivHeal
®
ActivHeal
®
 is our range of high quality woundcare dressings 
specifically designed to offer the NHS significant cost savings 
without compromising on clinical outcomes or patient care. Sales of 
ActivHeal
®
 increased by 4% to £6.3 million (2015: £6.0 million), 
reversing the decline that was reported in 2016, however the market 
remains difficult with increasing price pressure becoming evident. 
The Group has enhanced its education and marketing materials 
as well as broadened its product range with our antimicrobial and 
atraumatic foam dressing ranges. 
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2017 06 OEM
Our OEM business supports our partners with a multi-product 
portfolio of advanced woundcare products and bulk materials. 
We have been working with many of the world’s major wound care 
companies for a number of years providing manufacturing services to 
supply their woundcare dressings, new products they can incorporate 
into their portfolio of brands, as well as regulatory assistance in 
obtaining product approvals in overseas markets. Revenue increased 
10% to £41.7 million (2016: £37.8 million) and increased 8% at 
constant currency. 
A key driver for this Business Unit is in supplying products that 
incorporate antimicrobials. Sales of our antimicrobial dressings 
increased by 11% to £19.4 million (2016: £17.5 million), and by 9% at 
constant currency. Within this, silver alginate products grew by 12% 
to £18.0 million (2016: £16.2 million) and by 9% at constant currency 
while the Polyhexamethylene Biguanide (PHMB) foam range, which 
was launched in 2016 into Europe, increased 2% at reported and 
constant currency. 
PHMB is an antimicrobial which is effective against several bacteria 
including Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 
Escherichia coli (E.coli). Although we received approval to market 
PHMB foam into the US in 2017, we deferred a launch until we could 
market these products with extended claims. We expect to obtain 
these approvals in 2018.
Sales of our non-antimicrobial foams were down 16% at reported 
currency to £7.4 million (2016: £8.8 million) and by 20% at constant 
currency. Sales were impacted by the pipeline fill of our atraumatic 
foam launches in 2016, which we estimate to have been around 
£1 million. We also had some issues caused by a change of raw 
material from one of our suppliers which interrupted our ability to 
promote part of our more established range of products. These issues 
are now resolved. Sales of our other technologies, which include 
alginates and gels, increased 7% at reported currency to £11.8 million 
(2016: £11.0 million) and by 5% at constant currency.
In October 2017 we agreed an out-licensing agreement with 
Organogenesis Inc., a commercial leader in regenerative medicine 
focused on advanced woundcare and surgical biologics, on a U.S. 
patent for a collagen-based wound dressing containing PHMB.
Under the terms of the agreement, Organogenesis has been granted 
an exclusive license in the United States to the patent. In exchange 
for this, we have recognised £2.5 million from royalties, and will 
receive a minimum royalty of $1 million for each of the financial 
years ending 31 December 2018 and 2019. This is part of an ongoing 
royalty stream that will be payable to AMS on the net sales of the 
Licensed Product for the life of the patent. The patent is due to expire 
in October 2026.
The Group’s ability to out-license our patented technologies is an 
endorsement of the quality of our innovation and we are pleased to 
be working with a partner that is using the AMS patent to access the 
US market so effectively. 
In the latter part of 2017, we noted that a number of our partners have 
reported a slowdown in the European advanced woundcare market. 
We continue, however, to believe in our medium and long term 
prospects in this market.
In R&D, we continue to work on extending our advanced woundcare 
portfolio with focus on our antimicrobial range, improving the 
absorbancy of dressings and combining a number of materials to 
enhance product performance. We are developing a range of surgical 
dressings for which we are expecting to obtain approval in mid 2018 
for the US market. We are also expecting to receive approval to 
market an antimicrobial high performance dressing in the US before 
the end of 2018.

Operations and regulatory
With the business continuing to show strong organic growth, we 
have made investments in our converting capability at our Etten Leur 
site, as well as improving our packaging capability in Nuremberg 
which is expected to complete in 2018. 
As a result of the continued success of our medical adhesives 
business, we have also made plans to extend the capacity of the 
Plymouth facility. This will be a significant project for us and we 
estimate that the spend will be around £4 million and will take 
around three years. It will provide us with the capability to increase 
production of our existing product range as well as allowing us 
the capacity to manufacture new products such as the open 
hernia device. 
Following the FDA inspection of our Winsford site in June 2016, 
our Plymouth facility was inspected by the FDA in April 2017. 
We were very pleased with the outcome of this audit with no non-
conformances raised. 
The new European Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) entered into 
force on 25 May 2017, marking the start of the transition period 
for manufacturers selling medical devices into Europe. The MDR, 
which replaces the Medical Devices Directive (MDD) has a transition 
period of three years and manufacturers have this transition period 
to update their technical documentation and processes to meet the 
new requirements. The MDR brings more scrutiny on product safety 
and performance and stricter requirements on clinical evaluation 
and post-market clinical follow up. Our notified body, BSI, is already 
adopting the new standard and we are working with our OEM 
partners to ensure that we meet the new requirements. We anticipate 
that, although there will be some additional costs associated with 
meeting the new requirements, overall, the tighter regulatory 
standards should prove beneficial for the Group in the longer term.
Our implementation of Oracle ERP in Germany was successfully 
completed at the end of September. This will bring benefits 
from better availability of information and enhanced controls. 
This completes our major ERP conversions across the Group, 
although ongoing improvements to systems will continue. 
Acquisitions strategy
The Group is actively looking for businesses that meet its acquisition 
strategy of:
 e licensing or acquiring technology that allows us to leverage our 
global OEM customer base or branded routes to market;
 e licensing or acquiring additional brands within woundcare, wound 
closure or surgical setting that complement our existing range; and
 e geographic expansion through acquiring surgically focused 
companies with strong direct sales capability and ownership of 
complementary products.
We have an internal team working with advisors to identify, appraise 
and progress acquisition opportunities. 
The UK and the European Union 
To date, there has been no day-to-day operational impact of the 
referendum vote to leave the European Union, other than changes 
to currency exchange rates. In preparation, the Group has submitted 
its application to obtain Authorised Economic Operator status for its 
UK trading entities and expects to achieve this designation by the end 
of the year. With its footprint in mainland Europe, the Group is well 
positioned to deal with the uncertain outcome of the UK negotiations 
with the EU, moving activities into jurisdictions that are beneficial to 
the business.
Our culture
As a Group that is highly dependent on the innovation and creativity 
of our employees for our future growth and success, it is important 
that we have a culture and set of values that is understood and 
embraced across the business. We have adopted the business motto 
of ‘The AMS Care, Fair, Dare approach’ to summarise our culture, 
underpin our values, and to deliver results, building a sustainable 
future for our business. Under this motto, we have defined the 
principles and expectations of how we will operate together to 
deliver success. We have run workshops across all our sites and have 
responded to feedback about how we can improve the Care, Fair, 
Dare ethos in the workplace. We are now embodying these attitudes 
into our objectives and appraisal process. 
We recognise the importance of our people to the Group and that 
it is only by their effective engagement that we will continue to be 
successful. We value their commitment and determination to achieve 
and deliver good results. Our working environment encourages 
openness, teamwork, an understanding of others’ needs and the 
ability ‘to make a difference’. We continue to develop the talent 
at AMS by training and by providing a place to work where our 
employees feel valued, incentivised and fulfilled.
Summary and outlook
2017 has seen another good performance by the Group. T rading in 
the current financial year has begun well and is in line with the 
Board’s expectations. With our increasing portfolio of products,

LiquiBand
®
The LiquiBand
®
 range of products has been developed to provide 
innovative solutions to close wounds and minimise adverse surgical 
outcomes. Our products have been uniquely designed to meet 
the needs of clinicians and patients for safe, secure and effective 
wound closure.
Our LiquiBand
®
 technologies are developed and marketed for use 
in the emergency room, operating theatres and extended care 
environments. Through our expertise in cyanoacrylate technology we 
have developed a range of medical grade adhesive devices that meet 
specific clinical needs and deliver substantial benefits to patients. 
Our adhesive products are based on two main formulations; octyl 
and butyl. Octyl cyanoacrylate topical skin adhesives provide durable 
and flexible wound closure, whilst butyl cyanoacrylate adhesives 
provide high strength with a fast setting time. We are able to supply 
products based on each formulation as well as blends of both.
Wound closure using LiquiBand
®
 topical skin adhesives provides 
the patient with an enhanced experience over conventional wound 
closure methods. Cyanoacrylate skin adhesives allow non traumatic 
closure of wounds and do not require removal as they will naturally 
slough off the skin as part of the natural wound healing process. 
Cyanoacrylate skin adhesives can provide a water resistant and 
microbial barrier adding an extra level of security to the closed wound 
and eliminating the need for secondary dressings.

Key Benefits:
The LiquiBand
® 
family of topical skin adhesive products are provided 
in a range of different applicators to meet a variety of surgical needs 
and preferences. These include various configurations of adhesive 
volume, applicator design and the addition of wings to assist in device 
activation. The applicators also incorporate different tip designs 
such as a foam dome to provide broad application or a thin cannula 
shaped tip to provide controlled and precise adhesive placement in a 
more enclosed application.
We also sell LiquiBand
®
 into the OR in the UK and Germany where 
it is used to make the final topical skin closure following the surgical 
procedure. LiquiBand
®
 is also promoted and supported by our 
distributors throughout the rest of the world.

 Fix8™
Our LiquiBand
®
 Fix8™ device is a safe and effective device that 
secures implantable mesh to underlying tissues for laparoscopic 
hernia repair. 
LiquiBand
®
 Fix8™ is easy to use and allows precise and 
controlled application of fast setting internal use adhesive. 
The cyanoacrylate adhesive anchors provide non-traumatic 
fixation of the hernia mesh, avoiding the need for the metal or 
synthetic tackers used in traditional hernia repair procedures. 
The risk of post-operative complications caused by standard 
tackers is greatly reduced, and a higher level of patient comfort 
is reported.
The key features are:
 e Strong and secure mesh fixation
 e Precise and controlled delivery
 e Fast set time (≤10 sec)
 e No tissue penetration
 e No mechanical trauma
 e Non sticking/atraumatic applicator tip
 e Easy to use
 e Mesh fixation at multiple angles
Development work on an open hernia mesh fixation device is 
ongoing and we expect to launch in the second half of 2018.

Creating quality outcomes through 
our innovation
“LiquiBand
®
 Fix8™ has revolutionised my 
practice with regard to Laparoscopic hernia 
surgery. In transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) 
inguinal repair it has brought a precision and 
control to fixation and peritoneal closure which 
would be difficult to better. This has brought 
significant benefits to patients in reducing 
postoperative pain, allowing early recovery, and 
reducing the risk of adverse events.
In Laparoscopic intraperitoneal onlay mesh 
repair (IPOM) Incisional hernia repair, it has 
allowed me to extend the range of meshes 
used – allowing excellent fixation of biologic 
mesh in complex patients, as well as synthetic 
mesh fixation. LiquiBand
®
 Fix8™ is a significant 
advance in Laparoscopic Hernia Surgery.”

RESORBA
®
Our RESORBA
®
 branded products portfolio comprises of a 
comprehensive range of sutures which are used to close wounds and 
a range of bio-surgical products that can be used as haemostats and 
scaffolds for tissue growth.
Our suture range is extensive and includes both absorbable and non-
absorbable sutures, with mono and multifilament threads, and a wide 
range of needle shapes and sizes. It includes several brands such as 
CAPROLON
®
, GLYCOLON
®
, MOPYLEN
®
 and RESOPREN
®
 that are 
sold into hospitals, private practices and to oral surgeons. 
Our range of RESORBA
®
 biosurgical products includes COLLAGEN-
resorb, Resodura
®
 and GENTA-COLL
®
. The latter is a very pure 
collagen that includes the antibiotic gentamicin for use in sites where 
there is a high risk of infection. Combining the suture and collagen 
technologies, RESORBA
®
 has developed products and brands that 
are particularly applicable to the oral surgery market, e.g. PARASORB
®
 
Sombrero
®
 is a collagen cone used for dental surgery.
The RESORBA
®
 suture and collagen ranges are sold throughout 
Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Approval to market the majority of 
our suture range in the US was received in November 2015 and the 
first sales of sutures for dental applications were achieved in 2016. 
The US is a significant opportunity for the Group in the medium term. 
The total US surgical suture market is estimated to be in excess of 
$1 billion in size and is dominated by a few major brands.
During 2016 we renegotiated an OEM supply agreement for 
collagen products in global territories, including RESODURA
®
 and 
GENTA-COLL
®
. This has enabled us to start selling our gentamyacin 
loade collagens directly in the EU and those markets that accept 
CE approvals.

Unlike many of our competitors we offer a full turnkey solution 
encompassing design, development, manufacture and distribution 
service supported by regulatory, clinical and marketing professionals.
We partner with many of the world’s leading healthcare companies, 
supplying them with finished packed products which are provided 
under their own brand. Our technologies include foams, fibres, 
collagens, hydrogels and hydrocolloids.
We are also able to add antimicrobials such as silver and PHMB to our 
platform technologies.
We support our partners to access new markets through our in-
house regulatory expertise with strong marketing collateral backed by 
clinical evidence.
Following approval in 2015, we launched our PHMB foam dressing 
into Europe in 2016. PHMB is an antimicrobial effective against several 
bacteria including, amongst others, Staphylococcus Aureus including 
the methicillin resistant type, (MRSA) and Escherichia Coli (E-Coli).
This dressing may be used throughout the healing process on 
moderate to heavily exuding chronic and acute wounds that are 
infected or are at risk of infection, as well as on pressure ulcers,  
leg and foot ulcers, diabetic ulcers and surgical wounds.
In 2017 we expanded our product offering by obtaining European 
approval for our Foam Lite Non-Border dressing and our High 
Performance Dressing. In 2018 we intend to extend our Foam Lite 
range further with a Foam Lite Border variant. 
We continue to work on extending our advanced woundcare 
portfolio with focus on extending our antimicrobial range, improving 
the absorption capacity of our dressings and combining a number 
of materials to enhance product performance. We are developing a 
surgical range of dressings for the US market for which we expect to 
receive approval in 2018.
The Business Unit also manufactures rollstock foam. Our medical 
grade hydrophilic polyurethane foam is characterised by its ultrasoft, 
open-pored, medium density structure. It is very conformable 
and offers a high rate of absorbancy with good lateral control and 
fluid uptake.
We also supply film membranes with excellent moisture vapour 
transmission rates, as well as film-foam membranes that have 
applications in scar reduction.

The management of pressure damage upon removal of full leg 
cast following fracture to the right patella:
“ The Silicone Non-Border dressings were applied to the category 
3 pressure ulcer to assist in the management of exudate, prevent 
adherence and trauma at dressing changes along with providing 
a moist wound environment to aid wound healing. Reducing the 
potential mechanism for pain at dressing changes helped 
promote patient comfort and improve clinical outcomes.
The dressing was able to provide effective exudate handling as 
no signs of maceration were visible to the peri wound area, whilst 
maintaining a moist wound environment and promoting wound 
progression as the wound reduced in size and showed areas of 
new epithelial tissue. The Silicone foam dressing was easy to apply 
and remove and was atraumatic to the patient and was able to 
aid in the management of friable, vulnerable traumatic damaged 
tissue, and the achievement of satisfactory clinical outcomes for 
both the patient and the clinician.”

Creating quality outcomes
and good financial performance
Summary
The Group has delivered another year of strong financial 
performance, with revenue increasing by 16%, or 12% at constant 
currency, to £96.9 million (2016: £83.2 million) and with improving 
operating margins.
The Group has elected to adopt IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers) in 2017, which has no impact on profit or cash flow 
but results in fee income of £0.7 million (2016: £0.6 million) being 
recorded as Revenue rather than as Other Income.
During the year, the Group streamlined into two Business Units, to 
enhance commercial focus and improve marketing efficiencies.
All prior year values have been restated to reflect IFRS 15 adoption 
and the Business Unit restructure.
The Group uses alternative performance measures such as adjusted 
operating margin, adjusted profit before tax, net operating cash flow 
pre-exceptional items, and revenue growth at constant currency, to 
allow the users of the accounts to gain a clearer understanding of 
performance, allowing the impacts of amortisation, exceptional items 
and exchange rate volatility to be separately identified. The Group 
did not incur any exceptional costs in the year (2016: £0.4 million) 
and amortisation of acquired intangible assets was £0.1 million in the 
period (2016: £0.2 million). 
To aid comparison, the Group’s Adjusted Income Statement is 
summarised in Table 1 below.
Currency movements impacted revenues favourably by 
approximately £3.4 million during the year.

Mary G Tavener
Chief Financial Officer
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2017 22 Adjusted operating profit before exceptional items increased 
by 29% to £25.4 million (2016: £19.7 million) and adjusted 
operating margin increased by 250 bps to 26.2% (2016: 23.7%). 
Administration costs excluding exceptional items increased by 17% 
to £32.0m (2016: £27.3 million) due to currency movements and 
further investment in selling and marketing, particularly to support 
the Branded Business Unit. The Group incurred £3.0 million of gross 
R&D spend in the year (2016: £2.6 million), representing 3.1% of sales 
(2016: 3.1%). 
Profit before tax for the year was 32% higher at £25.3 million 
(2016: £19.1 million). 
The Group’s effective tax rate increased to 20.4% (2016: 17.9%) mainly 
due to being required to move to the less favourable, large company 
RDEC scheme in 2017. This effective tax rate reflects the blended 
tax rates in the countries in which we operate and, for the UK, 
includes the tax relief associated with the patent box scheme and the 
utilisation of residual previously unrecognised UK tax losses.
A reconciliation between the weighted average Group tax rate and 
the Group’s effective rate is summarised in Table 2 above.
Earnings (excluding amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
and before exceptional items) increased by 24% to £20.3 million 
(2016: £16.3 million), resulting in a 23% increase in adjusted basic 
earnings per share to 9.58p (2016: 7.77p) and a 23% increase in 
adjusted diluted earnings per share to 9.46p (2016: 7.66p). 
Profit after tax increased by 28% to £20.1 million (2016: £15.7 million), 
resulting in a 24% increase in basic earnings per share to 9.52p 
(2016: 7.65p) and a 27% increase in diluted earnings per share to 
9.39p (2016: 7.38p).
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 0.75p per share, to be 
paid on 15 June 2018 to shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 25 May 2018. This follows the interim dividend of 0.35p 
per share paid on 27 October 2017 and would, if approved, make 
a total dividend for the year of 1.10p per share (2016: 0.92p), a 20% 
increase on 2016.
The operational performance of the Business Units is shown in Table 
3 below. The adjusted profit from operations and the adjusted margin 
are shown after excluding amortisation of acquired intangibles.
Branded
The adjusted operating margin of the Branded Business Unit 
increased to 26.2% (2016: 25.4%), supported by sales growth and sales 
mix. Operating costs increased, especially sales, marketing, R&D and 
regulatory costs, to continue to support ongoing growth. 
OEM 
The adjusted operating margin of the OEM Business Unit increased 
to 27.3% (2016: 23.0%), mainly due to the out-licensing agreement of 
wound dressings containing Collagen and PHMB, which generated a 
£2.5 million royalty income in the year.
Geographic breakdown of revenues
The geographic breakdown of Group revenues in 2017 is shown in 
Table 4 below:
Approximately 90% of our US sales are invoiced in US Dollars and 
approximately 60% of our sales to mainland Europe are invoiced in 
Euros. The Group hedges significant currency transaction exposure 
by using forward contracts and options and aims to have at least 70% 
of its estimated transactional exposure for the next twelve months 
hedged. The Group estimates that a 10% movement in the £:US$ or 
£:Euro exchange rate will impact Sterling revenues by approximately 
3.3% and 2.6% respectively and in the absence of any hedging this 
would have an impact on profit of 2.7% and 0.3%.

23 Cash flows
Table 5 below summarises the Group’s cash flows. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased by 24% to £29.5 million 
(2016: £23.7 million).
Working capital increased during the year, mainly due to the higher 
value of trade receivables, which was caused by sales phasing and 
royalties, with debtor days unchanged at 41 days (2016: 41 days). 
T rade payable days reduced to 27 days (2016: 33 days) and months 
of supply of inventory held across the Group reduced to 4.2 months 
(2016: 4.4 months).
The Group generated net cash from operating activities of 
£21.5 million (2016: £21.9 million).
In the year, we invested £4.5 million in capital equipment, software 
and capitalised R&D (2016: £2.5 million), including investment 
in new packaging machines, ERP software and internally 
developed products.
Cash outflow relating to taxation increased sharply to £4.5 million 
(2016: £2.1 million) with historical losses and related deferred tax 
balances now fully used up.
The Group generated a free cash flow of £12.5 million in the year 
(2016: £17.3 million). The conversion of adjusted operating profit 
into free cash flow was 49% (2016: 88%). This was mainly due 
to investment in the Business Units, working capital outflow and 
increased taxation.
The Group paid its final dividend for the year ended 31 December 
2016 of £1.3 million on 16 June 2017 (2016: for the year ending 
2015, £1.2 million), and its interim dividend for the six months ended 
30 June 2017 of £0.7 million (2016: £0.6 million) on 27 October 2017. 
The Group has a £30 million, multi-currency credit facility with a 
£20 million accordion option, provided jointly by HSBC and The 
Royal Bank of Scotland in place until December 2019. It is unsecured 
and has not been drawn down. This facility carries an annual interest 
rate of LIBOR or EURIBOR plus a margin that varies between 0.65% 
and 1.75% depending on the Group’s net debt to EBITDA ratio.
At the end of the period, the Group had net cash of £62.5 million 
(2016: £51.1 million). The movement in net cash from the start of the 
year to net cash at the end of the year is reconciled in Table 6 below:

Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2017 24 Our Key Performance Indicators
Creating quality outcomes
by measuring our performance
Why we measure it
We see revenue growth as a contributing factor to our aim of providing long-
term value for our shareholders.
Progress made in the year
Revenue has increased by 16% to £96.9 million (2016: £83.2 million) 
in 2017 and by 12% on a constant currency basis to £96.9 million 
(2016: £83.2 million). 
Why we measure it
We see OTIF as a measure of providing excellent service to our customers.
Progress made in the year
OTIF increased to 93% (2016: 90%), which is higher than 2016, but below 
the average Group OTIF over the previous four years. OTIF was impacted by 
suture availability in the first half of 2017, which was addressed by increased 
production in the second half of 2017. It was also impacted by a change of a 
raw material by one of our suppliers which has now been resolved.
Why we measure it
We see operating margin as important to ensure the sustainability of our 
business and to our aim of providing long-term value for our shareholders.
Progress made in the year
Our operating margin declined in 2016 as a result of launching some new 
products where manufacturing processes were new and not fully efficient. 
In 2017, these effects were negated. Operating margin has also benefitted 
from the fee income from Organogenesis.
Why we measure it
We see EPS as an important factor to our aim of providing value for 
our shareholders.
Progress made in the year
Adjusted diluted earnings per share has increased by 23% to 9.46p 
(2016: 7.66p).

25 Creating quality outcomes
by ensuring that our business is conducted  
in a responsible manner
Employees
At AMS we focus on creating an engaging place to work where 
employees are able to develop and are challenged to achieve both 
their ambitions and the long-term strategic goals of the business. 
With over 650 employees globally, AMS is focused on retaining and 
attracting the right calibre of people and providing an environment 
where individuals can deliver to the best of their capabilities. 
We recognise the importance of our people and that it is only by their 
effective engagement that we will continue to be highly successful. 
We value their commitment and determination to achieve and deliver 
good results. Our working environment encourages openness, 
teamwork, an understanding of others’ needs and the ability ‘to make 
a difference’.
We develop the talent at AMS by training with programmes such 
as the Management Development Programme and principles of 
Lean Manufacturing, and by providing a place to work where our 
employees feel valued, incentivised and fulfilled. We continue 
to support a number of apprenticeship schemes and graduate 
recruitments across the Group and intend to expand the number  
of schemes we operate in 2018.
AMS promotes communication with employees who are encouraged 
to put forward their views to the Company through both our 
monthly briefing meetings and also through our employee surveys. 
Employees are encouraged to participate in suggesting and 
implementing improvements across the Group. 
We support a number of apprenticeship schemes and graduate 
recruitment across the Group and intend to increase the number 
of opportunities offered under these schemes in 2018.
Employee Diversity
We are committed to actively encouraging a more inclusive and 
diverse workplace and look for opportunities to reinforce this where 
appropriate, although we continue to recruit on merit. The Group is 
committed to eliminating all forms of discrimination and giving fair 
and equal treatment to all employees and job applicants in terms of 
recruitment, pay conditions, promotions, training and all employment 
matters regardless of their age, disability, race, sex, sexual orientation, 
marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, gender 
reassignment, religion or belief. The female representation on the 
Board, Senior Management Team and across the Group at the year-
end is shown here:
We continually review our business 
practices to ensure that our 
business operates in a responsible 
manner with respect to Employees, 
Ethical Standards, Health, Safety,

The Advanced Medical Solutions’ ‘Care Fair Dare’ Approach
Culture
AMS is highly dependent on the innovation and creativity of our 
employees for our future growth and success. It is important that  
we have a culture and set of values that are clearly understood across 
the business, and that employees embrace. We aim to operate to the 
highest ethical standards. We have adopted the business motto of 
‘AMS Care, Fair, Dare’ to summarise our culture, underpin our values, 
and to deliver results, building a sustainable future for our business. 
Under this motto, we have defined the principles and expectations 
of how we will operate together to deliver success as the Company 
continues to grow. Care, Fair, Dare.
Throughout 2017, we ran a series of work shops and communications 
with our employees to embed our Care, Fair, Dare culture. We have 
listened to the feedback which has been received and developed our 
principles and expectations. These will now form part of our appraisal 
system and recruitment of potential new employees.
Ethical Standards
We recognise the importance of operating a business in an 
ethical manner.
AMS has set appropriate standards and policies to uphold all laws 
relevant to prevention of bribery and corruption in all jurisdictions 
in which we operate. The Group also has in place policies and 
procedures covering Gifts and Hospitality, Whistleblowing, the 
Modern Slavery Act, the Market Abuse Regulations, General Data 
Protection Regulations, the Criminal Finance Act and Equality.
AMS has introduced compulsory Ethics T raining which all Group 
employees must complete to reinforce their understanding of the 
policies in place.

27 Supply Chain
Our Sourcing Policy requires suppliers to confirm they engage in 
ethical treatment of employees and observe prevailing laws in relation 
to other ethical issues, and ensures that suppliers:
 e Do not employ any forced, bonded or involuntary labour;
 e Do not use child labour;
 e Provide safe and hygienic working conditions;
 e Take adequate steps to prevent accidents and injury to health 
arising out of, associated with, or occurring in the course 
of employment;
 e Pay wages and benefits and apply working hours for a standard 
working week that are no less than the applicable minimum 
national legal standard; 
 e Do not discriminate on grounds of gender, age, religion, political 
affiliation or sexual orientation;
 e Do not permit harsh or inhumane treatment of its employees;
 e Do not supply equipment used in the unethical treatment 
of individuals;
 e Do not supply or trade in any banned or proscribed substances or 
materials in breach of the prevailing laws; 
 e Do not engage in practices that amount to bribery; and
 e Respect and seek to avoid any unlawful infringement of the 
intellectual property rights of third parties.
Health, Safety and Environment
The Health and Safety of our staff, visitors to our facilities, and those 
who carry out work on our behalf, is of the utmost importance to 
us. Identifying and complying with applicable legislation underpins 
our Health and Safety activities and improvement initiatives. 
The Board provides Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) 
leadership and the Chief Executive Officer has primary responsibility 
for setting the principles. The Chief Financial Officer, supported 
by the Group Operations Director, ensures adequate resource is 
available to support operational health, safety and environmental 
improvement plans.
We have established HSE Committees at each site which meet 
monthly. These Committees report monthly to the Senior 
Management Team and to the Board. We focus on the prevention 
of accidents and incidents through proactive reporting of 
potential hazards.
Over the last 12 months we have focused our resources to 
improve the level of accountability and expectation for continuous 
improvement in Health and Safety. Initiatives to improve involvement 
and accountability will continue over the foreseeable future to help us 
to further reduce our accident potential. 
Safety Performance 2017
Our All Injury Rate (AIR) was 3.1 in 2017 and fell from 5.4 in 2016. It has 
been below the target of 6.0 over the past 4 years. We endeavour to 
take proactive initiatives to ensure our AIR remains below our target. 
Our AIR is measured as follows:
AIR =  Total number of injuries x 100,000

Corporate Social Responsibility continued Environment
It is the Group’s policy to abide by all laws, directives and regulations 
relevant to its field of operations and to act in a manner so as to 
minimise the effects of our operations on the environment. 
As AMS has operations across a number of countries, local 
management drives environmental performance. Specific, site-level 
objectives are established to ensure compliance with local legislative 
and external management system requirements. AMS uses a variety 
of indicators to monitor environmental performance.
Community
We are committed to supporting and having a positive interaction 
with our local communities and encouraging our employees, families 
and friends to participate where possible.
AMS sponsors a number of sports charities and clubs in the area. 
We have sponsored the annual Pie & Peas 5 mile race for four years, 
which is organised by Vale Royal A.C., the local athletics club based in 
Winsford, Cheshire. As well as sponsoring this local race, employees 
are encouraged to participate in pre-race training programmes to 
foster employee well being as well as enjoying good-humoured 
rivalry. AMS aims to promote participation in sports and exercise so as 
to encourage healthy lifestyles.
In 2018 we will be the main sponsor for the England Athletics 5k 
Road Championships, a national event that is being held in a local 
Cheshire village.
We also sponsor a number of local football clubs and school sports 
teams including our local ladies football club, Witton Albion Ladies 
FC, who receive no other funding and are coached by one of our 
employees in their spare time. We sponsor a local junior rugby 
team (Crewe and Nantwich RUFC Junior Colts) and a local school, 
Sandbach School, to go on rugby and hockey tours to Canada, as 
well as an Under 13’s girls football team, the ‘Runcorn Limets’ which is 
coached by one of our employees. 
On an individual level, one of our employees was part of a team that 
participated in the Open Tae Kwon Do European Championships in 
Poland in June 2017. AMS contributed financially towards her cost of 
participating in this event with Gold, Silver and Bronze medals being 
achieved. We will continue to support her in the coming years.
In 2018 AMS will be the main sponsor of the St Luke’s Hospice 
Midnight Walk, which will be held on the streets of Crewe and 
Nantwich in June. St Luke’s Cheshire Hospice has been providing 
palliative care to local people, supporting them in ways beyond the 
scope and funding of the NHS. We will be supporting this event 
through employee participation and marshalling.
We are involved with some international 
charities. We sponsor a number of children 
in Africa and Asia through Plan International, 
a charity that promotes child rights and 
aims to end child poverty.
We intend to continue to provide ongoing 
support to these and other events.

29 Creating quality outcomes
by managing risk
An effective and successful risk management process balances risk 
and reward and is dependent on the judgement of the likelihood and 
impact of the risk involved. The Board has overall responsibility for 
ensuring there is an effective risk management framework, which 
underpins our business model.
The Business Units, Senior Management Team (SMT), Audit 
Committee and Board review risks throughout the year. These risks 
are documented in the Risk Register which is formally reviewed 
by the SMT, Internal Audit and the Board twice annually. The plans 
and actions assigned to the Executive Directors and SMT members 
are reviewed to ensure progress is being made with risk and 
mitigation plans.
We believe that the policies, procedures and monitoring systems that 
are in place are sufficient to effectively manage the risks faced by 
our business.
Risk and uncertainty are an inherent 
part of doing business and could have 
an impact on our business, brands, 
assets, revenue, profits, liquidity 
and capital resources. To meet our 
strategic objectives, build shareholder 
value and promote our stakeholders’ 
interests, we must manage this risk.

Risk Management Identifying Risks
A robust methodology is used to identify key risks across the 
Group; in Business Units, operations and during projects. This is an 
ongoing process.
Analysing Risks
Once identified, the process will evaluate identified risks to establish 
root causes, financial and non-financial impacts and likelihood of 
occurrence. We use a scoring system to assess the likelihood of a 
risk materialising and the potential financial impact on the Group. 
The risks are prioritised in terms of severity based on the scoring and 
a mitigation plan is prepared to reduce the risk. Once controls and 
mitigating factors are considered, the risk is reassessed and re-scored 
(mitigated score) to ascertain the net exposure.
Managing Risk
The SMT, Internal Audit and the Board review the Risk Register 
formally at least twice a year, assessing whether the risks are still 
the most significant facing the Group and whether new risks have 
arisen. Effectiveness, adequacy of controls and mitigating actions are 
assessed and if additional controls or actions are required, these are 
identified and actions assigned. The Risk Register documents this. 
Monitoring and Reporting Risk 
The SMT is responsible for monitoring progress to mitigate key 
risks. The risk management process is continuous; key risks and 
risk mitigation plans and progress are reported to, and reviewed 
by the Board, following the SMT’s bi-annual review of the Group’s 
Risk Register. 
Internal Audit
Additionally, the Board is supported by a programme of Internal 
Audits. Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee on 
progress of control or process improvements following Internal 
Audit recommendations.

37 Governance Statement 
The Company’s shares are quoted on the AIM market and are subject to the AIM Admission Rules of the London Stock Exchange and 
consequently are not required to comply with the provisions or report in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 (the 
Code) issued by the Financial Reporting Council. The Board is however committed to the principles of good corporate governance covering 
leadership, effectiveness, accountability, remuneration and shareholder relations as outlined in the Code, and have applied the Code as far as is 
practicable and appropriate for a public company of the Group’s size. 
In anticipation of the new guidelines that will come into force on 28th September 2018, AMS aims to comply with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2016. The area where AMS currently does not comply is the tenure requirements for a Non-Executive Director who has 
served on the Board for more than nine years from the date of first election to not be considered to be independent (Code Provision B.1.1.). 
Steve Bellamy has served as a Non-Executive Director for 11 years (February 2018) and is considered to be an independent Director. Details of 
this judgement are shown on page 40.
Role of the Board
The role of the Board is to establish the vision and strategy for the Group, to deliver shareholder value and it is responsible for the  
long-term success of the Company. Individual members of the Board have equal responsibility for the overall stewardship, management 
and performance of the Group and for the approval of its long-term objectives and strategic plans.
Division of Responsibilities

Effectiveness
Board Composition
The Board comprises the Non-Executive Chairman, two Executive Directors and three Non-Executive Directors. The Directors’ profiles appear 
on pages 34 and 35 and detail their experience and suitability for leading and managing the Group. Together they bring a valuable range of 
expertise and experience to the Group. No individual or group of individuals dominates the Board’s decision making process. The Chairman 
fosters a climate of debate and challenge in the boardroom, built on his challenging but supportive relationship with the Chief Executive 
Officer which sets the tone for Board interaction and discussions.
Appointment of Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors are appointed to the Board following a formal, rigorous and transparent process, involving external recruitment 
agencies, to select individuals who have a depth and breadth of relevant experience, thus ensuring that the selected candidates will be capable 
of making an effective and relevant contribution to the Board. The process for the appointment of Non- Executive Directors is managed by the 
Nomination Committee, whose responsibilities are outlined on page 40.
Diversity
We recognise the importance of diversity at Board level and our Board members comprise a number of different nationalities with a wide 
range of skills and experiences from a variety of business backgrounds. Our current female representation on the Board is 33.3%. Additionally, 
the Senior Management Team also has a diverse experience. Its members comprise of several nationalities and female representation is 44.4%.

39 Terms of Appointment and Time Commitment
All Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial term of three years subject to satisfactory performance. After this time they may serve 
additional three year terms following review by the Board. All Non-Executive Directors are expected to devote such time as is necessary for the 
proper performance of their duties. Directors are expected to attend all Board meetings and Committee meetings of which they are members 
and any additional meetings as required.
Further details of their terms and conditions are summarised in the Remuneration Report on page 54 and the terms and conditions of 
appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are available at the Company’s Registered Office.
Tenure Chart
The size of the Board during 2017 was six and the tenure is shown below.
The Company follows the Code as far as is practicable. The Board notes the tenure requirement for a Non-Executive Director who has 
served on the Board for more than nine years from the date of first election to not be considered to be independent (Code Provision B.1.1.). 
Steve Bellamy has served as a Non-Executive Director for 11 years (February 2018). Due to his extensive experience with the Company, and 
that the Board consider him to be independent of character and judgement, he is considered to be an independent Director. Steve Bellamy is, 
however, subject to annual re-election which started in 2017 (Code Provision B.7.1.).
The Board further notes that under Code Provision B.1.2 a smaller company (below FTSE 350) must have at least two independent Non-
Executive Directors. The Board consider Peter Allen, Steve Bellamy, Penny Freer and Peter Steinmann to be independent.
Peter Allen, Steve Bellamy and Penny Freer own shares in the Company as shown on page 58. These holdings have been highlighted to 
shareholders and are small. They are not considered to impact Non-Executive Director independence under Code Provision B.1.1.
Code Provision B.2.3. states that any term beyond six years for a Non-Executive Director should be subject to rigorous review, taking into 
account the need for progressive refreshing of the Board. The Board reviewed the appointments of Steve Bellamy and Penny Freer, and 
consider that their continued appointment does not present any issues.

Induction and Professional Development
New Directors are given a formal induction process including details of how the Board and Committees operate, meetings with Senior

Company Secretary and the Group’s External Auditors and advisors.
Professional Advice, Indemnities and Insurance
There is provision for Directors to take independent professional advice relating to the discharge of their responsibilities should they feel 
they need it. The Company has arranged Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance against certain liabilities and defence costs. However, the 
Directors’ insurance does not provide protection in the event of a Director being found to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Board and Committee Evaluation
The performance evaluation of the Board, its Committees and Directors is undertaken by the Chairman annually and implemented in 
collaboration with the Committee Chairmen. The 2017 Board and Committee evaluations were conducted by way of each Director and

41 Going Concern
In carrying out their duties in respect of going concern, the Directors have carried out a review of the Group’s financial position and cash flow 
forecasts for the next 12 months from signing of the accounts. These have been based on a comprehensive review of revenue, expenditure 
and cash flows, taking into account specific business risks and the current economic environment.
With regard to the Group’s financial position, it had cash and cash equivalents at the year-end of £62.5 million (2016: £51.1 million) and was 
debt free (2016: debt free). The Group agreed a five-year, £30 million, multi-currency, revolving credit facility in December 2014 with an 
accordion option under which AMS can request up to an additional £20 million on the same terms. The facility is provided jointly by the 
Group’s existing bank HSBC, as well as The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC. It is unsecured on the assets of the Group and is currently undrawn.
While the current economic environment is uncertain, AMS operates in a market whose demographics are favourable, underpinned by an 
increasing need for products to treat chronic and acute wounds. Consequently, market growth is predicted. The Group has a number of long-
term contracts with customers across different geographic regions and also with substantial financial resources, ranging from government 
agencies through to global healthcare companies.
Having taken the above into consideration, the Directors have reached the conclusion that the Group is well placed to manage its business 
risks in the current economic environment. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements.
Remuneration
The level of remuneration of the Directors is set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 47 to 56.
Modern Slavery Act
Prior to the introduction of the legislation the Company had implemented an Ethical Sourcing Policy and the requirements of the Modern 
Slavery Act build on that policy. During 2017 the Company has taken the following key steps to implement the requirements of the Modern 
Slavery Act 2015:
 e Introduction of an Anti-Slavery/Human T rafficking Policy (the “Policy”) and procedures
 e Group-wide communication of the Policy, with all employees confirming their understanding of the Policy
 e Reinforcement of existing policies covering ethical business practices and legal compliance
 e Contractual commitments from supply chain partners to act in accordance with our Ethical Sourcing Policy
 e Routine audits of suppliers include an assessment of compliance
 e Continuing liaison with suppliers, contractors and business partners to establish their commitment to the eradication of slavery and 
human trafficking
The full compliance statement can be found on the Company website ‘www.admedsol.com/modernslaveryact’.
Gender Pay Gap Reporting – Ensuring Opportunities for All
AMS believes in being an inclusive and diverse employer, where individuals are provided opportunities to develop and reach their full potential.
Pay and Bonus Gap Mean Median
Gender pay gap 11.2% 6.1%
Gender bonus gap 60.3% 0.0%
Gender bonus gap (excluding share exercises) 8.7% 0.0%
The above table shows our mean and median gender pay gap and bonus gap as at the snap-shot date (i.e. 5 April 2017). This information is for

Our disclosable pay gap is 11.2%. Our analysis of our gender gap tells us this is largely driven by the fact that women hold fewer senior positions 
than men. Women made up 41% of our overall workforce on the snapshot date, compared to 32% of women in upper quartile for pay.
Our analysis suggests that when we adjust for this structural issue, our pay gap changes to -2.4% (women paid more than men), which can be 
explained by time in role or skill-set factors.
Our bonus gap has been driven by a number of high value share exercises in the year to 5 April 2017, a large proportion of which were made 
by men. The exercise of these shares relates to options granted over a number of previous years and, as such, is not representative of the 
bonus earned in the year. Individuals have discretion on the timing as to when to exercise their share incentives. Any share incentives that 
vested but were not exercised are not included in this calculation. When we adjust for this factor, and exclude the impact of share exercises, 
our bonus gap drops to 8.7%.

women have an equal opportunity to earn a bonus.

As a responsible employer we are committed to addressing diversity and are approaching this in a number of ways to promote and attract 
more senior candidates. This includes flexible working (including job sharing, part-time working, flexitime, career break, home working), 
development opportunities (sponsorship of further education, coaching and mentoring, personal development plans) and our recruitment 
processes (attraction of diverse talent pools). We are confident that men and women are paid equally for doing equivalent jobs across 
the business.
Our Gender Pay Gap figures have been calculated using the methodology provided in the gender pay gap reporting legislation; The Equality 
Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017. These figures have been verified and checked to ensure accuracy. The Compliance 
Statement can be found on the Company website ‘www.admedsol.com/genderpay’.
Relations with Shareholders
The Board appreciates that effective communication with the Company’s shareholders and the investment community as a whole is a key 
objective. The Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Statement and the Strategic Report and Financial Review, together with the information 
in the Annual Report of the Group, provides a detailed review of the business. The views of both institutional and private shareholders are 
important, and these can be varied and wide-ranging, as is their interest in the Company’s strategy, reputation and performance. The Executive 
Directors have overall responsibility for ensuring effective communication and the Company maintains a regular dialogue with its shareholders, 
mainly in the periods following the announcement of the interim and final results, but also at other times during the year. The views of 
shareholders are sought through direct contact and via feedback from advisors and are communicated to the Board as a whole. The Board 
encourages the participation of shareholders at its Annual General Meeting, notice of which is sent to shareholders at least 20 working days 
before the meeting. The AMS website ‘www.admedsol.com’ is regularly updated and provides additional information on the Group including 
information on the Group’s products and technology.
Annual General Meeting
This year’s AGM will, as last year, include a presentation by the Chief Executive Officer on the current progress of the business and allow the 
opportunity for questions on this or any of the resolutions. The Company proposes separate resolutions for each issue and specifically relating 
to the report and accounts. The Company ensures all proxy votes are counted and indicates the level of proxies on each resolution along with 
the abstentions after it has been dealt with on a show of hands.
After the meeting, shareholders have the opportunity to talk informally to the Board and raise any further questions or issues they may have. 
The outcome of the AGM, a copy of the AGM presentation and details of the poll results will be posted on the Company’s website after 
the meeting.

 e Reviewed and considered the significant issues in relation to the Financial Statements and how these have been addressed, including: 
• Going Concern – The 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code provision C.2.2 has set out a requirement for the Directors to explain in the 
Annual Report how they have assessed the prospects of the Company, over what period they have done so and why they consider that 
period to be appropriate. The Committee reviews the analysis undertaken in relation to strategic risk management and risk assessment, 
risk appetite, internal control, risk and control reporting structure and the principal risks identified on an ongoing basis. This monitoring and 
review validates the draft statement which was documented for the first time in 2016

Terms of Reference
 e The Committee’s Terms of Reference are reviewed annually in line with the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators (ICSA) 
guidance to reflect the UK Governance Code. 
Effectiveness of External Auditor
To assess the effectiveness of our External Auditor, a formal performance review is undertaken on an annual basis to identify the adequacy of 
their approach to: 
 e Resource quality: – it is important that the External Auditor has achieved the right balance of audit team resource. With the team providing 
both continuity and knowledge, as well as a fresh perspective through new team members to allow processes and accounting policies to 
be challenged. 
 e Effective communication: – key audit judgements are communicated at the earliest opportunity to promote discussion and challenge 
between the External Auditors and management, informing AMS of audit issues as they arise, so that these can be dealt with in a timely 
manner. Communication regarding good practice, changes to reporting requirements and accounting standards is also needed to enable 
the Company to be prepared prior to year end. Timely provision of audit papers is required to enable adequate management review and 
feedback. The quality of the reports and publications provided by the External Auditor in terms of content, relevance and presentation 
is reviewed. 
 e Scoping and planning: – specifically relating to the year-end audit work: timely provision of the External Audit strategy and timetable to Audit 
Committee and management. 
 e Fees: – ensuring they are transparent and communicated prior to the commencement of any work undertaken. Where variations occur, 
these are challenged at the earliest opportunity to enable dialogue and negotiation to be undertaken.
 e Auditor independence: – the Committee continues to monitor the External Auditor’s compliance with applicable ethical guidelines and 
considers the independence and objectivity of the External Auditor as part of the Committee’s duties. The Committee received and reviewed 
written confirmation from the External Auditor on all relationships that, in their judgement, may bear on their independence. The External 
Auditor has also confirmed that they consider themselves independent within the meaning of UK regulatory and professional requirements. 
The External Auditor may be appointed to provide non-audit services where it is in the Group’s best interests to do so, provided a number of 
criteria are met. These are that the External Auditor does not: 
 e Audit their own work
 e Make management decisions for the Group
 e Create a conflict of interest 
 e Find themselves in the role of an advocate for the Group
All projects where forecasted expenditure exceeded £10,000 were approved by the Audit Committee. Deloitte LLP has been the Group’s 
External Auditor for nine financial years and the engagement partner completed five years as audit partner on completion of the 2016 Audit. 
During 2017 there was a successful transition to a new engagement partner to the Group. Following the positive outcome of a performance 
and effectiveness evaluation undertaken by the management, the Audit Committee concluded that it was appropriate to recommend to the 
Board the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as the Group’s External Auditor for the next financial year. 
Internal Audit
Internal Audit at AMS is managed and delivered by an external firm of Auditors, RSM UK, who provide this service under the direction and 
guidance of the Audit Committee. Against an agreed mandate, this function performs independent Internal Audit across the Group. A two-
year Internal Audit strategy and an annual Internal Audit plan are approved by the Audit Committee each year. Internal Audit reviews areas 
of areas of potentially significant risk and substantial process improvement and provide assurance that key controls are effectively designed 
and operated consistently. Audit reports are produced to convey the extent of control assurance derived from the formal testing of controls. 
RSM UK’s findings and recommendations are reported directly to the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee:
 e Reviews and approves the charter of the Internal Audit function and ensures the function has the necessary resources and access to 
information and the Group’s employees as necessary to enable it to fulfil its mandate and is equipped to perform in accordance with 
appropriate professional standards for Internal Auditors
 e Approves the appointment and the termination of the Internal Auditors
 e Ensures the Internal Auditor has direct access to the Board Chairman and to the Committee Chairman and is accountable to the Committee
 e Reviews and assesses the annual Internal Audit workplan
 e Receives a report on the results of the Internal Auditors work at least twice per year
 e Reviews and monitors management’s responsiveness to the Internal Auditor’s findings and recommendations and the corrective 
actions taken
 e Meets with the Internal Auditor at least once a year without the presence of management
 e Monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the Company’s controls in the context of the Company’s overall risk management system

Financial Statements
45 All Internal Audit reports are discussed with the Audit Committee and the External Auditor, and the recommendations considered 
and acted upon. RSM UK attends Audit Committee meetings twice a year and updates the Audit Committee in writing ahead of each 
Committee meeting.
In 2017 the Internal Auditor undertook detailed audits of Cyber Security and Budgeting and Forecasting, together with a review of previous 
audit reports. The recommendations of Internal Audit were accepted by the Audit Committee and acted upon. The Group also calls on the 
services of external bodies to review the controls in certain areas of the Group. The quality assurance systems are reviewed by the Group’s 
notified bodies, the British Standards Institute (BSI) and TÜV Rheinland and LGA Products GmbH, on a regular basis.
The Internal Controls Framework is available for all employees to view on the Intranet. Updates are driven by an underlying process change or 
by the outcomes of Internal Audit projects. Issues are identified, the policies are updated and then approved by the Group Financial Controller 
and Chief Financial Officer. The updated policies are then formally approved by the Board.
Risk Management and Internal Controls
The Board takes responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, taking guidance from the Audit 
Committee. The Board monitors and reviews all material controls including financial, operational and compliance controls. Risks arising from 
operations can only be managed rather than eliminated. Only reasonable and not absolute assurances can be made against material loss or 
misstatement. Key features of the internal control system are:
 e The Group has an organisational structure with clear responsibilities and lines of accountability. The Group promotes the values of integrity 
and professionalism. The members of the Board are available to hear, in confidence, any individual’s concerns about improprieties;
 e The Board has a schedule of matters reserved for its consideration. This schedule includes potential acquisitions, capital projects, treasury 
policies and management systems, risk management systems and policies, approval of budgets, re-forecasts and Health and Safety;
 e The Board or the Audit Committee reviews the Risk Register at least twice a year;
 e The Board monitors the activities of the Group through the management accounts, monthly forecasts and other reports on current activities 
and plans. The Senior Management Team, at least monthly, monitors financial and operational performance in detail; 
 e The Group has set appropriate levels of authorisation which must be adhered to as the Group concludes its business; 
 e An Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system with in-built controls over process and authority, minimising manual intervention and overall 
strengthening controls is in place in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany;and
 e The Group operates a ‘whistle-blowing’ policy enabling any individual with a concern to approach any of the Non-Executive Directors 
in confidence.
As part of the External Auditor’s annual review process, any weaknesses identified in the Group’s internal control system are reported to and 
discussed with the Audit Committee and corrective actions are agreed.
The Group’s corporate objective is to maximise long-term shareholder value, recognising that creating value is the reward for taking and 
accepting risk. The Directors consider risk management to be crucial to the Group’s success and give it a high priority to ensure that adequate 
systems are in place to evaluate and limit risk exposure.
Management formally reviews the Risk Register at least twice a year. Risks are evaluated for both likelihood and financial impact and scored 
against both criteria. This is used to identify the most significant risks the business faces. These risks have been identified and are discussed in 
more detail in the Strategic Report on pages 4 to 33. Actions are agreed to mitigate the risks. 
At each review, progress on actions is assessed and further actions may be identified. Risks are re-scored and the effects of mitigating actions 
taken are used to identify a residual risk score. Management also gives consideration to other risks that have been identified, score these risks 
to understand significance and assign actions to be taken to mitigate, if required. The process for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks 
faced by the Group is ongoing throughout the year.
Management report to the Audit Committee at least twice a year on the Risk Register. The Board or the Audit Committee reviews the Group’s 
Risk Register and the effectiveness of Management’s actions to mitigate the risks. 
As part of the External Auditor’s annual review process, any key risks and areas of audit focus are also identified and agreed with the 
Audit Committee. 
In September 2014 the FRC issued guidance on ‘Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial & Business Reporting’. The new 
guidance was first applied in the Group’s 2015 accounting period. The Audit Committee believes it meets the FRC requirements.

Remuneration Report  Remuneration Policy
The remuneration policy is formulated around the need to provide a remuneration structure that is competitive to attract, retain and motivate 
Senior Executives of the calibre required to develop and implement the Company’s strategy and enhance earnings over the long-term, 
whilst at the same time not paying more than is necessary for this purpose. A cohesive reward structure consistently applied with links to 
corporate performance is seen as crucial in ensuring attainment of the Group’s strategic goals. It is the intention of this policy to conform to 
best practice as far as reasonably practicable and that it will continue to apply for 2018 and subsequent years, subject to ongoing review as 
appropriate. The Committee retains the right for discretion, although no discretion was used in 2017. The policy is based around the following 
key principles:
 e Total rewards will be set at levels that are sufficiently competitive to enable the recruitment and retention of high calibre Senior Executives;
 e Total incentive-based rewards will be earned through the achievement of performance conditions consistent with shareholder interests;
 e The design of long-term incentives will be prudent and will not expose shareholders to unreasonable financial risk; and
 e In considering the market positioning of reward elements, account will be taken of the performance of the Group and of each individual 
Executive Director.
Kepler, part of Mercer (previously Kepler Associates), were engaged in 2014 to advise the Committee with regard to the remuneration of 
the Executives and SMT. Executive Directors are expected to accumulate and maintain a significant shareholding. The Committee took 
into account this expectation, together with the recommendations from Kepler, into account when introducing an Executive Shareholding 
Policy requiring the Executive Directors and SMT to hold a minimum of 100% and 50% respectively, of their pre-tax annual salary in Company 
shares within five years of attaining office. All SMT members met or exceeded the shareholding target except the two members who have 
been with the Company less than 5 years. Each Executive Director’s remuneration package consists of basic salary, bonus, LTIPs, health 
and insurance benefits, and pension contributions. The Committee ensures that there is a balance between fixed and performance related 
remuneration elements.
Consideration of Shareholder Views
In formulating the remuneration policy, the Committee takes into account guidance issued by shareholder representative bodies, including 
the Investment Association, the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association and Institutional Shareholder Services. The Committee also takes 
into consideration any views expressed by shareholders during the year (including at the AGM) and encourages open dialogue with its largest 
shareholders. Major shareholders are consulted in advance about changes to the remuneration policy.
Consideration of Employment Conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee considers the general basic salary increase for the broader employee population when determining the annual salary 
increases and remuneration for the Executive Directors. For example, as explained on page 51, reflecting the wider cost of living increase for 
the 2018 financial year, the Committee determined to only increase the basic salary for the Executive Directors by the cost of living (3%).

In line with the policy outlined on page 48 
salary levels of Executive Directors and the SMT 
are set after taking into account experience, 
responsibilities and performance, both on an 
individual and business perspective, and external 
market data (benchmarked against companies 
of a similar size and complexity and other 
companies in the same industry sector).
Salaries are reviewed annually (normally 
December, with any changes effective from 
1 January). Details of the current salaries of 
the Executive Directors are set out below. 
This review was last carried out in December 
2017. There is no prescribed maximum annual 
increase. The Committee will take into account 
the general increase for the broader employee 
population in the UK but on occasions may 
need to recognise, for example, an increase 
in the scale, scope or responsibility of the role. 
Current salary levels are set out on page 51.
Where there is a change in responsibility, 
progression in the role, change in size 
or structure of the Group or increased 
experience of the Executive Director or 
member of the SMT, the Committee retains 
the discretion to award a higher increase than 
the UK workforce.

Bonus
Drives and rewards

Each of the Executive Directors is entitled 
under the terms of their service agreements to 
receive an Annual Bonus to be determined by 
the Committee based on the Group’s financial 
performance and the achievement of specific 
personal targets set by the Committee.
The maximum Annual Bonus potential is 120% of 
salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 100% 
of salary for the Chief Financial Officer, of which 
85% of the award is dependent on financial 
performance targets and 15% on personal 
objectives. Bonuses are paid in a mixture of cash 
and shares with an element deferred under the 
Deferred Annual Bonus scheme.
The annual performance bonus is focused 
on the delivery of strategically important 
performance targets. These include 
demanding financial and non-financial 
measures. The financial targets are currently 
set against Group revenue, Group profit 
before tax and Earnings Per Share. 85% of 
the award is dependent upon the financial 
performance of the Group and 15% is 
achievable for meeting personal objectives.
The SMT are entitled to receive up to 50% 
of their salary in bonus, of which 86% of the 
award is dependent on financial performance 
targets and 14% on personal objectives. 
The Committee may use different measures 
and/or weightings for future bonus cycles to 
take into account changes in the strategic 
needs of the business.
Deferred Annual 
Bonus (DAB)
Provides mechanism 
to exercise 
malus provisions.
Following advice from Mercer (formally Kepler) 
regarding corporate governance developments 
in remuneration, the Committee introduced 
a Deferred Annual Bonus (DAB) Scheme after 
receiving shareholder approval at the 2014 AGM 
whereby both Executive Directors and the SMT 
are required to defer up to 25% of their Annual 
Bonus for three years.
The DAB introduced malus provisions which 
are laid out on page 51. There is no provision 
for clawback.

Deferred Share 
Bonus Plan 
(DSB)
To align the interests 
of the Executive 
Directors, the SMT and 
the employees with 
shareholders, incentivise 
long-term value creation 
and is a key tool for 
retention of staff.
The Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSB) is available 
to all employees and allows them to choose for 
the payment of some bonus to be made in the 
form of shares. It also allows for the provision of 
matching shares if the bonus shares are held for 
a set period. The DSB encourages employees 
to acquire shares in the Company and retain 
those shares to receive additional free shares 
from the Company. It acts as a valuable retention 
tool aligning employees’ interests with those of 
shareholders. The DSB first operated in 2007. 
The existing scheme received shareholder 
approval at the 2015 AGM.
N/A
Long Term 
Incentive Plan 
(LTIP)
To align the interests 
of the Executive 
Directors and the SMT 
with shareholders and 
incentivise long-term 
value creation.
The Company introduced a new Long 
Term Incentive Plan (2014 LTIP) at the 2014 
AGM, replacing the LTIP introduced in 2006. 
The LTIP permits an annual grant of shares that 
vest subject to performance and continued 
employment. The LTIP awards are granted 
in accordance with the rules of the plan. 
Individuals who are entitled to awards under 
the 2014 LTIP are not eligible to receive options 
under the Company’s Share Option Plan or the 
Executive Share Option Scheme.
Under the rules of the LTIP, the maximum 
annual award size is 200% of salary. Details of 
the proposed award level for 2017 are set out 
below. Awards under the LTIP may be granted in 
the form of nil-cost options or cash (where the 
award cannot be settled in shares). Awards are 
currently structured with a consideration of £1.
The 2014 LTIP introduced malus provisions 
which are laid out on page 51. There is no 
provision for clawback.
50% of the Award is determined based on the 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance 
of the Company compared with the AIM 
Healthcare Share Index over the vesting 
period and 50% of the Award is determined by 
the growth in the average Earnings Per Share 
(EPS) per year of the Company over a three-
year period. 
Of the 50% of the Award that is determined by 
reference to the AIM Healthcare Share Index, 
no shares will be awarded if the Company 
is ranked below the median. Awards will 
vest on a sliding scale from 25% to 100% for 
performance above median to upper quartile 
performance against the Index. 
The performance measurement for EPS will 
be based on the percentage increase of the 
Company’s EPS over a three-year period 
commencing on the 1 January of the year 
the Award is made. Awards will vest on a 
sliding scale from 25% to 100% for an average 
increase of EPS from target EPS of 5% to 
an average increase of EPS of 20% over the 
vesting period. No awards will be made for 
an average increase of EPS below target EPS. 
In 2014 the EPS target was set at 5%.
The Committee has the flexibility to make 
appropriate adjustments to the performance 
conditions to ensure that the Award achieves 
its purpose. Any vesting is also subject to 
the Committee being satisfied that the 
Company’s performance on these measures 
is consistent with the underlying performance 
of the business.
Pensions
To provide a 
market competitive 
remuneration 
package to enable 
the recruitment 
and retention of the 
Executive Directors 
and SMT.
All UK employees are entitled to become 
members of the Group Pension and Life 
Assurance Scheme which was set up with 
effect from 1 February 1999. The Scheme 
entitles Executive Directors to contribute up to 
10% of salary with the Group contributing 10%. 
All other UK employees contribute a minimum 
of 3% of their salary which is matched by a 6% 
contribution of the Group. The Pension Plan is 
a money purchase scheme. In 2011, the Group 
made arrangements allowing individuals to 
sacrifice their salary for pension contributions. 
Following changes in the taxation of personal UK 
pension contributions, and limitations on the size 
of individual personal pension funds, the Group 
has agreed that an employee may substitute the 
pension contributions they would have received 
from the Group for salary.
Automatic enrolment has been implemented for 
all UK employees.

Remuneration Report continued  Malus provisions – 2014 LTIP/DAB
The 2014 LTIP and DAB incorporate malus provisions. For LTIPs and DAB’s awarded from 2014 onwards, the Committee may in its absolute 
discretion resolve to vary an Award in the event that any of the Financial Statements or results for the Company, or for any Group Company, 
are materially restated (other than restatement due to a change in accounting policy or to rectify a minor error) or if, in the reasonable 
opinion of the Committee and following consultation with the relevant employing Group Company, a participant has deliberately misled the 
management of the Company and/or the market and/or the Company’s shareholders regarding the financial performance and/or technical 
information of any Group Company or any Subsidiary, or a participant’s actions amount to serious misconduct or conduct which causes 
significant financial loss for the Company, any Group Company and/or the participant’s Business Unit. 
If the Committee determines that the malus provision applies then they may resolve that the number of shares comprised in an Award that 
are not vested shares and/or vested shares in the case of an Option where the Option has not yet been exercised should be reduced (to nil if 
appropriate) and/or impose further conditions on an Award.

The table above summarises the payments made and additional amounts earned by the Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors 
for the 2016 and 2017 financial years. The Chairman of the Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee (Steve Bellamy and Penny Freer) 
received a supplementary fee of £3,000 for chairing the Committees. The Deferred Annual Bonus recorded in the table above is in respect of 
the 2016 and 2017 financial years, to be paid or deferred into shares, which will not be received until 2020 and 2021 respectively. The Executive 
Directors were granted further LTIPs as detailed on page 52. All Directors have confirmed that, save as disclosed in the single figures of 
remuneration tables above, they have not received any other items in the nature of remuneration.
Salaries and Fees
Executive Directors
The Remuneration Committee determined there would be an increase of 3% for Executive Director base salary for 2018. The Group’s UK 
employees also received a 3% salary increase for the 2018 financial year.
Director 2018 2017 % increase
Chris Meredith £278,409 £270,300 3%
Mary Tavener £215,373 £209,100 3%
Annual Performance Bonus
The Annual Bonus contains two elements — the cash element and the deferred share element. The bonus is determined on both financial 
targets and personal objectives. Up to 25% of the bonus is deferred into shares in line with the malus provisions. The Annual Bonus payments 
presented in the table above were based on performance against growth in Group revenue, adjusted Profit before Tax, and EPS, and 
performance against personal performance objectives measured over the relevant financial year. The maximum bonus potential for the year 
ending 31 December 2018 will remain as 120% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 100% for the Chief Financial Officer. 
The personal objectives for the Executive Directors are usually set on an individual basis. The personal objectives of each Executive Director for 
the year ended 31 December 2017 were linked to the corporate, financial, strategic and other non-financial objectives of the Company. 
Up to 18% of salary was payable to the Chief Executive Officer and 15% of salary to the Chief Financial Officer upon achievement of personal 
objectives. Based on the assessment against objectives set, the Committee determined that the performance of the Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Financial Officer warranted a 60% (2016: 50%) payout in relation to the non-financial elements of their respective bonuses, which 
resulted in payment worth 11% (2016: 9%) of salary to the Chief Executive Officer and 9% (2016: 7.5%) of salary to the Chief Financial Officer. 
The Committee consider the 2018 objectives to be commercially sensitive as they give our competitors insight into our business plans and 
therefore are not detailed in this Report.
The bonus for the 2017 financial year is accrued and paid in 2018. Overall the 2017 bonus payments made in respect of the 2016 financial year 
were as follows:

The LTIPs granted on 6 June 2014 to the Executive Directors under the 2014 Long-Term Investment Plan were based on performance criteria 
during the three-year period as detailed below. The LTIPs vested on 6 June 2017. The performance conditions were: 
 e 50% of the Award is subject to a performance condition based on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance over 
the performance period (90 dealing day period to the date of grant measured against the 90 dealing day period prior to the three year 
anniversary following the date of grant) relative to the constituent companies of the AIM Healthcare Share Index over the performance 
period; and
 e 50% of each Award is subject to a performance condition based on the growth in the Company’s underlying diluted earnings per share (EPS) 
over the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016.
The Performance Targets were as follows:
TSR Performance Vesting %
Below 50% of the comparator group
Between 50% and 75% of comparator group
Above 75% of comparator group
0%
Pro-rata vesting between 25% and 100% based on the ranking in the comparator group
100%
EPS compound annual growth rate Vesting %
<5% CAGR
5%-20% CAGR

Pro-rata vesting between 25% and 100%
Following a review of the performance conditions of the LTIPs granted in June 2014, 76.9% of the award vested in June 2017. The Company 
achieved 100% vesting for the TSR element (ranking 7th out of the 50 comparators) and 53.7% for the EPS element (compound annual EPS 
growth of 10.7%)

Remuneration Report continued  Approach to Remuneration of Executive Directors on Recruitment
In the case of appointing a new Executive Director, the Committee may make use of all the existing components of remuneration. The salaries 
of new appointments will be determined by reference to the experience and skills of the individual, market data, internal relativities and their 
current salary. New appointments will be eligible to receive a personal pension, benefits and to participate in the Company’s share schemes. 
No Director or Senior Manager shall be involved in any decisions as to their own remuneration. 
Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors are appointed under arrangements that may generally be terminated by either party on six months notice and 
their appointment is reviewed annually. The fees of the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Executive Directors, taking into 
account the time and responsibility of each role. Additional fees relate to the supplementary fee paid to the Chairmen of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees. 
Non-Executive Directors receive travel expenses but do not participate in any incentive arrangements. All Non-Executive Directors have 
confirmed that, save as disclosed in the single figures of remuneration tables above, they have not received any other items in the nature of 
remuneration. Further details of the Non-Executive Director fees are outlined below.

As per the Executive Directors 
there is no prescribed maximum

guided by the general increase 
in the Non-Executive Director 
market and the broader employee 
population but on occasion may 
need to recognise, for example, 
an increase in the scale, scope or 
responsibility of the role. Current 
fee levels are set out on page 51
Non-Executive Directors do 
not participate in variable pay 
arrangement and do not receive 
retirement benefits
Service Agreements
Executive Director service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the Committee and are 
designed to recruit, retain and motivate Directors of the quality required to manage the Company. The service contract of each Executive 
Director is not fixed term and is terminable by either party giving not less than 12 months’ notice in writing. The Executive Directors’ contracts 
are available to view throughout the year at the Company’s registered office and at the Annual General Meeting. The Remuneration 
Committee reviews the contractual terms for new Executive Directors to ensure they reflect best practice. Details of the service contracts for 
the Executive Directors and letters of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are as follows:
Executive Director Date of Contract

Policy on Payment for Loss of Office – Executive Directors
The Remuneration Committee considers the circumstances of individual cases of early termination and determines compensation on a case-
by-case basis accordingly, taking into account the relevant contractual terms, the circumstances of the termination and any applicable duty to 
mitigate. There are no special provisions in the event of loss of office or for payment in lieu of notice (PILON). The Remuneration Committee 
considers the circumstances of individual cases of early termination and determines compensation accordingly.
If such circumstances were to arise, the Executive Director concerned would have no claim against the Company for damages or any other 
remedy in respect of the termination. The Remuneration Committee would apply general principles of mitigation to any payment made to a 
departing Executive Director and will honour previous commitments as appropriate. 
The table below summarises how the awards under the Annual Bonus and 2014 LTIP are typically treated in different leaver scenarios and on 
a change of control. Whilst the Remuneration Committee retains overall discretion for determining ‘Good Leaver’ status, it typically defines a 
‘Good Leaver’ for the Annual Bonus and 2014 LTIP as circumstances which include retirement, ill health or injury, disability, redundancy and the 
employing company ceasing to be under the control of the Group. 
The 2014 DAB defines a ‘Good Leaver’ as ceasing to be a Director or employee of a Group Company where that individual is not a ‘Bad 
Leaver’. A ‘Bad Leaver’ is defined as a Director or employee leaving the business due to the Financial Statements requiring restatement. 
Final treatment is subject to the Committee’s discretion.

Upon exit or change of control Deferred Share Bonus (DSB) awards will be treated in line with the DSB plan rules.
If employment is terminated by the Company, the departing Executive Director may have a legal entitlement (under statute or otherwise) to 
additional amounts, which would need to be met. In addition, the Committee retains discretion to settle other amounts reasonably due to the 
Executive Director.
In certain circumstances, the Committee may approve new contractual arrangements with departing Executive Directors including (but 
not limited to) settlement and/or consultancy arrangements. These will be used sparingly and only entered into where the Remuneration 
Committee believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to do so.
There are no agreements between the Group and its Directors or employees for loss of office or employment (whether through resignation, 
purported redundancy or otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover bid.
Payments to past Directors
No payments were made to past Directors during the year ended 31 December 2017.

Private Healthcare
Executive Directors and other senior employees are entitled to private healthcare and permanent health insurance.
Share Options
Employees, except for participants in the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), may be granted options over shares in the Company under the 
Company Share Option Plan and Executive Share Option Scheme, under which either approved or unapproved options may be granted. 
Options granted under these schemes are not offered at a discount.
The exercising of options under these schemes is conditional on certain performance conditions which are pre-determined by the 
Remuneration Committee. Options are exercisable normally only after the third anniversary of the date of grant (or such later time as may be 
determined at the time of grant) and cannot, in any event, be exercised later than the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. Awards will not 
vest if the Group is not profitable at the end of the performance period. Full details are included in Note 29 on pages 89 to 93.
Company Share Option Plan (CSOP)
The Company received approval for a Company Share Option Plan (CSOP) on 2 June 2010. This was adopted after HMRC approval on 
13 August 2010. This Plan allows relevant employees to receive up to £30,000 of Company shares by reference to the market value of these 
shares on the grant date and to benefit from the growth in value of those shares.
2009 Executive Share Option Scheme
Up until 2010, the Company was able to offer options under an Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) Scheme. The Company no longer 
satisfies the requirements for operating this scheme, however, options already granted will be allowed to vest in accordance with the 
scheme rules.
Share Performance - 2017

payment of a final dividend of 0.75p per share (2016: 0.62p per share). The final dividend will, subject to shareholders’ approval, be paid on 
15 June 2018 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 25 May 2018. This will make a total dividend of 1.10p for the full year 
(2016: 0.92p).
Post-Balance Sheet Events
There have been no adjusting or non-adjusting post-balance sheet events.

Capital Structure
The Group is debt free. A five-year, £30 million, multi-currency, revolving, credit facility was agreed in December 2014 with an accordion 
option under which AMS can request up to an additional £20 million on the same terms. The facility is provided jointly by the Group’s banks 
HSBC and The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC. It is unsecured on the assets of the Group and is currently undrawn.
Going Concern
After making enquiries and on the basis outlined in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 38 to 42, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and for this reason they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Share Listing
The Company’s Ordinary Shares are admitted to, and traded on, the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange (AIM), a

Directors’ Report continued
For the year ended 31 December 2017 The Board has agreed procedures for considering and, where appropriate, authorising Directors’ conflicts or potential conflicts of interest. 
Only independent Directors i.e. those who have no interest in the matter under consideration are able to take the relevant decision. In taking 
the decision the Directors must act in a way they consider, in good faith, will be most likely to promote the Company’s success. Directors will 
be able to impose limits or conditions when giving authorisation if they believe it is appropriate. The Board will report annually on the 
Company’s procedures for ensuring that the Board’s power of authorisation in respect of conflicts of interest operated effectively and that 
procedures have been followed. None of the Directors had any interest during or at the end of the year in any contract relating to the business 
of the Company or its subsidiaries.
Directors and Officers’ Liability Insurance
Insurance cover is in force in respect of the personal liabilities which may be incurred by Directors and Officers of the Company in the course 
of their service with the Group, as permitted by the Companies Act 2006. No cover is provided in respect of any fraudulent or dishonest act.
Employees
The Group depends on the skills and engagement of its employees in order to achieve its objectives. Staff at all levels are encouraged to 
make the fullest possible contribution to the Group’s success. The Group is an equal opportunities employer. It is committed to eliminating 
all forms of discrimination and to giving fair and equal treatment to all employees and job applicants in terms of recruitment, pay conditions, 
promotions, training and all employment matters regardless of age, disability, race, sex, sexual orientation, marriage or civil partnership 
status, pregnancy, maternity and paternity, gender reassignment, religion or belief. An Equality Policy is in force which aims to ensure that 
all employees are selected, trained, compensated, promoted and transferred solely on the strength of their ability, skills, qualifications and 
merit. The aim is to encourage a culture in which all employees have the opportunity to develop as fully as possible in accordance with their 
individual abilities and the needs of the Group. The Group also believes that all employees have a right to work in an environment free from 
harassment and bullying, and there is an emphasis upon providing a safe and healthy working environment.
The Group ensures that every consideration is given to applications for employment from disabled persons. Should an employee become 
disabled, every effort would be made to retrain the employee if required and offer suitable alternative employment within the Group.
The Group’s policy is to consult and discuss with employees, through meetings, both formal and informal, those matters likely to affect 
employees’ interests. The Employees’ Consultative Committee in the UK, which comprises representatives of employees and management, 
and the Work’s Council in Germany meet regularly to discuss business issues and areas of concern.
Management also communicates with staff through regular team briefs. Details of policies, procedures and other information of interest are 
regularly updated and are easily accessed by all employees on the Group’s intranet page. The Group undertakes Employee Opinion Surveys 
and takes into account comments and feedback received when updating and formulating policies and procedures.
The Group’s aim is to recruit and retain sufficient skilled and motivated employees to meet the needs of the business. The Group operates to 
the internationally recognised medical device standard ISO 13485. Staff work within a defined quality system, and have Personal Development 
Plans that identify their training requirements to help them progress their careers and development. Employees are encouraged to become 
involved in the financial performance of the Group through participation in the Group’s share option plans and are incentivised directly through 
the Company’s bonus scheme, performance reviews and training and development opportunities.
Employee Share Schemes
Employees, except for participants in the Long-Term Incentive Plan (2014 LTIP), may be eligible after a period of service to be granted options 
over shares in the Company under the Company Share Option Plan or Executive Share Option Scheme. The Group received HMRC approval 
in 2010 to adopt a Company Share Option Plan (CSOP). Under the CSOP, employees are allowed to receive up to £30,000 of options in a tax-
efficient manner. Options granted under these schemes are not offered at a discount. Further details are included in the Remuneration Report 
on pages 47 to 56.
The Company also operates a Deferred Share Bonus Scheme (DSB) in which employees are invited to participate. The DSB encourages 
employee share ownership which helps to align the employees’ interests with those of the shareholders. The details of the DSB Scheme are 
provided in the Remuneration Report on page 50. The original DSB was set up in 2006 and having reached the end of its ten-year life a new 
DSB scheme was introduced on the same terms as the existing scheme following shareholder approval at the 2015 Annual General Meeting.
The Company no longer satisfies the requirements for granting tax-efficient options under its EMI scheme. Options already granted under this 
scheme will be allowed to vest in accordance with the rules of the scheme. 
2,200,000 Ordinary Shares (2016: 1,452,000) were issued during the year to employees exercising their share options and options over other 
share incentive schemes. Details are given in Note 29 to the Group Financial Statements.
Health and Safety
The Group is committed to high standards in health, safety and environmental performance. It is the Group’s policy to abide by, and where 
appropriate exceed, all laws, directives and regulations pertinent to its field of operations and to act in a manner so as to minimise the effects 
of its operations on the environment. The Group provides safe places and systems of work, safe plant and machinery, safe handling of 
materials and ensures appropriate information, instruction and training is given. Employees are encouraged to identify ‘near misses’ to ensure 
preventative actions are taken to avoid any unsafe work practices and a common All Incident Rate (AIR) reporting metric is used across the 
Group. Emphasis is placed on all employees having a responsibility to maintain a safe working environment. Health and Safety Committees at 
all sites assist with advice on safe working practices and ensure any corrective action is taken where necessary. Health and Safety reports are 
regularly received from Group sites and are reviewed by the Board. Regular audits are undertaken to evaluate compliance with Group policy. 
Health and Safety is a key component of the Group’s Corporate Social Responsibility Policy.

59 Environment
AMS is focused on reducing our impact on the environment. The Group has operations across a number of countries, where local 
management drive environmental performance. Specific site level objectives are established to ensure compliance with local legislative 
requirements. The Company aims to adopt responsible environmental practices and to give consideration to minimising the impact on 
the environment. The facility at Winsford has been built with a high level of thermal insulation to reduce the Group’s carbon footprint. 
It incorporates a solar wall, a renewable energy source that captures the sun’s warmth and supplements the building’s heating system. 
Lighting is controlled by movement sensors to avoid wastage and the heating system is fully programmable. Air compressors were replaced 
providing both business contingency and energy reduction. Across the manufacturing sites in recent years less energy efficient plant such as 
steam humidifiers, pump systems, chillers and transformers have been replaced and upgraded.
2017 saw an increased emphasis on energy management and using energy more efficiently. We continue to monitor and optimise the energy 
resources at our manufacturing facilities across the Group. Examples of activity in this area includes the fitting of light emitting diodes (LEDs) in 
our warehouse at Winsford. A study of water usage at the Winsford site, which focused on managing our use of water, resulted in a significant 
reduction in water usage, highlighting our commitment to environmental compliance and management. Work on the warehouse extension 
at our Plymouth site has commenced and it will incorporate an energy efficient system for heating and lighting, and be insulated to the 
highest standard.
Evaluations of capital investment opportunities are ongoing to further reduce energy consumption. 2018 will demonstrate significant 
investment in both infrastructure and expertise. The UK manufacturing sites will apply for the ISO 50001 Energy Management Standard, which 
is an internationally recognised world class standard. 
Corporate Social Responsibility
AMS is committed to ensuring that the business operates in a responsible way across these key areas:
 e Employees
 e Ethical Standards
 e Health, Safety and Environment
 e Customer and Community
The Group has implemented a Corporate Social Responsibility Policy.
Directors’ Responsibilities Statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to 
prepare the Group Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European 
Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law including FRS 101 ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’). Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing the Parent Company Financial Statements the Directors are required to:
 e Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 e Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 e State whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
Financial Statements; and
 e Prepare the Financial Statements on the Going Concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business.
In preparing the Group Financial Statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
 e Properly select and apply accounting policies;
 e Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
 e Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
 e Make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of Financial Statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Report on the audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
In our opinion:
 e the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of The Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 e the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union;
 e the Parent Company Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice including Financial Reporting Standard 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”; and
 e the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the Financial Statements of Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc (the ‘Parent Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) 
which comprise:
 e the Consolidated Income Statement;
 e the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income;
 e the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position;
 e the Parent Company Balance Sheet;
 e the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity;
 e the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement; and
 e the related Consolidated Financial Statement Notes 1 to 31; and
 e the related Parent Company Financial Statement Notes 1 to 7.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group Financial Statements is applicable law and IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of The Parent Company Financial 
Statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and The Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the Financial Statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters
The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
 e Identification of cash generating units and allocation of goodwill; and
 e Revenue recognition
Materiality
The materiality that we used for the Group Financial Statements was £1.2 million which was determined on the basis of approximately 5% of 
statutory profit before tax.
Scoping
We focused our Group audit scope on the UK, Germany and the Netherlands which were subject to a full audit. As a consequence of the audit 
scope determined, we achieved coverage of approximately 97% of revenue, 96% of profit before tax and 98% of net assets.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We are required by ISAs (UK) to report in respect of the following matters where:
 e the Directors’ use of the Going Concern basis of accounting in preparation of the Financial Statements is not appropriate; or 
 e the Directors have not disclosed in the Financial Statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the 
Group’s or The Parent Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months 
from the date when the Financial Statements are authorised for issue.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

Financial Statements
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial Statements of 
the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. 
These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing 
the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Identification of cash generating units and allocation of goodwill
Key audit matter description The Group holds £42 million of goodwill which has been allocated against three cash generating units (CGU) as 
shown in Note 19. Identifying the CGU at the smallest group of assets which can largely generate independent 
cash inflows requires the exercise of judgement regarding the interdependency of assets across the Group, in 
particular where geographic spread of sites and product ranges exist within each segment. For specific detail on 
the Groups accounting policy, please see Note 3.
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the key audit 
matter
We have assessed the design and implementation of controls relating to the identification of CGU and 
allocation of goodwill.
We challenged management’s assumptions and conclusions regarding the identification of the CGU. As part of 
our procedures we:
 e assessed the impact of the internal Business Unit restructure upon the business operations;
 e reviewed how performance is monitored and decisions are made; 
 e evaluated management’s assertions of the extent of interdependency of generation of cash inflows across 
individual sites, products and customer groups; and
 e checked the allocation of goodwill is in line with management’s basis of aggregating previous CGU.
Key observations Based on the procedures we have concluded that the CGU identified and allocation of goodwill were 
appropriate.
Key audit matter description ISAs (UK) require that, as part of our overall response to the risk of fraud, when identifying and assessing the risks 
of material misstatement due to fraud, we evaluate which types of revenue or revenue transactions might give 
rise to potential fraud risks.
The Group sells medical devices across a number of Geographical regions. We have specifically focused this 
key audit matter to whether sales have occurred, particularly for periods where revenue patterns are different to 
prior year and budget. Pressures to meet stakeholder expectations could provide incentives to record revenues 
where risk and reward have not passed.
The associated disclosure is included within Note 4. For specific detail on the Group’s accounting policy, please 
see Note 3.
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the key audit 
matter
We performed walkthroughs of the revenue cycle at significant components to gain an understanding of when 
the revenue should be recognised, to map out the relevant controls end to end and the processes in place. We 
have assessed the design and implementation of these controls.
We tested a sample of individual sales transactions and traced to sales invoices, final sales contracts or purchase 
orders.
We performed analytic reviews to identify any unusual sales trends, including analysis of sales prices at a 
customer Group level.
We reviewed a sample of new contracts in the period and considered the appropriateness of the revenue 
recognition policies adopted, including identification of any rebate conditions or minimum order clauses.
We identified and considered the impact of any credit notes or inventory returns occurring after year-end, 
including evaluating the impact of any overdue debts from customers.
Key observations We were satisfied that the revenue recognition policies have been applied appropriately. We noted no material 
instances of inappropriate revenue recognition arising from our testing.
63 Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2017
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the Financial Statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the Financial Statements as a whole as follows:
Group Financial Statements Parent company Financial Statements
Group materiality £1.2 million £1.08 million
Basis for determining 
materiality
Approximately 5% of profit before tax The Parent Company materiality represents less than 1% 
of equity which is capped at 90% of Group materiality.
Rationale for the  
benchmark applied
Profit before tax is determined to be the most relevant 
performance measure to the users of the Financial 
Statements.
As a non-trading Parent Company, equity is the key 
driver of the company.
Materiality
Proﬁt before tax
Proﬁt before tax

Group materiality
£1.2 million
Component
materiality
range £0.53 million 
to £1.08 million
Audit committee 
reporting threshold
£0.06 million Group materiality
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £60,000, as well as differences 
below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure 
matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the Financial Statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing 
the risks of material misstatement at the Group level.
Based on this assessment, we focused our Group audit scope on the UK, Germany and Netherlands, with the UK and Germany subject to a full 
audit and Netherlands specified procedures. As a consequence of the audit scope determined, we achieved coverage of 97% of the Group’s 
revenue, 96% of the Group’s profit before tax and 98% of the Group’s net assets. Our audit work at each location was executed at levels of 
materiality applicable to each individual entity which was lower than Group materiality. Component materiality ranged from £0.53 million to 
£1.08 million. 
The Group audit team are responsible for the audit of all components within the Group except for Germany, Russia and Czech Republic which 
are the responsibility of the component auditor Deloitte & Touche GmbH. During the year, senior members of the Group audit team have 
engaged in regular communications with Deloitte & Touche GmbH. We include the component audit team in our team briefing, discuss their 
risk assessment, attend the close meeting and review documentation of the findings from their work.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there 
were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components (Russia, Czech 
Republic, and the US components) not subject to audit.
Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other 
than the Financial Statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our 
report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material 
misstatement in the Financial Statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Financial Statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Financial Statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and The Parent Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or The Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

69 Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2017
1 Reporting entity
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc (“the Company”) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales 
(registration number 2867684). The Company’s registered address is Premier Park, 33 Road One, Winsford Industrial Estate, Cheshire, CW7 3RT.
The Company’s Ordinary Shares are traded on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange plc. The Consolidated Financial Statements of the 
Company for the twelve months ended 31 December 2017 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”).
The Group is primarily involved in the design, development, manufacture and distribution of novel high performance polymers (both natural 
and synthetic) for use in advanced woundcare dressings and materials, medical adhesives for closing and sealing tissue, and sutures and 
haemostats for sale into the global medical device market. 
2 Basis of preparation
The Group accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as adopted by the EU. 
The Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis of accounting except as disclosed in the accounting policies set 
out below.
The individual Financial Statements for each Group Company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the results and financial position of each 
Group Company are expressed in Pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
In carrying out their duties in respect of going concern, the Directors have carried out a review of the Group’s financial position and cash flow 
forecasts for the next 12 months. These have been based on a comprehensive review of revenue, expenditure and cash flows, taking into 
account specific business risks and the current forecast economic environment for the next 12 months. 
With regards to the Group’s financial position, it had cash and cash equivalents at the year end of £62.5 million. The Group also has in place a 
five-year, unsecured, multi-currency, revolving credit facility for £30 million which was undrawn during 2017.
While the current economic environment is uncertain, the Group operates in markets whose demographics are favourable, underpinned by 
an increasing need for products to treat chronic and acute wounds. Consequently, market growth is predicted. The Group has a number of 
contracts with customers across different geographic regions and also with substantial financial resources, ranging from government agencies 
through to global healthcare companies.
Having taken the above into consideration, the Directors have reached a conclusion that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks 
in the current economic environment. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
In the current year the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRSs issued by the IASB. Their adoption has not had a material impact 
on the disclosures or on the amounts reported in the Annual Financial Statements. The following amendments were applied:
 e Amendments to IAS 7, Disclosure Initiative
 e Amendments to IAS 12, Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses
 e Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2014-16 Cycle, specifically amendments to IFRS 12, Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
IFRS 15 is effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2018 and will replace IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IAS 18 Revenue. 
The standard establishes a principles based approach for revenue recognition and is based on the concept of recognising revenue for 
obligations only when they are satisfied and the control of goods or services is transferred. It applies to all contracts with customers, except 
those in the scope of other standards. It replaces the separate models for goods, services and construction contracts under the current 
accounting standards. The Group has decided to adopt the standard early with effect for the year ended 31 December 2017. As a result of the 
early adoption, Other Income of £709,000 (excluding the £2,504,000 royalty income from Organogenesis) has been re-classified as Revenue 
(2016: £621,000). The impact on Profit before Taxation is £nil (2016: £nil).
3 Accounting policies
Critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the course of preparing the Financial Statements, no critical judgements have been made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 
policies, nor are there any key sources of estimation uncertainty that exist which may cause a material impact in the next 12 months.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies 
of an entity so as to retain benefits from its activities. The Financial Statements of the subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements on the basis of acquisition accounting, from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Intercompany transactions and balances between Group entities are eliminated upon consolidation.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the 
fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, the equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange 
for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the issue of debt or equity. Acquisition related expenses are accounted for as 
expenses in the period in which the costs are incurred and the services rendered, with the exception of directly attributable costs incurred as 
a result of raising equity, which are off-set against share premium, and raising debt, which are capitalised and amortised over the term of the 
debt. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised 
at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with 
IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.

Company Overview
Strategic Report
Governance
Financial Statements
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business 
combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after 
reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost 
of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwill is 
measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition. If after restatement, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of 
the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each 
of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has 
been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce 
the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to assets of the unit on a pro-rata basis. An impairment loss recognised for 
goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Revenue recognition
The Group manufactures and sells a range of innovative and technologically advanced products for the global surgical, woundcare and wound 
closure markets. Sales are recognised when control of the products has transferred to the customer in accordance with the contractual 
shipping terms, the customer has discretion over the channel and price to sell the products in accordance with the sales contract, and there is 
no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer’s acceptance of the products. T ransfer occurs when the products have been shipped 
to the specific location, the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred to the customer, and either the customer has accepted the 
products in accordance with the sales contract, the acceptance provisions have lapsed, or the Group has objective evidence that all criteria for 
acceptance have been satisfied.
Occasionally, the products are sold with volume discounts based on aggregate sales over a 12 month period. Revenue from these sales is 
recognised based on the price specified in the contract, net of the estimated volume discounts. The Group recognised £92.6 million revenue 
in the year ended 31 December 2017 (2016: £81.8 million). Accumulated experience and customer-provided forecasts is used to estimate 
and provide for the discounts, using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a 
significant reversal will not occur. No element of finance is deemed present as the sales are made with a credit term of up to 90 days, which is 
consistent with market practice. A receivable is recognised when the goods are transferred as this is the point in time that the consideration is 
unconditional because only the passage of time is required before the payment is due. 
The Group also recognises revenue from royalty income receivable under licence agreements from external customers at amounts excluding 
value added tax as the products under licence are sold and the revenue can be reliably measured. For the year ended 31 December 2017, 
£3.3 million (2016: £0.8 million) revenue from royalty income was recognised.
Other income
Other income relates to tax credits received under the UK Research and Development Expenditure Credit (RDEC) scheme and is recognised in 
the Income Statement in the same period in which the expense is incurred.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those items that are significant for separate disclosure by virtue of their size, nature or incidence, or that the Directors 
consider should be disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial performance. This includes non-recurring 
transaction costs (see Note 6). Exceptional items have been presented separately on the face of the Income Statement. The Directors consider 
that this presentation gives a fairer presentation of the results of the Group.
Finance income
Finance income relates to interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference 
to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Finance costs
Finance costs relate to finance payments associated with financial liabilities. They are recognised in the Income Statement as they accrue using 
the effective interest method.
Finance costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily 
take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are 
substantially ready for their intended use.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted 
from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation.
71 Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2017
3 Accounting policies continued
Foreign currencies
T ransactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the Balance Sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange 
differences arising on translation are recognised in the Income Statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling 
at the date the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated at foreign 
exchange rates ruling at the Balance Sheet date. The revenue and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the 
period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly. Exchange differences arising on consolidation are recognised in equity within the Group’s 
translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income or expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Hedging
The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, embedded derivatives and non-derivatives in respect of foreign 
currency risk, as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. Hedges of foreign exchange 
risk on firm commitments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the 
relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking 
various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging 
instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. Note 24 sets out details of the fair values of 
the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes. Movements in the hedging reserve in equity are detailed in the Consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Equity.
Taxation
Taxation expense includes the amount of current income tax payable and the charge for the year in respect of deferred taxation.
The income tax payable is based on an estimation of the amount due on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit is different from Profit 
before Taxation as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expenditure which are not taxable or deductible 
in the year as a result of either the nature of the item or the fact that it is taxable or deductible in another period. The Group’s liability for current 
tax is calculated by using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is accounted for on a basis of temporary differences, except to the extent where it arises from the initial recognition of goodwill 
or of an asset or liability in a transaction where it is probable the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which temporary differences can 
be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which 
case it is dealt with within equity. It is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability 
is settled based on tax laws enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Intangible assets
Acquired intellectual property rights
Intellectual property rights that are acquired in a business combination are initially recognised at their fair value. Intellectual property rights 
purchased outright are initially recognised at cost. Intellectual property rights are capitalised and amortised over their estimated useful 
economic lives. In determining the useful economic life each asset is reviewed separately and consideration given to the period over which 
the Group expects to derive economic benefit from the asset.
Development costs
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge, is recognised in the Income 
Statement as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, where research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially 
improved products and processes, is capitalised once it can be demonstrated that the product or process is clearly identifiable, technically 
and commercially feasible, will generate future economic benefits, that the development costs of the asset can be measured reliably and 
the Group has sufficient resources to complete development. Expenditure capitalised is stated as the cost of materials and direct labour less 
accumulated amortisation.
Where development expenditure results in new or substantially improved products or processes and it is probable that recovery will take 
place, it is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the product’s useful life starting from the date on which serial production 
commences, which is between one and ten years. Patents and trademarks are measured initially at purchase cost and are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which is between three and 20 years.
Software intangibles
Where computer software is not integral to an item of property, plant or equipment its costs are capitalised and categorised as intangible 
assets. Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis over its economic useful life, which is in the range of three to ten years.

Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings and plant and equipment held for use in the production of goods and services or for administrative purposes are carried in 
the Balance Sheet at cost less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
The Group elected to use the fair value as the deemed cost in respect of land and buildings at the date of transition to IFRS. Fair value was 
calculated by reference to their existing use at the date of transition.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of all property, plant and equipment, over the expected useful life 
of the asset from the date that the asset is brought into use. It is calculated at the following rates:
 e Freehold property and improvements – 4% per annum on cost
 e Leasehold improvements – over the length of the lease
 e Plant and machinery – 6.7% to 33.3% per annum on cost
 e Fixtures and fittings – 33.3% per annum on cost
 e Motor vehicles – 25% per annum on cost
Property, plant and equipment in the course of construction for production are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. 
Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property, plant and equipment assets, commences when the assets are ready for their 
intended use.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Impairment of intangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
The carrying amount of the Group’s assets other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the Income Statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated to reduce the carrying amount of the assets in the unit on a pro 
rata basis. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash 
inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell or value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.
Reversal of impairment
An impairment loss in respect of a receivable carried at amortised cost is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be 
related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist and there 
has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Inventory
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs 
that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition and an attributable proportion of manufacturing 
overheads based on normal levels of activity.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs to completion and disposal.
The Group makes provision for inventory deemed to be irrecoverable or where the net realisable value is lower than cost. This provision is 
established on a stock keeping unit (SKU) basis by reference to the age of the stock, the forward order book, management’s experience and its 
assessment of the present value of estimated future cash flow.
Financial Instruments
Classification of financial instruments
Financial instruments are classified as financial assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments.
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions:
 e They include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets that are potentially unfavourable to the 
Group; and 
 e Where the instrument will or may be settled in the Group’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation 
to deliver a variable number of the Group’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Group exchanging a fixed 
amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.

Recognition and valuation of financial assets
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and cash deposits and amounts under short-term guarantees usually three 
months or less that are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments and are subject to insignificant risk in change in value 
and which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash. Cash held in accounts with more than 90 days’ notice that are not required to 
meet short-term cash commitments are shown as an investment.
Investments
Cash held in accounts with more than 90 days’ notice that are not required to meet short-term cash commitments are shown as an 
investment. The Group invests funds which are surplus to requirements in fixed rate deposits operating within parameters for credit ratings and 
credit limits for individual institutions that are approved and monitored by the Board.
Under IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments; recognition and measurement’, such investments are classified as loans and receivables and are 
recognised at fair value on initial recognition and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Trade and other receivables
T rade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. An impairment is made 
when it is likely that the balance will not be recovered in full. The recoverable amount is calculated as the present value of estimated future 
cash flows. Estimated future cash flows are not discounted due to the relatively short period of time between recognition of trade receivables 
and receipt of cash.
Recognition and valuation of equity instruments
Equity instruments are stated at par value. Any premium on issue is taken to the share premium account.
Recognition and valuation of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Trade payables
T rade payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Other loans
Other loans are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently recognised at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (‘FVTPL ’)
A derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument is classified as held for trading. Financial liabilities are classified as at 
FVTPL where the financial liabilities are held for trading.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. Fair value is determined in the 
manner described in Note 24.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rate risk. Further details of derivative 
financial instruments are disclosed in Note 24 to the Financial Statements.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their 
fair value at each Balance Sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss (administrative costs) immediately unless the 
derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the 
nature of the hedge relationship. The Group currently designates certain derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or 
hedges of foreign currency risk of firm commitments (cash flow hedges). A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset 
whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability.
Derivatives with remaining maturity of less than 12 months are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
Leased assets
Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held as finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments during the lease term at the inception of the lease. Lease payments are apportioned between the reduction of the lease liability and 
finance charges in the Income Statement so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Assets held under 
finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the assets and the lease term.
Assets leased under operating leases are not recorded on the Balance Sheet. Rental payments are charged directly to the Income Statement. 
Lease incentives, primarily up-front cash payments or rent-free periods, are capitalised and spread over the period of the lease term on a 
straight line basis unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern of the users’ benefit. Payments made to acquire 
operating leases are treated as prepaid lease expenses and amortised over the life of the lease.
Pensions
The Group operates a money purchase pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an 
independently administered fund. The amount charged against the Income Statement represents the contributions payable to the scheme in 
respect of the accounting period.

Financial Statements
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’. IFRS has been applied to all options granted after 7 November 
2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2006.
The Group issues equity–settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value 
at the date of grant. The fair value as determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of options that will eventually vest. At each Balance Sheet date the Group revises its 
estimate of the number expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. The impact, if any, is recognised in 
profit or loss with a corresponding adjustment to reserves.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes Merton or Monte Carlo model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based 
on management’s best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Capital management
For the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group had net funds with no borrowings. Capital is managed by maximising retained 
profits. Working capital is managed in order to generate maximum conversion of these profits into cash and cash equivalents thereby 
maintaining capital.
Capital includes share capital, share premium, investment in own shares, share-based payments reserve, share-based payments deferred tax 
reserve, other reserve, translation reserve and retained earnings reserve. There are no externally imposed capital requirements on the Group.
Employee Benefit Trusts
The Group operates an Employee Benefit T rust (EBT): ‘Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc UK Employee Benefit T rust’.
The Group has de facto control of the assets, liabilities and shares held by the T rust and bear their benefits and risks. The Group records assets 
and liabilities of the T rust as its own.
In compliance with IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation Group’, shares held by the EBT are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet 
as a reduction in equity. Gains and losses on Group shares are recognised directly in reserves.
IFRS not yet effective and not adopted early
New accounting standards not yet applied
At the date of authorisation of the Annual Financial Statements, the following new and revised IFRSs that are potentially relevant to the Group, 
and which have not been applied in the Annual Financial Statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been 
adopted by the EU):
 e IFRS 9, Financial Instruments – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
 e IFRIC 22, Foreign Currency T ransactions and Advance Consideration – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
 e Amendments to IFRS 2, Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment T ransactions – effective for accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2018.
 e Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2014-16 Cycle, IFRS 1 and IAS 28 Amendments – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018.
 e IFRS 16, Leases – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
 e IFRIC 23, Uncertainty over Income Tax T reatments – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the Financial Statements of the 
Group in future periods, except as follows:
IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2019 and will replace IAS 17 Leases. The standard represents a significant change 
in the accounting and reporting of leases for lessees as it provides a single lessee accounting model. As such it requires lessees to recognise 
assets and liabilities for all leases unless the underlying asset has a low value or the lease term is 12 months or less. The standard may also 
require the capitalisation of a lease element of contracts held by the Group which under the existing accounting standard would not be 
considered a lease. Early adoption is permitted if IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ has also been applied, however the Group 
does not expect to undertake this option.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group holds a number of operating leases, which currently, under IAS 17, are expensed on a straight line basis 
over the lease term. The Group has made the following estimates of the approximate impacts of adopting the new standard, which are 
sensitive to all changes up to the application date. If the standard had been adopted in the current year, a depreciation charge of around 
£1.0 million in relation to the right-of-use asset and a finance expense charge of around £0.6 million would have been recognised in place 
of the operating lease charge of £1.3 million. In addition, a right-of-use asset and largely offsetting lease liability of approximately £11.0 million 
would be recognised in the statement of financial position.

The Group has chosen to use a weighted average country tax rate rather than the UK tax rate for the reconciliation of the charge for the year 
to the profit per the Income Statement. The Group operates in several jurisdictions, some of which have a tax rate in excess of the UK tax rate. 
As such, a weighted average country tax rate is believed to provide the most meaningful information to the users of the Financial Statements.
b) Factors affecting tax charge for the year
The tax assessed for the year is lower (2016: lower) than the weighted average Group tax rate of 21.91% (2016: 22.11%) as explained below:

Legislation to reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax to 17% was passed by Parliament in September 2016 to take effect from 1 April 2020. 
The reduction in the main rate to 17% had been substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date and, therefore, the deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are calculated in these Financial Statements at this rate.
In addition to the amount charged to the Income Statement and other Comprehensive Income, the Group has recognised directly in equity:
 e Excess tax deductions related to share-based payments on exercised options
 e Changes in excess deferred tax deductions related to share-based payments, totalling £356,000 deficit: (2016: £22,000 deficit).

brand name, which the Directors believe has an unlimited useful economic life and has a carrying value of £9.2 million. In reaching this 
assessment, the Directors have considered that the RESORBA

Two cash-generating units (CGU) exist within the Branded segment whereby goodwill has been allocated. CGU1 has £1.8 million 
(2016: £1.5 million) of goodwill allocated, and CGU2 has goodwill and indefinite useful life intangible assets of £38.8 million and £9.2 million 
(2016: £37.5 million and £8.9 million) respectively. Only one CGU has been identified within the OEM segment to which goodwill has 
been allocated.
Goodwill arose on the acquisition of Advanced Medical Solutions B.V. on 30 September 2009 and the acquisition of RESORBA
®
 on 
22 December 2011.
The goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful economic life have been allocated to the relevant Business Units in proportion to 
profit from operations on a consistent basis for both segments, as follows:

Consolidated 41,801 9,208 51,009
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts have been determined based on a value-in-use calculation on a cash-generating unit basis, which uses cash flow 
projections based on financial budgets approved by the Directors covering a 12 month period. These budgets have been adjusted for specific 
risk factors that take into account sensitivities of the projection. The base 12 month projection is extrapolated using reasonable growth rates 
specific to each cash generating unit up to year five of between 2% and 14% with growth not exceeding the long-term average growth rate for 
the industry for years six to twenty. A discount rate of between 6.5% and 7.25% per annum (2016: between 6.5% and 7.5%), being the Group’s 
current pre tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risk, has been applied to these cash flows, being an estimation of current market 
risks and the time value of money. The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test. The Directors believe that any 
reasonably possible further change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount is based would not cause any of the carrying 
amounts to exceed the relevant recoverable amount.

The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and trade receivables. The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
No interest is charged on the receivables within the contracted credit period. Thereafter, interest may be charged at 2% per month on the 
outstanding balance. In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade 
receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the Group’s large 
and unrelated customer base. Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance 
for impairments.
Before accepting any new customer, the Group assesses the potential customer’s credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. 
Limits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and reflect current payment history.
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as 
there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable – a large proportion of debts overdue 
over 30 days were recovered post the Balance Sheet date. The Group does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements over these 
balances. The carrying amount and ageing of these debtors are summarised below.

In the year ended 31 December 2017, one customer accounted for more than 10% of the Group’s revenue (2016: none). This customer 
accounted for 14% (£13.2 million across the Branded and OEM segments) of the Group’s revenue in 2017.

T rade payables, other payables and accruals and deferred income principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and 
ongoing costs.
No interest is charged on trade payables that are within pre-agreed credit terms. Thereafter, interest may be charged on the outstanding 
balances at various interest rates. The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the pre-
agreed credit terms.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.

In December 2014 the Group entered into a multi-currency facility with the Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC. The principle features of the 
facility are:
 e The committed value of the facility is £30 million
 e There is an uncommitted accordion of an additional £20 million
 e It is unsecured
 e Facility will expire in December 2019
 e The interest payable on drawings under the loan is based on inter-bank interest (EURIBOR or, if sterling denominated LIBOR) plus a sliding 
scale margin determined by the Group’s leverage
 e The margin is currently 0.65%
 e The facility has two covenants – interest cover (ratio of EBITDA to net finance charges) must be above 4:1 and leverage (ratio of Total Net 
Debt to adjusted EBITDA) should not exceed 3:1
 e It was undrawn at the end of the year
The Risk Management section on pages 30 to 33 provides an explanation of the financial risks faced by the Group and the objectives and 
policies for managing those risks including hedging practices adopted. The information below deals with the financial assets and liabilities.

Risk sensitivity
The Group estimates that a 10% movement in the £:US$ or £:Euro exchange rate would have impacted 2017 Sterling revenues by 
approximately 3.2% and 2.6% respectively and in the absence of any hedging this would have had an impact on profit of 2.7% and 0.3%.
Forward foreign exchange contracts
It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments and receipts.

Investment in own shares
This is the nominal value of the shares held in trust on behalf of employees in respect of the DSB scheme.
Other reserve
This represents Advanced Medical Solutions Limited’s share premium account arising from merger accounting.
Translation reserve
The hedging reserve represents the cumulative amount of gains and losses on hedging instruments deemed effective in cash flow hedges. 
The cumulative deferred gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in profit or loss only when the hedged transaction impacts the 
profit or loss, or is included as a basis adjustment to the non-financial hedged item, consistent with the applicable accounting policy.
Hedging reserve
Exchange differences relating to the translation of the net assets of the Group’s foreign operations, which relate to subsidiaries only, from 
their functional currency into the parent’s functional currency, being Sterling, are recognised directly in the translation reserve. Gains and 
losses on hedging instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations are included in the translation 
reserve. A £2,187,000 gain has been recorded in the translation reserve during the period, which would otherwise have been recognised in 
Administration costs (2016: £8,851,000 gain), if hedge accounting had not been adopted.

Under the terms of the Company’s Share Option Schemes, approved by shareholders in 2010, the Board may offer options to purchase 
Ordinary Shares in the Company to all employees of the Company at the market price on a date to be determined prior to the date of the 
offer. Since 2005, individuals who are entitled to awards under the LTIP are no longer eligible to receive options under the Company’s Share 
Option Schemes.
Performance targets are assessed over a three-year period from the date of grant. Once options have vested they can be exercised during the 
period up to ten years from the date of grant.
The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historic volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three years.
Options have been granted over the following number of Ordinary Shares which were outstanding at 31 December 2017:

Notes to the Company Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2017
1 Significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (‘FRS 101’). 
In preparing these Financial Statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’), but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with 
Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.
In these Financial Statements, the Company has adopted FRS 101.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to share-
based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of an income statement, presentation of a Cash Flow statement, 
presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets business combinations, 
discontinued operations and related party transactions.
Critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the course of preparing the Financial Statements, no critical judgements have been made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 
policies, nor are there any key sources of estimation uncertainty that exist which may cause a material impact in the next 12 months.
Impairment of investments and intragroup receivables
Investment and receivable carrying values are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
of an asset or cash-generating unit is not recoverable. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, as supported by management valuation, 
less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of 
future cash flows have not been adjusted.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Foreign currencies
T ransactions in currencies other than Pounds Sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each 
Balance Sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the 
Balance Sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Gains and 
losses arising on retranslation are included in the profit or loss for the period.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting 
date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Temporary differences in respect of the initial recognition of assets and liabilities that 
affect neither accounting nor taxable profit are not provided for. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of 
realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Trade and other payables
T rade and other payables are non-interest bearing and recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Finance charges
Finance charges comprise interest payable on interest-bearing loans and borrowings and fair value losses on interest rate swap derivative 
financial instruments. Finance charges are recognised in the Income Statement on an effective interest method.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Company’s Balance Sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or 
are transferred. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.

1 Significant accounting policies continued
Derivatives
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and 
investment activities. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading 
purposes. However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments. Derivative financial 
instruments are recognised initially at fair value and re-measured at each period end. The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is 
recognised immediately in the Income Statement. The Company has elected not to apply hedge accounting. Forward currency contracts are 
recognised at fair value in the Balance Sheet with movements in fair value recognised in the Income Statement for the period. The fair value 
of the instruments is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the reporting date, taking into 
account current interest rates and the respective risk profiles of the swap counterparties. 
Derivatives are presented as assets when the fair values are positive and as liabilities when the fair values are negative. 
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and 
it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months.
Share-based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payments.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period. At each Balance Sheet date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to 
vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in 
profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimates with a corresponding adjustment to the equity-settled employee 
benefits reserves.
2 Income Statement
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own Income Statement for the year. 
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc reported a profit for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 of £9,523,000 (2016: profit of 
£18,276,000).
The Auditor’s remuneration for audit and other services is disclosed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The average number of employees in the year was 14 (2016: 11). The Directors’ remuneration is detailed in Note 9 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

exercise all the powers of the Company to allot shares in the Company and to grant rights to subscribe for or to convert any security into 
shares in the Company (each an allotment of ‘relevant securities’) up to an aggregate nominal amount of £3,544,127 provided that this 
authority is for a period expiring upon the earlier of the date of the Company’s next Annual General Meeting and 15 months after the date 
of the passing of this Resolution but the Company may before such expiry make an offer or agreement which would or might require 
relevant securities to be allotted after such expiry and the Directors may allot relevant securities in pursuance of such offer or agreement

(a) in connection with an offer of such securities by way of rights to holders of Ordinary Shares in proportion (as nearly as may be 
practicable) to their respective holdings of such shares, but subject to such exclusions or other arrangements as the Directors may deem 
necessary or expedient in relation to fractional entitlements or any legal or practical problems under the laws of any territory, or the 
requirements of any regulatory body or stock exchange;
(b) otherwise than pursuant to sub-paragraph (a) above up to an aggregate nominal amount of £1,063,238; and
(c) which shall expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company and 15 months after the date of

equity securities to be allotted after such expiry and the Directors may allot equity securities in pursuance of any such offer or agreement 
notwithstanding that the power conferred by this Resolution has expired.
9  That the Company is hereby generally and unconditionally authorised for the purposes of Section 701 of the 2006 Act to make market 
purchases (within the meaning of Section 693(4) of the 2006 Act) of any of its Ordinary Shares of 5p each in the capital of the Company

(b) the minimum price which may be paid for each Ordinary Share is 5p which amount shall be exclusive of expenses, if any;
(c)  the maximum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for each Ordinary Share shall not be more than 5% above the average of 
the middle market quotations for an Ordinary Share as derived from The London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five business 
days immediately preceding the date on which the ordinary share is purchased;
(d) unless previously renewed, revoked or varied, this authority shall expire upon the earlier of the date of the Company’s next Annual 
General Meeting and 15 months after the date of the passing of this Resolution; and
(e) under this authority the Company may make a contract to purchase Ordinary Shares which would or might be executed wholly or partly 
after the expiry of this authority, and may make purchases of Ordinary Shares pursuant to it as if this authority had not expired.

Notes
1  A member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting convened by the Notice set out on page 100 may appoint a proxy to attend, speak 
and, on a poll to vote in his place. A holder of more than one Ordinary Share may appoint different proxies in relation to each or any of those 
Ordinary Shares.
2  A member may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. A member 
may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. To appoint more than one proxy notice must be given 
to the Company’s Registrars not later than 48 hours before the time appointed for the holding of the meeting.
3  A proxy does not need to be a member of the Company but must attend the meeting to represent you. Details of how to appoint the 
Chairman of the meeting or another person as your proxy using the proxy form are set out at Note 1 of the proxy form. If you wish 
your proxy to speak on your behalf at the meeting you will need to appoint your own choice of proxy (not the Chairman) and give your 
instructions directly to them.
4  On a vote on a Resolution on a show of hands at the meeting, a proxy has one vote for and one vote against if the proxy has been 
appointed by more than one member and the proxy has been instructed by one or more of the members to vote for the resolution and by 
one or more other member to vote against it.
5  Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its powers 
as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.
6  A form of proxy is enclosed for use by members. To be effective, it must be completed and arrive not later than 48 hours before the time 
fixed for the Meeting at Link Asset Services, PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU. You may also deliver by hand to The 
Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU during usual business hours.
7  The Register of Directors’ Interests in the shares of the Company will be available for inspection at the registered office of the Company 
during usual business hours on any weekday (public holidays excepted) until the date of the Meeting and also on that date and at the place 
of the Meeting from 9.00 am until the conclusion of the Meeting.
8  The Company, pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, specifies that only those shareholders registered 
in the Register of Members of the Company as at close of business on 4 June 2018 shall be entitled to attend or vote at the aforesaid 
Annual General Meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their names at that time. Changes in the entries in the relevant 
register of Securities after close of business on 4 June 2018 shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at 
the meeting.
Notes on Special Business
Resolution 7: Authority to Allot Shares and other relevant securities
This Resolution would give the Directors the authority to allot Ordinary Shares up to an aggregate nominal amount equal to £3,544,127 
(representing 70,882,544 Ordinary Shares of 5p each). This amount represents approximately one-third of the issued Ordinary Share capital 
of the Company as at 29 March 2018, the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice.
The authority sought under this resolution will expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company held in 2019 or, 
if earlier, 15 months after the passing of the resolution.
While the Directors have no present intention of issuing any of the authorised but unissued share capital, it is considered prudent and 
appropriate to maintain the flexibility that this authority provides.
Resolution 8: Disapplication of Pre-emption Rights
Your Directors also require additional authority from shareholders to allot shares or grant rights over shares or sell treasury shares where they 
propose to do so for cash and otherwise than to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. Accordingly, Resolution 8 will 
be proposed as a Special Resolution to grant such authority. Apart from rights issues, open offers or any other pre-emptive offer as mentioned 
the authority will be limited to the issue of shares and sales of treasury shares for cash up to an aggregate nominal value of £1,063,238 (being 
10% of the Company’s issued Ordinary Share capital at 29 March 2018, the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice). This is 
in keeping with the extent for which such authority has been sought and given at each previous Annual General Meeting of the Company 
since 2006.
Allotments made under the authorisation in paragraph (a) of Resolution 8 would be limited to allotments by way of a rights issue only 
(subject to the right of the Directors to impose necessary or appropriate limitations to deal with, for example, fractional entitlements and 
regulatory matters).
If given, this authority will expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company held in 2019 or, if earlier, 15 months after 
the passing of the Resolution.
101 Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2017
Resolution 9: Purchase by the Company of its own shares
In certain circumstances, it may be advantageous for the Company to purchase its own shares. Under section 701 of the 2006 Act, the 
Directors of a Company may make market purchases of that Company’s shares if authorised to do so. Your Directors believe that granting 
such approval would be in the best interests of shareholders in allowing Directors the flexibility to react promptly to circumstances requiring 
market purchases.
Accordingly, Resolution 9, which will be proposed as a Special Resolution, will give the Directors the authority to purchase issued shares of the 
Company under section 701 of the 2006 Act.
The authority contained in this Resolution will be limited to an aggregate nominal value of £531,619 (representing 5% of the issued Ordinary 
Share capital of the Company as at 29 March 2018, the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice; representing 10,632,381 
Ordinary Shares of 5p each). The price which may be paid for those shares is also restricted as set out in the Resolution.
This authority will expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company held in 2019 or, if earlier, 15 months after the 
passing of the Resolution.
The Board has no present intention of exercising this authority. However, this will be kept under review, and the Board will use this power only 
if and when, taking account of market conditions prevailing at the time, other investment opportunities, appropriate gearing levels and the 
overall financial position of the Group, they believe that the effect of such purchases will be in the best interests of shareholders generally and 
that they will result in an increase in earnings per share.
Shares purchased under this authority may be held as treasury shares. Shares held in treasury do not carry voting rights and no dividends will 
be paid on any such shares. Shares held in treasury in this way can be sold for cash or cancelled. This would allow the Company to manage its 
capital base more effectively and to replenish its distributable reserves.
If and when the Board resolves to exercise its authority to make market purchases, it will at that time decide whether shares purchased are to 
be cancelled or held in treasury.
As at 29 March 2018, the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice, there were share options outstanding over Ordinary Shares, 
representing 2.6% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. The Company has no warrants in issue in relation to its shares. If the buyback 
authority was to be exercised in full, these options would represent 2.7% of the Company’s ordinary issued share capital.
