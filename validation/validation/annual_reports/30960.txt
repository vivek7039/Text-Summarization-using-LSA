GMS AT A GLANCE
A WORLD LEADER  
IN SESVs
Gulf Marine Services is the operator of the world’s largest fleet of 
advanced self-propelled self-elevating support vessels (SESVs).
About us
GMS assets provide a stable platform for  
the delivery of a wide range of services 
performed by the Group’s national and 
international oil company clients and 
engineering, procurement and construction 
contractors throughout the life cycle of 
offshore oil and gas projects and operators 
in the renewable energy (wind farm-related) 
industry. Our vessels are capable of 
operations in water depths of up to 80m  
that are typically found in the Middle East, 
South East Asia, West Africa and Europe. 
We pride ourselves on being at the forefront 
of technological innovation and construct 
and maintain our own vessels at our 
quayside yard in Abu Dhabi. Our extensive 
new build programme in recent years has 
made the GMS fleet one of the most 
sophisticated in the industry. 
A modern fleet fit for the future 
The Group’s core fleet of 13 SESVs is amongst 
the youngest in the industry, with an average 
age of just seven years, and this makes it 
highly attractive to clients seeking to charter 
the most advanced and cost-efficient vessels 
for their current and longer-term operations. 
Our SESVs are four-legged vessels that  
move independently, with no requirement  
for anchor handling or tug support. They  
have a large deck space, crane capacity and 
accommodation facilities that can be adapted 
to the requirements of our clients. These 
vessels support our clients in a broad range  
of offshore oil and gas platform refurbishment 
and maintenance activities, well intervention 
work and offshore wind turbine maintenance 
work (which are opex-led activities), as well  
as offshore oil and gas platform installation and 
decommissioning and offshore wind turbine 
installation (which are capex-led activities).
Small Class
• 6 units
• Average age: 11 years
• Water depth: 45m
• Accommodation for  
up to 300 people
Mid-Size Class
• 3 units

GMS supports:
• Well intervention services and 
enhanced oil recovery
• Drilling support, completions  
and testing
• Platform construction, hookup  
and commissioning
• Platform restoration and maintenance
• Coil tubing, wireline and snubbing
• Well abandonment and 
decommissioning
• Wind turbine installation  
and maintenance
• Offshore wind farm substation 
commissioning and maintenance
What differentiates GMS from other operators? 
• Pioneering development of Large Class and Mid-Size Class SESVs.
• All our SESVs have four legs; this, combined with our dynamic positioning system 
on our Large Class and Mid-Size Class vessels, helps us to position our vessels 
very close to our clients’ installations and provides a significantly more stable and 
reliable platform than three-legged jackup vessels. 
• All our SESVs are self-propelled; they do not need costly support vessels for travel 
and manoeuvres, saving our clients both time and money.
• We design, build and operate our own SESVs. 
• We are at the forefront of technological innovation; we use our in-house expertise  
to enhance the design of our vessels and expand our services so that we can provide 
flexible, cost-effective, offshore support solutions to our clients.
More information on the above can be found on pages 10 to 13.
GMS at the forefront of 
technological innovation  
for 40 years – expanding  
markets and services 
GMS was established in Abu Dhabi, UAE  
in 1977 and in 1982 pioneered the design, 
build and operation of the first purpose built 
four-legged self-propelled SESV in the Gulf. 
This Small Class vessel design provided 
clients in the Gulf with a low cost alternative 
‘workhorse’ for multi-move well servicing 
activities, with greater stability and quicker 
jacking speeds than the customary 
three-legged vessels. GMS successfully 
expanded its fleet and geographical 
coverage, from a local operation in Abu 
Dhabi to become one of the largest 
operators of self-propelled SESVs in the 
world. The Group listed on the London  
Stock Exchange in March 2014.
In 2010 the Group designed and delivered 
the first Large Class SESV. This Class 
includes dynamic positioning systems and  
is capable of working in harsh weather and 
deeper water environments. GMS was now 
able to expand its operations into Europe 
and deployed two Large Class vessels to the 
region to support clients in the oil and gas 
sector and, for the first time, in the offshore 
wind power installation market. 
From 2014 to early 2017 GMS embarked on 
a new build programme to expand the fleet 
by a further six SESVs as part of our strategy 
to widen our market opportunities. This 
included the introduction of our Mid-Size 
Class vessels, which also have dynamic 
positioning and can work in harsh weather 
environments, and these have successfully 
bridged the gap between our Large and 
Small Class vessels. In 2016, the Group 
developed the world’s first cantilever system 
for an SESV. This system, complete with  
a well workover unit, allows GMS to deliver  
a greater range of services from its  
SESVs and to carry out work that would 
otherwise be performed by more expensive  
non-propelled drilling rigs. The last of the  
six new vessels to be delivered was our 
Large Class vessel GMS Evolution, which 
was commissioned in Q2 2017.
The ongoing expansion of our services  
is part of our strategic plan to apply our 
ability to innovate technologically to diversify  
into new markets and to increase our 
geographical spread. 
Examples of industry-first projects delivered 
in 2017 can be found in the Operational 
Review on page 21. Information on some  
of the specific benefits our SESVs provide  
to clients can be found in Our Strategy in 
Action on page 13. 6 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I am pleased to be introducing the 
2017 Annual Report for Gulf Marine 
Services, a year in which GMS 
celebrated 40 years of successful 
operations. The Group has made 
good progress in securing new 
contracts despite the protracted 
market recovery.
The Group has delivered an adjusted EBITDA 
for 2017 of US$ 58.5 million (2016: US$ 
106.8 million) in what was a challenging year 
for the oil and gas industry. Our continued 
focus on cost management has enabled  
us to achieve an adjusted EBITDA margin  
of 52% (2016: 60%). A loss for the year of 
US$ 18.2 million (2016: net profit of US$ 29.4 
million) has been reported, although the 
underlying performance after adjusting for 
certain items, was a net profit of US$ 4.8 
million (2016: US$ 50.7 million). 
No dividend will be paid for 2017. The Board 
believes the cash generated by the business 
is better utilised for the reduction of bank 
debt at this time. Shareholder priorities 
continue to be recognised and dividend 
payments will be resumed as soon as 
reasonable financial prudence allows.
During the year we agreed certain amendments 
to our bank facilities, which has increased our 
liquidity and financial flexibility and this will allow 
us to benefit from improving market conditions. 
We have been encouraged by the increasing 
levels of enquiries and tender activity in the 
Middle East and Europe. During 2017, the 
Group secured five new contracts with a 
total charter period of just under eight years. 
Our backlog stands at US$ 160.6 million  
as at 1 March 2018 (all contracts include 
option periods). 
Vessel age has become increasingly  
relevant, with our clients currently able  
to demonstrate a preference for modern 
tonnage. Our investment in our new build 
programme has ensured GMS is well-placed 
to address this in tenders, with our fleet now 
one of the youngest in the industry. The 
performance of our Large and Mid-Size 
Class vessels in particular is notable, with 
these achieving above 70% utilisation. 
We are delighted to have amongst our new 
contract wins two long-term charters for wind 
farm projects in Europe, where the Group 
has worked successfully in the renewable 
energy sector in the past. A good example of 
how we use our operational experience and 
technological expertise to provide tailored 
solutions for our clients is the crew transfer 
system we developed for one of these 
projects, which is discussed later in this report.
I would like to thank all our staff, both 
land-based and offshore, for their hard work 
and their continued commitment to health 
and safety across the business and their 
achievement of zero lost time injuries in 2017 
is excellent. 
The Group is well-positioned to capitalise  
on a market recovery under the leadership  
of our CEO Duncan Anderson and his strong 
management team.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
We were pleased to secure three 
long-term contracts and two short-
term contracts in 2017 in what 
continued to be a challenging 
market for our industry. 
The prolonged downturn affected both our 
vessel utilisation and charter rates (through 
deferral of contract awards, discussed 
further below, and suppressed demand)  
and is reflected in significantly reduced 
profitability reported by GMS for 2017.  
A more stable oil price environment is 
welcomed and it is encouraging to see 
increasing levels of enquiries and tender 
activity for our services in the Middle East 
and Europe.
Group financial performance
Revenue for the year was US$ 112.9 million 
(2016: US$ 179.4 million) and adjusted 
EBITDA was US$ 58.5 million (2016: US$ 
106.8 million). The Group’s continued focus 
on cost management helped to deliver an 
adjusted EBITDA margin of 52% (2016: 60%). 
Although the Company is reporting a statutory 
loss for the year of US$ 18.2 million (2016: 
net profit of US$ 29.4 million), the underlying 
performance after adjusting items, was  
a net profit for the year of US$ 4.8 million 
(2016: US$ 50.7 million). 
During the year we made certain amendments 
to our bank facility agreement that have 
provided the Group with increased liquidity 
and financial flexibility (further details can  
be found in the Financial Review). We were 
pleased to have the full support of our 
banking partners through this process and 
appreciate their confidence in our business.
Fleet utilisation and order book
Utilisation of our core fleet of 13 SESVs was 
61% in the year (2016: 70%), delivering an 
improvement of 13 percentage points on Q4 
2016. Demand has been relatively good for 
the Large Class and Mid-Size Class vessels 
in the current market, with both classes 
achieving utilisation above 70% for 2017 
(Small Class vessel utilisation was 53%).  
This has been a validation of the investment 
in these two vessel classes through our new 
build programme, and it is reassuring to see 
this demand continuing, with contracts in 
place for six of the seven vessels for charters 
from Q2 2018 onwards. 
 
While the extended tender processes and 
delayed contract awards we discussed  
in our Interim Results are continuing to be 
experienced, we have some satisfaction  
in having secured three new long-term 
contracts in the year: a 36-month charter  
for a Mid-Size Class vessel in the MENA 
region, and two charters for Large Class 
vessels totalling 41 months in Europe. Two 
eight-month charters for Large and Mid-Size 
Class vessels were also secured in the 
MENA region. It was particularly pleasing to 
be awarded a 16-month contract extension 
for a Small Class vessel in the MENA region 
in early 2018 by one of our longest standing 
clients. These charter awards, which include 
option periods, represent in excess of  
US$ 150 million of work for the Group. 
The secured backlog is US$ 160.6 million 
(including options) as at 1 March 2018.  
We are encouraged by how the Large and 
Mid-Size Class vessels are performing and 
are seeing utilisation for these trending 
upwards. As demand continues to recover, 
particularly in the MENA region, we would 
then expect to see a return to higher levels  
of utilisation for our Small Class vessels over 
time. The Board’s view for 2018 trading 
remains unchanged, with a gradual recovery 
in market conditions expected to be reflected 
in an improvement over our 2017 results.
Operations
We achieved an excellent safety performance in 
2017, with a total recordable injury rate of zero 
(2016: 0.20) and zero lost time injuries (2016: 
one lost time injury). The total number of man 
hours worked was 4.5 million in 2017 (2016: 
6.0 million man hours). Health, safety and the 
environment continues to be a top priority. 
In 2017 we rationalised our fleet by selling 
our two non-core anchor handling tugs and 
returning a leased vessel to its owner. We 
conducted a full impairment review of our 
fleet during the year, which resulted in a 
previously announced impairment charge of 
US$ 7.3 million on a 35-year-old vessel being 
recorded in the income statement. Our core 
SESV fleet now consists of 13 vessels, with 
an average age of just seven years. This 
makes our fleet one of the youngest in the 
industry, which benefits us in the current 
market environment as clients are expressing 
a preference for modern tonnage in most of 
the major tenders.  9 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
As our new build programme is now 
complete, we have scaled down the  
number of construction personnel at GMS 
substantially, whilst still retaining a small 
complement of staff with the necessary  
key technical expertise to support ongoing 
vessel modification and maintenance 
projects. Our off-hire vessels are able to be 
kept, at a relatively low cost, in operational 
readiness for rapid deployment as new 
charters are secured. 
I would like to thank everyone at GMS for 
their hard work during the year. We once 
again achieved a very low level (less than 1%) 
of technical and operational downtime for 
our chartered vessels and this is a credit to 
our highly skilled and dedicated workforce. 
Expansion of services
We continually seek to enhance the 
capability of our vessels and the services  
we provide so we can deliver the highest 
quality cost-effective offshore support 
solutions to our clients. 
In 2017 we expanded our well services 
capabilities through the development of a 
cantilever system for our Large Class SESVs. 
The combination of a self-propelled jackup 
vessel with a removable cantilever and 
workover unit is a world-first that allows our 
vessel to supplant higher cost non-propelled 
drilling rigs on well workover projects. The 
system was installed on GMS Evolution, which 
became fully operational during the year and 
approval of its Safety Case for well operations 
has been received from the UK Health and 
Safety Executive. We are encouraged by our 
clients’ interest in this cantilever system, which 
will become available following completion  
of GMS Evolution’s long-term contract that 
commences in Q2 this year. 
During the year we also designed and 
developed an innovative crew transfer 
system that was an important element in  
the successful award of a renewable energy 
contract. The transfer system is a retractable 
access tower fitted to our Large Class  
SESV GMS Endeavour, which is providing 
accommodation for our client’s personnel at 
a wind farm project. The tower enables the 
movement of personnel to and from transfer 
vessels while they are working at various 
satellite locations; so our clients benefit from 
a safer and more time-efficient method of 
boarding their personnel than was previously 
available to them. 
Market commentary
Middle East
We are seeing increasing levels of both 
enquiries and tender activity for all our vessel 
classes in the Middle East, although the 
conversion of certain tenders into contracts 
continues to be a protracted process. 
Demand for our SESVs in Saudi Arabia  
has risen and we expanded our operational 
base there during the year to support  
our increased activities in the country.  
The majority of contract opportunities in  
the region over the past few years have  
been shorter term and originated from EPC 
contractors, so it is now reassuring to see 
our NOC clients returning to the market with 
long-term charter requirements for work that 
was previously curtailed.
Europe
While demand in the oil and gas sector in 
Europe continued to be subdued in 2017,  
we have been encouraged by the ongoing 
development of the offshore renewables 
industry in Europe, where we secured two 
long-term contracts during the year. We 
anticipate there will be more opportunities  
for GMS as this sector develops. Our SESVs 
provide a stable accommodation hub for  
our clients’ personnel working on wind farm 
installations where the sea and weather 
conditions are inherently rough. As wind  
farm projects are now being located further 
offshore, frequent personnel transfers to and 
from the shore have become impractical.  
Our vessels are ideally suited to supporting 
these projects as they can remain in-field 
throughout the project and can move rapidly 
between locations using their own propulsion 
according to our clients’ operational needs. 
Rest of World 
We are continuing to actively promote the 
benefits of our SESVs to potential clients as 
we believe there will be suitable opportunities 
in the mid to longer-term for GMS in regions 
outside our current core markets. 
Dividends
No dividend is to be paid for 2017. The Board 
believes the cash generated by the business 
is better utilised for the reduction of bank 
debt at this time. The Board recognises 
shareholder priorities and dividend payments 
will be resumed as soon as reasonable 
financial prudence allows.
Outlook
We would expect the improving oil price 
environment to have a positive influence  
on clients’ activity levels in our markets. 
While the timing of contract awards is 
inevitably linked to our clients’ own operational 
programme, we believe demand for our 
vessels will continue to improve, with utilisation 
expected to increase ahead of day rates. The 
Group will remain focused on maximising 
utilisation whilst managing costs appropriately, 
and deleveraging will continue to be a priority. 
I am confident that with our modern fleet, 
industry-leading operational expertise and 
technological capability we are well-placed 
to capitalise on a recovering market.

to the needs of our clients in 2017 can be 
found on page 21. We will continue to focus  
on providing vessel flexibility as this allows  
us to target a sophisticated, less 
commoditised, niche sector where 
there is less competition for our 
cost-effective solutions, and to 
maximise fleet utilisation. 
Expand our services and  
seek growth opportunities 
We continually pursue ways to expand  
our offering with new ideas and enhanced 
services. During the year we increased our  
well intervention services, expanded our 
operational base in Saudi Arabia and 
strengthened our position in the offshore 
renewables sector in Europe; further  
information can be found on page 23.  
We will continue to seek to expand  
our offering, increase our market  
share and broaden our  
geographical diversity.
Attract and retain  
a talented workforce 
We attract and retain talented people with the 
right skills mix, expertise and potential in order 
to maintain an agile and diverse workforce 
that can safely deliver our flexible offshore 
support services. We provide bespoke training 
for key personnel and train our staff to the 
highest operational standards. We will continue 
to appropriately incentivise our people and to 
encourage their personal career development 
and progression within GMS.
Generate  
long-term 
shareholder 
value
Disciplined cost and 
balance sheet management 
We seek to maintain a prudent financial  
policy with appropriate levels of liquidity.  
During the year, we amended our financial 
structure and this has provided the Group with 
increased operational and financial flexibility; 
further information can be found on page 26. We 
will continue to manage appropriately our 
balance sheet and will maintain our near-term 
focus on reducing levels of bank indebtedness. 
OUR STRATEGY
Our objective is to create long-term shareholder value through the 
delivery of modern, innovative and sustainable solutions to our clients  
in the offshore energy sector. In order to achieve this, we focus on the 
four strategic priorities below.  13 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
For more than 40 years GMS has been delivering high quality offshore 
support to our international energy clients. 
Topside maintenance Well intervention Commissioning  
and accommodation
Wind-farm installation,  
maintenance and accommodation
During the industry downturn of recent years, our strategy has been to ensure the innovative solutions we provide can help our clients  
to realise meaningful cost efficiencies in their own operations, and this has helped us to maximise our vessel utilisation in the challenging 
market environment. 
Our SESVs offer a broad range of services to our oil, gas and renewable energy clients.
The strategic reshaping of our fleet since 2014 (further information on the fleet is available on page 4) has resulted in the GMS core SESV  
fleet being one of the youngest in the industry, with an average age of just seven years. The fleet is non-commoditised in nature and that 
allows us to compete against a diverse range of marine assets, including drilling rigs, accommodation service barges (non-propelled) and 
floating construction vessels. 
Some features of our fleet that directly benefit our clients are shown below. 
A GMS SESV provides Benefits to our clients
Independent self-propelled 
four-legged design for safe  
and efficient operations,  
with rapid move capability. 
SESVs do not require additional tug support or anchor handling vessels and can therefore move more 
efficiently around a client’s field of assets than conventional jackups without self-propulsion. A typical in-field 
move takes GMS a few hours, compared to circa three days for a conventional non-propelled jackup barge. 
Our vessels are ideally suited to well intervention activities that require frequent changes in location. The 
four-legged design allows our vessels to jack up and down securely, in shorter weather windows. Clients 
benefit from increased operational uptime (productivity), reduced costs and lower fuel consumption.
Safe and stable living and 
working environment. 
SESVs provide accommodation for our clients’ workforce (up to 300 people per vessel). The jacked up 
vessel is stable regardless of weather conditions. Personnel can remain comfortably infield for longer 
periods, which allows clients to avoid frequent and expensive personnel transport costs and to benefit from 
increased productivity of its workforce. The deck space is flexible and allows deployment of clients’ own 
equipment and provides a safer, more stable working environment than that of a floating vessel. SESVs  
have integrated cranes, which means that clients do not require additional costly crane barges. The recent 
development of a retractable access tower fitted to one of our vessels enables a safer and more time-
efficient method of boarding large numbers of personnel to crew transfer vessels. 
Cantilever systems fitted  
to the decks of SESVs. 
The SESV with a cantilever system allows us to offer a wider range of well intervention services, including 
well workover operations that were previously only available from higher cost non-propelled drilling rigs.  
With no need for additional support vessels resulting in quicker vessel moves between locations, clients  
can reduce their project costs and increase productivity. 
OUR STRATEGY IN ACTION  14 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
The Group uses a combination of financial and operational  
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure its performance and 
review the impact of its business strategy. The KPIs are continually 
reviewed to ensure that we focus on achieving our strategic objectives 
whilst addressing the principal risks facing the Group.
KPI Description 2017 Performance
Revenue and utilisation Revenue reflects the value of operating activities  
and is derived primarily from the charter day rates 
and utilisation levels achieved.
Utilisation is the percentage of days vessels within 
the core fleet of SESVs are chartered on a day rate 
out of total available days.
The decline in revenue is mainly as  
a result of lower utilisation rates of  
the core SESV fleet combined with 
reduced charter day rates overall. 
The reduction in utilisation is mainly  
as a result of reduced demand for oil 
extraction support services combined 
with protracted tendering processes 
for certain contract awards.
Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted  
EBITDA margin
Adjusted EBITDA is a key profit measure and means 
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation, excluding adjusting items. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin demonstrates our ability 
to convert revenue into profit.
Adjusted EBITDA declined year on 
year mainly reflecting the decrease  
in revenue during the year. 
The adjusted EBITDA margin declined 
as a result of lower utilisation and 
lower day rates reflecting challenging 
trading conditions which was partly 
offset by effective cost management 
and a continued focus on operational 
efficiency.
Adjusted net profit and adjusted DEPS Adjusted net profit measures the net profitability  
of the business excluding adjusting items.
Adjusted DEPS means fully diluted earnings 
per share, which measures the level of net  
profit excluding adjusting items per ordinary 
share outstanding.
Adjusted net profit declined reflecting 
the reduction in revenue with operating 
costs reducing by less than the revenue 
as vessels that were ‘warm stacked’ 
between contracts still incurred certain 
operating costs to be ready for rapid 
redeployment. In addition, there was an 
increase in finance costs mainly relating 
to increased borrowing rates.
The reduction in adjusted DEPS is in line 
with the decline in earnings for the year.
Net debt to proforma EBITDA Net debt to proforma EBITDA is the ratio of net 
debt at year end to earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation, excluding adjusting 
items, as reported under the terms of our bank  
facility agreement. 
This KPI indicates the Group’s level of borrowing 
against operating cash flows.
The net debt to proforma EBITDA  
ratio increased in 2017 primarily on 
account of reduced proforma EBITDA 
which was partly offset by a small 
reduction in net debt. 
The Group remained in full 
compliance with its latest banking 
covenants at year end.

New build programme delivery KPIs measure how 
successful the Group has been in managing vessel 
construction projects in terms of cost control and 
delivery schedule.
Large Class vessel Evolution was 
delivered on time and within budget 
against the original design plans.  
The vessel subsequently underwent 
modifications to install a well 
intervention cantilever system, which 
was commissioned in Q3 2017.
The new build programme announced 
in 2014 has been fully completed and 
future fleet expansion will be subject  
to market demand.
Employees Offshore staff retention shows the percentage 
of senior officers (masters and chief engineers) 
who continued to be employees in the year. 
The percentages shown do not take into account 
employee redundancies. 
Average FTE employees means the average number 
of full time equivalent employees throughout the year 
which provides an indication of the Group’s service 
capacity and scale of operations.
The Group’s continued focus on 
retention policies for key personnel  
has enabled it to retain key personnel 
with the level of offshore staff retention 
being maintained during the year.
Average FTE employees was lowered 
as the Group continued to rationalise 
its headcount in the challenging market 
conditions and as the number of staff 
involved in construction projects 
continued to reduce. The number of 
FTE employees has reduced from  
471 at 31 December 2016 to 444  
at 31 December 2017. This reduction 
process has continued into 2018.
TRIR and LTIR TRIR is the total recordable injury rate per 200,000 
man hours, which provides a measure of the 
frequency of recordable injuries.
LTIR is the lost time injury rate per 200,000 man 
hours which is a measure of the frequency of injuries 
requiring employee absence from work in the year 
for a period of one or more days.
Offshore man hours are calculated based on 
a 24 hour working period per day. 
The Group incurred zero TRIR  
and LTIR incidents in 2017 which 
demonstrates our commitment  
to delivering industry leading 
standards of safety.

RISK MANAGEMENT
The effective identification, management and mitigation of business risks 
and opportunities across the Group are a key priority of the business 
and integral to the successful delivery of the Group’s strategic objectives. 
The Group has a robust risk management system in place to support 
the identification, analysis, evaluation, mitigation and ongoing monitoring 
of risks as shown in the risk management framework below.
The Group’s risk management framework 
encompasses the policies, culture, 
organisation, behaviours, processes, 
systems and other aspects of the Group that, 
taken together, facilitate its effective and 
efficient operation. We recognise that,  
with careful management, risks can offer 
opportunities as well as challenges.
Business risks across the Group are 
addressed in a systematic and consistent 
way through the risk management 
framework, which has clear lines of reporting 
and communication to deal with risk 
management and internal control issues.  
The Board has overall responsibility for 
ensuring that risks are effectively managed. 
However, the Audit and Risk Committee has 
been delegated the responsibility for 
reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal control and procedures for 
the identification, assessment, management, 
mitigation and reporting of risk. 
The internal control process starts with 
identifying risks, compliance matters and 
other issues through regular reviews carried 
out by process owners and facilitated by 
individual departmental risk assessments 
where the process owners regularly assess 
the implications and consequences and 
determine the likelihood of occurrences.  
The risks associated with the delivery of  
the strategy, business plan, annual work 
programme as well as the associated 
mitigation measures, are maintained in a 
series of departmental risk registers which 
are consolidated and reviewed by the senior 
management team to formulate the Group 
risk management process. The outcomes of 
risk identification and control assessments 
are formally reported to the senior 
management team and escalated to the 
Audit and Risk Committee and Board, as 
appropriate. The Board regularly reviews  
all key risks facing the Group as part of the 
Group risk management process which 
ensures that the Board satisfies the UK 
Corporate Governance Code requirement to 
perform a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Company, including those 
that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity.
The Group’s internal audit function has been 
predominantly outsourced to a specialist 
team provided by a reputable third party.  
All internal audit activity conducted by the 
internal audit team is done under the 
direction and leadership of the Finance 
Director, who reports to the Chief Financial 
Officer, but the team also has an 
independent reporting line to the Chairman 
of the Audit and Risk Committee. In the light 
of the internal auditors’ recommendations, 
management agrees and implements 
corrective action plans, which are tracked  
to completion by the internal audit team,  
with the results reported regularly to the 
Audit and Risk Committee and the Board. 17 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017

Principal risks and uncertainties 
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group in the short to medium term are set out below, together with the principal mitigation 
measures. These risks are not intended to be an exhaustive analysis of all risks that may arise in the ordinary course of business or otherwise.
Key:  Risk has increased since 2016  No material change in risk since 2016  Risk has reduced since 2016
Risk Risk profile
Assessment 
of change 
in risk Mitigation, monitoring and assurance
Strategic The macroeconomic environment 
influences the demand for our 
services. Uncertainty over global oil 
prices could influence the levels of 
investment or operating expenditures 
within the industry which could 
adversely affect demand for the 
Group’s oil extraction support 
services. This could lead to lower 
utilisation or lower charter day rates 
causing profit margins to fall. 
Significant changes in the market-
place as a result of the actions of our 
competitors or the entrance of new 
competitors may jeopardise our 
market share or adversely affect 
utilisation levels or charter day rate 
levels achieved.
Over-exposure to any one geographic 
market or loss of a major client or a 
reduction in activity of a major client 
could impact our performance.
Construction and modification flexibility for clients
Our vessels are built to be as flexible as possible allowing us to  
compete for a wide share of the market, helping us to maximise 
utilisation levels and charter day rates. The Group is capable of 
modifying assets to satisfy client requirements and can do so in  
its own yard where appropriate. 
Focus on low cost of production areas such as MENA 
A substantial proportion of the Group’s client base and revenues 
are generated in the MENA region, where the cost of oil production 
is generally lower than in other parts of the world.
Growth and expansion
We lead the field in technological innovation and continually seek to 
expand the range of activities our vessels can perform. In 2017 the 
Group successfully delivered its well intervention cantilever system, 
significantly expanding its well servicing capabilities. It remains the 
intention of the Group to further expand its offering, subject to future 
market demand.
The Group has expansion of its geographical footprint as one of its 
long-term strategic aims as it seeks to diversify into other markets.  
Where possible we strive to have a geographical balance of our 
operations by not limiting our portfolio of clients to one country. 
Opex v capex
The Group provides cost-effective services mainly in the opex phase 
of oil companies’ budgets, supporting long-term oil production which 
historically has tended to be less cyclical than capex phase work. 
Cost management
The Group is focused on controlling costs in order to help achieve 
appropriate profit margins whilst having the ability to offer competitive 
pricing to clients. 
Commercial The reliance of the Group on a 
limited number of blue chip clients 
may expose us to losses in the event 
of client relationship disruptions.
The Group may not be able to  
win new contracts or retain existing 
contracts including clients not  
opting to exercise contractual option  
periods because of the actions of 
competitors. This could lead to lower 
vessel utilisation or lower charter day 
rates causing profit margins to fall.
The Group may not be able to 
secure long-term contracts or certain 
clients could cancel contracts, which 
may lead to commercial downtime 
between contracts and lower overall 
average utilisation.
Flexibility and innovation
We seek to continually improve our offering through innovation including 
new vessel designs and specification improvements by responding 
directly to client feedback.
Market knowledge and operational expertise
The Group has a clear record of established long-term relationships 
in the MENA region and North West Europe, which helps provide a clear 
understanding of our clients’ requirements and operating standards.  
We believe that the Group continues to have a competitive edge over 
most other alternative providers of vessels through our operational 
expertise and the high quality specifications of our offshore solutions. 
Tender approach
We compete in tenders for all vessels nearing the end of their firm 
contracts, ensuring that, if a client chooses not to exercise their option, 
other opportunities should not be missed. The Group continually 
monitors and tracks its pipeline of new contract opportunities.
The Group’s robust operating standards result in minimal downtime 
which helps ensure that clients are not given cause to cancel contracts 
through non-performance. 
Investments Delays in completion or errors in 
assessing the impact of new strategic 
expansion projects could result in 
decreased margins and market share.
 
Board oversight
The Board has oversight of approving and monitoring strategic projects.
Project management
Extensive project management controls and processes are adhered  
to throughout project life cycles. 18 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
Risk Risk profile
Assessment 
of change 
in risk Mitigation, monitoring and assurance
People As the market recovers the Group 
may incur challenges in recruiting  
and retaining the required calibre  
of staff which could lead to an 
increase in operating costs or 
influence effectiveness.
The Group’s success depends  
on our ability to attract and retain 
sufficiently qualified and experienced 
personnel, particularly at senior 
management levels. 
Failure to attract, develop and retain 
sufficient competent senior offshore 
staff to support our clients’ needs 
could result in operational issues 
on-board vessels.
Succession planning
The Group maintains detailed management succession plans for key 
personnel which are monitored by the Group HR team. The current 
macroeconomic environment has resulted in a wider external talent  
pool available for certain roles within the Group.
Following completion of the new build programme, key technical 
personnel who were involved in vessel construction projects were 
integrated within the Operations Department to assist in vessel 
modification and maintenance projects. This has enabled the Group to 
retain key technical skills and expertise in our fleet of high quality vessels.
Learning and development
The Group is committed to providing bespoke training and development 
paths for key personnel and invests heavily in learning and development 
with a major focus on regular training for our safety critical, senior 
operational and management roles. 
Competitive remuneration packages
The Group has a competitive remuneration structure that aims to attract, 
motivate and retain suitably qualified personnel through performance-
based reward practices.
Financial Macro and micro economic events, 
such as a sustained low oil price, 
may impact our ability to raise 
finance, achieve forecast, effectively 
manage our working capital and 
service our financial obligations.
A sustained reduction in charter 
day rates and/or utilisation levels 
could lead to a breach in certain 
debt covenants.
Failure of the Group to service its 
debts and comply with debt 
covenants could result in negative 
repercussions for the Group 
including restriction of funding.
The Group may use external funding  
in financing major projects, and inability 
to obtain the required funding may 
hamper the successful undertaking 
of capital-intensive projects.
Banking covenants which place 
restrictions on capital expenditure 
and other uses of funding, when 
leverage is above certain levels, 
could restrict commercial and 
investment opportunities for the 
Group in the near term. 
Robust monitoring
The Group has robust procedures in place for financial planning and 
forecasting. Management and the Board regularly monitor the Group’s 
debt obligations and funding requirements which enables careful 
ongoing assessment of liquidity levels and covenant headroom.
Availability of funding
We maintain a close working relationship with our banking syndicate and 
in 2017 we amended our bank facility agreement providing extended 
repayment terms and increased financial flexibility. The Group’s near 
term focus is on reducing leverage levels.
Key performance indicators (KPIs)
Transparent KPIs are used for reporting to track progress. The KPIs  
are reviewed regularly to ensure management has all the necessary 
information to make timely financial decisions.
Policies and procedures
We adhere to Group-wide financial and accounting policies which 
underpin our approach to risk management. 
Compliance 
and 
regulation 
Non-compliance with anti-bribery 
and corruption regulations could 
damage stakeholder relations and 
lead to reputational and financial 
loss.
Failure to appropriately identify and 
comply with laws and regulations  
and other regulatory statutes in new 
and existing markets could lead to 
regulatory investigations.
Code of conduct
The Group has a Code of Conduct with which employees are required  
to comply when conducting business on behalf of the Group; this includes 
anti-bribery and corruption policies.
Due diligence
Prior to venturing into new markets, the Group performs substantial  
due diligence work and obtains an understanding of the governing laws 
and regulations. Group legal and external counsel support are utilised  
as necessary.

Health, 
Safety, 
Security, 
Environment 
and Quality
The Group may suffer commercial 
and reputational damage as a result 
of an environmental or safety 
incident involving our employees, 
visitors or contractors.
Our operations have an inherent 
safety risk due to our offshore 
operations. We have a fundamental 
obligation to protect our people and 
recognise the implications of poor 
safety procedures.
Safety awareness
Safety and assurance continues to be a top priority and is underpinned  
by our HSSEQ management system and strong safety-focused culture. 
Management ensures appropriate safety practices and procedures, 
disaster recovery plans and the insurance coverage of all commercial 
contracts are in place both prior to acceptance and during contract delivery.
Training and compliance
Our employees undergo continuous training and sensitisation on 
operational best practices.
Scheduled maintenance
The Group follows regular maintenance schedules on its vessels and the 
condition of the vessels is consistently monitored. 
Operational There is a risk that the Group’s assets 
may not be fit for purpose or may fail 
to operate in the manner intended by 
management. Failure to deliver the 
expected operational performance 
could result in reputational damage, 
litigation, reduced profit margins or 
loss of clients.
Changes in the political regimes, civil 
and political unrest or sanctions in 
the jurisdictions in which we operate 
could adversely affect our 
operations.
The Group may not be able to deploy 
stacked vessels timely for new 
contracts which could limit operational 
readiness. Also deployment costs  
of previously stacked vessels could  
be significant.
There is a risk that cybersecurity 
incidents could lead to financial  
loss and reputational damage due  
to a breach of confidential data or 
technology disruption caused by  
an internal or external attack.
Vessel monitoring
The Group constantly monitors the condition of the vessels and other 
equipment which undergo mandatory dry docking within the specified 
timeframes. The Group has policies and procedures in place such as the 
Planned Maintenance System to ensure that the vessels undergo regular 
preventative maintenance.
Emergency plans and insurance
For all our major assets and areas of operation, the Group maintains 
emergency preparedness plans. We regularly review the insurance 
coverage over the Group’s assets to ensure adequate cover is in place.
Constant review
The Group remains vigilant to potential changes and risks and may 
engage with governments and legal counsel to ensure a comprehensive 
view of our stakeholders is presented. The Group constantly monitors  
the ever-changing political landscape in the regions that are considered 
volatile or unpredictable.
Readiness for deployment
The Group carefully plans the stacking of vessels and maintains  
detailed deployment plans to ensure vessels can be brought back  
into operation efficiently.
Cybersecurity monitoring and defence
GMS operates multi-layer cybersecurity defences which are monitored for 
effectiveness and to ensure they remain current. Extensive monitoring of 
attempts to breach IT systems take place with detailed analysis to help 
ensure potential threats are identified and effectively mitigated. 
Other considerations 
The Directors have given consideration to 
other risks that the Group may be exposed  
to including risks associated with climate 
change, and the uncertainty associated  
with the UK’s decision to leave the European 
Union. The Directors concluded that whilst 
these risks exist, overall they were not 
considered to be material and therefore did 
not constitute one of the Group’s principal 
risks and uncertainties.
Longer-term viability
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Directors 
have assessed the prospects of the Group 
over a three year period to December 2020. 
The Board believes that a viability 
assessment for a period of three years is 
appropriate for the following reasons:
(i) it aligns with the Group’s annual strategic 
plan which covers three years; 
(ii) the Company has a reasonable ability to 
forecast its likely contracting 
opportunities and successes up to three 
years; and
(iii) a longer period of assessment is not 
considered appropriate given that a 
proportion of the variability in plans and 
budgets for the Company is influenced  
by sentiment surrounding oil price. 
The Board reviews annually and on  
a rolling basis the strategic plan for the 
business which management progressively 
implements. The Group’s business model  
has proven to be resilient over the  
long term in previous down turns in the 
macroeconomic environment. 
The viability assessment takes into account 
expected future tender activity levels and the 
Group’s anticipated success in winning 
contracts. There are inevitably uncertainties 
attached to this assessment, and the Group’s 
business model was stress tested against a 
range of significant adverse scenarios, both 
individually and in combination to validate the 
robustness of the model and financial position 
(including consideration of compliance with 
banking covenants and loan repayment 
commitments), together with the effectiveness 
of mitigating actions available to the business. 
The assessment took into consideration the 
potential impact that the Group’s principal 
risks and uncertainties detailed above on 
pages 17 to 19, could have on the Group’s 
business model, liquidity and future 
performance over the review period. As part 
of its assessment the Directors have also 
considered the robust risk management 
framework in place to monitor and mitigate its 
exposure to the principal risks. The scenario 
analysis performed specifically considered  
the potential impact on our business of a 
sustained period of low oil prices, primarily 
through reducing revenues and cash inflows 
by incorporating prolonged reductions in 
charter day rates and utilisation levels.
Based on the results of this analysis the 
Board has concluded that there is a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will  
be able to continue in operation and meet  
its liabilities as they fall due over the three 
year period of the assessment. 20 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017

HSSEQ
Health, safety and the environment continue 
to be our top priority and we delivered an 
excellent safety performance in the year,  
with a total recordable injury rate** of zero 
(0.20 in 2016) and zero lost time injuries**  
(one lost time injury in 2016). 
 
The total number of man hours worked was 
4.5 million in 2017 (6.0 million man hours in 
2016). This reduction in man hours reflects 
the lower level of activity following the 
completion of the new build programme  
in 2016 and reduced vessel utilisation. 
While we have scaled down the number of 
our construction personnel, we have ensured 
the retention of a small complement of staff 
with the necessary key technical expertise  
to support ongoing vessel modification and 
maintenance projects. 
We are committed to providing all our 
personnel with a quality and safe working 
environment at all times whilst under our 
duty of care and will maintain our focus  
on HSE. 
Our operations team has extensive 
operational experience in the global SESV 
sector and can draw on in-house expertise 
for vessel construction and modification, 
technical asset integrity, marine assurance 
and well operations as it delivers our 
premium fleet and services to our clients. 
A significant achievement in 2017 was the 
team’s completion and installation of our 
innovative cantilever system for GMS 
Evolution. We are proud to have developed 
this industry-first system, which has 
broadened the scope of well services we  
can offer to our clients. Further information 
on the cantilever is provided below.
During the year, we continued to achieve 
efficient mobilisations and a high level of 
client satisfaction. We also ensured that 
GMS is well-positioned to react quickly as 
the market recovers by keeping our off-hire 
vessels in a state of readiness, at a relatively 
low cost, for rapid deployment when new 
charters are awarded.
SESV charter rates, utilisation 
and operating costs
While 2017 continued to be a challenging 
year in our sector, utilisation of our core 
SESV fleet improved 15 percentage points 
on Q4 2016, with a rate of 61% delivered for 
the year. Demand has been relatively good 
for both the Large Class and Mid-Size 
Classes, which each achieved utilisation 
above 70% for 2017. 
The Group’s business continues to be heavily 
weighted towards clients’ opex-based 
activities, with 71% of our total 2017 revenue 
coming from this segment. As shown in the 
table below, charter rates incurred some 
downward pressure during the year. Further 
information on vessel revenue by Class is 
provided in the Financial Review on page 24. 
Through the successful implementation  
of our cost reduction programme from 
mid-2016, we managed to keep our average 
daily vessel operating costs for the year  
at very similar levels to 2016 and it is 
commendable that these costs have been 
reduced by around 25% since 2015. 
 
Operational activity was predominantly in  
the maintenance, accommodation and well 
servicing sector. We were pleased to deliver 
a very low technical and operational 
downtime of less than 1% for our chartered 
vessels, with 198 rig moves and 41 client 
wells serviced.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
Fitted to the bottom of each of the four legs of a GMS 
SESV are spudcans. The size and geometry of these 
substantial inverted cones are the key to securing our 
vessel to the seabed. In 2017, the specific soil conditions 
at a new NOC client’s offshore location in Europe 
required a 75% increase in the surface area of the 
spudcans to ensure the secure installation of our Large 
Class SESV next to our client’s operations. GMS 
successfully delivered the solution to the client in the form 
of four innovative removable rings or ‘shoes’, one for each 
leg, which extended the surface area of the existing  
spud cans. The shoes were built with 180 tonnes of steel, 
much of which is special grade and up to 60mm thick, 
and can be detached once the offshore project is completed 
and used elsewhere as required. 
ENLARGED 
SPUDCANS 
FOR GMS SESV 
PROVIDED  
A BESPOKE 
SOLUTION FOR 
OUR CLIENT 
We have expanded our well services capabilities 
through the development of a cantilever system 
for our Large Class SESVs. The innovative 
combination of a self-propelled jackup vessel 
with a removable cantilever and workover unit  
is not only the first to achieve ABS Self Elevating 
Drilling Unit certification, it is also the first mobile 
offshore drilling unit of its kind in the industry.  
The system was installed on GMS Evolution, 
which became fully operational during the  
year and approval of its Safety Case for well 
operations has been received from the UK  
Health & Safety Executive. 
The cantilever system allows our vessel to 
supplant higher cost non-propelled drilling rigs  
on well workover projects by offering greater 
operational efficiencies, quicker servicing times 
and lower costs. This complete system allows  
us to perform operations such as plugging and 
abandonment, light drilling, change out of electric 
submersible pumps and completions. 
 
GMS Evolution, complete with the cantilever,  
has now relocated to Europe where it has been 
chartered by a new client to support a renewable 
energy project from Q2 this year, however, the 
cantilever system will become available after 
completion of this long-term contract. GMS 
Evolution was transported from Abu Dhabi to the 
UK on the Norwegian-owned 265 meter, 34,700 
tonne heavy transport vessel Albatross. This vast 
vessel delivered our SESV to the Port of Blyth  
in Northumberland, where it was being prepared 
for deployment to the above contract, and was 
the largest ship to visit the harbour in the history 
of the Port. 
WORLD  
FIRST SESV 
CANTILEVER 
SYSTEM
During the year we also developed an innovative crew 
transfer system for one of our Large Class SESVs that  
will be providing mobile accommodation for our client’s  
personnel working on a wind farm project. The system 
provides a retractable access tower that enables the safe 
and efficient high volume movement of personnel to and 
from our vessel to crew transfer vessels that dock against 
the access tower whilst our SESV remains jacked up on 
location, which is an industry first. This system helps to 
deliver a more cost-effective use of the project’s offshore 
accommodation provision and the SESV’s working deck 
by negating the need to frequently jack down to allow  
the transfer of personnel and equipment to and from  
the shore.

CONTINUED
ENSURING OUR HIGHLY 
SPECIALISED CREW IS  
READY TO DEPLOY ON  
NEW CHARTERS
GMS already retains critical specialist personnel in 
the fields of electrical, jacking, crane and dynamic 
positioning, and our managers have extensive 
industry experience as naval architects, oil and gas 
specialists, marine engineers and master mariners. 
As the industry recovers, we will need to recruit more 
offshore personnel as new contracts are secured 
and our off-hire vessels are re-chartered. Our GMS 
Training Academy is of great benefit to the Group  
as it allows us to efficiently equip our newly recruited 
experienced and qualified mariners with the 
additional, highly specialised skills needed to operate 
our SESVs. We have already recruited a number  
of Saudi nationals in recognition of our client Saudi 
Aramco’s nationalisation targets and to support  
our increasing operations in the country, and these 
are receiving training through our Academy. This 
in-house training resource ensures we can mobilise 
our vessels in a timely manner as new contracts  
are awarded.
Setting the industry benchmark  
for SESV training
In 2017 GMS designed and developed the SESV 
Move and Positioning Course in 2017. It is a 
testament to the expertise and experience of all 
GMS personnel involved that the course has  
been adopted by the International Jack-up Barge 
Operators Association (IJUBOA) and assured by 
the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) as an 
industry training standard and is being provided  
to operators of jackup barges through third party 
international marine and offshore training providers.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT

Markets
Middle East
We are seeing improvements in levels of 
enquiries and tender activity for all our vessel 
classes in the Middle East, with this region 
being our largest market in 2017. It is now 
reassuring to see a re-emergence of 
longer-term charter requirements from our 
NOC clients, as over the past few years the 
majority of contracts have been of a shorter 
term nature and originated from EPC 
contractors. We commenced two long-term 
charters in the region in H1 2017 and a 
further two new charters that were secured 
during the year are scheduled to commence 
in Q2 2018. In 2017 we expanded our 
operational base in Saudi Arabia to support 
increased activities there. 
Europe
We have been encouraged by the demand 
for our SESVs in Europe. One of our Large 
Class SESVs commenced a new contract  
in Q2 2017 to support maintenance work  
in the oil and gas sector in Europe. We were 
also pleased to secure two long-term 
contracts for Large Class vessels for wind 
farm projects in the region, with these 
scheduled to commence in Q2 2018. 
We believe there will be more opportunities 
for GMS in the offshore renewable energy 
sector. As wind farms are increasingly being 
located further offshore, there will be a 
requirement for mobile accommodation  
for the workforce located close to the work 
site, during both the construction and 
maintenance phases. Our SESVs are ideal  
as they provide a stable platform on which 
our clients’ personnel are accommodated 
and can remain on location throughout the 
entire project. The vessels can also move 
rapidly between in-field locations, which 
helps to increase our clients’ operational 
uptime. In addition, we have developed  
a solution for our renewable energy client  
in Europe that reduces the time needed to 
safely board their personnel (as described 
above). We will continue to use our technical 
capabilities to differentiate GMS as a key 
service provider for this market. 
Decommissioning in the North Sea remains  
a significant source of potential demand for 
GMS and we remain ready to work within 
this sector, as our cantilever systems for  
our Large Class SESVs lend themselves 
particularly to the cost-effective plug and 
abandonment of old wells, a key step in the 
decommissioning process. 
Rest of World 
We are continuing to promote the benefits  
of our fleet to potential clients outside our 
current core markets where we believe we 
are well-placed to win new business in the 
mid to longer-term. For example, our vessels 
are ideally suited to support asset life 
extension projects on ageing oil producing 
infrastructure in South East Asia, where 
factors such as water depth and weather 
conditions present no difficulties for our fleet. 
Summary
We are seeing increasing utilisation of our 
vessels, the majority of which were chartered 
during the year, and have maintained  
our service quality and focus on cost 
management in what was another challenging 
year for our industry. We have continued  
to broaden our markets and have expanded 
our services offering. With the market 
environment showing signs of improvement, 
we are well-placed, with a young and flexible 
fleet, to maximise new opportunities for GMS.  24 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017

Overview
The Group’s results for 2017 reflect the 
continued challenges within the oil and gas 
industry. Revenue for the year was lower at 
US$ 112.9 million (2016: US$ 179.4 million) 
with adjusted EBITDA of US$ 58.5 million 
(2016: US$ 106.8 million). The decrease  
in revenue reflects the deferral of certain 
contracts in 2017, along with a reduction  
in utilisation levels and overall lower charter 
day rates. Our continued focus on cost 
management helped achieve an adjusted 
EBITDA margin of 52% (2016: 60%). Adjusted 
net profit reduced to US$ 4.8 million (2016: 
US$ 50.7 million) and adjusted diluted EPS 
was 1.26 cents (2016: 14.35 cents). The loss 
for the year of US$ 18.2 million (2016: net 
profit of US$ 29.4 million) includes a 
non-cash impairment charge of US$ 7.3 
million on a 35-year old vessel (Naashi), and 
the expensing of US$ 15.6 million of debt 
modification costs with US$ 9.7 million of 
these costs representing the expensing  
of unamortised costs paid in previous years 
relating to the former bank facility. The loss 
incurred in 2017 reflects the first full year  
of trading in this more challenging market 
environment, with the comparative results 
having the benefit of the unwinding of contracts 
secured prior to the market downturn.
The Group continues to generate positive 
operating cash flows. The total capital 
expenditure for 2017 was US$ 29.7 million 
(2016: US$ 106.0 million). This was primarily 
invested on the completion of the Large 
Class vessel GMS Evolution including the 
new well intervention cantilever system 
(which was commissioned in Q3 2017).  
The Group has now concluded the new  
build programme, commenced in 2014, and 
we currently expect no significant capital 
expenditure in 2018 and beyond.
The Group amended its bank facilities  
in 2017 to increase liquidity and financial 
flexibility. The net bank debt level (total bank 
borrowings less cash) was US$ 372.8 million 
at the year end (2016: US$ 373.5 million). 
We continued our emphasis on maintaining a 
stable financial structure. Dividend payments 
have been suspended while we focus on 
reducing our bank debt. We will continue to 
manage our costs appropriately with cash 
conservation and deleveraging being key 
priorities.
The following sections discuss the Group’s 
adjusted results as the Directors consider 
that they provide a useful indicator of 
underlying performance. The adjusting items 
are discussed below in this review and  
a reconciliation between the adjusted and 
statutory results is contained in note 6.  
It is noted that the 2016 comparative figures 
presented reflect better trading levels 
compared to more recently as a significant 
portion of revenue in 2016 (H1 2016 in 
particular) was derived from contracts  
that had been signed prior to the market 
downturn and lower oil prices.
Revenue and segmental profit 
Revenue decreased by 37% in 2017 to  
US$ 112.9 million (2016: US$ 179.4 million). 
The decrease in revenue primarily reflects  
the reduction in the core SESV fleet 
utilisation to 61% (2016: 70%) and overall 
lower charter day rates during the year. 
During the year 70% of total Group revenue 
was derived from customers located in the 
MENA region (2016: 74%) while the remaining 
30% of revenue was earned from customers 
in Europe (2016: 26%). We diversified our 
revenue mix within the MENA region in 2017 
with 53% of revenue being earned in Saudi 
Arabia, 25% earned in the UAE and 22% 
earned in Qatar (2016: 82% in the UAE, 11% 
in Qatar, 7% in Saudi Arabia). Within Europe 
in 2017 49% of revenue was derived in the 
UK, 41% in the Netherlands and 10% in the 
rest of Europe (2016: 53% in the UK, 36% in 
the Netherlands, 11% in the rest of Europe). 
The table below shows the contribution  
to revenue and segment adjusted gross 
profit or loss (being gross profit excluding 
depreciation, amortisation and impairment) 
made by each vessel class during the year. 
The Large Class vessels segment again 
made the largest contribution to Group 
revenue. The composition of the Other 
vessels segment, which are non-core assets, 
was amended during the year following the 
sale of two anchor handling tugs, and the 
reclassification of the vessel Naashi from 
Small Class vessels to Other vessels 
following its impairment (comparative figures 
have also been adjusted to reflect this).

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
Cost of sales and general and 
administrative expenses
We maintained our focus on cost 
management throughout 2017. We delivered 
on our annualised cash cost saving targets 
previously announced in 2016, realising  
the full benefits from headcount reductions 
and efficiencies within our supply chain  
and operations that were implemented from 
mid-2016. 
Cost of sales, excluding impairment charges, 
decreased by 17% to US$ 69.6 million  
(2016: US$ 83.8 million). Cost of sales 
reduced less than the decrease in revenue, 
as vessels that were ‘warm stacked’ 
between contracts at our own yard still incur 
certain operating costs to be ready for rapid 
redeployment. These warm stacking costs, 
of approximately US$ 2,000 per day, are 
significantly lower than those of peers who 
use third party facilities.
Cost of sales for the year on a cash basis 
(excluding depreciation, amortisation, 
impairment and LTIP charges) reduced by 
25% to US$ 38.9 million (2016: US$ 52.0 
million) primarily reflecting the reduction  
in utilisation rate of the core SESV fleet 
together with the achievement of operational 
efficiencies in the year. There was a small 
reduction in cost of sales on a cash basis 
(excluding depreciation, amortisation, 
impairment and LTIP charges) as a 
percentage of revenue, which decreased 
from 36% in H2 2016 to 34% in 2017. 
General and administrative expenses required 
to support our level of operations in 2017 were 
US$ 16.7 million (2016: US$ 21.6 million), a 
reduction of 23% on 2016. We would expect 
general and administrative expenses to be  
at a higher level going forward as operating 
levels increase. Certain costs previously 
capitalised through our new build programme 
activity will now also be expensed and there 
will be increased costs arising from the 
expansion of our operations in both Saudi 
Arabia and Europe.
During the year the Group undertook an 
impairment assessment of its entire fleet.  
At the 2017 interim results an impairment 
loss of US$ 7.3 million was identified on the 
Group’s oldest SESV (Naashi) as the outlook 
for it had deteriorated due to its age in the 
prevailing market conditions. The non-cash 
impairment charge was recognised in cost  
of sales in the statement of comprehensive 
income. There were no other impairments 
required on the Group’s assets.
Adjusted EBITDA 
Adjusted EBITDA for the year was US$ 58.5 
million (2016: US$ 106.8 million) primarily 
reflecting the reduction in revenue through  
a lower level of utilisation across the core 
SESV fleet. The Group’s adjusted EBITDA 
margin in 2017 was 52% (2016: 60%) with 
the reduction in revenue contribution  
being partly offset through ongoing cost 
management initiatives. 
Finance costs and foreign 
exchange
Net finance costs in 2017 were US$ 38.9 
million (2016: US$ 20.1 million). US$ 15.6 
million of the increase in finance costs arose 
from the expensing of costs incurred of US$ 
14.2 million following the debt modification  
in December 2017 (with US$ 8.3 million  
of these costs representing the expensing  
of unamortised costs relating to the former 
bank facility), and the expensing of 
unamortised commitment fees of US$ 1.4 
million which relates to the voluntary early 
cancellation of an undrawn US$ 95.0 million 
capex loan facility in June 2017. Bank finance 
expenses increased in 2017 as the LIBOR 
rate increased and the cost of borrowing 
from banks is based on a variable rate 
dependent on net leverage levels. The Group 
is currently paying an interest rate of 
approximately 7% on its bank borrowings.
During the year US$ 3.3 million (2016: US$ 
2.4 million) of finance costs were capitalised 
as part of the new build programme as 
directly attributable costs. 
Following the return of a previously leased 
Small Class vessel to its owner in August 
2017, at the end of its five-year lease term, 
the Group holds no vessels under leases. 
Net borrowings reduced by US$ 40.1 million 
as a result.
In 2017 there was a net foreign exchange 
gain of US$ 1.9 million (2016: loss of US$ 1.0 
million) arising mainly from the movement in 
foreign exchange rates, with the Pound 
Sterling strengthening against the US Dollar 
during the year. 
Taxation
The net tax credit for the year was US$ 0.2 
million (2016: tax charge of US$ 1.4 million). 
The net tax credit in 2017 includes a deferred 
tax credit of US$ 0.7 million arising from 
unused trading losses, and a tax refund of 
US$ 2.4 million arising from a change in UK 
legislation. Excluding these tax credits, there 
was an increase in overall tax charge mainly 
resulting from a higher proportion of Group 
revenue being derived in Saudi Arabia  
and Qatar which attract corporate tax.  
The underlying tax charge relating to 2017 
trading was US$ 2.9 million.
Earnings 
The loss for the year of US$ 18.2 million 
(2016: net profit of US$ 29.4 million) includes 
the non-cash impairment charge of US$ 7.3 
million described above, and the expensing 
of US$ 15.6 million of debt modification costs 
with US$ 9.7 million of these costs representing 
the expensing of unamortised costs paid  
in previous years relating to the former  
bank facility.
Adjusted net profit decreased in 2017 to  
US$ 4.8 million (2016: US$ 50.7 million) 
mainly arising from the reduction in revenue 
in the year. The fully diluted adjusted earnings 
per share (DEPS) for the year decreased  
to 1.26 cents (2016: 14.35 cents). Adjusted 
DEPS is calculated based on adjusted  
net profit and a reconciliation between  
the adjusted net profit and statutory loss,  
is provided in note 6. 
Dividends 
As discussed in the Chief Executive’s 
Review, dividend payments have been 
suspended while we focus on reducing  
our bank debt. 
Capital expenditure 
The Group’s capital expenditure during the 
year was US$ 29.7 million (2016: US$ 106.0 
million). The main area of investment was  
the completion of the final new build vessel 
Evolution including the new well intervention 
cantilever system which was commissioned 
in Q3 2017. No significant capital expenditure 
is currently planned in 2018 and beyond with 
ongoing planned capital expenditure limited 
to necessary fleet maintenance. Any further 
capital expenditure would relate to contract 
specific requirements that may be required 
as new work is secured. 
Cash flow and liquidity
The Group’s net cash flow from operating 
activities was a net inflow of US$ 56.3 million 
in 2017 (2016: net inflow of US$ 126.3 million) 
with the reduction in cash inflow reflecting 
the decrease in revenue in the year. The  
net cash outflow from investing activities  
for 2017 reduced to US$ 21.7 million  
(2016: net outflow of US$ 149.2 million)  
as new build construction activities ceased.  
The Group’s net cash flow relating to financing 
activities was an outflow of US$ 57.2 million 
(2016: net inflow of US$ 23.7 million) as there 
were no drawdowns of bank borrowings 
during the year.  26 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
Net bank debt and borrowings 
The net bank debt position (total bank 
borrowings less cash) as at 31 December 
2017 was US$ 372.8 million (2016: US$ 
373.5 million). The net debt* level reported 
under IFRS, which includes unamortised 
loan arrangement fees and finance lease 
obligations, reduced from US$ 402.1 million 
in 2016 to US$ 372.8 million at year end. 
Undrawn committed bank facilities were  
US$ 50.0 million at year end (2016: US$ 
145.0 million) following the voluntary 
cancellation, described above, of a capex 
loan facility no longer required. During 2017 
the Group agreed various amendments to  
its bank facilities to secure increased liquidity 
and financial flexibility. The amendments 
include an increase in tenure of the loan 
facility by two years with maturity revised  
to 2023, a reduction in scheduled loan 
repayments by two-thirds in both 2018 and 
2019; and a relaxation of certain covenants 
(as announced on 9 August 2017).
As part of the amendments, certain 
restrictions on capital expenditure and 
dividend payments were agreed; as well  
as establishing a cash sweep mechanism 
from 2018, that is effective when the net 
leverage ratio exceeds 4 times EBITDA, 
where up to 75% of surplus free cash flows 
(after adjustment for permitted payments  
and maintenance of a minimum cash balance 
level) will be applied towards repayment  
of bank debt. In addition, EBITDA based 
covenants are now to be calculated on a 
proforma EBITDA basis (further explanation 
is contained within the Glossary) with the 
intention to provide a more forward-looking 
assessment of trading rather than reporting 
on an historic basis.
At the year end the Group was in full 
compliance with all its banking covenants 
and expects to remain so.
Balance sheet
Total current assets at 31 December 2017 
were US$ 57.4 million (2016: US$ 85.5 million). 
This movement is mainly attributable to a 
decrease in cash and cash equivalents to 
US$ 39.0 million (2016: US$ 61.6 million) and 
a decrease in trade and other receivables  
to US$ 18.5 million (2016: US$ 23.9 million). 
The reduction in cash balance primarily 
reflects the lower revenues during the year 
combined with the capital expenditure 
incurred on the completion of the new Large 
Class well intervention cantilever system. 
Debt repayments and interest expenses  
paid during the year have also reduced the 
cash balance. 
During the year receivable collection  
days improved to 56 days (2016: 78 days).  
As the Group’s customers comprise mainly  
of NOCs, IOCs and international EPC 
companies, the credit quality of the 
outstanding receivables is considered to be 
good. Payable days outstanding increased  
to 50 days during the year (2016: 40). 
Total current liabilities at 31 December 2017 
were US$ 49.8 million (2016: US$ 93.7 
million), the principal movement being the 
decrease in the current portion of obligations 
under finance leases to nil (2016: US$ 40.1 
million) arising from the decision to return the 
previously leased Small Class vessel to its 
owner in August 2017, as well as a decrease 
in the current portion of bank borrowings  
to US$ 20.3 million (2016: US$ 22.0 million) 
following the amendments to bank facilities 
discussed above. 
The combined effect of the changes  
in current assets and current liabilities 
described above resulted in an increase  
in the Group’s working capital and cash 
balance to US$ 7.6 million at 31 December 
2017 (2016: deficit US$ 8.2 million). 
Total non-current assets at 31 December 
2017 were US$ 808.4 million (2016: US$ 
857.2 million). This decrease is primarily 
attributable to the US$ 47.9 million decrease 
in the net book value of property, plant and 
equipment, arising mainly from the leased 
Small Class vessel being returned to its 
owner and the impairment charge on Naashi. 
Total non-current liabilities at 31 December 
2017 were US$ 394.7 million (2016: US$ 
404.8 million). This decrease reflects the 
repayments of bank borrowings during  
the year.
 
Equity
Shareholders’ equity decreased to US$ 
420.7 million at year end from US$ 443.7 
million at 31 December 2016. The movement 
is mainly attributed to the 2016 final dividend 
of US$ 5.2 million and the loss incurred 
during the year. 
The number of issued ordinary shares in the 
Company increased to 349,703,973 following 
the issue of 176,169 shares on 6 July 2017 
awarded under the Company's 2014 
Long-Term Incentive Plan. No grants of share 
awards were made in 2017 under the 
Long-Term Incentive Plan. 
Adjusting items 
The Group presents adjusted results,  
in addition to the statutory results, as the 
Directors consider that they provide a useful 
indication of underlying performance. In 2017 
these comprised of a non-cash impairment 
charge on one vessel of US$ 7.3 million,  
the expensing of costs incurred of US$ 14.2 
million following the debt modification in 
December 2017 and the write-off unamortised 
commitment fees of US$ 1.4 million relating 
to the cancelled capex loan facility which 
have been discussed above. In 2016 the 
adjusting items comprised non-cash 
impairment charges on the non-core assets 
and a leased vessel, amounting to US$ 21.3 
million. A reconciliation between the adjusted 
and statutory results is provided in note 6.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
We are committed to working responsibly across all aspects  
of our business.
Ethical practice
We seek to uphold high ethical standards throughout our global 
business. Our core values of Responsibility, Excellence and Relationships 
are embedded in our culture and are integral to the way we work.  
Further information on our core values can be found on our website.
GMS operates responsibly in accordance with the formal legal and 
regulatory disclosure requirements expected of a UK listed company. 
Our corporate governance structure is designed to ensure we are 
well-positioned to conduct our business appropriately as we seek  
to deliver the best value for our shareholders. Further discussion on 
our stakeholders can be found below.
The GMS Code of Conduct (‘Code’) sets out the basic rules of  
the Group and its purpose is to ensure we work safely, ethically, 
efficiently and within the laws of the countries in which we operate. 
All our staff receive Code of Conduct training as part of their 
induction and our reputation and success is dependent on our  
staff putting the Code into practice in all our dealings with our 
stakeholders. GMS also maintains an awareness of human rights 
issues, which is reflected in our suite of Group policies including  
our Anti-Corruption and Bribery Policy, Anti-Slavery Policy, Social 
Responsibility Policy and Whistleblowing Policy. 
Our stakeholders
Clients
We value the relationships we have with our clients, which are  
built on trust and a proven track record of delivering successful 
operations. Many of these relationships are with long-term clients,  
in the case of ADNOC spanning more than 40 years. 
Shareholders
We communicate with our shareholders in a variety of ways such  
as through meetings, presentations and roadshow events (mainly 
results-oriented) and through participation in investor conferences  
in Europe and the Middle East. We are committed to the clear and 
comprehensive communication of our financial and non-financial 
performance to our shareholders, and our other stakeholders,  
via regulatory reporting, including press announcements, and 
through our website and selected social media. Further information 
on our shareholder engagement can be found on page 37. 
Employees and subcontractors
GMS is dedicated to providing our employees and subcontractors 
with a safe working environment. We ensure our subcontracted 
personnel working at our premises or on our vessels offshore  
are treated with the same respect afforded to our own staff and  
that they comply with the Group’s standards and working practices. 
We encourage an honest and open dialogue with our entire 
workforce and host a variety of formal and informal communications 
initiatives. In addition, our offshore performance coaches act as a 
sounding board for any issues our crews wish to raise, with feedback 
passed to the GMS senior management team for appropriate action. 
We support the personal and professional development of all our 
employees, so they can reach their full potential within GMS. 
Community 
GMS understands how important it is to contribute to the local 
communities where we work. We encourage a healthy living lifestyle, 
both within the Group and the wider community, through our support 
of various sports activities and charity events. 
During the year, we were pleased to visit the Rashid Centre for  
the Disabled in Dubai, and to present a donation to support their 
work in providing high quality integrated education services and 
therapies for children with special needs. GMS staff participated in  
a charity walk in Abu Dhabi in support of World Diabetes Day and 
donations were made to the Emirates Red Crescent. We are also 
pleased to provide student placements at our head office in Abu 
Dhabi as part of our commitment to the development and promotion 
of work opportunities for young people in the UAE.  29 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017

Diversity
The Group employs 474 personnel from more than 35 countries  
and we are very proud of our cultural diversity. Our international  
staff and offshore employees bring significant experience and  
skills to GMS, and this helps to ensure we conduct our business  
from a global perspective. 
For cultural and legal reasons the extent to which we can increase 
the number of female personnel is often limited. For example, we 
cannot employ women offshore in the countries in which we currently 
operate in the Middle East. The charts below provide information  
on the number of male and female staff employed by GMS.  
As the provisions of the UK Government’s Equality Act 2010  
relating to gender pay gap disclosure are not applicable to GMS,  
this information has not been provided. 
The charts below provide details of the gender diversity and country 
of origin of our personnel as at 31 December 2017. 
Land-based management*
Total of 33** (30 male, 3 female)

** Of the 33 land-based management, seven were members of the senior management team (all male). The Board of Directors comprised five members (all male); further 
information on the diversity of the Board can be found in the Report of the Nomination Committee on page 57.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Statement
This section has been prepared in accordance with our regulatory obligation to report greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to Section 7 of the 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013.
We have reported on all of the emission sources required. These sources fall within our consolidated statement. We do not have responsibility 
for any emission sources that are not included in our consolidated statement.
In calculating our GHG emissions, we have used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised edition), the 
Climate Registry 2014, the IEA CO
2
 Emissions from Fuel combustion 2017 and emission factors from the UK Government Conversion Factors 
for Company Reporting 2017.
The table below shows the data points that are required under the UK Government regulatory requirements. 
The consumption of fuel during the operation of our vessels is the largest contributor to our GHG emissions. Although our vessels are usually 
leased to our clients on a long-term basis, we have chosen to account for their GHG emissions within our footprint, in accordance with the 
‘operational control’ approach to developing our GHG footprint.

CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION
Dear Shareholders, 
At GMS, we seek to operate with integrity at all times, recognising  
that in doing so the Company will help maintain the trust of its 
stakeholders. This Corporate Governance Report explains key 
features of the Company’s governance structure, to provide an 
understanding of how the main principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (“the Code”) have been applied and to highlight 
key areas of focus during the year. The Board considers that  
the Company has complied in all respects with all the relevant 
recommendations of the Code throughout the year.
As of 1 January 2018, the Board continues to comprise a majority  
of non-executive Directors with an independent Chairman, two 
independent non-executive Directors, an executive Director, and  
a non-executive Director who is considered to not be independent 
because of his relationship with Gulf Capital, a substantial 
shareholder in the Company. The Board has three Committees: the 
Audit and Risk Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the 
Nomination Committee, all of which are compliant with the Code. 
The reports from the Chairman of each of these committees can  
be found in the pages that follow. 
The Board is committed to promoting high standards of corporate 
governance and understands that an effective and challenging  
Board is essential to enable the Company to deliver its strategy and 
shareholders’ long-term interests, whilst also generating investor 
confidence that the business is conducting itself in a responsible 
manner. The Company continues to maintain a robust governance 
structure through its corporate governance policies. Further information 
on our governance, values, strategy and business model, can be 
found in the Strategic Report section of this Annual Report. 
The Remuneration Committee focused during 2017 on preparing  
for the Company’s second shareholder vote on our Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy. Accordingly, the Committee undertook a review 
of our executive Director remuneration arrangements. Consideration 
throughout the process was given to alignment with strategy and 
delivery of shareholder value, simplicity and balance, and effectively 
linking pay to performance.
The Board strives to improve its effectiveness and recognises  
that our annual performance evaluation process represents an 
opportunity to enhance overall Board effectiveness. As we noted  
in our 2016 Annual Report, this year’s Board evaluation process 
would be externally facilitated. Details of the process undertaken  
can be found in the report of the Nomination Committee. In all Board 
positions, objectivity and integrity, as well as ability and diversity, 
assist the Board in its key functions and are prerequisites for 
appointment. These also apply to senior management appointments 
below Board level as well as the Company’s succession planning.
The governance focus for 2018 is on maintaining the development  
of the Company’s framework whilst providing independent oversight 
and effective risk management in order to build long-term value for 
our shareholders. I am confident we have a strong Board to take the 
Group forward and I trust that you will find this Governance Report 
helpful and informative.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Board membership
The composition of the Board complies with the provision of the 
Code, which provides that independent non-executive Directors 
should comprise at least half of the Board, excluding the Chairman
The composition, qualifications, experience and balance of skills  
on the Board are regularly reviewed by the Board to ensure there is 
the right mix on the Board itself and its Committees, and that these 
are working effectively. The aim is to bring relevant experience  
and independence to the Board while at the same time ensuring 
continuity and stability. The current members of the Board have  
a wide range of appropriate skills and experience and their 
biographies can be found on pages 32 to 33. 
Non-executive Director independence
The independent non-executive Directors are a key source of 
expertise and contribute to the effectiveness of the Board. The Board 
considers and reviews the independence of each non-executive 
Director at least annually as part of the Directors’ performance 
evaluation. In carrying out the review, consideration is given to factors 
such as their character, judgement, commitment and performance  
on the Board and relevant Committees and their ability to provide 
objective challenge to management. 
Following the annual review for 2017, the Board concluded that each 
of the independent non-executive Directors continue to demonstrate 
those behaviours and continue to be considered by the Board  
as independent.
Division of responsibilities
In compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, a clear 
written division of responsibilities between the roles of Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer has been agreed by the Board. The Chairman 
is responsible for the leadership and effectiveness of the Board. He 
chairs the Board meetings, ensures the agendas are appropriate and 
is responsible for ensuring that all Directors actively contribute to the 
determination of the Group’s strategy. The Chief Executive Officer  
is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Group and 
implementing the Group’s strategy, developing proposals for Board 
approval and ensuring that a regular dialogue with shareholders  
is maintained. The separation of authority enhances independent 
oversight of senior management by the Board and helps to ensure

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED
How the Board operates
The Board and its Committees
The Board is responsible for providing entrepreneurial leadership  
on behalf of the Company and exercising its business judgement 
within a framework of prudent and effective controls. It also agrees 
the strategic direction and governance structure that will help achieve 
the long-term success of the Company and maximise shareholder 
value. The Board takes the lead in areas such as strategy, financial 
policy, annual budgeting, significant potential acquisitions, risk 
management and the overall system of internal controls. The Board’s 
full responsibilities are set out in the matters reserved for the Board. 
The ultimate responsibility for the Company rests with the Board  
and its legal powers and responsibilities are stated in the Articles  
of Association, which are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office in the UK. 
The Board delegates authority to its Committees to carry out certain 
tasks on its behalf, so that it can operate efficiently and give the right 
level of attention and consideration to relevant matters. The composition 
and role of each Committee is summarised on pages 38 to 57 and 
their full terms of reference are available on the Company’s website.
The Board processes
The Chairman, along with the Chief Executive Officer and the 
Company Secretary, has established processes designed  
to maximise Board performance. Key aspects of these are  
shown below:
• the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Company Secretary 
meet towards the beginning of each year to agree an overall 
calendar of subjects to be discussed by the Board during  
the year;
• Board meetings are timetabled to ensure adequate time for open 
discussion of each agenda item allowing for questions, scrutiny, 
constructive challenge and full debates on key matters for 
decisions to be taken by consensus (although any dissenting 
views would be minuted accordingly);
• the development of Group strategy is led by the Chief Executive 
Officer, with input, challenge, examination and ongoing testing 
and review by the non-executive Directors throughout the year;
• good working relationships exist between non-executive Directors 
and non-Board members of the senior management team;
• members of the senior management team draw on the collective 
experience of the Board, including its non-executive Directors;
• comprehensive reporting packs, which are designed to be clear, 
accurate and analytical, are normally distributed in advance of Board 
meetings allowing sufficient time for their review, consideration and 
clarification or amplification of reports in advance of the meeting;
• once goals have been set and actions agreed, the Board receives 
regular reports on their implementation;
• comprehensive management accounts with commentary and 
analysis are distributed to the Board on a monthly basis;
• the Board reviews the Group’s risk register at each of its main 
meetings and challenges this where appropriate;
• the Board visits the Group’s major business locations both to 
review its operations and to meet with local management; and
• all Directors have open access to the Group’s key advisers, 
including management and the Company Secretary, and are also 
entitled to seek independent professional advice at the Group’s 
expense where appropriate. 
Appointment and tenure
All non-executive Directors serve on the basis of letters of 
appointment, which are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office. The letters of appointment set out the expected 
time commitment of non-executive Directors, who, on appointment, 
undertake that they will have sufficient time to meet what is expected 
of them. 
The non-executive Directors are appointed for a term of three years, 
subject to earlier termination, including provision for early termination 
by either the Company or the non-executive Director on three

months’ notice. The non-executive Directors signed new three year 
letters of appointment in 2017. In accordance with the Company’s 
Articles of Association, all Directors must retire by rotation and  
seek re-election by shareholders every three years; however, it is 
intended that the Directors will each retire and submit themselves  
for re-election by shareholders annually. 
Director induction and training 
The training needs of the Directors are periodically discussed at 
Board meetings and Nomination Committee meetings and briefings 
are arranged on issues relating to corporate governance and other 
areas of importance. 
Arrangements are in place for any newly appointed Directors  
to undertake an induction programme designed to develop their 
knowledge and understanding of the Company. The induction 
programme includes briefing sessions during regular Board 
meetings, visits to the Company’s fabrication, modification  
and maintenance yard, meetings with members of the wider 
management team and discussions on relevant business issues. 
Upon appointment, Directors are advised of their legal and other 
duties and their obligations as Directors of a listed company and 
under the Companies Act 2006 and they receive training from the 
Company’s lawyers. 
Re-election of Directors
Following recommendations from the Nomination Committee, the 
Board considers that all Directors continue to be effective, committed 
to their roles and have sufficient time available to perform their duties. 
In accordance with the provisions B.7 .1 of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, all Directors wishing to continue serving, will be subject to 
annual re-election. Accordingly, all Directors elected in 2017, will seek 
re-election at the Company’s 2018 Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) 
as set out in the Notice of the Annual General Meeting (see page 112 
for resolutions relating to re-election of Directors). 
Conflicts of interest
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in which they have 
or may have interests that conflict with those of the Company, unless 
that conflict is first authorised by the Directors. This includes potential 
conflicts that may arise when a Director takes up a position with 
another company. The Company’s Articles of Association allow the 
other Directors to authorise such potential conflicts, and a procedure 
is in place to deal with any actual or potential conflicts of interest.  
The Board deals with each actual or potential conflict of interest on 
its individual merit and takes into consideration all the circumstances. 
All potential conflicts approved by the Board are recorded in an 
Interests Register, which is reviewed by the Board at the beginning  
of each main Board meeting to ensure that the procedure is 
operating at maximum effectiveness. 
Board evaluation and effectiveness 
Critical to the success of our Board and its Committees in achieving 
their aims is the effectiveness with which they operate. Accordingly, 
we take our annual evaluation of this seriously. The Board believes 
that these evaluations can provide a valuable opportunity to highlight 
recognised strengths and identify any areas for development. 
The performance evaluation of the Board and its Committees  
in 2017 was conducted with support from Lintstock, a London-based 
advisory firm that is independent to the Company. Further details  
can be found within the Report of the Nomination Committee on 
pages 56 to 57. As part of the evaluation process, the Chairman  
and non-executive Directors also met twice during the year in the 
absence of the executive Director. 
The Board and its Committees have assessed the results of the 
evaluation process and concluded that the Directors continue  
to be effective and demonstrate commitment to their roles.  
The Directors are satisfied that the Board and its Committees  
are continuing to operate effectively. 
Engagement with shareholders  
and other stakeholders
The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer  
are responsible for shareholder relations. They ensure that there  
is effective communication with shareholders on matters such  
as governance and strategy, and are responsible for ensuring that  
the Board understands the views of major shareholders.
As part of our investor relations programme a combination of 
presentations, Group calls and one-to-one meetings are arranged  
to discuss the Company’s interim and full year results with current 
and prospective institutional shareholders and analysts. Additional 
meetings are held in the intervening periods to keep existing and 
prospective investors updated on our latest performance. We also 
arrange visits to our premises to give analysts, brokers and major 
shareholders a better understanding of how we manage our business. 
The Board receives regular updates on the views of its shareholders 
from its brokers at its Board meetings. In addition, the senior 
independent Director is available to meet shareholders if they wish  
to raise issues separately from the arrangements as described above. 
The Company’s website provides stakeholders with comprehensive 
information on our business activities and financial developments, 
including copies of our presentations to analysts and regulatory  
news announcements.
The Chief Executive Officer is the principal spokesperson with  
the press and other stakeholders such as the Company’s clients, 
business partners and investors.
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The AGM is the Company’s principal forum for communication  
with private shareholders. In addition to the formal business, there  
is a presentation by the Chief Executive Officer on the recent 
performance of the Group and its future development. The Chairman 
of the Board and the Chairman of each Board Committee, together 
with members of senior management, are available to answer 
shareholders’ questions at the AGM. Our next AGM will be held  
in London on 22 May 2018, full details can be found on pages 112  
to 117. 38 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017

REPORT OF THE AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE
Dear Shareholders, 
I am pleased to present the report of the Audit and Risk Committee  
for 2017 which provides insights into our work during the year.  
The Audit and Risk Committee’s activities continue to focus on the 
effectiveness of the internal and external audit processes, the integrity 
of the Group’s financial reporting, and the effectiveness of the Group’s 
risk management process and other governance related matters. 
These areas are important to the way the Group’s business is operated 
and are vital in enabling the Group to achieve its strategy, as described 
on page 12, in a controlled and sustainable manner.
The Committee’s membership consists of two independent non-
executive Directors, as shown above. This Committee composition  
is compliant with the Code which recommends that, as the Group  
is classified as a “smaller company”, the Committee have at least  
two members, both of whom should be independent non-executive 
directors. All Committee members have recent and relevant senior 
financial experience given that both Simon Batey and W. Richard 
Anderson are qualified accountants, and have comprehensive industry 
knowledge and expertise, providing independent experience and 
understanding of the issues under consideration.
The Audit and Risk Committee’s responsibilities include:
 Financial statements • monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Group and formal 
announcements relating to the Group’s financial performance, and reviewing any 
significant financial reporting judgements contained in them; 
• reviewing accounting policies, accounting treatments and disclosures in financial reports; and 
• providing advice to the Board on whether the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable.
 External audit • advising the Board on the policy with regards to audit tendering, taking into account 
relevant regulatory requirements and making recommendations to the Board as to the 
appointment, re-appointment or removal of the external auditor;
• making recommendations to the Board as to the remuneration of the external auditor;
• reviewing the terms of engagement, independence, objectivity and effectiveness of the 
external auditors; and
• assessing the external audit process and the appropriateness of the external auditors  
to supply non-audit services, in accordance with Group policy.
 Internal audit • reviewing the Group’s internal financial controls and internal control and risk management 
systems; and
• monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit function.
 Whistleblowing and related policies • reviewing the Group’s whistleblowing procedures and ensuring that arrangements  
are in place for the proportionate and independent investigation of possible improprieties 
in respect of financial and other matters, for appropriate follow-up action. 39 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
The Audit and Risk Committee discharges its responsibilities through 
a series of scheduled meetings during the year, the agenda of which 
is linked to events in the financial calendar of the Company. We met 
five times during the financial year and attendance at those meetings 
is set out on page 31. The Committee receives reports from external 
advisers and from the senior management team, as required, to 
enable it to discharge its duties. The Chief Financial Officer and 
senior members of the finance team attend each of these meetings 
at our request. The internal auditor attends and presents at the 
majority of meetings. In addition, the external auditor attended three 
of these meetings. 
The external auditor receives copies of all relevant Committee papers 
(including papers that were considered at the meeting when they 
were not in attendance) and minutes of all Committee meetings.
The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the Annual 
Report and financial statements and the half-yearly reports remains 
with the Board. The Committee gives due consideration to laws and 
regulations, the provisions of the Code and the requirements of the 
listing rules, and makes its recommendations on these reports to the 
Board. In 2017, this included an assessment of whether the Annual 
Report taken as a whole was fair, balanced and understandable.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE CONTINUED
Significant issues 
The Audit and Risk Committee pays specific attention to matters it considers important based on their potential impact on the Group’s 
results, or based on the level of complexity, judgement or estimation involved in their application. The Committee considered the matters 
shown below as significant issues in 2017. The Committee was satisfied that the judgements made by management were reasonable and 
that appropriate disclosures have been included in the financial statements.
Internal controls and risk management 
The Group’s systems of internal control and in particular our risk 
management process have been designed to support our strategic 
and business objectives as well as our internal control over financial 
reporting. The Board has an established ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group that 
have been in place for the period under review and up to the date  
of the Annual Report. The process is regularly reviewed by the Board 
and is in accordance with the Turnbull Review guidance on internal 
controls and requirements of the Code. 
Any system of internal control is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
The Group has a clear framework for identifying and managing risk, 
both at an operational and strategic level. Our risk identification and 
mitigation processes have been designed to be responsive to the 
constantly changing environment. The internal control process starts 
with identifying risks, compliance matters and other issues through 
routine reviews carried out by process owners and facilitated by 
regular Group-wide risk assessments. For risks that are recorded in 
the Group risk register, the Group then assesses the implications and 
consequences and determines the likelihood of occurrence. Further 
details of the Group’s risk management process can be found on 
pages 16 to 19. 
Internal audit
At the majority of meetings the Committee receives a report on internal 
controls. These reports provide an update on progress against the 
internal audit plan, including the status of actions and management 
responses, key improvement themes and recommended areas  
of business focus. The internal audit function is largely outsourced  
to KPMG.
In addition to the internal audit plan, the Group is regularly audited by 
certain clients and industry bodies, with any key findings reported to 
the Audit and Risk Committee who assess these findings and ensure 
that appropriate action is taken by management as deemed necessary.
External audit
Appointment and independence
The Committee has overall responsibility for ensuring that the 
external auditors’ independence and objectivity is not compromised. 
The Committee considers formally the re-appointment of the external 
auditor each year, as well as assessing their independence on an 
ongoing basis. In accordance with UK regulations and to help ensure 
independence, our auditors adhere to a rotation policy based on the 
FRC’s Ethical standard that requires the Group audit partner to rotate 
every five years. The 2017 year-end is the fourth year the current lead 
audit partner, David Paterson, has been involved in the audit of the 
Group but, due to his role as reporting accountant at the time of the 
IPO in 2014, he will be rotating off following the completion of the 
2017 audit. He is assisted in his Group auditor role by a partner in  
the Middle East firm of Deloitte, who has also acted as audit partner 
for one of the Group’s material subsidiaries in the Middle East since 
2012 and is therefore considered by the FRC to be a “key audit 
partner” under the relevant Ethical Standard. In order to maintain 
audit quality during the transition to a new lead audit partner  
in 2018, we have agreed that the Middle East partner referred to 
above can remain in place until the completion of the 2018 audit, 
notwithstanding that this would represent a period in excess of the 
usual 5 year limit for key audit partners. However, in order to ensure 
that the independence of Deloitte is not adversely impacted, they 
have implemented an additional safeguard whereby the engagement 
quality review partner based in the UK has performed specific 
additional reviews on areas of the audit that are under the direct 
supervision of the Middle East partner.
Following a review of the effectiveness of the audit, the Committee 
was satisfied that Deloitte continued to carry out its duties in a 
diligent and professional manner maintained a good knowledge  
of the market and continued to provide a high level of service.  
A resolution to re-appoint Deloitte LLP as the Company’s Auditor  
will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.
Deloitte LLP was appointed as external auditor of the Company  
in 2014 and the audit has not been put out to tender since that date. 
The Committee is aware of the legal requirements for external auditor 
selection and rotation. Whilst we do not consider it necessary to  
have a policy for mandatory rotation of external audit firms, we plan 
to provide consideration to placing future audits out to tender over 
the coming years. 
Significant issue How addressed
Impairment of property, plant  
and equipment
IAS 36 requires that a review for impairment 
be carried out if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
The continuing low oil price environment 
may impact the value in use of the vessels.
Impairment assessments are judgemental 
and careful consideration of the assumptions 
used in the determination of the value in use 
of the assets is required.
The Committee evaluated management’s approach in determining the recoverable value of the 
Group’s vessels.
The assumptions used in the computation of the value in use of the vessels were assessed. 
Consideration was given to both the feasibility of the long-term business plan and the 
appropriateness of the weighted average cost of capital which formed an initial basis for 
determining the discount rate.
An impairment loss of US$ 7.3 million was identified during the year on a 35-year-old Small 
Class vessel. 41 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
Assessment of external audit process 
The Committee has an established framework to assess the effectiveness 
of the external audit process. This includes but is not limited to:
• A review of the audit plan including the materiality level set by the 
auditors and the process they have adopted to identify financial 
statement risks. 
• A review of the Audit Quality Inspection (AQI) Report on our 
auditors published by the Financial Reporting Council with 
particular emphasis on those key messages applicable to the 
Company.
• A review of the final audit report, noting key areas of auditor 
judgement and the reasoning behind the conclusions reached 
(summarised in the Independent Auditor’s Report on pages 62  
to 68). 
• A formal questionnaire issued to all members of senior 
management who are involved in the audit covering the robustness 
of the audit process, independence and objectivity, quality of 
delivery, quality of people and service, and value-added advice.
 
As part of the Committee’s assessment of the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditor, the Committee held two  
private meetings with the external auditor without management  
being present. In addition, I met privately with the external audit 
Engagement Partner on several occasions.
The Committee has determined that Deloitte LLP was effective in 
providing its services to the Group. As a result, the Committee has 
recommended to the Board that the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP 
as the Company’s external auditor be proposed to shareholders at 
the 2018 AGM.
Provision of non-audit services 
The Committee believes that it may be appropriate for the Company 
to engage its external auditor to provide non-audit services in certain 
circumstances. Given the knowledge of a company’s market, 
systems and operations which an external auditing firm gains through 
the audit process, together with effective working relationships 
developed with senior management, the Committee believes that  
on occasion appointing the Company’s external auditor to provide 
non-audit services can represent an effective and cost-efficient 
process which is in the best interests of shareholders. However, to 
ensure the continued objectivity and independence of the external 
auditor are not compromised, the Committee has established  
a non-audit services policy. 
The Committee requires specific approval for the provision of any 
non-audit services above the value of US$ 50,000 and, in the unlikely 
event that the non-audit services have resulted in a cumulative total 
of 70% or more of the overall Group audit fee in any financial year, 
then any further non-audit services carried out by the external auditor 
would be regarded as exceptional and will require the Committee’s 
prior approval. The Committee receives quarterly reports of any 
non-audit services undertaken. The Committee must be satisfied 
that the external auditor’s objectivity and independence would not be 
compromised in any way as a result of being instructed to carry out 
those services.
Total 2017 audit fees were US$ 249,000 (2016: US$ 244,000). The 
total non-audit services provided by the Group’s external auditor 
Deloitte LLP for the year ended 31 December 2017 were US$ 
100,000 (2016: US$ 124,000) which comprised 29% (2016: 34%) of 
total audit and non-audit fees. The most significant non-audit fee was 
US$ 80,000 (2016: US$ 92,000) in relation to the interim review. The 
Committee is satisfied that the quantum and nature of the non-audit 
services provided by Deloitte LLP during the current year are such 
that the objectivity and independence of the external auditor have 
been safe guarded. Further details of the remuneration paid to the 
Group’s external auditor in respect of both audit and non-audit work 
is provided in note 26 to the financial statements.
Ethical conduct
Our Code of Conduct encourages all employees to report any 
potential improprieties in financial reporting or other matters. The 
Group operates a confidential whistleblowing hotline and all reports 
received are communicated to this Committee. Where appropriate, 
our internal audit team or other third party specialist may be asked to 
investigate issues and report to us on the outcome. Code of Conduct 
training is included as part of the Company induction process for all 
new employees who join the Group. 
The Group operates an Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy and is 
satisfied that appropriate policies and training are in place to deal 
with any instances of whistleblowing and to ensure that appropriate 
follow up action is taken on a timely basis.

REPORT OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Dear Shareholders, 
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”), I am 
pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year 
ended 31 December 2017. This Remuneration Report contains 
details of the proposed Remuneration Policy (pages 44 to 49) which 
will be submitted to a binding shareholder vote in the AGM on 
22 May 2018. As this is the third anniversary from the approval of the 
Remuneration Policy in 2015, shareholders will be asked to approve 
the new Directors’ Remuneration Policy at the AGM and it will, if 
approved, apply to payments made from this date. Until then the 
2015 policy will continue to apply.
This report also contains a section on the Annual Remuneration Report 
(pages 49 to 55) which sets out details of how the Remuneration Policy 
was implemented for the year ended 31 December 2017 and how we 
intend to apply it for the year ending 31 December 2018. It will be subject 
to an advisory vote at this year’s AGM.
The oil and gas industry challenges continued in 2017 with market 
recovery slower than previously anticipated. The Committee decided, 
based on management’s recommendation, to neither increase salaries 
nor grant any awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) during 
2017. The Committee appreciates the commitment and dedication 
shown by all members of staff during this challenging period.
Our remuneration arrangements have been designed in accordance 
with the principles set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
current market practices and best practices for UK listed companies. 
They also take into account market practice and labour laws in the 
local UAE market. 
Our aim is to ensure that remuneration arrangements appropriately 
and responsibly incentivise the executive Director and members  
of senior management to achieve the Group’s strategic objectives,  
in turn creating value for the Company’s shareholders. Our remuneration 
structure comprises a significant proportion of variable pay based on 
individuals achieving KPIs which are directly linked to the fulfilment of 
the Group’s strategic objectives. The overall remuneration structure 
for the executive Director typically comprises:
• base salary, benefits and allowances – set at a level appropriate 
to the sector and geographic markets in which we operate;
• an annual bonus – based on measures of annual financial and 
strategic performance; and 
• a share-based LTIP – based on growth in a financial measure 
such as earnings per share (EPS) and/or total shareholder  
return (TSR).
Performance and remuneration for 2017
For 2017, the adjusted EBITDA, being 20% of the total annual bonus 
opportunity, was below the threshold required for a payment under 
this part of the annual bonus scheme. However, the adjusted EBITDA 
margin, Total Recordable Injury Rate, adjusted Net Profit and 
progress against strategic, financial and operational objectives were 
achieved within or in excess of the target ranges. As such the bonus 
payable to the CEO constituted 51% of base salary – for further 
details, see page 51. 
No awards vested on the LTIP granted in May 2014 as the scheme 
came to an end in May 2017 and the performance conditions were 
not achieved. Similarly, no awards vested on the LTIP granted in 
March 2015 as the scheme came to an end in March 2018 and the 
performance conditions were not achieved.
Review of the Remuneration Policy
The current Directors’ Remuneration Policy was strongly supported 
by shareholders when it was approved at the 2015 AGM. This year 
we have reviewed the Remuneration Policy which will be put to 
shareholders for approval in a binding vote at the 2018 AGM. The 
review confirmed that the policy continues to appropriately align the 
interests of the executive Director to those of our shareholders and 
the wider Company strategy and does not require change. We will 
continue to review our Remuneration Policy and targets for future 
variable pay awards so that we can remain confident that our policy 
reflects the Company’s strategic objectives and to take account of 
any feedback received from shareholders.
The Remuneration Policy has been included in full on pages 44 to 49, 
alongside the Annual Remuneration Report.  43 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
Remuneration arrangements for 2018 and beyond
The Committee regularly reviews current market conditions within the 
industry and aligns remuneration levels as appropriate. The Committee 
has been mindful of the continuing challenging market conditions in 
the industry when considering the remuneration for 2018.
The Annual Remuneration Report will be subject to an advisory 
shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM. The Committee is dedicated to 
ensuring that our shareholders understand and support our policy 
and therefore we welcome questions and feedback regarding our 
remuneration structures. 
The Annual Remuneration Report describes how the Remuneration 
Policy has been implemented, particularly in relation to rewards for 
2017. The financial performance of the Group in 2017 reflected lower 
utilisation and pricing pressures on certain contracts. The impact  
on adjusted EBITDA was partially offset by our continued focus  
on managing costs including with regard to the remuneration of  
our Directors.
 
For the second consecutive year there will be no increase in salary  
in 2018 for the executive Director or members of senior management. 
This follows Group-wide salary reductions that were implemented  
in 2016. 
We will be operating the same bonus framework for 2018. This 
means the maximum opportunity will therefore remain at 100%  
of base salary, with performance measured against financial  
targets (50%) and a balanced scorecard of strategic, financial and 
operational objectives (50%). As a Committee, we have focused  
on establishing appropriately stretching objectives, with tangible 
performance outcomes focused on the delivery of the Group’s short 
term strategic plans.
 
The Committee intends to grant an LTIP award to the CEO in 2018 
over shares with a value of 150% of base salary. The award will vest 
three years after grant, subject to performance measured over the 
three year period. 
Conclusion
The Committee continues to ensure that pay is linked to performance 
and that the annual bonus and LTIP provide an incentive to deliver 
superior performance over the short and longer term. We believe  
our Remuneration Policy achieves these objectives.
On behalf of the Committee and the Board, I recommend this 
Remuneration Report to you and I hope that you find it clear, concise 
and understandable. We shall be seeking your support for each part 
of this report at the forthcoming AGM on 22 May 2018.

REPORT OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CONTINUED
Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report
This part of the report, which is not subject to audit, sets out the remuneration policy for the Company and has been prepared in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013. The policy has been developed taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the guidelines 
published by institutional advisory bodies and the views of our major shareholders. The Company is required to prepare, and seek shareholder 
approval for an updated Directors’ Remuneration Policy at least once every three years. The Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be put to  
a shareholder vote at the Company’s Annual General Meeting and is detailed below. 
Policy overview
The Committee assists the Board in its responsibilities in relation to remuneration, including making recommendations to the Board on the 
Company’s policy on executive remuneration.
The Company’s policy is to provide remuneration to executives to reflect their contribution to the business, the performance of the Group,  
the complexity and geography of the Group’s operations and the need to attract, retain and incentivise executives. The Committee seeks  
to provide remuneration packages that are simple, transparent and aligned with UK best and local UAE market practice, whilst providing  
an appropriate balance between fixed and variable pay that supports the delivery of the Group’s strategy.
The following table sets out the Directors’ Remuneration Policy.

REPORT OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CONTINUED
Notes to table
Annual bonus performance measures
The annual bonus reflects key financial performance indicators linked to the Group’s strategic goals. Financial targets are set at the start  
of the financial year with reference to internal budgets and taking account of market expectations. The balance is based on how well the 
individual performed against a range of stretching objectives relating to key strategic and operational objectives.
LTIP performance measures
The LTIP performance measures (which are currently EPS growth and relative total shareholder return (TSR) reward long-term financial 
growth and significant long-term returns to shareholders. Targets are set on sliding scales that take account of internal strategic planning  
and external market expectations for the Group. Only modest rewards are available for achieving threshold performance with maximum 
rewards requiring substantial out-performance of challenging strategic plans approved at the start of each year. 
Discretion
The Committee operates annual bonus and long term incentive arrangements for the executive Director in accordance with their respective 
rules, the Listing Rules and the HMRC rules where relevant. The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number 
of areas relating to the operation and administration of the plans. These include the following: 
• who participates;
• the timing of the grant of award and/or payment;
• the size of an award (up to plan limits) and/or a payment;
• the annual review of performance measures, targets and weightings for the annual bonus plan and LTIP from year to year;
• discretion relating to the measurement of performance including in the event of a change of control or restructuring;
• determination of a good leaver (in addition to any specified categories) for incentive plan purposes;
• adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring and special dividends); and
• the ability to adjust existing performance conditions for exceptional events so that they can still fulfil their original purpose.
Remuneration scenarios for the CEO
The chart below shows an estimate of the potential future remuneration payable for the CEO in 2018 at different levels of performance.  
The chart highlights that the performance-related elements of the package comprise a significant portion of the CEO’s total remuneration  
at on-target and maximum performance.

1.  Duncan Anderson’s remuneration is paid in UAE Dirhams and shown above in US$ using an exchange rate of US$ 1/AED 3.67.
2.  Minimum remuneration represents base salary and allowance levels applying as at 1 January 2018. It also includes benefits and end of service gratuity.
3.   The value of benefits is based on the cost of supplying those benefits (as disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 52) for the year ended 
31 December 2017.
4.      The end of service gratuity is based on the provision accrued (as disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 52) for the year ended 31 December 2017 
in line with the UAE Labour Law limit.
5.   Minimum performance assumes no award is earned under the annual bonus plan and no vesting is achieved under the LTIP; at on-target, half of the annual bonus 
is earned (i.e. 50% of base salary) and 30% of the maximum LTIP opportunity (150% of base salary) is achieved (i.e. 45% of base salary); and at maximum full vesting 
under both plans.
6.  Share price movement and dividend accrual have been excluded from the above analysis.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
How remuneration of the executive Director differs from employees generally, and how their views are 
taken into account in setting remuneration policy 
When considering the structure and levels of executive Director remuneration, the Committee reviews base salary and annual bonus 
arrangements for the management team, to ensure that there is a coherent approach across the Group. The annual bonus plan operates on 
a similar basis across the senior management team. The key difference in the Executive Director Policy is that remuneration is more heavily 
weighted towards variable pay than that of other employees. This ensures that there is a clear link between the value created for shareholders 
and the remuneration received by the executive Director. 
The Committee does not formally consult with employees in respect of the design of the executive Director Remuneration Policy, however the 
Human Resources Director is available to discuss issues relating to the wider employee population.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Company is committed to maintaining good communications with investors. The Committee considers the AGM to be an opportunity  
to meet and communicate with investors, giving shareholders the opportunity to raise any issues or concerns they may have. In addition,  
the Committee will seek to engage directly with major shareholders and their representative bodies should any changes be planned to the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy or if the Committee wishes to make material changes to how Policy will be implemented. 
Following the Company’s AGM in 2018, details of votes cast for and against the resolutions to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
and Annual Report on Remuneration will be included in the next Annual Report on Remuneration published following the AGM.
Directors’ recruitment and promotions 
The policy on the recruitment or promotion of an executive Director takes into account the need to attract, retain and motivate the best 
person for each position, while at the same time ensuring a close alignment between the interests of shareholders and management, 
as follows: 
Base salary The base salary for a new appointment will be set taking into account the skills and experience of the 
individual, internal relativities and the market rate for the role as identified by any relevant benchmarking  
of companies of a comparable size and complexity.
If it is considered appropriate to set the base salary for a new executive Director at a level which is below 
market (for example, to allow them to gain experience in the role) their base salary may be increased to 
achieve the desired market positioning by way of a series of phased above inflation increases. Any increases 
will be subject to the individual’s continued development in the role.
End of service gratuity, 
benefits and allowances
End of service gratuity, benefits and allowances will be set in line with the policy above, reflective of typical 
market practice and the Labour Law for the UAE. The Committee may also approve the payment of one-off 
relocation-related expenses and legal fees incurred by the individual.
In the event of an executive Director being recruited to work outside the UAE, alternative benefits, pension 
provision and/or allowances may be provided in line with local market practice.
Annual bonus and LTIP The Company’s incentive plans will be operated, as set out in the policy table above, albeit with any 
payment pro-rata for the period of employment and with the flexibility to use different performance 
measures and targets, depending on the timing and nature of the appointment.
Remuneration foregone The Committee may offer cash and/or share-based elements to compensate an individual for remuneration 
and benefits that would be forfeited on leaving a former employer, when it considers these to be in the best 
interests of the Group (and therefore shareholders). 
Such payments would take account of remuneration relinquished and would mirror (as far as possible) 
the delivery mechanism, time horizons and performance requirement attached to that remuneration.
Where possible this will be facilitated through existing share plans as set out in the policy table above, 
but if not, the Committee may use the provisions of 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules.
Internal appointments In the case of an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role will be 
allowed to pay out according to its original terms stipulated on grant or adjusted as considered desirable to 
reflect the new role.  48 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
REPORT OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CONTINUED
Directors’ service agreements and payments for loss of office 
The Committee seeks to ensure that contractual terms of the executive Director’s service agreement reflects best practice. 
Notice period The CEO’s service agreement is terminable by either the Company or the Director on 12 months’ notice. In 
circumstances of termination on notice the Committee will determine an equitable compensation package, 
having regard to the particular circumstances of the case. The Committee has discretion to require notice 
to be worked, to make payment in lieu of notice or to place the Director on gardening leave.
The Company may terminate the appointment summarily with immediate effect if the Director is guilty of 
gross misconduct in accordance with relevant provisions of the UAE labour law.
Payment in lieu of notice In case of payment in lieu, base salary, allowances, benefits and end of service gratuity will be paid for the 
period of notice served or paid in lieu. 
If the Committee believes it would be in shareholders’ interests, payments would be made either as one 
lump sum or in equal monthly instalments and in the case of payment in lieu will be subject to be offset 
against earnings elsewhere.
Annual bonus An annual bonus may be payable in respect of the period of the bonus plan year worked by the Director; 
there is no provision for an amount in lieu of bonus to be payable for any part of the notice period  
not worked.
LTIP Outstanding share awards under the LTIP are subject to the rules which contain discretionary provisions 
setting out the treatment of awards where a participant leaves for designated reasons (i.e. participants  
who leave early on account of injury, disability or ill health, death, a sale of their employer or business  
in which they were employed, statutory redundancy, retirement or any other reason at the discretion of  
the Committee).
In these circumstances a participant’s awards will not be forfeited on cessation of employment and instead 
will continue to vest on the normal vesting date or earlier at the discretion of the Committee, subject to  
the performance conditions attached to the relevant awards. The awards will, other than in exceptional 
circumstances, be scaled back pro-rata for the period of the incentive term worked by the Director.
Other payments In addition to the above payments, the Committee may make any other payments determined by a court  
of law in respect of the termination of a Director’s contract.
Change of control In the event of a change of control all unvested awards under the LTIP would vest, to the extent that any 
performance conditions attached to the relevant awards have been achieved.
 
The date of the CEO’s executive Service Agreement is 12 March 2014. The service contract is available for inspection during normal business 
hours at the Company’s registered office, and available for inspection at the AGM. 
External appointments
The Committee recognises that an executive Director may be invited to become a non-executive Director in another company and that such 
an appointment can enhance knowledge and experience to the benefit of the Group. It is policy that Board approval is required before any 
external appointment may be accepted by an executive Director. An executive Director is permitted to retain any fees paid for such services. 
The current executive Director does not hold any such external appointments.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
Non-executive Directors are appointed by letter of appointment for an initial period of three years, which are terminable by three months’ 
notice on either side. However, it is the Company’s intention to comply with provision B.7.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code and 
accordingly all Directors will stand for annual re-election by shareholders at future AGMs until the Board determines otherwise. 
The dates of the letters of appointment of the Chairman and non-executive Directors are:
  
Simon Heale Chairman 27 February 2017
Dr Karim El Solh Non-executive Director 27 February 2017
Simon Batey Independent non-executive Director 27 February 2017
W. Richard Anderson Independent non-executive Director 27 February 2017
The letters of appointment are available for inspection during normal business hours at the Company’s registered office. For the appointment 
of a new Chairman or non-executive Director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the approved remuneration policy in force 
at that time.
Annual Report on Remuneration 
This part of the report has been prepared in accordance with Part 3 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts  
and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 and 9.8.6R of the Listing Rules. The Annual Report on Remuneration will be put to an advisory 
shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM. Sections of this report that are subject to audit, on pages 51 to 53 have been indicated.
Responsibilities of the Committee
The Remuneration Committee’s responsibilities include:
• setting the strategy, structure and levels of remuneration of our executive Director and senior management, ensuring compliance with 
internal policies whilst also adhering to legislative regulations; and
• aligning the financial interests of the executive Director and other management and employees with the achievement of the  
Group’s objectives. 
The Remuneration Committee will assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities regarding all matters related to remuneration, including 
making recommendations to the Board on the Company’s policy on executive remuneration. In reviewing executive remuneration, the 
Committee may set the over-arching principles, parameters and governance framework of the Group’s Remuneration Policy and determine 
the individual remuneration and benefits package of the executive Director and the Company Secretary. In addition, the Committee monitors 
the structure and level of remuneration for the senior management team and is aware of pay and conditions in the workforce generally.  
The Committee also ensures full compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code in relation to remuneration.
Members and activities of the Committee
The composition of the Remuneration Committee is in compliance with the Code which provides that all members of the Committee should 
be independent non-executive Directors. 
The members of the Committee during 2017 were W. Richard Anderson (Chairman) and Simon Batey. Both members were independent 
non-executive Directors. The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Human Resources Director are normally invited to attend  
for at least part of each meeting to allow the Committee to benefit from their contextual advice. The Group Chairman also normally attends 
meetings by invitation. The Human Resources Director acts as Secretary to the Committee. These individuals are not present when their  
own remuneration is discussed. 
The Committee held two formal meetings during the year and each member of the Committee attended both. The Committee also held 
informal discussions as required.
Performance evaluation of the Committee
In 2017, the performance evaluation of the Committee was conducted in conjunction with the main Board evaluation process, further details 
of which are included on pages 56 to 57. The Committee has assessed the results of the evaluation process and concluded that the Directors 
continue to be effective and demonstrate commitment to their roles. 
External advice received
In carrying out its responsibilities, the Committee seeks external remuneration advice as necessary. During the year, the Committee received 
independent advice on remuneration matters from New Bridge Street, an AON plc company. New Bridge Street is a signatory of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct and any advice received is governed by that Code. The fees paid to New Bridge Street  
in 2017 were US$ 46,208. 50 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017

insurance, disability insurance and payment of children’s school fees.
Annual bonus for 2018 
For 2018 the maximum annual bonus opportunity will be 100% of base salary. The annual bonus will be assessed against financial and 
personal objectives to provide a rounded assessment of the Group and individual’s performance, weighted as follows:
Measure Weighting
Adjusted EBITDA 20%
Adjusted EBITDA margin 20%
Net income 10%
Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) 10%
Strategic, financial and operational objectives 40%
Total 100%
The Committee considers the targets to be commercially sensitive, but will provide details of performance against the financial targets 
retrospectively in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.
The bonus will be paid wholly in cash. Clawback provisions apply in the event of a material misstatement of the Group’s financial results  
or an error in the calculation of performance targets. Clawback can be applied for three years from the end of the financial year to which  
a payment relates. 51 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
Long term incentive plan to be granted in 2018
The Committee intends to grant an LTIP award to the CEO in 2018 over shares with a value of 150% of base salary. The award will vest three 
years after grant, subject to performance measured over the three year period. Vesting of 50% of the award will be based on the compound 
annual growth rate (CAGR) of EPS and the other 50% will be determined by TSR relative to the FTSE 250 Index excluding financial services 
companies. EPS and relative TSR are considered to be the most appropriate measures of long-term performance, as they incentivise and reward 
for improvement in the long-term financial performance of the Group, together with the creation of value for shareholders. The weighting of the  
EPS and TSR performance conditions remain the same as the LTIP awarded in 2016 and the intention is that this weighting will continue for the 
foreseeable future.
End of service gratuity 
As required under the UAE Labour Law, the Company accrues for the end of service gratuity entitlement in respect of the CEO, whereby the 
gratuity is 21 days’ base salary (excluding fixed cash allowances) for each year of the first five years of employment and 30 days’ wages for 
each additional year of employment thereafter, up to a limit of two years’ total wages.
Performance against annual bonus targets for 2017 (audited)
For 2017 the maximum annual bonus opportunity was set at 100% of base salary. The annual bonus was assessed against the following 
financial and personal objectives:

Total 100% 51%
* Zero to maximum pay-out is not linear as bands operate within the performance ranges shown. 
** Objectives set related to key strategic, financial and operational objectives, with targets for each aligned with delivery of the Company’s annual corporate objectives and 
long-term financial plan. The details of these objectives are commercially sensitive, however in 2017 they included the delivery of a new build SESV with cantilever system 
on schedule and on budget and the development and implementation of a strategic plan for the Group. A large majority of these measures were fully achieved, which the 
Committee considers to be reflective of strong performance overall, and therefore this resulted in a payment of 27% out of a possible 40%.
Accordingly, the total payments under the annual bonus plan were US$ 213,000. The bonus will be paid wholly in cash. Clawback provisions 
apply in the event of a material misstatement of the Company’s financial results or an error in the calculation of performance targets. 
Clawback provisions can be applied for three years from the end of the financial year to which a payment relates.
LTIP awards vesting for 2017 (audited)
LTIP awards were granted on 8th May 2014 over 184,327 ordinary shares. No awards vested in the year on the LTIP granted on 8th May 2014

Directors’ interests in ordinary shares (audited)
Through participation in performance-linked share-based plans, there is strong encouragement for the executive Director to build and 
maintain a significant shareholding in the business.
As set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, the Committee requires any executive Director to build and maintain a shareholding in the 
Company equivalent to 100% of base salary. Until this threshold is achieved they are required to retain no less than 50% of the net of tax 
value of any share award that vests. A new appointment will be expected to reach this guideline in three to five years post-appointment. The 
Chairman and non-executive Directors are encouraged to hold shares in the Company but are not subject to a formal shareholding guideline. 
The beneficial interests of the Directors and connected persons in the share capital of the Company at 31 December 2017 were as follows:

REPORT OF THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE
Dear Shareholders, 
I am pleased to present the report of the Nomination Committee for 
2017. Our role is to assist the Board in the key areas of composition 
and succession planning for the Board and the senior management 
of the Group. Having an appropriate range of high-calibre Directors 
on our Board with the necessary skills and expertise continues to be 
key to determining and maximising success in the Group’s strategic 
objectives. Establishing appropriate succession planning for the 
existing Board and senior management is essential to ensuring that 
this success can be sustained over the long term. The composition 
of the Nomination Committee continues to be in compliance with the 
Code which provides that independent non-executive Directors 
should comprise the majority of the Committee.
Key responsibilities
The Nomination Committee’s responsibilities include:
• regularly reviewing the composition, structure and size of the 
Board and its Committees;
• considering succession planning for Directors and other  
senior executives; 
• evaluating the appropriate skillsets, diversity, experience, 
knowledge and independence on the Board; and
• leading the process for Board appointments and making 
recommendations to the Board in respect of new appointments.
External Board and Committee evaluation
Critical to the success of our Board and its Committees in achieving 
their aims is the effectiveness in which they operate and accordingly, 
we take our annual Board evaluation very seriously. The Committee 
also identifies the future training requirements of the Board, as part  
of the Board’s ongoing development programme.
The Board and Committee evaluation process in 2017 was led by the 
Nomination Committee with support from Lintstock, a London-based 
advisory firm that specialises in the facilitation of Board performance 
reviews. Lintstock has no other connection with the Company.
Lintstock engaged with the project sponsors to set the context for 
the evaluation, and tailor content to the specific circumstances of 
GMS. All Board members were then requested to complete an online 
survey addressing the performance of the Board, its Committees  
and the Chairman, as well as their own individual contribution to the 
Board. The anonymity of the respondents was ensured throughout 
the process in order to promote an open and frank expression  
of views.
 
 
Lintstock subsequently produced a report addressing the following 
areas of Board performance:
• The appropriateness of the Board’s size and composition was 
assessed, and respondents were asked to identify any changes 
that ought to be made to the profile of the Board.
• The Board’s understanding of the views of key stakeholders  
and market environment in which the Company operates was 
considered, and the Board’s oversight of relevant technological 
developments, and the culture and behaviours throughout the 
Company, was reviewed.
• The relationships between Board members and management, 
and the atmosphere in and management of meetings, were 
assessed, as was the quality of the Board packs and 
management presentations.
• The effectiveness of the Board in reviewing the Company’s 
current performance, and influencing future performance,  
was considered, and respondents were asked to identify areas 
upon which they feel the Board should spend more or less time 
focusing over the coming year.
• The Board’s oversight of strategy and progress against each  
of the Company’s strategic priorities was considered, as was  
the Board’s understanding of the capacity of the organisation  
to deliver the strategy. Respondents’ views as to the top strategic 
issues facing the Company were also identified.
• The Board’s focus on risk and HSE performance was assessed, 
as was the adequacy of succession plans for members of top 
management. Respondents were asked to consider the top 
Human Resources priorities facing the Company over the  
coming years.
Following the review, the Board agreed to increase the number of 
operational and vessel visits carried out by the Board and to increase 
the number of Board meetings that members of management attend 
and present at. 
The Committee has assessed the results of the Board evaluation 
process and, in light of the findings, we have concluded that the 
performance of each of the Directors standing for re-election 
continues to be effective and that these Directors demonstrate 
commitment to their roles, including commitment of time for Board 
and Committee meetings and any other duties.  57 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
My performance as Chairman is evaluated by the other non-
executive Directors. The evaluation, led by the senior independent 
non-executive Director, is carried out at least annually and also takes 
into account the views of the senior management team.
Re-election of Directors
The biographical details of the Directors can be found on pages 32  
to 33. All of the Company’s current Directors will stand for re-election 
at the 2018 Annual General Meeting. 
The terms and conditions of appointment of non-executive Directors, 
which includes their expected time commitment, are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered office.
Diversity
Currently all members of the Board are male however the Nomination 
Committee very much takes into account the benefits of diversity  
on the Board, including gender and variety of experience. The Board 
remains diverse in terms of the range of nationality and international 
experience of its members. The Directors’ broad range of experience 
and expertise covers relevant technical, operational, financial, 
governance, legal and commercial expertise as well as the valuable 
experience of operating in the energy industry on an international basis.
The Company aspires to diversify its Board further as part of its 
succession planning process. Whilst seeking to achieve this aim,  
the Company will not appoint an individual to the Board unless they 
are considered the best candidate for the role, whether male or 
female. The Corporate Social Responsibility section on pages 28  
to 29 provides further information on the Group’s workforce.
Succession planning
The Committee is aware of its responsibilities in relation to Board  
and senior management succession plans to ensure that unforeseen 
changes are managed effectively and efficiently, without disruption to 
the Group’s strategy or day-to-day operations. The Committee has 
developed a comprehensive succession planning process for senior 
management across the Group. It includes encouragement and 
facilitation of the development of each individual, including internal 
career progression opportunities as they arise.
The Board and Nomination Committee are satisfied that the 
individuals’ currently fulfilling key senior management positions  
in the organisation have the requisite depth and breadth of skills, 
knowledge and experience.

The Company did not acquire any of its own shares in the financial 
year to 31 December 2017 or in the period between the year end  
and the date of this report. 
The Company was granted a general authority by its shareholders  
at the 2017 AGM to allot shares up to 33% of the Company’s issued 
share capital as at 27 March 2017. The Company also received 
authority to allot shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis up  
to 5% of the Company’s issued share capital as at 27 March 2017.  
As at the date of this Report, no shares have been issued under 
these authorities. These authorities will expire at the conclusion  
of the 2018 AGM. Resolutions will be proposed at the 2018 AGM  
to renew these authorities.
The Company did not buy back any shares during the year, therefore 
the outstanding authority is 34,970,397.
The Company is due to have its 2018 AGM on 22 May 2018 and the 
Directors will be seeking approval from shareholders, to authorise the 
Company to purchase up to 10% of its existing ordinary share capital. 
This authority would expire at the Company’s 2019 AGM; however, it is 
intended that this authority be renewed each year. For more information 
on this resolution refer to the Notice of AGM and explanatory notes on 
pages 112 to 117 .  59 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017

Significant agreements 
As at 31 December 2017 the Company was party to the following 
significant agreements that take effect, alter or terminate, or have  
the potential to do so, on a change of control of the Company:
Relationship Agreement 
The Relationship Agreement dated 14 March 2014 amongst Green 
Investment Commercial Investments LLC (GICI), Ocean Investments 
Trading LLC (Ocean), Horizon Energy LLC (Horizon), Al Ain Capital 
LLC (Al Ain) and the Company provides that it shall terminate on 
there ceasing to be a “Principal Shareholder” holding at least 10% of 
the issued share capital of the Company or shares carrying at least 
10% of the aggregate voting rights in the Company from time to time. 
In this context a “Principal Shareholder” is any of (a) GICI and Ocean 
together, (b) Horizon and (c) Al Ain. 
The relevant Principal Shareholder shall be entitled to appoint one 
Director to the Board, and for so long as a Principal Shareholder 
Group holds 15% or more of the issued ordinary share capital  
of the Company, the relevant Principal Shareholder shall be entitled 
to appoint two Directors to the Board. The relevant Principal 
Shareholder has appointed a single Director to the Board, Dr Karim 
El Solh. The Company has further agreed that, subject to the Gulf 
Capital Shareholders (comprising Green Investment Commercial 
Investments LLC, and Ocean Investments Trading LLC, both 
beneficially owned by GC Equity Partners Fund II, L.P.), having the 
requisite aggregate shareholding to appoint a Director as described 
above that Christopher Foll shall be given notice of, be invited to, and 
have the right to attend meetings of the Board as an observer, but 
shall not be entitled to vote.
The Relationship Agreement has not been amended since adoption 
and is in compliance with the Listing Rules. 
Share incentive schemes
All of the Company’s share-based employee incentive plans detailed 
in the Report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 42 to 55 
contain provisions relating to a change of control of the Company. 
Vesting of outstanding awards and options on a change of control 
would normally be at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, 
who would take into account the satisfaction of any applicable 
performance conditions at that time and the expired duration of the 
relevant performance period.

The Group is party to a limited number of operational arrangements 
that have the potential to be terminated or altered on a change  
of control of the Company, but these are not considered to be 
individually significant to the business of the Group as a whole.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
Employees and policies 
The Group operates an equal opportunities policy that aims to treat 
individuals fairly and not to discriminate on the basis of sex, race, 
ethnic origin or disability or on any other basis. Applications for 
employment are fully considered on their merits, and employees  
are given appropriate training and equal opportunities for career 
development and promotion.
The Group gives full consideration to applications for employment 
from disabled persons where the requirements of the job can be 
adequately fulfilled by a handicapped or disabled person. Where 
existing employees become disabled, it is the Group’s policy 
wherever practicable to provide continuing employment under 
normal terms and conditions and to provide training and career 
development and promotion opportunities to disabled employees 
wherever appropriate.
During the year, the policy of providing employees with information 
about the Group and keeping them up to date on financial, economic 
and other factors which affect the Group has been continued 
through internal media methods. Employees have also been 
encouraged to present their suggestions and views on the Group’s 
performance. Regular meetings are held between local management 
and employees to allow a free flow of information and ideas.
Health and safety
Information on health and safety is provided on pages 11, 15, 19  
and 20, and forms part of this report by reference.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Information on the Group’s greenhouse gas emissions is set out  
in the Corporate Social Responsibility section on pages 28 to 29  
and forms part of this report by reference.
Dividends
No dividend is to be paid for 2017. The Board believes the cash 
generated by the business is better utilised for the reduction of bank 
debt at this time. 
Going concern 
The Group is expected to continue to generate positive operating 
cash flows on its own account for the foreseeable future and has 
access to a committed working capital facility of US$ 50 million,  
the total facility remained undrawn at 26 March 2018.
On the basis of their assessment of the Group’s financial position, 
and after reviewing its cash flow forecasts for a period of not less 
than 12 months from the date of approval of the Annual Report, the 
Group’s Directors have a reasonable expectation that, taking into 
account reasonably possible changes in trading performance and 
appropriate mitigating actions, the Group will be able to continue  
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they have 
adopted the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
consolidated financial statements. 
More information on the going concern status of the Group can be 
found in the going concern section of note 3 to the consolidated 
financial statements on page 78. Details of the Group’s objectives 
and policies for managing its capital, its financial risk management 
objectives, details of its financial instruments and its exposure to 
credit and liquidity risk can be found in note 34 to the consolidated 
financial statements on pages 98 to 100. The principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group are set out on pages 17 to 19. 
Information on the Group’s longer-term viability is provided within  
the risk management section on pages 16 to 19.
Statement on disclosure to the external auditor
So far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant information, 
which would be needed by the Company’s external auditor in 
connection with preparing its audit report (which appears on pages 
62 to 68) of which the external auditor is not aware; and each 
Director, in accordance with section 418(2) of the Companies Act 
2006, has taken all reasonable steps that he ought to have taken  
as a Director to make himself aware of any such information and  
to ensure that the external auditor is aware of such information.
Auditors
Deloitte LLP, the Group’s auditors, have indicated their willingness  
to continue in office and in accordance with Section 489 of the Act,  
a resolution to re-appoint them will be put to the 2018 Annual 
General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The Company’s 2018 AGM will take place at 10.00am (UK time) on 
Tuesday 22 May 2018 at Linklaters LLP, One Silk Street, London, 
EC2Y 8HQ. All shareholders have the opportunity to attend and vote, 
in person or by proxy, at the AGM. The notice of the AGM can be 
found on page 112 and on the Company’s website. The Notice of 
AGM sets out the business of the Meeting and an explanatory note 
on all resolutions. Separate resolutions are proposed in respect of 
each substantive issue.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required  
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have 
elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law), 
including FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in 
the UK and Republic of Ireland”. Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of 
the profit or loss of the company for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and 
conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
• make an assessment of the company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant 
financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole;
• the strategic report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face; and
• the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole,  
are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.

Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2017 and of the group’s loss for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice including Financial Reporting Standard 102 
“The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and 
Republic of Ireland”; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements of Gulf Marine Services plc 
(the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) which comprise:
• the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
• the consolidated and parent company statements of financial 
position;
• the consolidated and parent company statements of changes  
in equity;
• the consolidated and parent company cash flow statements;
• the related notes 1 to 37 in respect of the group and 1 to 13  
in respect of the parent company.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent 
company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, including FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting 
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section  
of our report. 
We are independent of the group and the parent company in 
accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s 
Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and  
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance  
with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services 
prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the 
group or the parent company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient  
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified 
in the current year were:
• Impairment of the group’s vessels; and
• Revenue recognition
The risks included within our report are 
consistent with those included in our 
2016 audit report.
Materiality The materiality that we used for the group 
financial statements was $2.7 million, 
which was determined on the basis  
of 5.6% of normalised average pre-tax 
profit for the 2015-2017 period, adjusted 
to exclude impairment charges and the 
expensing of refinancing costs.
Scoping We identified the group’s business to  
be a single component, and therefore  
all operations of the group were subject  
to a full scope audit. All audit work for  
the group was performed directly by  
the audit engagement team.
Significant changes  
in our approach
There have been no significant changes 
in our audit approach compared to the 
prior year. 63 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017

Conclusions relating to going concern, principal risks and viability statement
Going concern We have reviewed the directors’ statement in note 3 to the financial statements 
about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties 
to the group’s and company’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least 
twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to that statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3)  
and report if the statement is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have  
nothing material to report,  
add or draw attention to  
in respect of these matters.
Principal risks and 
viability statement
Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering whether  
they were consistent with the knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, 
including the knowledge obtained in the evaluation of the directors’ assessment 
of the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, we are 
required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention  
to in relation to:
• the disclosures on pages 16 to 19 that describe the principal risks and 
explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
• the directors' confirmation on page 16 that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity; or
• the directors’ explanation on page 19 as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the group, over what period they have done so and why they 
consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue  
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement relating  
to the prospects of the group required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have  
nothing material to report,  
add or draw attention to  
in respect of these matters. 64 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of 
the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. 
These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Impairment of the group’s vessels 
Key audit matter 
description
The group’s vessels are its sole revenue generating assets, with a carrying value of $748.1 million at 31 December 2017 
(2016: $730.3 million) which represents 86% of the group’s total assets at that date. Their recoverable amount  
is based on an assessment of the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. Estimates of fair value  
less costs to sell take into consideration vessel valuations from an independent ship broker, whilst value in use  
is calculated as the net present value of estimated future cash flows, in each case on a vessel by vessel basis.  
In the current year, there is a risk that recoverable amounts could be adversely impacted by the significant and 
prolonged fall in prevailing oil & gas prices, due to the resultant impact on the group’s customer base in the oil & 
gas industry. Due to the high level of judgements involved, we have also determined that there was a potential for 
fraud through possible manipulation of the recoverable amount.
Management has assessed recoverable amount based on the estimated value in use of each vessel, which in  
all cases was higher than fair value less costs to sell. The key assumptions utilised in these calculations include, 
on a vessel by vessel basis:
• forecast utilisation;
• forecast day rates;
• cost assumptions; and
• discount rate.
As referenced in note 4 of the financial statements the carrying value of the group’s vessels is considered by 
management as a critical accounting judgement and key source of estimation uncertainty.
The group has recorded a $7.3 million impairment charge in respect of one vessel. Further details of the group’s 
vessels and the current year impairment charge is provided in note 8 to the financial statements and in the Audit 
and Risk Committee Report on page 40.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to 
the key audit matter
We challenged the assumptions made by management on a vessel by vessel basis by reference to publicly available 
information, our knowledge of the group and industry and the group’s most recent budget. This included:
• understanding the process by which management has derived its value in use estimates;
• evaluating the design and implementation of management’s controls to address the risk of impairment of the 
group’s vessels;
• comparing forecast utilisation and day rates to those achieved in prior periods;
• comparing forecast day rates to signed contracts for contracted periods, and challenging the basis adopted 
for day rates elsewhere in the calculations;
• using our internal valuation specialists to perform an independent recalculation of the discount rate;
• performing sensitivity tests tailored to each vessel demonstrating an impairment indicator as at 31 December 
2017, using more conservative assumptions for future day rates and utilisation levels to take into consideration 
the current market conditions described above; and
• testing the clerical accuracy of the calculations.
Key observations We are satisfied that the impairment charges recorded by management are appropriate and that no additional 
impairments have arisen during the year. 65 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
Revenue recognition 
Key audit matter 
description
Each of the group’s vessels earns revenues on the basis of a specific contract with the relevant counterparty. Each 
contract will typically specify a day rate, which can vary significantly by vessel and by counterparty, as well as a 
standby rate for when the vessel is available for use but not operational. Certain contracts also include amounts 
payable to the group in respect of mobilising the vessel at the inception of the contract and/or demobilising the 
vessel at the end of the contract term. As disclosed in the accounting policies in note 3 lump-sum fees received for 
equipment moves (and related costs) and fees received for contract-specific equipment modifications or upgrades 
are initially deferred and amortised on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. The costs of related 
equipment modifications or upgrades are capitalised and depreciated in accordance with the Group’s fixed asset 
capitalisation policy. Demobilisation revenue at the end of the contract is recognised when received.
Accordingly, in order for revenue to be recorded appropriately, for each vessel the company needs to:
• accurately record the number of days both on hire and on standby (to achieve both completeness and accuracy); 
• apply the correct contractual rates, net of any discounts, to the number of days in each of these categories  
(to ensure accuracy); and
• ensure mobilisation and demobilisation revenue has been appropriately recorded in accordance with the 
terms of the contract and the accounting policies above.
Due to the significant variability in contract terms by vessel and by counterparty, we have identified the complete 
and accurate recording of revenue as a key audit matter.
Further details of revenue arising in the year is provided in note 23 to the financial statements.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to 
the key audit matter
We have obtained a detailed schedule analysing the revenue earned by month and by vessel, which specifies 
both the number of days on hire/on standby and the relevant contractual rate, and agreed this to the general 
ledger. We have:
• performed an analytical review in respect of the number of days on hire/standby, obtaining supporting 
explanation for any gaps and reconciling this to our knowledge of each vessel’s operational performance 
during the period;
• on a sample basis, agreed the day rate to the underlying contract; 
• on a sample basis, recalculated the revenue figure based on the days on hire/standby and the day rate and 
agreed both the revenue amount and days on hire/standby to invoice;
• on a sample basis, agreed the on hire days billed to a confirmation of days worked signed by the customer;
• obtained an overview of new contracts in the period and the appropriateness of the revenue recognition 
policies adopted;
• for mobilisation and demobilisation revenue, determined whether revenue has been recorded in accordance 
with the terms of the contract and the group’s accounting policy in this area; and
• performed a recalculation of the deferred revenue in respect of mobilisation revenue by agreeing mobilisation 
income to contract and apportioning according to the life of the minimum contracted period of the contract.
We have also evaluated both the design and implementation and operating effectiveness of management 
controls to address the risk of inappropriate revenue recognition.
Key observations Our testing showed that revenue has been recorded in accordance with the terms of the underlying contracts 
and the group’s accounting policies in this area. 66 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF GULF 
MARINE SERVICES PLC CONTINUED
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of  
a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and  
in evaluating the results of our work
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group and Parent company financial statements
Materiality $2.7 million (2016: $3.5 million)
Basis for determining 
materiality
Group: 5.6% of normalised average pre-tax profit for the 2015-2017 period, adjusted to exclude impairment 
charges and the expensing of refinancing costs. 
Parent company: 3% of net assets, capped at the materiality applied to the group financial statements. 
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
In respect of the group, we consider that users of the financial statements are focused on the group’s ability  
to generate profits for its shareholders. However, in a period of volatility for both day rates and utilisation,  
we consider it appropriate to consider average profits over the 2015-2017 period. We have also excluded 
impairments and refinancing costs as they would distort materiality year-on-year.
In addition to this primary metric, we have also taken into consideration a number of other factors, noting that 
$2.7 million represents less than 1% of net assets and 4.6% of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, 
impairment and refinancing costs (“adjusted EBITDA”). 
For the parent company, as the primary nature of this holding company is to hold investments in subsidiaries,  
we have concluded that net assets represents the most appropriate benchmark.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of $135,000 (2016: $175,000)  
for both the group and the parent company, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative 
grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and assessing 
the risks of material misstatement at the group level. Based on that assessment, we identified the group’s business to be a single component, 
and therefore all operations of the group were subject to a full scope audit. During the course of the audit, senior members of the UK audit 
team, including the Senior Statutory Auditor, supervised the members of the audit team who are based in the United Arab Emirates, and 
visited the United Arab Emirates operations during the completion stages of the audit. 67 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017

If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required 
to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material 
misstatements of the other information include where we conclude that:
• Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the directors that they consider 
the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
group’s position and performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent 
with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
• Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the audit committee does  
not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts  
of the directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for 
review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose  
a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report  
in respect of these matters.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and  
fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and 
the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors 
either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements  
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,  
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect  
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located  
on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended 31 December 2017
1 General information
Gulf Marine Services PLC (“GMS” or “the Company”) is a Company which registered in England and Wales on 24 January 2014. The 
Company is a public limited company with operations mainly in the Middle East and North Africa, and Europe. The address of the registered 
office of the Company is 6th Floor, 65 Gresham Street, London, EC2V 7NQ. The registered number of the Company is 08860816.
The principal activities of GMS and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”) are chartering and operating a fleet of specially 
designed and built vessels. All information in the notes relates to the Group, not the Company unless otherwise stated.
The Company and its subsidiaries are engaged in providing self-propelled, self-elevating support vessels which provide the stable platform 
for delivery of a wide range of services throughout the total life cycle of offshore oil, gas and renewable energy activities and which are 
capable of operations in the Middle East, South East Asia, West Africa and Europe.
2 Adoption of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
The accounting policies and methods of computation adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are consistent 
with those followed in the preparation of the Group’s annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016, except for the 
adoption of new standards and interpretations effective as of 1 January 2017.
New and revised IFRSs applied with no material effect on the consolidated financial statements
The following new and revised IFRSs have been adopted in these consolidated financial statements. The application of these new and revised 
IFRSs has not had any material impact on the amounts reported for the current and prior years but may affect the accounting for future 
transactions or arrangements.
New and revised IFRSs Summary of requirements
Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative The Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 7 for the first time in the current year.  
The amendments require an entity to provide disclosures that enable users of financial 
statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including  
both cash and non-cash changes. The Group’s liabilities arising from financing activities 
consist of borrowings (note 19). A reconciliation between the opening and closing balances 
of these items is provided in note 28. Consistent with the transition provisions of the 
amendments, the Group has not disclosed comparative information for the prior year. Apart 
from the additional disclosure in note 28, the application of these amendments has had no 
impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred 
Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses 
The Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 12 for the first time in the current year.  
The amendments clarify how an entity should evaluate whether there will be sufficient 
future taxable profits against which it can utilise a deductible temporary difference. The 
application of these amendments has had no impact on the Group’s consolidated financial 
statements as the Group already assesses the sufficiency of future taxable profits in a way 
that is consistent with these amendments.
Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle The Group has adopted the amendments to IFRS 12 included in the Annual Improvements 
to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle for the first time in the current year. The other amendments 
included in this package are not yet mandatorily effective and they have not been early 
adopted by the Group. IFRS 12 states that an entity need not provide summarised financial 
information for interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures that are classified (or 
included in a disposal group that is classified) as held for sale. The amendments clarify that 
this is the only concession from the disclosure requirements of IFRS 12 for such interests.
New and revised IFRSs in issue but not yet effective 
At the date of authorisation of these consolidated financial statements, the following new and revised IFRSs were in issue but not yet effective:

New and revised IFRSs in issue but not yet effective continued
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
The Group will apply IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018. The Group has elected not to restate comparatives on initial application of IFRS 9. The full 
impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the Group’s consolidated financial statements will depend on the financial instruments that the Group has in place 
during 2018 as well as on economic conditions and judgements made as at the year end. The Group has performed a preliminary assessment  
of potential impact of adopting IFRS 9 based on the financial instruments as at the date of initial application of IFRS 9 (1 January 2018). 
Classification and measurement 
With respect to the classification and measurement of financial assets, the number of categories of financial assets under IFRS 9 has been 
reduced compared to IAS 39. Under IFRS 9 the classification of financial assets is based both on the business model within which the asset 
is held and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three principal classification categories for financial assets that 
are debt instruments: (i) amortised cost, (ii) fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) and (iii) fair value through profit or loss 
(FVTPL). Equity investments in scope of IFRS 9 are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognised in profit or loss unless an 
irrevocable election is made to recognise gains or losses in other comprehensive income. Under IFRS 9, financial assets can be designated 
as at FVTPL to mitigate an accounting mismatch. 
With respect to the classification and measurement of financial liabilities changes in the fair value of a financial liability designated as at FVTPL 
due to credit risk, are presented in other comprehensive income unless such presentation would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch  
in profit or loss. 
Based on the Group’s preliminary assessment, there will be no impact on the classification and measurement of financial assets and all 
financial assets will continue to be classified at amortised cost. There will be no change in the classification and subsequent accounting 
treatment for any financial liabilities. 
Impairment 
The impairment model under IFRS 9 reflects expected credit losses, as opposed to only incurred credit losses under IAS 39. Under the 
impairment approach in IFRS 9, it is not necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognised. Instead, an entity 
always accounts for expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses. The amount of expected credit losses should be 
updated at each reporting date. 
The new impairment model will apply to the Group’s financial assets that are debt instruments measured at amortised cost.
The Group expects to apply the simplified approach to recognise lifetime expected credit losses for its trade receivables, as permitted by 
IFRS 9. The Group has made an assessment of the lifetime expected credit loss and applied sensitivities using different credit spreads and 
does not expect a material change to impairments for financial assets.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers.  
IFRS 15 will supersede the current revenue recognition guidance including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and the related 
Interpretations when it becomes effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group is required to adopt  
IFRS 15 for the year ending 31 December 2018.
The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity should recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers  
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Specifically, 
the Standard introduces a 5-step approach to revenue recognition: 
• Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer
• Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract
• Step 3: Determine the transaction price
• Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
• Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation
When IFRS 15 is adopted, it can be applied either on a fully retrospective basis, requiring the restatement of the comparative periods presented 
in the financial statements, or with the cumulative retrospective impact of IFRS 15 applied as an adjustment to equity on the date of adoption; 
when the latter approach is applied it is necessary to disclose the impact of IFRS 15 on each line item in the financial statements in the 
reporting period. 
Under IFRS 15, an entity recognises revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e. when ‘control’ of the goods or services 
underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer. 
Management has assessed the effects of applying the new standard on the Group’s financial statements. Based on the Group’s preliminary 
assessment, there will be no material impact on the recognition and measurement of revenue. 75 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16, which has not yet been endorsed by the EU, introduces a comprehensive model for the identification of lease arrangements and 
accounting treatments for both lessors and lessees. IFRS 16 will supersede the current lease guidance including IAS 17 Leases and the related 
interpretations when it becomes effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The Group currently expects to adopt 
IFRS 16 for the year ending 31 December 2019. No decision has been made about whether to use any of the transitional options in IFRS 16.
IFRS 16 distinguishes leases and service contracts on the basis of whether an identified asset is controlled by a customer. Distinctions of 
operating leases (off balance sheet) and finance leases (on balance sheet) are removed for lessee accounting, and is replaced by a model 
where a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability have to be recognised for all leases by lessees (i.e. all on balance sheet) except for 
short-term leases and leases of low value assets.  
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost (subject to certain exceptions) less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present 
value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. Subsequently, the lease liability is adjusted for interest and lease payments, as well 
as the impact of lease modifications, amongst others. Furthermore, the classification of cash flows will also be affected because operating 
lease payments under IAS 17 are presented as operating cash flows; whereas under the IFRS 16 model, the lease payments will be split into 
a principal and an interest portion which will be presented as financing and operating cash flows respectively. In contrast to lessee accounting, 
IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17, and continues to require a lessor to classify a lease either 
as an operating lease or a finance lease. 
As at 31 December 2017, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of US$ 2.0million. IAS 17 does not require the 
recognition of any right-of-use asset or liability for future payments for these leases; instead, certain information is disclosed as operating 
lease commitments in note 32. A preliminary assessment indicates that these arrangements will meet the definition of a lease under IFRS 16, 
and hence the Group will recognise a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability in respect of all these leases unless they qualify for low 
value or short-term leases upon the application of IFRS 16. The new requirement to recognise a right-of-use asset and a related lease liability 
is not expected to have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. 
Under the updated accounting standards, the Group has preliminarily determined that some of its revenue contracts with customers may 
contain a lease component, with the Group acting as lessor, and at adoption therefore the Group may be required to disclose a leasing 
component on these contracts. The Directors are currently assessing the potential impact of the above. It is not practicable to provide  
a reasonable estimate of the financial effect until the Directors complete their review.
3 Significant accounting policies
The Group’s significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have 
been consistently applied to each of the years presented.
Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as 
adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and therefore the financial information presented complies with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. 
IFRS includes the standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) including International 
Accounting Standards (“IAS”) interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”).
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments and share 
based payments that are measured at revalued amounts or fair values at the end of each reporting period. Historical cost is generally based 
on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for assets. 
For financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair 
value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:
• Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the 
measurement date; 
• Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly  
or indirectly; and 
• Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. 
Basis of consolidation
The financial statements incorporate the financial statements of GMS and entities controlled by GMS (its subsidiaries). Management have 
assessed the control which GMS has over its subsidiaries in accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements which provides that 
an investor controls an investee when the investor is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has 
the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. 76 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017

The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from 
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the results of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with those used by other members 
of the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. The interests of non-controlling shareholders 
may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable 
net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount 
of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent 
changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests 
having a deficit balance.
Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying 
amounts of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. 
Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received 
is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Group. Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the 
acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets 
given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related 
costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Fair value is determined as the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability 
transferred, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length transaction.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3(2008) are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the  
fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including 
goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income  
in relation to the subsidiary are accounted for (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to retained earnings) in the same manner 
as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities were disposed of. The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at 
the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement or, when applicable, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity. 78 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
3 Significant accounting policies continued
Going concern 
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. The use of this basis of accounting takes into consideration the 
Group’s current and forecast financial position, including the capital commitments described in note 30. Further information on the use of the 
going concern basis has been disclosed in the Directors’ report on page 60.
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of  
the Group’s activities. Revenue is recognised only when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with a transaction will flow  
to the Group and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and is stated net of sales taxes if applicable (such as VAT) and discounts.  
If advances are received from customers for future contractual services, the revenue is deferred until the services are provided. 
Charter revenue
Revenue from services is recognised as the services are rendered, including where they are based on contractual daily rates for the chartering  
of vessels in respect of multi-year service contracts. Income from vessels hired on time and voyage charters and from the hire of equipment 
or personnel is accounted for on a time apportionment basis in line with agreed contract terms. 
Contract mobilisation/demobilisation revenue
Charter contracts generally provide for payment on a daily rate basis, and revenues are recognised as the work progresses with the  
passage of time. In addition, lump-sum payments are occasionally received at the outset or at the end of a contract for equipment moves  
or modifications. Lump-sum fees received for equipment moves (and related costs) and fees received for contract-specific equipment 
modifications or upgrades as part of mobilisations are initially deferred and amortised on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. 
Lump-sum fees received for equipment moves (and related costs) as part of demobilisations are recognised as the services relating to the 
demobilisation are rendered. 
The costs of contractual equipment modifications or upgrades to vessels that are permanent in nature are capitalised and depreciated  
in accordance with the Group’s fixed asset capitalisation policy. The costs of moving equipment while not under contract are expensed  
as incurred.
Revenue is recognised for certain reimbursable costs. Each reimbursable item and amount is stipulated in the Group’s contract with the 
customer, and such items and amounts are variable from contract to contract. Reimbursable costs are recognised on the gross basis, as 
both revenues and expenses, because the Group is the primary obligor in the arrangement, has discretion in supplier selection, is involved  
in determining product or service specifications and assumes full credit risk related to the reimbursable costs.
Revenue from messing and accommodation services 
Revenue from these services is recognised as the services are rendered, including where they are based on contractual daily rates for 
providing accommodation and messing services which may include catering and cleaning services. 
Interest income
Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of income can be 
measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate 
applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that 
asset’s net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Maintenance income
Maintenance income relates to maintenance work which is carried out on vessels during times that the vessel is on hire. This is done 
periodically throughout the year and is charged to customers in accordance with agreed contractual daily rates. Maintenance revenue  
is recognised when the work takes place. 
Sundry income
Sundry income relates to handling charges which are applied to costs which are paid by the Group and then recharged to the customer.  
The revenue is recognised when the costs are recharged to customers with the handling charge applied. 
Leasing
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except where another systematic basis 
is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed. Contingent rentals arising under 
operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate 
benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more 
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed. 
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at 
the present value of the minimum lease payments calculated using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The corresponding liability to the 
lessor is included in the consolidated statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation. 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
for the year ended 31 December 2017 79 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest 
on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly to profit or loss, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying 
assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s general policy on borrowing costs (see below).
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses (if any). The cost of 
property, plant and equipment is their purchase cost together with any incidental expenses of acquisition. Subsequent expenditure incurred 
on vessels is capitalised where the expenditure gives rise to future economic benefits in excess of the originally assessed standard of 
performance of the existing assets.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment less their residual values over their useful lives, using 
the straight-line method. The residual values of vessels and related equipment are determined taking into consideration the expected scrap 
value of the vessel, which is calculated based on the weight and the market rate of steel at the time of asset purchase. If the price per unit of 
steel at the balance sheet date varies significantly from that on date of purchase, the residual value is reassessed to reflect changes in market 
value. The estimated useful lives used for this purpose are:
Vessels 25-35 years
Land, buildings and improvements 3-20 years 
Vessel spares, fittings and other equipment 3-20 years 
Office equipment and fittings 3-5 years 
Motor vehicles 3 years 
Taking into consideration independent professional advice, management considers the principal estimated useful lives of vessels for the 
purpose of calculating depreciation to be 25 to 35 years from the date of construction. 
The estimated useful life depends on the type and nature of the vessel. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method 
are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the 
sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised within administrative expenses in the income statement. The depreciation 
charge for the period is allocated between cost of sales and administrative expenses, depending on the usage of the respective assets.
Standby equipment 
The cost of purchased second hand engines and related refurbishment expenses which are classified as standby equipment are capitalised 
and depreciated from the date that the engine has been made ready for use and installed on the vessel. 
Second hand refurbished engines are depreciated over the shorter of the useful economic life of the refurbished second hand standby 
equipment or the life of the vessel on which such equipment is installed. 
Repair expenses relating to used engines belonging to the Group are charged to cost of sales when incurred.
Dry docking
The costs incurred for periodical dry docking or major overhauls of the vessels are identified as a separate inherent component of the vessels 
and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the period to the next anticipated dry dock being approximately 30 months. 
For acquired or newly built vessels, a notional dry dock cost is allocated from the vessel’s cost based on experience of similar vessels,  
and (if material) depreciated on a straight-line basis to the next anticipated dry docking. If a dry docking occurs prior to its anticipated date, 
any remaining capitalised dry docking expenditure is expensed.
Capital work-in-progress
Properties and vessels under the course of construction, are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes professional 
fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs under capitalised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. Depreciation of these 
assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives used for  
this purpose are:
Customer relationships 10 years
The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate 
being accounted for on a prospective basis.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at the 
acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost). 80 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
3 Significant accounting policies continued
Intangible assets continued
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately. The amortisation expense on 
intangibles is included as a part of general and administrative expenses.
An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or losses 
arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount  
of the asset are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill 
At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there  
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is 
estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an 
individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable  
and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise  
they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.
Intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the asset may 
be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss  
is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take 
a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are 
substantially ready for their intended use or sale. 
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the 
Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the 
reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash 
flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the receivable is 
recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.
Employees’ end of service benefits 
In accordance with the applicable Labour Laws of the UAE and Saudi Arabia, the Group is required to pay end of service benefits to all 
qualifying employees upon cessation of employment. The only obligation of the Group with respect to end of service benefits is to make the 
specified lump sum payments to employees which become payable when they leave the Group for reasons other than gross misconduct. 
The amount payable is calculated as a multiple of a pre-defined fraction of basic salary based on the number of full years of service. 
To meet the requirement of the UAE and Saudi Arabia labour laws, a provision is made for the full amount of end of service benefits payable 
to qualifying employees up to the end of the reporting period. The provision relating to end of service benefits is disclosed as a non-current 
liability. The provision has not been subject to a full actuarial valuation or discounted as the impact would not be material.
The actual payment is made in the year of cessation of employment of a qualifying employee. The payment for end of service benefit is made 
as a lump sum along with the full and final settlement of the employee. 
The total expense recognised in profit or loss of US$ 0.6 million (2016: US$ 0.8 million) represents end of service benefit provision made to 
employees in accordance with the UAE and Saudi Arabia Labour Laws.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
for the year ended 31 December 2017 81 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company are prepared in the currency of the primary economic environment in which  
it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of these financial statements US Dollars (US$) is the functional currency of the Group  
and the presentation currency of the Group. In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies  
other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. 
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when 
the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for exchange differences on monetary items 
receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur, which form part of the net 
investment in a foreign operation, and which are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve and recognised in profit or loss on 
disposal of the net investment.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial information, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s subsidiaries are expressed in US 
Dollars using exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange 
rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuated significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the dates of the 
transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity 
(attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate).
On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of  
control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, loss of joint control over a jointly controlled entity that includes a foreign operation, 
or loss of significant influence over an associate that includes a foreign operation), all of the accumulated exchange differences in respect  
of that operation attributable to the Group are reclassified to profit or loss. Any exchange differences that have previously been attributed  
to non-controlling interests are derecognised, but they are not reclassified to profit or loss.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from ‘profit before tax’ as reported in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income because of items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are 
never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities in the financial statements  
and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such deferred tax assets  
and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests  
in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based  
on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the 
income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also 
dealt with in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities 
on a net basis.
Long term incentive plans
The fair value of an equity instrument is determined at the grant date based on market prices if available, taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which those equity instruments were granted. If market prices are not available for share awards, the fair value of the equity 
instruments is estimated using a valuation technique to derive an estimate of what the price of those equity instruments would have been  
at the relevant measurement date in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties.  82 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
3 Significant accounting policies continued
Long term incentive plans continued
Equity-settled share based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the instruments, using a binomial model together with 
Monte Carlo simulations as at the grant date, and is expensed over the vesting period. The value of the expense is dependent upon certain 
key assumptions including the expected future volatility of the Group’s share price at the date of grant. The fair value measurement reflects all 
market based vesting conditions. Service and non-market performance conditions are taken into account in determining the number of rights 
that are expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative 
expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves. 
Financial assets
The Group has the following financial assets: cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables (excluding prepayments and advances 
to suppliers) and amounts due from related parties. These financial assets are classified as ‘loans and receivables’. The classification 
depends on the nature and purpose of the financial asset and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and balances held with banks with original maturities of three months or less.
Trade and other receivables and amounts due from related parties
Trade and other receivables (excluding prepayments and advances to suppliers) and due from related parties that have fixed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for 
short-term receivables or when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period. Financial assets are considered to be impaired 
when there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the 
estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
Objective evidence of impairment could include:
• significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; or
• default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or
• it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are subsequently 
assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s past 
experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period, as well as 
observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. The provision is determined by 
reference to previous experience of recoverability for receivables in each market in which the Group operates.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment loss recognised is the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade 
receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against  
the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring 
after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the extent that the 
carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had  
the impairment not been recognised.
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the 
financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest 
in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the 
proceeds received.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Classification as debt or equity
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual 
arrangement.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity 
instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss ‘FVTPL ’ or ‘other financial liabilities’.
Derivatives that are not designated and effective as hedging instruments are classified as financial liabilities and are held at FVTPL. 
Derivatives held at FVTPL are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period with the resulting gain or loss recognised in profit or loss immediately.
Trade and other payables, bank borrowings, loans from related parties, amounts due to related parties and other liabilities are classified  
as ‘other financial liabilities’. Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.  
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised 
on an effective yield basis, except for short-term payables or when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the 
relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the 
financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk. As at 31 December 2017, the 
Group did not have any open derivative financial instruments.
Derivatives that are not designated and effective as hedging instruments are classified as financial liabilities or financial assets and are held  
at FVTPL. Derivatives held at FVTPL are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period with the resulting gain or loss recognised in profit or loss immediately.  
All derivatives are carried at their fair values as assets where the fair values are positive and as liabilities where the fair values are negative.  
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months 
and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
Fair values of the derivatives are carried out by independent valuers by reference to quoted market prices, discounted cash flow models and 
recognised pricing models as appropriate. They represent Level 2 financial instruments under the IFRS hierarchy. Changes in the fair value  
of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in profit or loss as they arise. Derivative financial 
instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are classified as held for trading derivatives.
4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and 
associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects 
both current and future periods.
The following are the critical judgements and key sources of estimation, which management have made in the process of applying the Group’s 
accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty that may have a significant risk of causing  
a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are outlined below.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment
Management evaluate the carrying amounts of the Group’s vessels and vessels under construction to determine whether there is any 
indication that those vessels have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of vessels is estimated  
in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).  84 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. As part of the process of assessing fair values less  
costs to sell of the vessel, management obtain vessel valuations from leading, independent and internationally recognised ship brokers on an 
annual basis or when there is an indication that the value of the vessel may be impaired. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a real pre-tax discount rate of 11.5% that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. The projection of cash 
flows related to vessels is complex and requires the use of various estimates including future day rates, vessel utilisation and discount rates. 
These estimates are based on a number of key assumptions including asset replacement cost, ongoing maintenance and repair costs and 
estimated asset usage over the relevant period. These factors make it impracticable to provide sensitivity analysis on one single measure  
and its potential impact on the recoverable amount of the asset. Further details of impairment charges during the year are provided in note 8. 
As at 31 December 2017 the Group had property, plant and equipment of US$ 804.5 million (2016 US$ 852.4 million). 
Impairment of accounts receivable
An estimate of the collectible amount of trade accounts receivable is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. The Group 
reviews the ageing of trade receivables regularly and the need for allowances against doubtful debts is considered for trade receivables  
that are past due based on estimated irrecoverable amounts determined by reference to past default experience of the counterparty and  
an analysis of the counterparty’s current financial position. Any difference between the amounts actually collected in future periods and  
the amounts expected to be impaired will be recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. As at 31 December 2017 
the Group had net trade accounts receivable of US$ 12.3 million (2016 US$ 19.3 million). Further details in this area are provided in note 11.
Critical accounting judgements 
The following are the critical judgements that the Directors have made in applying the Group’s accounting policies that have the most 
significant effect in the amounts recognised in the financial statements. 
Accounting treatment of the new loan facility 
Management have determined that the terms of the new loan facility acquired in the year are substantially different from the old facility 
previously held by the Group. Therefore, the old facility has been derecognised with all associated unamortised arrangement and 
commitment fees expensed within the statement of comprehensive income. 
The new facility was initially recognised at fair value which was estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation based upon the Group’s 
current borrowing rate and remaining maturities consistent with the debt being valued. The new facility will subsequently be recognised as a 
financial lability at amortised cost. Any costs incurred on the new loan facility have also been recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income along with the gain arising from recognition of the new facility. This has resulted in additional finance expenses of US$ 14.2 million, 
with further details in note 24.
Capitalisation of vessel costs
Management exercises judgement in assessing the extent to which costs incurred in relation to its vessel fleet, including overheads, dry docking 
expenditure and finance charges, meet the criteria for capitalisation under IFRS. Judgement is also required in determining the date at which 
vessels under construction are ready for use at which point capitalisation of the majority of costs ceases and depreciation commences. 
Further details of expenditure incurred during the year is provided in note 8.
5 Segment reporting 
Management have identified that the Directors and senior management team are the chief operating decision makers in accordance with the 
requirements of IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’. Segment performance is assessed based upon adjusted gross profit, which represents gross 
profit before depreciation and amortisation and loss on impairment of assets. The reportable segments have been identified by management 
based on the size and type of asset in operation.
The operating and reportable segments of the Group are (i) Small Class vessels which includes the Kamikaze, Kikuyu, Kawawa, Kudeta, 
Keloa, Kinoa and Pepper vessels (ii) Mid-Size Class vessels which includes the Shamal, Scirocco and Sharqi vessels, (iii) Large Class vessels 
which includes the Endeavour, Endurance, Enterprise and Evolution vessels, and (iv) Other vessels, considered non-core assets, which 
includes one accommodation barge (Khawla) and one 35-year old vessel (Naashi) which do not form part of the Small, Mid-Size or Large 
Class vessels segments. The composition of the Other vessels segment, which are non-core assets, was amended during the year following 
the sale of two anchor handling tugs, and the reclassification of the vessel Naashi from Small Class vessels to Other vessels following its 
impairment (comparative figures have also been adjusted to reflect this).
All of these operating segments earn revenue related to the hiring of vessels and related services including charter hire income, messing and 
accommodation services, personnel hire and hire of equipment. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the 
Group’s accounting policies described in note 3.

The total revenue from reportable segments which comprises the Small, Mid-Size and Large Class vessels is US$ 112.9 million (2016: US$ 
171.4 million). The Other vessels segment does not constitute a reportable segment per IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
Segment revenue reported above represents revenue generated from external customers. There were no inter-segment sales in the periods.
Segment assets and liabilities, including depreciation, amortisation and additions to non-current assets, are not reported to the chief 
operating decision makers on a segmental basis and are therefore not disclosed.
Information about major customers
Certain customers individually accounted for greater than 10% of the Group’s revenue. During the year, seven customers (2016: three) 
individually accounted for more than 10% of the Group’s revenues. The related revenue figures for these major customers, the identity  
of which may vary by year, were US$ 18.35 million (2016: US$ 51.46 million), US$ 17.05 million (2016: US$ 40.46 million), US$ 15.61 million 
(2016: US$ 24.45 million), US$ 14.73 million (2016: US$ 16.71 million), US$ 13.84 million (2016: US$ 14.4 million), US$ 13.81 million  
(2016: US$ 9.58 million) and US$ 13.16 million (2016: US$ 8.23 million). The revenue from these customers is attributable to the Large  
Class vessels, Mid-Size Class vessels and Small Class vessels reportable segments.

Basic (loss)/earnings per share is calculated by dividing the (loss)/profit attributable to equity holders of the Company (as disclosed in the 
statement of comprehensive income) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated on the same basis but uses the earnings for the purpose of basic earnings per share (shown above) 
adjusted by adding back the impairment charge on certain vessels (US$ 7.3 million), written-off unamortised loan arrangement fees 
(US$ 9.6 million), written-off unamortised loan facility fees (US$ 1.4 million), costs to acquire a new bank facility (US$ 5.9 million) and fair value 
gain on financial liabilities held at amortised cost (US$ 1.3 million) which have been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.  
The adjusted earnings per share is presented the Directors consider it provides an additional indication of the underlying performance of 
the Group.
Diluted (loss)/earnings per share is calculated by dividing the (loss)/profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, adjusted for the weighted average effect of share options outstanding during the 
year. As the Group incurred a loss in 2017, diluted loss per share is the same as loss per share, as the effect of share options is anti-dilutive.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated on the same basis but uses adjusted profit (note 6) attributable to equity holders of 
the Company.

The carrying amount of vessels held under finance leases was nil (2016: US$ 38.4 million) as the Group returned the formerly leased vessel 
Kinoa to its lessor in August 2017. The Group also derecognised a related lease liability of US$ 37.5 million resulting in a loss on disposal of 
US$ 0.7 million.
Depreciation amounting to US$ 27.0 million (2016: US$ 27.2 million) has been allocated to cost of sales. The balance of the depreciation 
charge is included in general and administrative expenses.
Included in additions to the vessels under construction is US$ 3.3 million (2016: US$ 2.4 million) in respect of capitalised borrowing costs.  
The capitalisation rate used to determine this figure was 3.37% (2016: 3.99%) based on specific borrowing rates.
Certain vessels, with a total net book value of US$ 748.1 million (2016: US$ 566.6 million), have been mortgaged as security for the loans 
extended by the Group’s banking syndicate (note 19).
Impairment Assessment 
The Group undertook a full impairment review of its fixed assets during the year. The Group recognised an impairment charge of US$ 7.3 million 
on a 35-year old vessel to reduce its carrying amount to its estimated recoverable amount of US$ 3.0 million. The outlook for a vessel of that 
age in securing work in the current environment in the medium term has deteriorated with clients having a tendency to elect for more modern 
tonnage. The impairment charge has been expensed in the statement of comprehensive income through cost of sales.
For the purpose of the impairment assessment, each vessel is considered a separate cash-generating unit (“CGU”) and management has 
estimated the recoverable amounts of its vessels based on their value in use. The cash flow projections used in determining the value in  
use of each CGU were based on forecasts prepared by management taking into account past experience. The average compound annual 
growth rates (“CAGR”) in revenue for the CGUs were assumed as an average upward revision of 10.0% (2016: 6.8%) between 2018 and 2022, 
remaining flat thereafter. The CAGR is dependent on the average utilisation and charter rate of the vessels.
  
The risk adjusted cash flows have been discounted using a real pre-tax discount rate of 11.5% (2016: 11.5%) which was estimated taking into 
consideration the weighted average cost of capital of a portfolio of peer group companies with similar assets.

*  Prepayments and deposits include guarantee deposits of US$ 0.61 million (2016: US$ 0.69 million). Guarantee deposits are paid by the Group for employee work visas 
under UAE labour laws. These deposits become refundable to the Group upon the cancellation of an employee’s work visa. Work visas are not granted indefinitely in the 
UAE and as such these deposits which are currently held by the government in the UAE are refundable to the Group. 
Gross trade receivables, amounting to US$ 9.8 million (2016: US$ 16.8 million), have been assigned as security against the loans extended  
by the Group’s banking syndicate (note 19).
Trade receivables and other receivables disclosed above are classified as loans and receivables and are therefore measured at amortised cost. 
Trade and other receivables are all current and the Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables is approximately 
equal to their fair value due to the very short time between inception and maturity (based on level 2 fair value measurements as defined by the 
fair value hierarchy according to IFRS 13). 
The normal credit period granted to customers is 30 – 45 days (2016: 30 – 45 days). Before accepting any new customer the Group assesses 
the potential credit quality of the customer. The Group has policies in place to ensure that credit sales are rendered to customers with an 
appropriate credit history.
The Group reviews the ageing of trade receivables regularly and the need for allowances against doubtful debts is considered for trade 
receivables over 60 days based on estimated irrecoverable amounts determined by reference to past default experience of the counterparty 
and an analysis of the counterparty’s current financial position. 90 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
11  Trade and other receivables continued
The Group does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements over any of its trade receivables nor does it have a legal right of offset 
against any amounts owed by the Group to the counterparty.
The movement in the allowance for doubtful receivables during the year was as follows:

At 31 December 920 2,287
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the 
date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. Trade receivables are considered past due once they have passed their contracted 
due date.
Included in the Group’s trade receivables balance are receivables with a carrying amount of US$ 2.32 million (2016: US$ 7.39 million)  
which are past due for 30 days or more at the reporting date. The average age of these past due receivables is 190 days (2016: 96 days).

however, credit risk is considered to be limited due to historical performance and ongoing assessments of customer credit and 
liquidity positions.

and its subsidiaries. At the date the Company became the new parent company of the Group via a share-for-share exchange, the difference 
between the share capital of GMS Global Commercial Investments LLC and the Company, amounting to US$ 49.7 million, was recorded in 
the books of Gulf Marine Services PLC as a group restructuring reserve. This reserve is non-distributable.
15  Share option reserve
Share option reserve of US$ 2.5 million (2016: US$ 1.7 million) relates to awards granted to employees under the long-term incentive plans

In December 2017, the Group entered into a new bank loan facility. The principal terms of the new bank loan facility are as follows: 
• The facility is repayable with final maturity in December 2023 (2016: November 2021);
• The revolving working capital facility amounts to US$ 50.0 million. The total facility remained undrawn at 31 December 2017 and is 
available for drawdown until December 2023 (2016: US$ 50.0 million available for drawdown until December 2017);
• The capex loan facility which had an undrawn balance of US$ 95.0 million was cancelled in June 2017; (2016: US$ 95.0 million available  
for drawdown until December 2017);
• The facility remains secured by mortgages over certain Group vessels, with a net book value at 31 December 2017 of US$ 748.1 million 
(2016: US$ 566.6 million); and
• The facility is subject to certain financial covenants including; Finance Service Cover, Interest Cover, Net Leverage Ratio, and Security 
Cover (loan to value). The Group remained in full compliance with these covenants at year end. 
A fair value gain of US$ 1.3 million (2016: nil) has been recognised in relation to the extinguishment of the old facility and recognition of the 
new bank facility at its initial fair value. The fair values of the bank borrowings were determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing 
models based on a discounted cash flow analysis, using appropriate market interest rates. These represent level 3 value measurements as 
defined by the fair value hierarchy according to IFRS 13.

20  Taxation charge for the year 
Tax is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions in which the Group operates. The overall effective rate is the aggregate 
of taxes paid in jurisdictions where income is subject to tax (being principally Qatar, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Saudi Arabia), 
divided by the Group’s profit.

Tax (credit)/charge per financial statements (167) 1,377
During the year tax on profits and withholding taxes of the Group from operations were 10% in Qatar (2016: 10%) and 19.25% in the  
United Kingdom (2016: 20%). The Group incurred 5% withholding taxes on revenue (2016: 5%) and 2.5% Zakat tax on profit from operations  
in Saudi Arabia (2016: 2.5%). Also, the Group incurred an income tax in Saudi Arabia on the non-GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) owned 
element of net profit at 20%. The withholding tax included in the current tax charge amounted to US$ 1.7 million (2016: US$ 0.5 million). 
During the year, a tax refund of US$ 2.4 million was received in respect of tax overpaid in 2014 and 2015 mainly arising from a change in UK 
tax legislation.
The Group expects the overall effective tax rate in the future to vary according to local tax law changes in jurisdictions which incur taxes,  
as well as any changes to the share of the Group profits which arise in tax paying jurisdictions. 
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of US$ 6.9 available for offset against future profits with an indefinite expiry 
period. As at 31 December 2017, a deferred tax asset has been recognised in full in respect of such losses as below.

Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure its ability to continue as a going concern while maximising the return on equity. The Group does  
not have a formalised optimal target capital structure or target ratios in connection with its capital risk management objectives. The Group’s 
overall strategy in this regard remains unchanged throughout the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016.
Significant accounting policies
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the 
basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are 
disclosed in note 3 to the financial statements.
Financial risk management objectives
The Group is exposed to the following risks related to financial instruments – credit risk, liquidity risk, cash flow, interest rate risk and foreign 
currency risk. The management actively monitors and manages these financial risks relating to the Group.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
for the year ended 31 December 2017 99 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
Credit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counter party will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group, and arises 
principally from the Group’s trade and other receivables and bank balances. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy 
counterparties which have been determined based on credit checks and other financial analysis, such that significant revenue is generated 
by dealing with high profile well known customers, for whom the credit risk is assessed to be suitably low. The Group attempts to control 
credit risk by monitoring credit exposures, limiting transactions with specific non-related counterparties, and continually assessing the 
creditworthiness of such non-related counterparties. Cash balances held with banks are assessed to have low credit risk of default since 
these banks are highly regulated by the central banks of the respective countries. 
Concentration of credit risk arises when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same 
geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by 
changes in economic, political or other conditions. Concentration of credit risk indicates the relative sensitivity of the Group’s performance to 
developments affecting a particular industry or geographic location. During the year, vessels were chartered to two Middle East and eight 
international companies, including international oil companies and engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractors. At 
31 December 2017, these ten companies accounted for 99% (2016: 99%) of the outstanding trade receivables. The credit risk on liquid funds 
is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international agencies.
The amount that best represents maximum credit risk exposure on financial assets at the end of the reporting period, in the event 
counterparties failing to perform their obligations generally approximates their carrying value. Trade and other receivables and cash balances 
held with banks are not secured by any collateral.
Foreign currency risk management
The majority of the Group’s transactions are denominated in UAE Dirhams, Euros, US Dollars and Pound Sterling. As the UAE Dirham and the 
Saudi Riyal is pegged to the US Dollar, balances in UAE Dirham and Saudi Riyals are not considered to represent significant currency risk. 
Transactions in other foreign currencies entered into by the Group are short-term in nature and therefore management considers that the 
currency risk associated with these transactions is limited and consequently this risk is typically not hedged, other than in relation to 
significant foreign currency capital expenditure programmes. 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s significant foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the reporting date are as follows:

At 31 December 2017, if the exchange rate of the currencies other than the UAE Dirham and Saudi Riyal had increased/decreased by 10% 
against the US Dollar, with all other variables held constant, the Group’s profit for the period would have been higher/lower by US$ 1.2 million 
(2016: higher/lower by US$ 1.9 million) mainly as a result of foreign exchange loss or gain on translation of Euro and Pound Sterling 
denominated balances.
Interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on its bank borrowings which are subject to floating interest rates. 
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at the end of the 
reporting period. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the end of the reporting 
period was outstanding for the whole year. A 50 basis point increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key 
management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates. 
If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the year ended 
31 December 2017 would decrease/increase by US$ 2.1 million (2016: decrease/increase US$: 2.1 million). This is mainly attributable to the 
Group’s exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings. 
Liquidity risk management
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management 
framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Group 
manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity 
profiles of financial assets and liabilities. 100 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017

Management believe that the difference between fair value and carrying value is negligible.
35 Long term incentive plans
The Group has Long Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs), performance shares and share options which were granted to senior management, managers 
and senior offshore officers. The release of these shares is conditional upon continued employment, certain market vesting conditions and in  
the case of senior management LTIP awards; performance against three-year target EPS compound annual growth rates. Equity-settled 
share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined, using the Binomial Probability Model together 
with Monte Carlo simulations, at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments, is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately vest. The fair value of each award is determined by taking into 
account the market performance condition, the term of the award, the share price at grant date, the expected price volatility of the underlying 
share and the risk-free interest rate for the term of the award. 
Non-market vesting conditions, which for the Group mainly relate to the continual employment of the employee during the vesting period, and 
in the case of the senior management LTIP awards the achievement of EPS growth targets, are taken into account by adjusting the number of 
equity instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period 
is based on the number of options that eventually vest. Any market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted.
To the extent that share options are granted to employees of the Group’s subsidiaries without charge, the share option charge is capitalised 
as part of the cost of investment in subsidiaries.
The number of share awards granted by the Group during the year is given in the table below together with their weighted average exercise 
price (‘WAEP’).

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
for the year ended 31 December 2017
1 Corporate information 
Gulf Marine Services PLC is a private limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act. On 7 February 2014, 
the Company re-registered as a public limited company. The address of the registered office of the Company is 6th Floor, 65 Gresham Street, 
London, EC2V 7NQ. The registered number of the Company is 08860816.
The Company is the parent company of the Gulf Marine Services Group comprising of Gulf Marine Services PLC and its underlying 
subsidiaries. The consolidated group accounts are publicly available. 
These separate financial statements were approved and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of Gulf Marine Services PLC  
(“the Company”) on 26 March 2018.
2 Accounting policies
Currency 
The functional and presentational currency of the Company is United States Dollars. 
Going concern
The Company’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development and position, are set out in the Directors’ 
Report on page 60 and Strategic Report on pages 4 to 29.
The Company participates in the Group’s centralised treasury arrangements and so shares banking arrangements with its underlying subsidiaries.
After making enquiries and on the basis of their assessment of the Group’s financial position, the Company’s Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they have 
adopted the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. 
Basis of accounting 
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. They have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention, modified to include certain items at fair value, and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102  
(FRS 102) issued by the Financial Reporting Council. 
The Company has elected to take the exemption under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’) to not present the Company 
Income Statement nor the Company Statement of Comprehensive Income. The result for the Company for the year was a loss of US$ 2.7 
million (2016: loss of US$ 2.7 million). 
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries and associates are recognised at deemed cost, which is the previous GAAP carrying value at the 
transition date, less impairment.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (“FVTPL”) or ‘‘other financial liabilities’’.
Trade and other payables, loans from related parties and other liabilities are classified as ‘‘other financial liabilities’’. Other financial liabilities, 
are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis, except for short-term payables or when the recognition 
of interest would be immaterial.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the 
relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the 
financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Company derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity 
instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial assets
All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract 
whose terms require delivery of the asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned. They are initially measured at fair value, 
plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through the profit and loss account, which are initially 
measured at fair value.  106 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
2 Accounting policies continued
Financial instruments continued
Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets ‘at fair value through profit or loss’ (FVTPL), ‘held-to-
maturity’ investments, ‘available-for-sale’ (AFS) financial assets and ‘loans and receivables’. The classification depends on the nature and 
purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Loans and receivables
Loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as ‘loans and 
receivables’. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. Interest income 
is recognised by applying the effective interest rate method, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be 
immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective 
evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows 
of the investment have been affected.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form an integral part of the 
Company’s cash management and are included as a component of cash at bank and in hand for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK Corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions 
or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet 
date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its 
results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessment periods different from those in 
which they are recognised in the financial statements.
Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be 
regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences 
can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date that are 
expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference. 
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the contracted rate or the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the 
gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Share based payments
The fair value of an equity instrument is determined at the grant date based on market prices if available, taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which those equity instruments were granted. If market prices are not available for share awards, the fair value of the equity 
instruments is estimated using a valuation technique to derive an estimate of what the price of those equity instruments would have been at 
the relevant measurement date in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties. 
Equity-settled share based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the instruments, using a binomial model together with 
Monte Carlo simulations as at the grant date, and is expensed over the vesting period. The value of the expense is dependent upon certain 
key assumptions including the expected future volatility of the Group’s share price at the date of grant. The fair value measurement reflects all 
market based vesting conditions. Service and non-market performance conditions are taken into account in determining the number of rights 
that are expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative 
expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Company’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects 
both current and future periods.
The following are the key sources of estimation concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty that may have a significant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. There were no critical accounting judgements.

Investments in subsidiary undertakings are included in the balance sheet of the Company at deemed cost less any provision for impairment. 
The Company performs impairment reviews in respect of fixed asset investments whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that 
the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. An impairment charge is recognised when the recoverable amount of an asset, which is  
the higher of the asset’s net realisable value and its value in use, is less than its carrying amount. The recoverability of investments is primarily 
impacted by the cash flows of the vessels owned by the Group’s subsidiary undertakings. The projection of cash flows related to vessels is 
complex and requires the use of various estimates including future day rates, vessel utilisation levels and discount rates. These estimates are 
based on a number of key assumptions including asset replacement cost, ongoing maintenance and repair costs and estimated asset usage 
over the relevant period. These factors make it impracticable to provide sensitivity analysis on one single measure and its potential impact on 
the recoverable amount of the vessels and hence the Company’s investments in its subsidiaries. As at 31 December 2017 the Company had 
investments of US $573.5 million (2016 US$ 573.5 million).

a subsidiary undertaking under a long-term incentive plan, details of which are provided in note 12. The share option charge during the year 
was US$ 0.8 million.
The retained earnings represent cumulative profits or losses net of dividends paid and other adjustments.

12  Long term incentive plans
The Group has Long Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs), performance shares and share options which were granted to senior management, 
managers and senior offshore officers. The release of these shares is conditional upon continued employment, certain market vesting 
conditions and in the case of senior management LTIP awards; performance against three-year target EPS compound annual growth rates. 
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined, using the Binomial Probability 
Model together with Monte Carlo simulations, at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments, is expensed on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately vest. The fair value of each award is determined by 
taking into account the market performance condition, the term of the award, the share price at grant date, the expected price volatility of the 
underlying share and the risk-free interest rate for the term of the award. 
Non-market vesting conditions, which for the Group mainly relate to the continual employment of the employee during the vesting period, and 
in the case of the senior management LTIP awards the achievement of EPS growth targets, are taken into account by adjusting the number of 
equity instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period 
is based on the number of options that eventually vest. Any market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted.
To the extent that share options are granted to employees of the Group’s subsidiaries without charge, the share option charge is capitalised 
as part of the cost of investment in subsidiaries.
The number of share awards granted by the Group during the year is given in the table below together with their weighted average exercise 
price (‘WAEP’).

Share price £0.71 £1.31 
Exercise price £0.00 £0.00
Expected volatility 40% 34%

Expected dividend yield 3.3% 1.5%
Vesting period 3 years 3 years
Award life 3 years 3 years
Market performance condition 36.0% 37.9%
The expected share price volatility of Gulf Marine Services PLC shares was determined taking into account the average of the volatility of two 
comparable companies at each of the grant dates.
The risk free return was determined from similarly dated zero coupon UK government bonds at the time the share awards were granted, using 
historical information taken from the Bank of England’s records.
The charge arising from share-based payments is disclosed in note 9.

Capital risk management
The Company manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders.
The capital structure of the Company consists of cash and short-term deposits and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, 
comprising issued capital, reserves and loss for the period as disclosed in note 9. 
The Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Significant accounting policies
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted (including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the 
bases for recognition of income and expenses) for each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in the 
accounting policies to the financial statements (see note 2).

All financial liabilities are repayable upon demand. 
Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Company is exposed to the following risks related to financial instruments – credit risk, cash flow and liquidity risk, foreign currency risk 
and interest rate risk. The management actively monitors and manages these financial risks relating to the Company.
Credit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counter party will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Company, and  
arises principally from the Company’s trade and other receivables. The Company has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy 
counterparties, for whom the credit risk is assessed to be low. The Company attempts to control credit risk by monitoring credit exposures, 
limiting transactions with specific non-related counter-parties, and continually assessing the creditworthiness of such non-related counter-
parties. Balances with banks are assessed to have low credit risk of default since these banks are highly regulated by the central banks  
of the respective countries. 
The amount that best represents maximum credit risk exposure on financial assets at the end of the reporting period, in the event counter 
parties failing to perform their obligations generally approximates their carrying value. Trade and other receivables are not secured by  
any collateral.
The Company’s principal financial assets are bank balances, and intercompany and other receivables. The Company’s main credit risk is 
primarily attributable to its key intercompany receivables. The Company has no other significant concentration of credit risk. An allowance  
for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence for a reduction in the 
recoverability of the cash flows.
Cash flow and liquidity risk
The Company is not exposed to any significant cash flow or liquidity risk. The Company currently has sufficient cash to fund its activities. 
However, in the event that additional liquidity is required for ongoing operations and future developments, the Company has access to 
additional funding from other Group entities which it controls. 
Foreign currency risk management
The majority of the Company’s transactions are in either UAE Dirhams or US Dollars. Transactions in other foreign currencies entered into  
by the Company are short term in nature and therefore management considers that the currency risk associated with these transactions  
is limited and consequently this risk is not hedged.
Interest rate risk management
The Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities are interest-free; accordingly the Company is not subject to any interest rate risk.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
The Company’s management considers that the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities approximates their carrying amounts. 112 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017

EXPLANATION OF RESOLUTIONS 
Resolution 1 – To receive the Report and Accounts
The directors are required to present the Company’s audited accounts, directors’ reports and auditor’s report to the AGM. These are 
contained in the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts.
Resolution 2 – To approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
This resolution deals with the remuneration paid to the directors during the year under review. Shareholders are invited to vote on the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, which appears on pages 44 to 55 in the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts (excluding the directors remuneration policy 
set out on pages 44 to 55 of the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts (the “Directors’ Remuneration Policy”)). Resolution 2 is an advisory vote.
Resolution 3 – To approve the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
This resolution proposes the approval of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. The Company is required to put the Director’s Remuneration 
Policy to a binding shareholder vote by way of ordinary resolution at least once every three years, irrespective of whether changes are 
proposed to the policy. As shareholders last approved the Directors’ Remuneration Policy at the first AGM of the Company held on 6 May 
2015, it is necessary to put the policy to shareholders for approval at this AGM. Unlike resolution 2, this resolution is a binding vote and, 
assuming it is passed, will take effect from the conclusion of the meeting. There are no substantive changes between the policy proposed  
for approval at the AGM and the policy approved at the first AGM of the Company held on 6 May 2015.
Resolutions 4 to 8 – Re-election of Directors
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code and consistent with relevant institutional voting guidance, all current directors of the 
Company will seek re-election by shareholders at the AGM. 
No independent non-executive director seeking re-election at the AGM has any existing or previous relationship with the Company, nor with 
any controlling shareholder of the Company or any associate of a controlling shareholder of the Company within the meaning of Listing Rule 
13.8.17R(1). In considering the independence of the non-executive directors, the Board has taken into account the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. The Board continues to consider Simon Batey and W. Richard Anderson to be independent non-executive directors in accordance 
with provision B.1.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
In accordance with the Listing Rules, Dr Karim El Solh is classed as a representative of a “controlling shareholder” of Gulf Marine Services 
PLC and is not considered to be an independent non-executive director. The Company entered into a Relationship Agreement with its 
“controlling shareholders” effective 14 March 2014 in accordance with Listing Rule 9.2.2AR(2)(a), which serves to ensure that the controlling 
shareholders and their representatives (including Dr Karim El Solh) comply with the independence provisions outlined in Listing Rule 6.1.4DR. 
The Listing Rules also require that independent non-executive directors be elected by a majority of votes cast by independent shareholders  
in addition to a majority of votes cast by all shareholders in the Company. Therefore, the resolutions for the election of the independent 
non-executive directors (resolutions 6 and 7) will be taken on a poll and the votes cast by independent shareholders and all shareholders 
will be calculated separately. Such resolutions will be passed only if a majority of votes cast by independent shareholders are in favour, 
in addition to a majority of votes cast by all shareholders being in favour.
Full biographies of all the directors are set out in the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts and are also available for viewing on the Company’s 
website (http://www.gmsuae.com). Following an external Board evaluation process and recommendation from the Nomination Committee, 
the Board is satisfied that each director seeking re-election at the AGM continues to be effective and demonstrates a commitment to the role 
and that each such director continues to be able to dedicate sufficient time to their duties. The Board believes that its composition continues 
to include an appropriate balance of skills and provides effective leadership for the Company. 
It is intended that Christopher Foll, currently an alternate director for Dr Karim El Solh, will continue that appointment beyond the AGM without 
seeking re-election by shareholders. If the resolution to re-elect Dr Karim El Solh is not passed by shareholders at the AGM, the alternate 
directorship will immediately cease. 
Resolution 9 – To re-appoint Deloitte LLP as auditor of the Company, to hold office until the conclusion of the next general 
meeting at which accounts are laid before the Company
At each meeting at which the Company’s accounts are presented to its members, the Company is required to appoint an auditor to serve 
until the next such meeting. The Board, on the recommendation of its Audit and Risk Committee, recommends the re-appointment of Deloitte 
LLP as auditor.
Resolution 10 – To authorise the directors to determine the remuneration of Deloitte LLP
This resolution gives authority to the Audit and Risk Committee to determine the auditor’s remuneration.
Resolution 11 – To authorise the directors to allot ordinary shares
The authority in paragraph (a) of this resolution, if passed, would provide the directors with a general authority to allot new shares and grant 
rights to subscribe for, or convert other securities into, shares up to a nominal amount of £11,656,799, which is equal to approximately 33%  
of the issued share capital of the Company as at 26 March 2018, being the latest practicable date before the publication of this Notice. 
Paragraph (b) of resolution 11 will grant the directors additional authority to allot 116,567,991 new shares and grant rights to subscribe for,  
or convert other securities into, shares in connection with a rights issue up to a further nominal amount of, which is equal to approximately 
33% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 26 March 2018, being the latest practicable date before publication of this Notice.  115 GULF MARINE SERVICES PLC Annual Report 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
When taken together, the authorities proposed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this resolution extend (before any reduction) to approximately  
two thirds of the current issued share capital of the Company as at 26 March 2018, being the latest practicable date before the publication  
of this Notice. 
The resolution, if passed, would give the Board the maximum flexibility permitted by investor guidelines to respond to market developments. 
The Board has no current intention to allot shares, except in connection with the Company’s employee share schemes, but the Board intends 
to keep the matter under review.
The authorities conferred by this resolution will expire on the earlier of 30 June 2019 and the conclusion of the Company’s next AGM. It is the 
intention of the directors to seek to renew these authorities every year.
Resolution 12 – To authorise the directors to disapply pre-emption rights
This resolution would, if passed, authorise the directors to allot shares or sell treasury shares for cash (other than in connection with  
an employee share scheme), without having to offer such shares to existing shareholders in proportion to their own holdings (known 
as pre-emption rights):
(a) up to a maximum nominal amount of £1,748,520, which represents approximately 5% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital 
(excluding treasury shares) as at 26 March 2018, being the latest practicable date before publication of this Notice; and
(b) in relation to pre-emptive offers and offers to holders of other equity securities if required by the rights of those securities or as the 
directors otherwise consider necessary, up to a maximum nominal amount of £11,656,799, which represents approximately one third  
of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at as at 26 March 2018, being the latest practicable  
date before publication of this Notice, and, in relation to rights issues only, up to a maximum additional amount of £11,656,799, which 
represents approximately a further one third, of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 26 March 
2018, being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this Notice.
Resolution 12 is consistent with guidance issued by the Investment Association (as updated in July 2016) and the Pre-Emption Group’s 
Statement of Principles (as updated in March 2015) (the “Statement of Principles”). The directors confirm that, in accordance with the 
Statement of Principles, they do not intend to issue shares for cash representing more than 7.5% of the Company’s issued ordinary share 
capital in any rolling three-year period other than to existing shareholders, save as permitted in connection with an acquisition or specified 
capital investment as described above, unless shareholders have been notified and consulted in advance.
The authorities conferred by this resolution will expire on the earlier of 30 June 2019 and the conclusion of the Company’s next AGM. It is the 
intention of the directors to seek to renew these authorities every year.
Resolution 13 – To authorise the Company to make market purchases of its own shares
This resolution would, if passed, authorise the Company to make market purchases of up to 34,970,397 of its own ordinary shares, representing 
just under 10% of the Company’s issued share capital as at 26 March 2018, being the latest practicable date before publication of this Notice. 
The resolution specifies the minimum and maximum prices at which the ordinary shares may be bought under this authority. 
This authority conferred by this resolution will expire on the earlier of 30 June 2019 and the conclusion of the Company’s next AGM. It is the 
intention of the directors to seek to renew this authority every year.
The directors have no present intention of exercising the authority granted by this resolution, but the authority provides the flexibility to allow 
them to do so in future. The directors would not exercise the authority unless they believed that the expected effect would promote the success 
of the Company for the benefit of its shareholders as a whole. Any shares purchased would be effected by a purchase in the market and may 
either be cancelled or held as treasury shares, which may then be cancelled, sold for cash or used to meet the Company’s obligations under 
its employee share schemes. The Company currently has no shares held in treasury.
As at 26 March 2018, being the latest practicable date before publication of this Notice, the total number of options to subscribe for shares  
in the Company was 5,897,948 (approximately 1.7% of the Company’s issued share capital and approximately 1.9% of the Company’s issued 
share capital if the full authority proposed by resolution 13 was used and the shares purchased were cancelled).
Resolution 14 – Notice of general meetings, other than AGMs
Under the Act, the notice period required for all general meetings of the Company is 21 days. An AGM is required by law to be held on at 
least 21 clear days’ notice but shareholders can approve a shorter notice period for other general meetings.
This resolution would, if passed, allow the Company flexibility to call general meetings, other than AGMs, on not less than 14 clear days’ notice. 
The approval will be effective until the Company’s next AGM, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed. 
A resolution in identical terms was passed at the previous AGM of the Company, held on 16 May 2017. 
The Board confirms that, in its opinion, all of the resolutions are in the best interests of the shareholders of the Company  
as a whole and unanimously recommends that shareholders vote in favour of them.

IMPORTANT NOTES
The following notes explain your general rights as a shareholder and your right to attend and vote at this AGM or to appoint someone else to 
vote on your behalf.
1. To be entitled to attend and vote at the AGM (and for the purpose of the determination by the Company of the number of votes they may 
cast), shareholders must be registered in the register of members of the Company at 6.30 p.m. (UK time) on 18 May 2018 (or, in the event 
of any adjournment, 6.30 p.m. (UK time) on the date which is two business days before the time of the adjourned meeting). Changes to  
the register of members after the relevant deadline shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at the 
AGM. There are no other procedures or requirements for entitled shareholders to comply with in order to attend and vote at the AGM.  
In alignment with best practice for UK listed companies, it is the current intention that each of the resolutions to be put to the AGM will  
be voted on by way of a poll and not by show of hands. The Company believes that a poll is more representative of shareholders’ voting 
intentions because shareholder votes are counted according to the number of ordinary shares held and all votes tendered are taken  
into account. 
2. The doors will open at 9.00 a.m. (UK time) and you are recommended to arrive by 9.30 a.m. (UK time) to enable you to register and take 
your seat in good time. Light refreshments will be provided at the AGM. If you have any special needs or require wheelchair access to the 
offices of Linklaters LLP please contact Leanne Shergold by e-mail on lshergold@brunswickgroup.com or telephone +44 (0) 20 7396 7480 
in advance of the AGM. Mobile phones may not be used in the meeting hall, and cameras and recording equipment are not allowed in the 
meeting hall.
3. Members are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or part of their rights to attend and to speak and vote on their behalf at the AGM.  
A shareholder may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the AGM provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights 
attached to a different ordinary share or ordinary shares held by that shareholder. A proxy need not be a shareholder of the Company.  
A form of proxy which may be used to make such appointment and give proxy instructions accompanies this Notice. If you do not have  
a form of proxy and believe that you should have one, or if you require additional forms, please contact the Company’s registrar Equiniti 
(the “Registrar”), on 0371 384 2030 (or from outside the UK: +44 121 415 7047). Lines are open from 8.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. (UK time) 
Monday to Friday, excluding public holidays in England and Wales.
4. In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment submitted by the 
most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company’s 
register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first named being the most senior).
5. Any person to whom this Notice is sent who is a person nominated under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”) to enjoy 
information rights (a “Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement between him/her and the shareholder by whom he/she was 
nominated, have a right to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the AGM. If a Nominated Person has no  
such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she may, under any such agreement, have a right to give instructions  
to the shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.
6. The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies in notes 3, 4 and 9 do not apply to Nominated 
Persons. The rights described in these paragraphs can only be exercised by shareholders of the Company.
7. Members meeting the threshold requirements set out in the Act have the right, subject to certain conditions, to (a) require the Company to 
give notice of any resolution which can properly be, and is to be, moved at the AGM pursuant to section 338 of the Act; and/or (b) include 
a matter in the business to be dealt with at the AGM, pursuant to section 338A of the Act.
8. A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution. If 
no voting indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) 
as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the AGM.
9. To be valid, any form of proxy or other instrument appointing a proxy must be received by the Registrar by post or (during normal business 
hours only) by hand at the address shown on the form of proxy, by e-mail by sending a scanned copy of your completed proxy form to 
proxyvotes@equiniti.com or, in the case of shares held through CREST, via the CREST system (see note 12 below), For proxy appointments  
to be valid, they must be received by no later than 10.00 a.m. (UK time) on 20 May 2018. If you return more than one proxy appointment, 
the proxy appointment received last by the Registrar before the latest time for the receipt of proxies will take precedence. You are advised 
to read the terms and conditions of use carefully. Electronic communication facilities for the receipt of any document or information on 
proxies are open to all shareholders and those who use them will not be disadvantaged.
10. The return of a completed form of proxy or any CREST Proxy Instruction (as described in note 12 below) will not prevent a shareholder 
attending the AGM and voting in person if he or she wishes to do so.
11. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the AGM 
(and any adjournment of the AGM) by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual (available from www.euroclear.com). CREST 
Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a service provider(s), should 
refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
12. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy 
Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s specifications and must contain the 
information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message must be transmitted so as to be received  
by the issuers’ agent (ID RA19) by 10.00 a.m. (UK time) on 20 May 2018. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to the time  
(as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST application host) from which the issuers agent is able to retrieve 
the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time, any change of instructions to proxies appointed 
through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
13. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors, or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited 
does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular message. Normal system timings and limitations will, therefore, 
apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST 
member is a CREST personal member, or sponsored member, or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST 
sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the 
CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting system 
providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. 
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001.
14. Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its powers  
as a member provided that no more than one corporate representative exercises powers relation to the same shares.
15. As at 26 March 2018 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this Notice), the Company’s ordinary issued share capital 
consists of 349,703,973 ordinary shares, carrying one vote each. No shares are held in treasury. Therefore, the total voting rights in the 
Company as at 26 March 2018 are 349,703,973.
16. Under section 527 of the Act, shareholders meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section have the right to require the Company 
to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the Company’s accounts (including the auditor’s report 
and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the AGM; or (ii) any circumstances connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing 
to hold office since the previous meeting at which annual accounts and reports were laid in accordance with section 437 of the Act. The 
Company may not require the shareholders requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in complying with sections 527  
or 528 of the Act. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a website under section 527 of the Act, it must forward the 
statement to the Company’s auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement available on the website. The business which  
may be dealt with at the AGM includes any statement that the Company has been required under section 527 of the Act to publish on  
a website.
17. Any shareholder attending the AGM has the right to ask questions. The Company must cause to be answered any such question relating 
to the business being dealt with at the AGM but no such answer need be given if (a) to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation 
for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information, (b) the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an 
answer to a question, or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting that the question be answered.
18. The following documents are available for inspection during normal business hours at the registered office of the Company on any 
business day from 26 March 2018 until the time of the AGM and may also be inspected at the AGM venue (Linklaters LLP, One Silk Street,

GLOSSARY
Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) – An APM is a financial measure of historical or future financial performance, financial 
position, or cash flows, other than a financial measure defined or specified in the applicable financial reporting framework.
APMs are non-GAAP measures that are presented to provide readers with additional financial information that is regularly reviewed by 
management and the Directors consider that they provide a useful indicator of underlying performance. However, this additional information 
presented is not uniformly defined by all companies including those in the Group’s industry. Accordingly, it may not be comparable with 
similarly titled measures and disclosures by other companies. Additionally, certain information presented is derived from amounts calculated 
in accordance with IFRSs but is not itself an expressly permitted GAAP measure. Such measures should not be viewed in isolation or as an 
alternative to the equivalent GAAP measure. In response to the Guidelines on APMs issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority

 EBITDA – represents Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation, which represents operating profit after adding back 
depreciation and amortisation. This measure provides additional information of the underlying operating performance of the Group.
