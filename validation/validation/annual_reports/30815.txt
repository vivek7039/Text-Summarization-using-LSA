Continuing operations
Unless otherwise stated, the FY 2017 
results and narrative contained in this 
Annual Report reflect the revenue and 
adjusted operating profit of the Essentra 
Group on a continuing basis (ie, excluding 
the Porous Technologies business which 
was divested on 6 March 2017).
Non-GAAP measures
Throughout this FY 2017 Annual Report, 
the following terms are used to describe 
Essentra’s financial performance.
Constant exchange rates
Movements in exchange rates relative to 
sterling affect actual results as reported. 
The constant exchange rate basis adjusts 
the comparative to exclude such 
movements, to show the underlying 
performance of the Company.
For the principal exchange rates for 
Essentra for the year ended 31 December 
2017 (“FY 2017”), see the table below. 
Re-translating at FY 2017 average rates 
increases the prior year revenue and 
adjusted operating profit by £53.0m  
and £6.9m respectively.
Principal  
exchange rates US$:£ €:£
Average
FY 2017 1.30 1.14
FY 2016 1.36 1.23
Closing
FY 2017 1.35 1.13
FY 2016 1.24 1.17
Like-for-like basis
The term “like-for-like” describes the 
performance of the business on a 
comparable basis, excluding the impact  
of acquisitions, disposals and foreign 
exchange. The FY 2017 results are adjusted 
for the divestment of the Bristol consumer 
packaging site on 5 June 2017 . 
Adjusted basis
The term “adjusted” excludes the impact 
of amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets and exceptional operating items, 
less any associated tax impact. In FY 2017 , 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
was £22.9m (FY 2016: £30.2m), and there 
was an exceptional pre-tax charge of 
£56.2m (FY 2016: £128.5m) mainly relating 
to costs associated with the closure of the 
folding cartons facility at Newport, UK, 
the strategic review of the Company and 
the simplification of the organisational 
structure – including the departure of certain 
senior management – during the year.
Constant exchange, like-for-like and 
adjusted measures are provided to reflect 
the underlying performance of Essentra. 
For further details on the performance 
metrics used by Essentra, please refer  
to page 21.
Reconciliation of GAAP to  
non-GAAP measures
The following tables are presented by  
way of reconciling the metrics which 
management uses to evaluate the 
Essentra Group to GAAP measures.
Cash flow
Adjusted operating cash flow is presented  
to exclude the impact of tax, exceptional 
items, interest and other items not 
impacting operating profit. Net capital 
expenditure is included in this measure  
as management regards investment  
in operational assets as integral to the 
underlying cash generation capability  
of the Company.
The financial information in this FY 2017 Annual Report is prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and IFRS 
as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, and with the accounting policies set out on pages 121 to 128.

STRATEGIC REPORT | ESSENTRA AT A GLANCE WHAT WE DO
The Essentra Group comprises nine 
businesses, serving multiple end-
markets with a very broad and 
differentiated range of products  
and services. 
Reflecting our strategic review,  
with effect from 1 January 2018  
Essentra changed its structure and  
is now organised as three global  
divisions of Components, Packaging  
and Filters, with a fourth division – 
Specialist Components – comprising  
our six smaller businesses. 
In order to create sustainable long-term 
value, our business model seeks to 
effectively and efficiently manage  
this portfolio of global leading, diverse 
activities, while adding further to this 
through a clearly articulated role for  
the Group underpinned by robust 
financial and capital allocation policies.
Although our businesses produce  
a diverse range of products and 
serve a wide range of end-markets, 
nonetheless we share a number of 
capabilities and characteristics.
Focus on sizeable end-markets  
with growth opportunities
Essentra has a clear, data-driven strategy 
for each of its Components, Packaging 
and Filters global divisions, each of which 
operates in sizeable end-markets which 
present opportunities for future growth, 
and in which the Company is 
fundamentally well-positioned to drive 
long-term growth and margin expansion.
Develop long-standing blue chip 
customer relationships
Essentra develops and maintains a  
close relationship with a wide portfolio  
of blue chip customers, who are successful 
leaders in their respective markets.  
The high standards of service and supply 
demanded by such customers help to  
drive continuous improvement across  
the Company. Essentra’s manufacturing 
and distribution expertise adds value in 
response to customer demands, and  
its innovative capabilities drive the joint 
development of new products and services 
with key strategic partners.
Invest in innovation capability
The continued successful launch and 
commercialisation of new products  
and services is a key driver of Essentra’s 
growth. Investment in research and 
development functions, supported by  
the identification of additional product 
sourcing opportunities to deliver product 
innovation and range development, 
provides the platform to further enhance 
the Company’s competitive positions. 
Robust quality systems maintained to 
internationally accredited standards assist 
the fulfilment of customers’ demands.
Global partner with local presence
Essentra has a comprehensive 
international production and distribution 
footprint, which can be flexed to respond 
to customers’ needs, whether they be 
product, service, cost or supply chain 
driven. The Company is focused on being  
a low-cost producer, to secure revenue 
growth at attractive margins and 
continuous improvement programmes 
– with tight cost control and productivity 
gains – serving to reduce conversion costs.
Efficient footprint and strong  
value proposition
Essentra has a well-invested and  
flexible international sourcing, supply  
chain and production infrastructure.  
This provides businesses across the 
Company with the opportunity to use the 
existing infrastructure and management  
to exploit new opportunities efficiently and 
cost-effectively. The Company’s extensive 
international distribution network ensures 
the delivery of cost-competitive and 
high-quality products in response to 
customers’ requirements. High levels of 
service and broad geographic reach are  
an important competitive differentiator.
A portfolio of activities …
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM

STRATEGIC REPORT | WHAT WE DO There is clear scope for the Group to 
add value through a defined role.
Portfolio management and strategic 
development
While each division is responsible for 
contributing to the successful delivery 
of Essentra’s strategic and financial 
objectives, it is important that this is 
managed within an established and 
agreed framework which not only 
facilitates and challenges the next stage  
of corporate development, but also 
identifies and exploits any commercial 
synergies between the Essentra businesses. 
Risk management
Effective management of risk and 
opportunity is essential to the protection 
of Essentra’s reputation and the delivery of 
sustainable shareholder value. The Board 
of Directors is responsible for determining 
the risk attitude of the Company and for 
communicating to the organisation what 
constitutes acceptable risk-taking. The 
Board, supported by the Audit Committee, 
also oversees the management process for 
the identification, assessment and 
mitigation of risk across Essentra.
Legal requirements and compliance
Essentra is committed to doing business 
the right way to continually earn the  
trust of its customers, other stakeholders 
and the wider marketplace, and to ensuring 
that all of its activities are conducted in 
accordance with all applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements and the highest 
standards of ethical business conduct. 
Essentra’s Ethics Code helps to ensure that 
everyone working for or on behalf of the 
Company understands its expectations 
and conducts Essentra business in a way 
that is consistent with the Company’s six 
principles and with its procedures.
Together with common sense, logic and 
good faith behaviour, Essentra’s Ethics 
Code provides a framework and structure 
to guide employees in determining the 
correct course of action, and the 
Company’s policies continue to promote 
fair and ethical dealings with customers 
and competitors as a matter of law  
and conscience.
Talent management
Essentra’s greatest asset is its employees 
and, at all levels, we have a highly 
experienced and well-regarded team.  
Their skills and experience are essential  
to driving the innovation which enables 
the Company to provide added value  
to its customers, enhance supply chain 
logistics and reduce the environmental 
impact of its operations.
In creating a winning and engaged team, 
it is important that we have a world-class 
global talent management process and 
high performance ethos. We must also 
strive for excellence in health and safety 
and proactively manage learning and 
development, and our objective is to 
become exemplary with regard to diversity 
and inclusion.
Process alignment and sharing  
of best practice
Sharing certain facilities and functions  
– from Human Resources, Operations  
and Corporate Governance to Finance,  
IT and Commercial – allows us to develop 
and implement aligned processes and 
procedures, identify and fill skill gaps,  
share best practice across the  
Company and exploit our collective  
size, infrastructure, investment  
and capabilities.
A unified “whole”
Our respective businesses have secured 
leadership positions in the majority of  
the industries which they serve. Through 
harnessing this strength in diversity with  
a clearly defined and unifying role for the 
Group – all of which underpinned by clear 
financial and capital allocation policies, 
appropriately aligned to management 
incentives – we are well-placed to  
create sustainable long-term growth  
for our shareholders.

STRATEGIC REPORT | WHAT WE DO CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
In my first full year as Chairman,  
I am very pleased to report that 2017 
saw stability being restored to Essentra 
after a year of challenge and change in 
2016, with our new corporate strategy 
being unveiled by Chief Executive, Paul 
Forman, at the time of our HY 2017 
results. The Board was extensively 
engaged in the strategy review process 
and fully supports the future direction 
set out by Paul, which provides the 
roadmap for future sustainable growth 
across the Group based on the highest 
standards of business ethics and best 
practice governance.
Board composition
As previously reported, Paul Forman joined 
the Board as Chief Executive with effect 
from 1 January 2017 . Paul’s proven track 
record of international experience at  
senior level – in particular in strategy and 
acquisitions – has already shown itself to  
be extremely relevant and beneficial in 
restoring widespread stability to Essentra. 
Paul has provided a clear and data-driven 
strategy which he and his team have 
developed and communicated, which will 
deliver sustainable, long-term shareholder 
value, excellent customer service and a 
motivated and engaged workforce.
In July, as the result of a robust selection 
process led by the Nomination 
Committee, my colleagues and I were 
delighted to welcome Mary Reilly and Ralf  
K. Wunderlich to the Board as independent 
Non-Executive Directors, both of whom 
have extensive international experience 
across a wide range of industries. Mary 
was a Partner at Deloitte LLP for more 
than 20 years and has served on a number 
of Boards in a non-executive capacity 
since 2000, while Ralf – who is currently 
based in Singapore – has an extensive 
knowledge of the packaging industry,  
and has lived and worked across 
three continents. 
Separately, in December, Terry Twigger 
advised the Board that he will be retiring 
as a Director and from his current roles  
as Senior Independent Director (“SID”)  
and Chairman of the Audit Committee, 
following the Company’s 2018 Annual 
General Meting (“AGM”). Terry joined 
Essentra as a Non-Executive Director and 
Chairman of the Audit Committee in 
2009, and was subsequently appointed as 
SID in 2014. On behalf of the Board, I would 
like to thank Terry for his dedication and 
significant commitment to Essentra during 
his nine-year tenure. He has been unfailing 
in his support and guidance throughout, 
and I and my fellow Board members will 
miss both his financial insight and wise 
counsel. We wish him all the very best  
for a long and healthy retirement.
My Board colleagues and I are very pleased 
that Tommy Breen, who joined the Board 
as a Non-Executive Director in 2015, will 
assume the role of SID following the 2018 
AGM and will bring significant experience 
to the position. Replacing Terry as our new 
Audit Committee Chair will be Mary Reilly. 
With her extensive accounting, finance 
and international management 
background, we have no doubt that Mary 
will prove an excellent successor to Terry 
and build further on the important work  
of the Committee which he led with 
considerable skill and expertise. I would  
like to wish both Tommy and Mary every 
success in their new roles. 
As previously advised, Peter Hill and Colin 
Day retired from the Board following the 
Company’s 2017 AGM.
Strategic review
While there was significant focus on 
stabilising the Company during 2017 – not 
least those handful of manufacturing sites 
where we have previously experienced 
operational issues – at the same time,  
we simultaneously developed a clear  
and objective assessment of the various 
businesses within the Essentra organisation 
together with their future potential. We 
have only just started upon this path, but 
the review has confirmed that Essentra is  
a fundamentally strong organisation with 
many positive features to build upon. 
Such a detailed evaluation of any business 
potentially results in tough decisions.  
This was indeed the case with our folding 
cartons site in Newport where, having  
given a number of strategic options careful 
consideration, the Board regrettably 
concluded that the proposal to close the 
facility was the most appropriate route 
given that it was not anticipated to make 
a realistic improvement to profitability in 
the near, or even long, term. The decision 
was in no way a reflection on the quality  
or dedication of our employees there, and  
my fellow Board colleagues and I would  
like to acknowledge the supportive and 
professional way in which they engaged  
in the consultation process.
Paul Lester, CBE
Chairman
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM

STRATEGIC REPORT | CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT In conjunction with the strategic review,  
the Board evaluated the appropriate 
deployment of capital in the business – 
including the amount which is returned  
to shareholders by way of dividends.  
While our financial Key Performance 
Indicators will focus on all value drivers, 
further to the strategy review there is  
a clear and increased emphasis on cash 
generation and returns. These financial  
and capital allocation priorities have been 
aligned to new metrics for both short  
and long-term management incentives, 
upon which we have already consulted  
with shareholders and are subject to 
approval at the 2018 AGM.
People and culture
Change for the better is still change, which 
can be disconcerting for those involved. 
Accordingly, on behalf of the Board, I would 
like to thank all our employees for their 
continued commitment to building a better 
Essentra together. We are proud of our 
international presence in 33 countries and 
we recognise the vital contribution which 
our people make. Indeed, during the course 
of the year, I had the pleasure of visiting  
a number of our facilities – from our head 
offices in Milton Keynes, UK and Chicago, 
US and our Health & Personal Care 
Packaging sites in Portsmouth, UK and 
Charlotte, US, to our Components 
European manufacturing hub in Kidlington, 
UK and our Filter Products joint venture in 
Dubai – and can testify to the skill, passion 
and hard work of our employees. In 
particular, my fellow Board members and  
I would like to pay tribute and give our 
sincere thanks to our 345 colleagues in 
Puerto Rico who, in the face of significant 
personal challenge following hurricane 
Maria, have shown incredible fortitude  
and dedication in attending work and 
supporting our customers, many of whom 
were facing similar hurricane-related issues.
Separately, I attended the leadership 
conference in June, during which the 
output of the strategic review was 
discussed at length with approximately  
100 of our senior management team.  
The lively debate and contribution over the 
three-day offsite was hugely encouraging, 
as was the positive energy for change.
Consistent with Paul and the senior 
management team, the Board is 
committed to making Essentra a great 
place to work, where talent can thrive. We 
therefore whole-heartedly support his focus 
on building employee engagement and, in 
particular, on his priority of creating a safe, 
respectful and diverse environment for our 
people. While we are coming from a low 
base in certain aspects of morale and 
motivation following a challenging 2016,  
my Board colleagues and I are nevertheless 
encouraged by the improvement in 
engagement which has been reported in 
our 2017 surveys, and the focus which is 
being given to following up and implementing 
post-survey action plans in a timely manner .
The Board is committed to achieving  
and maintaining the highest standards  
of occupational health and safety and 
environmental protection, as well as 
making Essentra an exemplary workplace 
with regard to diversity and inclusion. Each 
Board member is required to visit one of the 
Essentra sites each year and to undertake a 
health and safety “walk” around the site to 
focus on these important matters. The 
Board thus fully endorses the priority which 
these critical workplace practices are now 
being given under Paul’s stewardship, which 
is expanded upon in the Chief Executive’s 
Review on pages 10 to 17 .
A stronger company
Last year saw substantial change at 
Essentra, and restoring the Company  
to sustainable, profitable growth will take 
time. However, while there is much still  
to do, we made significant progress  
and widespread improvement during  
2017 so we are already well underway.

STRATEGIC REPORT | CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Paul Forman 
Chief Executive
Having been appointed as Chief 
Executive of Essentra on 1 January 2017 , 
I am pleased to present my first  
Annual Review. 
In summary, following a period of 
turbulence, we did much in 2017 to 
stabilise Essentra; this was not only with 
regard to our operational performance 
metrics, but also in terms of starting  
to win back lost credibility with our 
customers, improving engagement  
with our employees and creating a stable 
balance sheet supported by markedly 
improved cash flow control. At the same 
time, we have developed and articulated  
a sustainable, data-driven corporate 
strategy which will see the various 
activities which comprise the Essentra 
Group restored to profitable growth over 
the medium term behind a talented and 
engaged workforce. At the heart of this 
change programme is our people, where 
the establishment of an agreed set of 
principles and the absolute priority of 
health and safety have been critical 
developments in the culture of excellence 
which we are seeking to create and embed 
across Essentra. 
There is clearly much for us all still to do, 
and this will take time; however, now a 
year into my tenure, I am encouraged by 
the progress we have made to date and  
by the positive energy for change across 
the organisation. 
Financial performance 
FY 2017 revenue decreased 2.3% (at 
constant exchange), with a like-for-like 
decline of 2.0%. The underlying result 
reflected an improved revenue trend in the 
second half of the year, with a continued 
strong result in Component Solutions and  
a material improvement in Filter Products 
offset by a decrease in Health & Personal 
Care Packaging. With a significantly 
positive foreign exchange benefit, together 
with a modest decline from change in 
scope owing to the divestment of the 
Bristol consumer packaging site in June 
2017 , total revenue increased 2.9% to 
£1,027 .3m. 
On an adjusted basis, operating profit  
was down 26.8% (at constant exchange) 
at £84.6m. The 280bps reduction in the 
margin (at constant exchange) to 8.2% 
was largely driven by Health & Personal 
Care Packaging – notably the profit 
drop-through from lower revenue, 
together with a material operating loss  
at our folding cartons site at Newport,  
UK and the impact of hurricane Maria on 
our facilities in Puerto Rico – as well as a 
less profitable revenue and segment mix  
in Tapes. There was a £2.1m decrease in  
our financing costs resulting from a lower 
average net debt position during the year 
and our tax rate was maintained at 20.0%, 
contributing to basic adjusted earnings  
per share (at constant exchange) reducing 
by 30.1% to 22.1p. 
During the year, there was further 
investment in our footprint and equipment, 
with FY 2017 net capital expenditure of 
£45.3m: we also made good progress with 
regard to net working capital management, 
which supported a cash conversion ratio  
of 94.6%. As such, and boosted by net 
proceeds from the divestment of Porous 
Technologies of £210.8m, our financial 
ratios remain robust, with net debt to 
EBITDA of 1.7x and interest cover of 9.0x  
as at 31 December 2017 . As a result, the 
Board is recommending a final dividend  
of 14.4p per share – implying a FY 2017 
dividend of 20.7p per share, unchanged 
versus FY 2016. 
 
My initial impressions
When I joined Essentra, it was clear that 
the Company had experienced a number 
of challenges. Most evident of these was 
the poorly executed integration of the 
Clondalkin Specialist Packaging Division 
(“SPD”), which resulted in certain material 
commercial and operational issues which 
were significantly weighing on the financial 
performance. Beyond this, however, were 
a number of other root causes: Essentra 
did not have a clearly defined corporate 
strategy; the “matrix” organisational 
structure was a source of confusion  
and a consequent lack of accountability; 
there was a conspicuous lack of rigorous 
and consistent process; and the IT 
infrastructure was fragmented and had 
been underinvested. Taking these issues 
together, it was unsurprising, therefore, 
that employee morale was very low and 
there had been an exodus of talent.
Notwithstanding these challenges, my 
initial view was that the Essentra Group  
is comprised of strategically attractive 
businesses, virtually all of which hold 
leadership or number two positions in their 
respective markets, and many of which 
have sustainable organic (and possibly 
acquisition) growth potential thanks to 
their strong competitive advantage and 
their loyal, blue chip customer base. 
Critically, I met many excellent and 
passionate colleagues, who believed in  
the fundamental strengths of Essentra 
and were enthused by the prospect for 
positive change. Accordingly, the issues  
to be overcome were predominantly 
self-inflicted – rather than end-market 
related – and there were solid foundations 
upon which to build.

STRATEGIC REPORT | CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW “During 2017 , we 
successfully restored 
stability across the 
organisation – from 
our people and 
customers to our 
processes and 
finances. A year into 
my tenure, my belief 
in a bright future  
for our Company  
is – if anything –  
even stronger than 
my initial view.”
2017 – a year of stabilisation …
While it was important to initiate the 
strategy development programme at the 
earliest opportunity, at the same time we 
needed to restore stability to the Company 
– from our people and customers to our 
processes and finances.
My priority as Chief Executive is to provide 
employees with a safe, respectful and 
diverse environment, where people want 
to come to work in the morning. In the  
first instance, therefore, it was imperative 
to start to rebuild our corporate culture, 
and to develop and communicate an 
agreed set of values – as well as where  
we aim to take the business and why – to 
ensure we are all clear as to how we should 
behave while in the workplace, as well as 
how we will together build Essentra into 
the best company it can be. Accordingly, 
we established our six principles and three 
steps to long-term success – being Stability, 
Strategy and Growth – which were rolled 
out across the business, supported by  
an extensive programme of video 
communication in all languages and 
townhall presentations. In addition, we 
needed an unambiguous organisational 
structure, which resulted in the disbanding 
of the previous Strategic Business Unit  
and regional matrix in favour of three 
global divisions, each with profit & loss 
accountability and clear lines of reporting 
and responsibility.
Following a period of significant footprint 
change, too often to the detriment of our 
commercial relationships, we undertook  
to stabilise our business and to regain 
revenue momentum behind a new set  
of customer retention initiatives. In the 
case of certain underperforming sites, this  
also entailed the injection of turnaround 
resource – both in terms of judicious 
financial investment and dedicated, 
experienced personnel. This significant 
focus and remedial action was particularly 
evident in Health & Personal Care 
Packaging, as we sought to arrest the 
significant rate of revenue and profit 
decline during the second half of 2016, 
especially at those sites impacted by the 
acquisition integration: we also moved 
rapidly to start to address systems 
challenges and simplify our infrastructure 
in IT, and changed the reporting line of the 
Chief Information Officer (“CIO”) directly 
to me to reflect the critical importance of 
the task ahead.
While 2017 marks the outset of our 
three-step corporate change programme, 
nonetheless we made meaningful progress 
in driving widespread stability during the 
year: compared to a low point in H2 2016, 
our revenue trends have steadied; our key 
performance indicators (notably service 
and quality metrics) have increased 
demonstrably in all three divisions, which 
has helped to enhance the dialogue we are 
having with customers; we have delivered 
a number of successful commercial and 
operational initiatives; and our employee 
engagement surveys have shown excellent 
levels of participation, with improvement 
in all key areas (albeit from a low base,  
in some cases) versus 2016. Underpinning  
all of this is a robust balance sheet and a 
very good level of cash conversion in the 
business, and towards the end of the year 
we successfully refinanced our entire debt 
facilities to extend maturities at attractive 
rates – including the issue of US$75m of  
US Private Placement notes – to ensure 
stability in our finances over the medium 
to long term. 
… and strategic development
Entailing eight different workstreams, the 
aim of our strategy review was to provide 
a well-defined and objective assessment 
of the current status and positioning of 
the various business activities within the 
Essentra organisation, together with  
their future potential. Presented to the 
financial markets at the time of our 
interim results on 28 July 2017 , the output 
of this six-month review has been a clear 
corporate strategy (with options) which is 
aligned to a three-year plan, and provides 
a data-driven view of the areas which may 
require measured additional investment in 
capability / process and of how we intend 
to drive future growth. Ahead of our 
external presentation, however, I was 
pleased to have the opportunity to discuss 
the findings from the strategy review with 
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM
11
STRATEGIC REPORT | CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW our leadership teams from across Essentra 
at our global Management Conference  
in June. Involving a much wider group than 
has previously been so directly involved of 
almost 100 people, I greatly valued their 
contribution to our future, and they have 
collectively done a fantastic job of 
communicating our strategy to their 
respective organisations, to ensure that 
our employees fully understand the 
direction in which we are heading and the 
reasons why , and to solicit their comments 
and questions.
Overall, the strategy review confirmed my 
initial assessment; namely, that the nine 
businesses comprising the Essentra Group 
have strong and defensible strategic 
positions, with operating margins which 
can be sustained or – in the case of Health 
& Personal Care Packaging – improved to 
industry norms over the medium term.  
As part of the review, we also determined 
that with effect from 1 January 2018 –  
and to provide greater focus across the 
portfolio, we should be grouped into three 
global divisions of Components, Packaging 
and Filters, with the creation of a fourth 
Specialist Components division to separately 
manage our six smaller businesses. In 
addition, we clearly defined the role of  
the overall Group in driving value. 
In order to support our stability and future 
growth agenda, we identified the need for 
an incremental £30m of investment over 
three years in key areas; of this, c. £10m is 
IT-related and approximately £20m is to 
drive an equipment upgrade programme 
in Packaging.
Components
Combining the expertise and credibility of  
a manufacturer with the service orientation 
of a distributor there are a number of 
factors which make the c. £8bn Bill of 
Materials “small components” market 
attractive to Essentra. Competitors –  
of which there are hundreds – are either 
distributors or niche manufacturers; it  
is difficult for new entrants to establish 
themselves in a meaningful way due  
to the high cost to produce moulds to 
manufacture standard parts across a  
very broad range of Stock Keeping Units 
(“SKUs”) ; Asia remains a large, growing and 
relatively underdeveloped region; and good 
margins are generally available – among 
other factors. Indeed, no major changes  
in market dynamics or customer needs  
are foreseen in the immediate future.
While there are opportunities for 
improvement – including cross-selling 
across product categories and the rate  
of new customer acquisition – the strategy 
for Components is essentially one of 
evolution from a strong and relatively 
unique proposition. However, over and 
above the scope to grow the division 
organically through expanding into 
faster-growing geographies and adjacent 
product ranges, there is also potential to 
achieve this through bolt-on transactions. 
Indeed, the acquisition of Micro Plastics –  
a leading provider of fasteners – at the  
end of the year, was a great example of the 
consolidation opportunities available to us; 
not only does Micro Plastics significantly 
enhance our offering in the US for one of 
our core product ranges and add custom 
injection moulding capability – as well as 
providing compelling cross-selling potential 
– it also extends our manufacturing 
footprint and gives us access to a number 
of high-growth end-markets in Mexico.
“Our strategic review 
has confirmed that 
the fundamental 
strengths exist across 
our businesses which 
we can build upon, 
and that previous 
challenges were 
caused by internal  
– not external – 
factors.”
Packaging
As one of only two multi-continental 
suppliers of a full range of specialist 
secondary health & personal care 
packaging, Essentra is fundamentally 
well-positioned in an attractive sector: 
underlying markets are stable and 
growing; we have a predominantly blue 
chip customer base which represents a 
high barrier to entry and exhibits a clear 
pattern of “one stop shop” purchasing, 
and industry trends support continuing 
growth and scope for value-added 
opportunities.
However, as mentioned above, through 
the poor integration of the acquisition  
of Clondalkin SPD, we lost much of our 
market share (through a reduced “share  
of wallet”) and customer trust over the 
course of 2016, further to which much of 
our recent focus has been on stabilising 
the business.
As part of the strategy review, and to 
create greater organisational clarity,  
we took the decision to carve out the 
tapes activities from the division and to 
run them as part of the newly-created 
Specialist Components division. In 
addition, low complexity packaging  
for consumer goods applications will  
be de-emphasised: notably, this 
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM
12
STRATEGIC REPORT | CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW unfortunately resulted in the closure of the 
financially and operationally-challenged 
Newport folding cartons site at the end  
of 2017 , and thus the removal of c. £4.5m 
losses in FY 2018.
As we continue to stabilise our underlying 
health & personal care packaging activities, 
we are now starting to leverage our core 
capabilities to drive revenue growth 
through initiatives such as additional 
commercial programmes to materially 
increase customer share of wallet, 
developing a broader and deeper service 
proposition and expanding geographically 
with existing customers. At the same time, 
the delivery of short-term profit levers  
– including procurement and process 
improvement initiatives, as well as the 
benefit from incremental investment in 
upgraded, more efficient equipment –  
are expected to help the division to start  
to improve towards an industry-average 
operating margin.
Filters
While Essentra’s addressed segments  
are fundamentally stable in an overall 
declining tobacco market – given our 
significant weighting towards special filters 
and Asia – there is scope to refine and 
distinguish the current proposition further, 
with the objective of both expanding the 
share of wallet with multi-nationals while 
simultaneously driving share among 
independent customers. In the case of  
the former, rebuilding global key account 
management and providing solutions in 
new geographic markets now demanding 
special filters should help us to strengthen 
and deepen customer relationships; 
regarding the latter, a more tailored offering 
and a better configuration of facilities  
can help to balance their demand for 
innovation with low-cost manufacturing.
Combined with further internal upgrading 
of our innovation capability to become  
a more commercially (rather than 
operationally) led business, and hence  
a more strategic partner, these initiatives 
– which are being led by our new divisional 
Managing Director, Kamal Taneja,  
who joined us in October – are aimed at 
improving customer and market visibility, 
and thereby dampening the historical 
volatility in the project pipeline.
Over and above optimising the existing 
business, we have identified three 
potential “game changers” and we are  
in the process of evaluating these further:
 > China – the world’s largest cigarette 
market (44% global volume) and 
currently served as an export market 
from our sites in Thailand and Indonesia. 
We are exploring a structural move into 
China, supported by our proven special 
filter capability, to capture the clear 
market trends toward premium and 
more international-style products
 > Greater outsourcing – a 1% shift in  
the outsourced filter share represents  
a c. £50m revenue increase to third-
party producers such as Essentra.  
With multi-national players continuing  
to pursue opportunities to rationalise  
their manufacturing footprint and  
to focus on core skills / improve asset 
utilisation, we are exploring the 
potential to help them simplify their 
supply chains through outsourcing a 
greater proportion of filter production
 > Next Generation Products (“NGP”) –  
currently a very small percentage of the 
overall tobacco market, however rapidly 
expanding as multi-nationals increasingly 
focus their innovation spend on both 
vaping (e-cigarette) and Heat Not  
Burn platforms. With a strong position  
in combustibles, and an expanding 
presence in both NGP segments, there  
is the possibility for us to grow in such 
emerging technologies
Given the early stage of evaluating each  
of these potential medium to long-term 
value-creating levers, these are not 
opportunities which we are assuming  
to be certain and we will update the 
financial markets accordingly as our 
analysis progresses.
Specialist Components
The newly-created Specialist Components 
division comprises Essentra’s six smaller 
business activities, which have very limited 
synergy with their previous larger “host” 
divisions and with each other. However,  
in their respective niches, most have 
strong (or at least reasonable) positions 
and all have scope for organic growth. 
Accounting for FY 2017 revenue of c. £164m 
– and with a (potentially variable) high 
single-digit adjusted operating margin  
in aggregate – these activities comprise 
Extrusion, Pipe Protection Technologies, 
Tear Tapes, Speciality Tapes, Industrial 
Supply (the Maintenance, Repair & 
Overhaul (“MRO”) industrial components 
business) and Card Solutions (Security).
We expect that this new organisational 
structure will facilitate faster, more nimble 
management, and that greater focus  
will enable more detailed strategic 
development: it will also give greater 
visibility on the performance of the three 
larger divisions. With effect from 1 January 
2018, Tim Wilson joined Essentra as 
divisional President and – over and  
above maximising short-term tactical 
opportunities – his task over the next six 
months will be to work with each of the 
respective business heads to formulate  
a full range of longer-term strategies.
The role of Finance …
As we have stabilised the Company,  
the Finance function has made a 
significant contribution in providing  
due control, discipline and balance sheet 
management, and will continue to do so  
as we seek to restore sustainable revenue 
growth and profitability to Essentra.  
In particular, the team has a critical role  
to play in terms of business partnering,  
as well as capturing the financial 
consequences of our corporate strategy 
and, hence, in informing the decision-
making process – both in terms of 
medium-term planning and in-year 
budgeting.

STRATEGIC REPORT | CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW “While there is 
limited synergy 
between our 
businesses, we have 
clearly defined a  
role for “the Group” 
to add value across  
a number of  
enabling functions  
– from Corporate 
Governance,  
Finance and HR, to 
Operations, IT, HSE 
and Commercial.”
Across our diverse businesses our 
manufacturing capability is a common 
theme and – having first started producing 
filters in the UK in the late 1940s – we have 
extensive expertise, from plastic injection 
moulding and extrusion to specialist 
printing / conversion and filtration 
technologies. In harnessing this significant 
capability, the Group has an important 
role to play in leveraging investment, 
sharing best practice to move our facilities 
to world class levels, taking advantage  
of common purchasing opportunities  
and standardising key processes where 
relevant. Alongside Operations, there  
are also opportunities to deliver critical 
process improvements, skill upgrades  
and cultural change in our Strategy & 
Commercial function, particularly with  
regard to driving corporate strategy, 
facilitating and challenging the next stage 
of divisional strategies and overseeing  
M&A activity and consistent post-merger 
integration protocols. As both areas will 
greatly benefit from central leadership and 
support, we have accordingly created two 
important Group Management Committee 
(“GMC”) roles in Group Operations Director 
and Strategy & Commercial Director.
Further to our review, we have revised  
our key financial performance indicators 
to focus on all value drivers, from both  
a profit & loss and balance sheet 
perspective. In the case of the former, 
operating profit growth and margin are 
now prioritised, while in the case of the 
latter there is an emphasis on working 
capital (measured as average working 
capital per month as a percentage of 
revenue), Property, Plant & Equipment  
and gearing: this translates into an 
increased focus on returns, both return  
on capital employed (ie, how we are using 
our balance sheet) and return on total 
invested capital (including accumulated 
goodwill etc from acquisition spend). 
From a financial perspective, the output  
of our review is a clear – and significantly 
enhanced – focus on cash flow generation; 
indeed, notwithstanding the afore-
mentioned incremental £30m capital 
expenditure, our objective is to improve 
our conversion ratio over the medium 
term, in particular through driving 
sustainable improvement in net  
working capital.
This focus on cash generation is evidenced 
in well-defined financial and capital 
allocation policies: these include a  
leverage target of between 1 – 2x net  
debt to EBITDA and a stretching internal 
return threshold for capital expenditure 
programmes, as well as a disciplined 
financial approach to acquisitions and  
a recognition of the importance of the 
dividend to shareholders while driving 
stability and growth. In addition, we  
have revised our management incentives  
to ensure due alignment, such that 
cash-related performance measures  
now account for 30% of the annual cash 
bonus and 20 - 40% of the Long-Term 
Incentive Programme.
… and of the wider “Group”
While there is limited synergy between our 
nine businesses in terms of end-markets 
and customers served, nonetheless there 
are a number of key aspects where “the 
Group” can add value. Indeed, over and 
above the role of Finance outlined above 
– together with Human Resources and 
Health and Safety (of which more below) 
– there are a number of other areas where 
a unifying central resource can significantly 
enhance the sum of our constituent parts 
and we are already making progress.
Not least among these is Corporate 
Governance and, consistent with the 
Board’s ongoing commitment to 
promoting a strong culture of the highest 
standards of business ethics based on 
clear principles, we now have an externally 
benchmarked and supported route to 
upper quartile FTSE 250 performance by 
2020. Together with the cultural change 
initiated during the year – which has seen 
a more committed “tone from the top” 
and the revision of a number of protocols 
– we have initiated a number of process 
improvements, including re-setting our risk 
management approach to develop consistent 
and relevant performance indicators, filling 
certain gaps in business continuity 
management and contract processes and 
revising our internal audit approach to add 
value and help drive positive change.
IT is also an area where we can benefit 
from an integrated approach, global 
infrastructure and co-ordinated activities. 
Indeed, the previous absence of corporate 
strategy, consistent standards and 
post-acquisition systems integration has 
resulted in a proliferation of platforms and 
installations relative to our site footprint, 
while historic under-investment means 
certain software is coming to the end of 
vendor support and we lack the necessary 
skills and number of resource for the 
relatively complex environment we have. 
The IT team, led by our new CIO, Richard 
Cammish, and supported by selective 
external expertise, has much to do to 
upgrade our capabilities – as well as to 
direct the continued investment being 
made to address the growing risks which  
all companies face in the cyber security 
domain – but is energised for change  
and the task in hand.

STRATEGIC REPORT | CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW People
At all levels, our employees are a vital 
resource in the Company’s pursuit of 
operational excellence and the provision  
of quality products and services to our 
customers. And, as Chief Executive,  
my priority is to provide a working 
environment which enables talent to 
flourish and where people believe  
they have the opportunity for career 
development.
Having introduced assessment-based 
Leadership Development Centres (“LDC”) 
in 2014, a total of 171 colleagues across all 
geographical regions have now attended 
the two key development programmes 
globally. Essentra’s LDC is not a traditional 
training programme; rather, it is designed 
to assess skills against defined Company 
leadership competencies which will be 
critical to our organisational success going 
forward. Together with their manager,  
the employee takes responsibility for using 
the output from the LDC to create a 
personal development plan with support 
from our Human Resources team. By 
being nominated to the LDC, employees 
have already delivered success consistently 
in their current role and demonstrated the 
potential for future advancement. As a 
result, the programme is designed to help 
employees fulfil their respective potential.
The Essentra Graduate Programme 
enjoyed further success in 2017 . The 
two-year programme has provided a 
talent pipeline for a number of years and,  
in 2017 , 25 people joined the scheme, 
which continues to expand its 
international reach. The 2017 intake will 
join the 19 graduates recruited in 2016, and 
will have the opportunity to develop their 
management skills through bespoke 
training which takes place around 
Essentra’s sites, giving graduates exposure  
to the business while carrying out an 
operational job from day one. Separately, 
in October, the 2015 graduate intake – 
who, for the first time had the opportunity 
to undertake some of their training in Asia 
in Bangalore, India – completed their 
programme, with a number of successful 
presentations hosted in Milton Keynes. 
Representatives from senior management 
were invited to watch the graduate teams 
drawn from across functions and 
geographies present on topics focusing  
on “Millennial Employee Engagement  
at Essentra”, “Should Essentra Improve  
its Employer Brand?” and “Knowledge 
Sharing: a Proposal for Implementation  
in Essentra Components” .
Additionally, in April, we announced our 
first National Apprenticeship Progamme  
in the UK. The programme launched 
across our sites at Bradford, Kidlington, 
Kilmarnock, Newmarket, Newport, 
Nottingham and Portsmouth, providing 20 
young apprentices the opportunity to learn 
skills in the printing, setting and finishing 
industries. Comprised of a selection of 
vocationally-recognised qualifications,  
as well as technical, functional and soft  
skills modules, the programme will take  
36 months to complete and provide 
participants with a Level 3 apprenticeship. 
With the average age of employees at our 
manufacturing sites increasing, we believe 
that such an initiative is an excellent way  
of attracting new talent to our business – 
particularly in skilled operational roles – and 
to offer them a rewarding and varied career .
Since joining, I have had the pleasure of 
visiting all our manufacturing sites and 
speaking to thousands of my colleagues, 
and what has consistently struck me is  
the incredible team we have and the 
extent of their knowledge, skill, passion 
and dedication to Essentra. Nowhere is 
this more evident than at our sites in 
Puerto Rico, where hurricane Maria caused 
devastation beyond anything most of us 
can imagine. While our experienced local 
team was well prepared for the hurricane 
strike, nonetheless the response of our 345 
employees at Manati and Guaynabo in 
reporting for work at a time when many  
of them were facing significant personal 
challenges was truly humbling, and the Board, 
GMC and I would like to pay tribute to their 
outstanding commitment to our business.

should suffer injury or harm, and  
Essentra’s commitment to achieving  
and maintaining the highest standards  
of occupational health and safety extends  
to our employees, temporary workers, 
contractors, customers, suppliers, visitors 
and members of the public alike. Our 
commitment also extends to our supply 
chain and to organisations working on  
our behalf, and we actively encourage  
our suppliers to operate in a similarly 
responsible manner.
Although we are still some way from the 
levels of excellence to which the Board  
and GMC are committed – and which are 
espoused in our updated Group HSE policy 
– we made progress in improving the HSE 
culture across the Group in 2017 . Indeed, 
although the number of Lost Time 
Incidents only modestly decreased versus 
2016, we saw a close to 20% reduction in 
days lost as a result of these incidents, 
indicating that the severity of the cases 
reported has notably lessened. In addition, 
we significantly invested in our global HSE 
capability during the year, to add resource 
and capability and to help identify and 
drive further improvements in performance 
and culture. This included the recruitment 
of a new Group HSE Director who – with 
his Global Safety Team, and with my and 
the GMC’s unstinting support – will be 
responsible for ensuring that this critical 
area remains at the forefront of the 
Company’s agenda, will take steps to reduce 
the number of accidents and incidents  
(with a goal of zero), will share learnings of 
safety investigations to prevent recurrence, 
and will encourage and facilitate employee 
participation and feedback to contribute  
to the high standards we have set ourselves. 
We will also expect employees to participate 
fully in the improvement of standards  
– not least site managers and supervisors – 
to ensure that healthy and safe working 
conditions are maintained within their 
sphere of influence at all times. 
Further to the disbanding of the matrix 
structure in February 2017 , in October we 
made further organisational changes in 
light of our strategic review. In particular, 
having restored stability to our activities, 
we created a global Health & Personal 
Care Packaging organisation – Essentra 
Packaging – with leadership under a  
single functional team. This has brought 
together our previous Europe & Asia and 
Americas regional organisations – which 
had been separately managed since 
February 2017 – and will allow us to serve 
our global customers better and with 
greater alignment, and to leverage our 
scale in innovation, best practice transfer 
and talent development. As a result, it  
will allow us to pursue a clear strategic 
direction with common purpose and to 
provide customers with a consistent global 
value proposition. Leading Essentra 
Packaging with effect from October is Iain 
Percival, who joined Essentra as Managing 
Director of the Europe & Asia business  
in March 2017; supporting Iain will be  
a number of senior global roles, which  
we have already made good progress  
in recruiting.
Following a year of challenge and change  
in 2016, we have much still to do to 
improve motivation and morale in certain 
parts of the organisation. This includes the 
Company being exemplary in all aspects 
of diversity and inclusion, and we have 
recently established a Steering Group to 
implement the agenda in these critical 
areas which form part of the cornerstone 
of our six principles. Accordingly, there is  
a significant role for our Group Human 
Resources team, from monitoring and 
reviewing the action plans from 
engagement surveys and further 
enhancing and managing our Learning & 
Development programmes, to continuing 
to lead the recruitment process for talent  
to fill skill gaps and benefiting from the 
addition of dedicated resource to expand 
our employee communications. Together 
with my GMC colleagues, I am committed 
to ensuring that Essentra is a great place 
to work, and to driving the engagement  
of our people from the lower quartile level 
which I inherited to our objective of  
upper quartile.

STRATEGIC REPORT | CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW As part of the cornerstone of our six 
principles, it is imperative that we give 
health and safety in the workplace our  
full focus and commitment, and I expect 
every one of us to participate fully in 
delivering our strategic and policy 
objectives in this area.
Essentra is additionally committed to  
the highest standards of corporate 
governance and responsibility, to ensure 
that the way in which we manage our 
activities reflects the expectations of  
all the Company’s stakeholders. As a 
member of both the FTSE4Good Index  
and the Carbon Trust, we recognise that 
careful stewardship of the environment  
is a duty we owe to our neighbours and  
to future generations, as well as a critical 
component of the international reputation 
and quality of Essentra’s businesses. 
All our principal manufacturing facilities 
hold the ISO 14001 environmental 
accreditation and, with the exception  
of recently acquired sites, they have also 
achieved the Occupational Health & 
Safety Management Systems OHSAS 
18001. Many of our operations are 
additionally required to adhere to more 
stringent standards, notably those serving 
the automotive and health & personal care 
sectors. During the year, our Barcelona, 
Spain Components site was accredited  
to IATF 16949, an updated and improved 
certification which ensures the facility 
meets the rigorous processes required  
to sell components to the automotive 
industry. Separately, we received PS9000 
certification across all our Health & 
Personal Care Packaging sites in the US  
and Puerto Rico, making Essentra the  
first manufacturer of secondary packaging 
in the region to secure this accreditation, 
and underscoring our commitment to 
Good Manufacturing Practice and  
“best in class” quality assurance to our 
pharmaceutical customers.
As part of our afore-mentioned updated 
HSE policy, we also committed to 
continuously improving our environmental 
performance. This includes preventing 
pollution and minimising emissions, 
discharges and disposals; reducing waste; 
specific energy consumption; and, where 
possible, conserving and recycling 
resources such as water – particularly  
in areas of scarcity. In addition, we have 
committed to actively engage with 
stakeholders to explore the opportunities 
offered by new technologies to improve our 
production processes and operations. 
Summary
Our roadmap from Stability, through to 
Strategy and Growth will take two to three 
years and, given the scale of the task, we 
will need to prioritise our objectives and 
may need to evolve our thinking over time. 
However, the vast majority of what we 
need to do is in our own hands, and we  
are already well on our way to rebuilding 
the foundations from which we can restore 
sustainable growth in our fantastic 
Company. We underwent a great deal  
of change in 2017 – which I know can be 
both exciting and unsettling – and I would 
like to thank all our employees for their 
collective hard work and commitment in 
this respect as, together, we seek to build  
a better Essentra.
PAUL FORMAN
Chief Executive
2 March 2018
“Restoring Essentra 
to sustainable, 
profitable growth is 
not a rapid journey, 
and we clearly have a 
lot of work still to do. 
However, together  
we have made great 
progress and tangible 
improvement in 2017 , 
so we are already 
well on our way.”

STRATEGIC REPORT | CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW STRATEGY AND PROGRESS
Our aim is to make Essentra the best 
company it can be. To achieve this, 
everyone in the business needs to bring 
our six principles to life in their work 
and to follow the three steps to 
long-term success of Stability,  
Strategy and Growth.
How we will achieve it
“The map”
Our strategy provides a detailed roadmap 
of what each of our businesses will look 
like in three to five years, how we will  
get there, how we can be the best supplier 
we can to our customers and how we will 
protect our position. In delivering our 
strategic objectives, there is a well-defined 
role for the overall Group in driving  
value, not least with regard to corporate 
governance. 
Underpinning our strategy are clear and 
robust financial and capital allocation 
policies, with an overall focus on cash 
generation and quality of earnings  
being aligned to management incentives.
“The journey”
As we progress, it is imperative that  
we remain stable while delivering growth 
– particularly to the extent that growth 
entails acquiring other businesses.
We also need to ensure that we have  
the necessary skills in place to deliver  
our strategy, as well as the appropriate 
financial profile to support the future 
development of the Group.
“The preparation”
In order to restore – and maintain – 
sustainable growth to Essentra over the 
medium to long term, it is imperative that 
we have stable foundations upon which  
to build: in our people; our processes;  
our customers; and our finances.

Key Performance Indicators
The delivery of Essentra’s strategic 
priorities is underpinned by a focus  
on Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”)
which measure the Company’s progress 
in the delivery of value. Further to the 
strategic review which took place 
during the year, these metrics have 
been duly amended from the prior  
year period to reflect an additional 
emphasis on profitability, cash flow 
generation and return on capital.
In addition, the definition of Net Working 
Capital Ratio has been revised, to be  
the average monthly net working capital 
(measured over 12 months) – as opposed  
to the balance as at year end – as a 
percentage of revenue.
With the exception of adjusted earnings 
per share and dividend per share, these 
indicators have been used as principal 
elements in assessing the long-term 
performance of the operating businesses.

STRATEGIC REPORT | STRATEGY AND PROGRESS FINANCIAL REVIEW
Stefan Schellinger 
Group Finance Director
Trading performance
FY 2017 revenue increased 2.9% (decreased 
2.3% at constant exchange) to £1,027 .3m, 
with a like-for-like decline of 2.0%. While 
Component Solutions showed significant 
growth – driven by our Components and 
Pipe Protection Technologies businesses –
this was more than offset by a decline in 
Health & Personal Care Packaging, and  
a like-for-like decrease in Filter Products 
mainly as a result of the pass-through  
of reduced raw material costs in the  
form of lower pricing.
On an adjusted basis, operating profit  
was down 22.2% (-26.8% at constant 
exchange) at £84.6m. The 270bps 
reduction in the margin (-280bps at 
constant exchange) to 8.2% largely arose  
in Health & Personal Care Packaging, 
owing to the profit drop-through from 
lower revenue, a material loss at our 
Newport folding cartons facility and the 
costs associated with disruption to the 
sites in Puerto Rico further to hurricane 
Maria – as well as a less profitable revenue 
and segment mix in Tapes.
Including amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets of £22.9m and an 
exceptional pre-tax charge of £56.2m – 
mainly relating to costs associated with 
the closure of our folding cartons site in 
Newport, the strategic review of the 
Company and the simplification of the 
organisational structure (including the 
departure of certain senior management 
during the year) – operating profit as 
reported was £5.5m (FY 2016: operating 
loss of £50m).
Net finance expense
Net finance expense was lower at  
£10.4m (2016: £12.5m). The net interest 
charge on net debt decreased to £8.4m 
(2016: £11.6m), the amortisation of bank 
facility fees was slightly higher at £1.0m 
(2016: £0.7m) and there was an IAS 19 
pension net finance charge of £1.0m  
(2016: £0.2m).
Tax
The effective tax rate on underlying profit 
before exceptional items and tax was 
20.0% (2016: 20.0%).
Net income
On an adjusted basis, net income of £59 .2m 
was down 23.0% (-28.8% at constant 
exchange) and basic earnings per share 
declined by 24.4% (-30.1% at constant 
exchange) to 22.1p. Reflecting the post-tax 
profit and exceptional gain on sale relating 
to the Porous Technologies business which 
completed on 6 March 2017 , on a total 
reported basis, net income of £115.8m and 
earnings per share of 43.7p, compared to  
a net loss of £39 .6m and a loss per share of 
15.4p in FY 2016.
Dividends
The Board of Directors recommends  
a final dividend of 14.4p per share  
(2016: 14.4p), taking the FY 2017 dividend  
to 20.7p per share (unchanged versus  
FY 2016).
Net working capital
Net working capital is defined as 
“inventories plus trade and other receivables 
less trade and other payables, adjusted to 
exclude deferred consideration receivable / 
payable and interest accruals / capital 
payables.”
Net working capital of £124.4m was  
£11.6m lower than the 31 December 2016 
level of £136.0m, largely due to a reduction 
in accounts receivable. The average net 
working capital / revenue ratio decreased  
to 15.1% (2016: 16.3% at constant exchange) .
Cash flow
Adjusted operating cash flow was lower  
at £80.0m (2016: £101.8m). This included 
an inflow of net working capital for the 
year of £6.4m (2016: inflow of £2.8m)  
and gross capital expenditure of  
£47 .1m (2016: £46.7m), with net capital 
expenditure at £45.3m (2016: £37 .3m).  
Net capital expenditure equated to  
125% (2016: 120%) of the depreciation 
charge (including amortisation of non- 
acquired intangible assets) for the year  
of £36.3m (2016: £31.1m). Net interest  
paid was £12.5m (2016: £11.3m) and tax 
payments decreased by £5.9m to £11.2m  
(2016: £17 .1m). The inflow in respect of 
pension obligations was £0.1m (2016: £1.1m).
Adjusted free cash flow of £56.4m compared 
to £74.5m in FY 2016.

Net debt 
Net debt at the end of the period was 
£210.6m (31 December 2016: £379.3m), 
reflecting the proceeds from the sale of 
the Porous Technologies business and 
strong underlying cash flow generation.
The Company’s financial ratios remain 
robust. The ratio of net debt to EBITDA  
as at 31 December 2017 was 1.7x  
(31 December 2016: 2.3x) and interest 
cover was 9.0x (31 December 2016: 9.0x).
In November, the Group refinanced its 
existing bank revolving credit facility into  
a new £375m, five-year, multi-currency 
facility provided by a strong international 
banking group. In addition, we also 
successfully placed US$75m of loan  
notes spread over seven, 10 and 12-year 
maturities in the United States Private 
Placement market (“USPP notes”). 
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM

STRATEGIC REPORT | FINANCIAL REVIEW “In 2017 , we 
strengthened  
the balance sheet, 
generated a very 
good level of cash 
conversion and 
refinanced our entire 
debt facilities, helping 
to secure not only 
our current financial 
stability but also 
underpinning  
our medium to  
long-term position.”
This refinancing optimises Essentra’s 
financial position going forward, in terms 
of interest cost, sources of funding and 
maturities – as well as providing further 
headroom – thus underpinning the 
medium and long-term financial stability 
of the Company as we pursue our 
strategic objectives.
Balance sheet
As at the end of 2017 , the Company  
had shareholders’ funds attributable  
to Essentra equity holders of £612.3m  
(2016: £595.4m), an increase of 2.8%.  
Net debt was £210.6m (2016: £379.3m)  
and total capital employed in the  
business was £831.0m (2016: £982.0m).
This finances non-current assets of 
£868.1m (2016: £885.3m), of which £283.1m 
(2016: £285.9m) is tangible fixed assets,  
the remainder being intangible assets, 
deferred tax assets, retirement benefit 
assets and long-term receivables.
The Company has net working capital  
of £124.4m (2016: £136.0m), current 
provisions of £4.8m (2016: £1.2m) and 
long-term liabilities other than borrowings 
of £105.4m (2016: £105.4m). 
Pensions
As at 31 December 2017 , the Company’s 
IAS 19 net pension liability was £13.4m 
(2016: £23.4m).
The role of Finance in the  
strategic process
Over and above the afore-mentioned 
refinancing of our facilities, the Finance 
workstream was a critical aspect of the 
strategic review which we undertook.  
The key objective of this was to define the 
financial architecture and potential of the 
Group based on the status quo, a detailed 
benchmarking exercise of Essentra’s 
divisional performance versus its “peers” 
and an evaluation of the sustainable 
revenue growth and operating margin  
as a result of executing our key strategic 
initiatives. Further to this extensive 
exercise, we have a data-driven view of  
the financial consequences of our strategy 
and our financial potential, and are thus 
better positioned with regard to Group 
decision making – including capital 
allocation and portfolio management. 
Accordingly, we have not only been able  
to articulate an outlook for revenue 
growth and profitability for each of our 
larger three global divisions, we have also 
been able to formulate clear key performance 
indicators, and financial and capital 
allocation policies, to which management 
incentives will appropriately be aligned.
Treasury policies and controls
Essentra has a centralised treasury 
function to control external borrowing and 
manage exchange risk. Treasury policies 
are approved by the Board and cover the 
nature of the exposure to be hedged, the 
types of financial investments that may 
be employed and the criteria for investing 
and borrowing cash. The Company uses 
derivatives only to manage foreign currency 
and interest rate risk arising from underlying 
business activities. No transactions of a 
speculative nature are undertaken.
Treasury activities are subject to 
independent reviews by the Group 
Assurance department. Underlying policy 
assumptions and activities are reviewed  
by the Treasury Committee.
Controls over exposure changes and 
transaction authenticity are in place,  
and dealings are restricted to those  
banks with the relevant combination of 
geographical presence and suitable credit 
rating. Essentra monitors the credit ratings 
of its counterparties and credit exposure 
to each counterparty.
Foreign exchange risk
The majority of Essentra’s net assets  
are in currencies other than sterling.  
The Company’s normal policy is to limit 
the translation exposure and the resulting 
impact on shareholders’ funds by 
borrowing in those currencies in which  
the Company has significant net assets. 
As at 31 December 2017 , Essentra’s US 
dollar-denominated assets were 
approximately 36% hedged by its US 
dollar-denominated borrowings, and  
its euro-denominated assets were 
approximately 65% hedged by its 
euro-denominated borrowings.
The majority of Essentra’s transactions are 
carried out in the functional currencies of 
its operations, and so transaction exposure 
is limited. However, where they do occur, 
the Company’s policy is to hedge the 
exposures as soon as they are committed 
using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Impact of US tax legislation
Essentra notes the enactment of the  
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United  
States on 22 December 2017 , which has 
reduced the statutory rate of US Federal 
corporate income tax to 21% with effect 
from 1 January 2018. While the full 
implications of this new US tax legislation 
on the Company are still being reviewed, 
Essentra estimates that the Group’s 
effective tax rate for the year ending  
31 December 2018 will only be marginally 
impacted by the enactment of this  
new Act.

26 Who we are and what we do
The Components business is a global 
market-leading manufacturer and 
distributor of plastic injection moulded, 
vinyl dip moulded and metal items. 
Operating in 27 countries worldwide,  
11 manufacturing facilities and 24  
logistics centres serve more than 90,000 
customers with a rapid supply of low cost 
but essential products for a variety of 
applications in industries such as 
equipment manufacturing, automotive, 
fabrication, electronics and construction.
The Pipe Protection Technologies (“PPT”) 
business specialises in the manufacture  
of high-performance innovative products 
from commodity resins to engineering-
grade thermoplastics and polymer alloys 
for use in the oil & gas industry. Locations 
in four countries, combined with a wide 
distributor network, serve customers 
around the world. 
The Extrusion business is a leading custom 
profile extruder located in the Netherlands, 
which offers a complete design and 
production service. One of the first 
companies to extrude plastics in 1956, 
Essentra is now one of Europe’s most 
advanced suppliers of co-extrusion and 
tri-extrusion to all branches of industry.
The Card Solutions business is a provider  
of ID card printers, systems and 
accessories to direct and trade customers, 
providing a broad product offering and 
competitive value.
How we do it
The objective of our Components  
business is to leverage its extensive customer 
base, product range and distribution 
capability, using our efficient sourcing and 
manufacturing operations and integrated  
IT platform, to respond to the demands  
of our diverse customer base. Our tool 
library, product development skills and 
manufacturing experience, combined with 
our inventory and logistics infrastructure, 
are unique assets. We have sophisticated 
business-to-business, multi-channel 
marketing expertise, and support this with 
our knowledgeable sales resource and 
comprehensive product catalogues, which 
are available in many languages and online.
We target organic growth through 
increasing the range of products and 
effective marketing, cross selling to existing 
customers, expanding our customer base 
and entering new geographic markets.  
We also see opportunities to grow through 
acquisition, where it can move our business 
into complementary product categories or 
end-markets, or further our geographic 
distribution capability.
As a global leading supplier to the oil  
& gas sectors, our PPT business provides  
the broadest range of custom thread and 
pipe protection products for a complete 
range of Oil Country Tubular Goods 
(“OCTG”) tubulars, line pipe and drilling 
pipe applications. Our objective is to 
leverage our state-of-the-art manufacturing 
footprint headquarters in Houston, US,  
to meet global demand while ensuring 
adherence to the latest industry regulations.
Offering a full range of value-adding 
design and production services, Essentra 
Extrusion is well placed to provide 
purpose-developed products based on 
unique specifications. Our objective is to 
leverage our extensive in-house capabilities 
– including a laboratory, R&D department 
and tooling expertise – to partner with 
customers from the earliest stages of new 
product development and provide them 
with a compelling value proposition, no 
matter how complex the finished product.
The Card Solutions business has access  
to a wide portfolio of products and 
services, including printers, software and 
consumables from leading manufacturers. 
Our systems produce durable, high-quality, 
credit card-style photo ID cards, which  
are compatible with the majority of security 
systems, and which can be specified to 
incorporate magstripes, barcodes, 
contactless chips or smart cards.
How we performed in 2017
Financial performance 
Revenue increased 13.4% (8.0% at 
constant exchange) to £343.1m, driven  
by growth in Components and recovery  
in Pipe Protection Technologies. Excluding 
PPT, revenue increased 8.5% (3.4% at 
constant exchange).
The result in Components was broad-
based across geographic regions, with  
a continued strong performance in 
Continental Europe and Asia underpinned  
by a return to growth in the Americas  
and the UK, further to operational and 
commercial improvement initatives 
implemented in both markets. The 
increase in Europe was supported by 
further service improvements at our 
regional manufacturing hub in Kidlington, 
with better management of inventory 
levels helping to reduce overall net working 
capital. Trading in the Americas benefited 
from a more defined segmentation of  
the customer base and product offering 
– particularly in the Maintenance, Repair  
& Overhaul (“MRO”) segment further  
to the roll-out of 4,000 new mechanical 
components towards the end of the prior 
year – while growth in Asia was driven  
by electronics and general industrial 
mid-sized customers.

Our general protection range of caps and 
plugs increased, with our access hardware 
offering also continuing to perform well;  
in addition, components aimed at the 
consumer electronics segment delivered  
a strong result in Asia. Further to the 
successful development of tooling, there 
was an encouraging revenue contribution 
in custom injection moulding, particularly 
in the automotives sector in both Europe 
and the US. Towards the end of the year, 
we also relaunched our catalogue in 
Europe, featuring c. 1,000 new products 
including electromechanical switches  
and cable management and access 
hardware solutions.
In December, we announced the 
acquisition of Micro Plastics, a leading 
manufacturer and distributor of nylon 
fasteners and other plastic components 
for a wide range of industrial end-markets 
– including general industrial, automotive 
and white goods. Based in Arkansas, US, 
the transaction not only expands one of 
our core product ranges and adds to our 
manufacturing capacity in the US, but 
also – with a facility in Monterrey – 
provides an entry platform for our 
Components business in the attractive 
Mexican market.
Like-for-like revenue in PPT increased 
115.7% to £28.4m, notwithstanding 
temporary disruption to our Houston,  
US facility from Hurricane Harvey; this 
recovery (from a low base) was as a result 
of an uplift in the North American rig count, 
and the consequent impact on drilling 
activity and demand from the pipe mills, 
oil & gas service companies and pipe 
processors. Both our mid- and heavy-duty 
product ranges, including Tector Plus
®
  
and Titan
®
, performed particularly well  
as onshore drilling improved, although this 
was partially offset by the impact of lower 
investment in offshore explorations and 
production fields.
Revenue in Extrusion was moderately 
lower than the prior year. Continuing  
to benefit from its expertise in complex, 
technical profiles, the business saw further 
good growth for its plastic components 
used in the purification of drinking and 
processed water in both industrial and 
municipal installations, as well as in the 
construction industry for swimming pool 
covers; however, this was offset by a softer 
performance in extruded finishing parts 
used in the furniture sector.
Adjusted operating profit increased 7 .9% 
(3.9% at constant exchange) to £58.7m, 
equating to a 90bps decline in the margin 
to 17 .1% (-70bps at constant exchange): 
excluding PPT, adjusted operating profit 
declined 1.4% (-5.2% at constant 
exchange) to £56.1m, with a 180bps 
(-160bps at constant exchange) decrease  
in the margin to 17 .8%. Further operating 
efficiency savings, together with a return  
to profitability in PPT, were offset by 
measured investment in Components  
to rebuild capability, together with a 
significant increase in raw material costs  
in early 2017 and a lower margin product  
mix in Extrusion. 
Operational developments 
During the year, we undertook a number 
of operational initiatives across the division.
In Components, we further rationalised 
our footprint with the transfer of our  
seals activities from Ipoh, Malaysia to  
our facility at Rayong, Thailand, which  
is accredited to the stringent level of 
quality demanded by the automotive 
industry. As a result of this consolidation  
of our operational capabilities and resources, 
we will build scale in south east Asia, as 
well as helping our customers to simplify 
their own supply chains as all our seals 
products are now available to ship from  
a single location. In Turkey, we extended 
into a second facility, to accommodate 
the expansion of both our metal hardware 
and mainline plastics components offering, 
while new injection moulding equipment 
with reduced set-up time was installed at 
both Kidlington and our Americas regional 
manufacturing hub in Erie, US.

STRATEGIC REPORT | OPERATIONAL REVIEW | COMPONENT SOLUTIONS Following the previous addition of robotics 
and automated parts handling systems 
to our presses at Houston, we further 
invested in our PPT manufacturing 
platform at this flagship site in additional 
automation and laboratory capabilities. 
There was also significant investment  
in three large tonnage injection moulding 
machines in Veracruz, Mexico, which  
has improved both our capacity and  
our abilities.

Components
Market trends 
Given their very wide application, the  
global market for industrial components  
is large, fragmented and ill-defined for  
both suppliers and customers. However, 
management estimates the value of  
the Bill of Materials “small components” 
market at c. £8bn, with growth in line  
with Industrial Production.
Manufacturing GDP growth rate
With low-cost direct material components 
being used in a very broad spectrum of 
industrial end-markets, those countries 
with a higher manufacturing GDP growth 
rate are particularly attractive.
Increased use of standard components 
There is an increasing move to small, 
specialised manufacturing businesses, 
which assemble their parts and equipment 
from a range of standard components. 
This approach provides them with 
flexibility, and the ability to move quickly 
to provide their own customers with the 
service they require.
Just-in-time delivery 
As customers are required to deliver  
their own products “just-in-time”, so their 
demand for critical components from their 
suppliers is increasingly on the same basis.
Increasing labour costs 
Standardised manufacturing processes  
and components typically require less 
labour, thereby helping customers reduce 
their cost base. There is also a trend 
among larger customers to design in 
“higher technology” markets such as the 
US, UK, Germany, Japan and Singapore, 
and then to manufacture in lower labour 
cost regions (eg, eastern Europe, China 
and India), which benefits components 
suppliers with global reach. 
Industry specification 
As end-markets become more 
sophisticated and demanding, so the 
requirement for higher-quality components 
increases. Over and above this more 
general trend, certain customers are 
increasingly facing regulatory guidelines  
in terms of the specification of the 
components they use.
Weight reduction
Increasing focus on fuel efficiency in the 
automotives industry is resulting in weight 
reduction targets and a trend of replacing 
metal components with plastic. 
Growing functionality 
Increased product sophistication, 
particularly in the automotives and white 
goods sectors, is resulting in growing 
demand for cable management solutions. 
Key new product opportunities 
 > Continue range expansion, to provide 
customers with the broadest selection  
of components
 > Develop new sectors for existing 
customer base, such as hardware 
 > Globalise successful local products 
through established supply chain 
 > Enter new and adjacent product 
markets, such as medical devices  
and aerospace 
 > Launch products which are compliant 
with new industry standards

STRATEGIC REPORT | OPERATIONAL REVIEW | COMPONENT SOLUTIONS Extrusion
Market trends
Management estimates the global 
addressable market for extruded plastic 
products at around €400m, increasing 
broadly in line with GDP . The underlying 
growth rates and key trends vary 
depending on the end-market served and 
the respective solution being provided.
Increased demand for fully-engineered 
and rapid solutions 
Customers are increasingly seeking more 
sophisticated and bespoke solutions to 
their needs, which typically require more 
value-added equipment and a more 
technically-educated workforce. In addition, 
with solutions required ever more rapidly, 
the ability to provide prototype tooling  
(for example, through the use of 3D 
printing), as well as to integrate the design 
and manufacturing process, is becoming 
more important.
Practicality and reliability 
In many end-markets, particularly in 
construction and furniture, the use of 
plastic is increasingly displacing more 
traditional materials (such as wood and 
metal) in a wide variety of applications – 
from finishing to protection, and for 
interiors and exteriors alike.
Regulatory requirements  
and sustainability 
As regulation evolves and sustainability 
concerns increase, so there is a growing 
demand for products which use more 
environmentally-friendly, non-PVC raw 
materials.
Consumer behaviour 
The continued increase in online shopping 
is reducing traditional retail shelf space, 
while a growing cruise ship market is 
driving demand for waste water solutions. 
Cost 
Continued customer focus on profitability 
and competition from low cost economies 
benefits suppliers with a broad product 
offering across price points and the ability 
to invest in more efficient equipment and 
manufacturing processes. 
Key new product opportunities
 > Continue to invest in high value-added 
tooling and design capabilities, to meet 
demand for technical and efficient 
high-end profile solutions and reduce 
lead times 
 > Actively outsource tools where 
appropriate, to provide greater capacity

and creativity, and is well placed to meet 
the exacting needs of an international 
customer base. 
Essentra is also globally recognised as  
the leading manufacturer and supplier  
of pressure-sensitive tear tapes – as well  
as a provider of other solutions such as 
bags, sacks and commercial print – which 
are largely used in the tobacco, food &

How we performed in 2017
Financial performance 
Revenue decreased 4.8% (-9.0% at 
constant exchange) to £409 .5m. Excluding 
the divestment of the Bristol consumer 
packaging facility on 5 June 2017 , 
like-for-like revenue reduced 8.5%.
As expected, the performance in health 
 & personal care continued to deteriorate, 
largely owing to legacy operational issues 
at certain integration sites in the UK and 
US which had a disproportionate impact 
on the result. Specifically, the structural 
and operational challenges at our folding 
cartons facility (“IP5”) in Newport were 
such that a proposal to cease production 
was confirmed, and the facility was  
closed at the end of the year. Indeed, 
notwithstanding the significant improvement 
efforts of the site management team  
and employees, IP5 generated a FY 2017 
adjusted
1
 operating loss of £4.5m on 
revenue of £12.2m, and was not anticipated 
to make a realistic improvement to 
profitability in the near, or even long, term.

In the autumn, hurricane activity impacted 
our sites in Largo, US and – more severely 
– at Guaynabo and Manati in Puerto Rico. 
While all our employees were fortunately 
safely accounted for and the facilities were 
left fundamentally intact, our Puerto Rico 
operations were significantly affected by 
the infrastructure and supply chain issues 
which ensued and a reduced level of demand 
from customers, who themselves faced 
similar post-hurricane Maria challenges. 
Although normal output levels were fully 
restored by the end of the year , management 
estimates the FY 2017 revenue and adjusted 
operating profit impact of hurricane 
activity (ie, including Largo) at £2.5 – 3.0m 
and £1.5 – 2.0m respectively, net of any 
recovery from insurance. However, beyond 
the afore-mentioned issues, the focus and 
remedial action of the senior management 
team on the integration challenges of the 
prior year led to a reduction in the rate of 
revenue decline in FY 2017 when compared 
to H2 2016, and key service and quality 
metrics improved progressively during the 
year in both the US and Europe. These 
demonstrable and consistent improvements 
have been noted by customers, and have 
facilitated a significantly enhanced dialogue 
about how we can collaborate to help  
them meet a range of needs and business 
objectives.
This enhanced customer sentiment was 
reinforced by encouraging new business 
wins during 2017 , as well as certain 
multi-year, multi-product global framework 
agreements with international blue chip 
healthcare companies which were renewed 
towards the end of the year. In addition, our 
range of “freshness” labels – which can be 
tailored to meet specific requirements, and 
help to keep a product as fresh as possible 
for as long as possible – continued to 
perform well, with growth underpinned by 
further demand from an existing customer.
The result in Tapes reflected gains in the 
appliance sector for speciality tapes and  
in the food segment for tear tapes, being 
offset respectively by softness in point  
of purchase and continued weakness  
in tobacco.

STRATEGIC REPORT | OPERATIONAL REVIEW | HEALTH & PERSONAL CARE PACKAGING While the focus in 2017 was on stabilising 
the division and restoring a platform from 
which to grow, nonetheless we continued 
to develop our product pipeline to ensure 
that customers are well-positioned to 
meet such industry trends as patient 
adherence and evolving legislative 
requirements regarding the tracking, 
tracing and authenticating of products 
through the supply chain. Accordingly,  
we further commercialised our serialised 
carton and label offering, as well as our 
large format literature and range of 
fibre-tear, void-release and frangible labels 
which allow consumers to easily identify if 
packaging has been interfered with.
Following its establishment in 2016, we 
leveraged the capabilities of our Design 
Hub service in providing customers with 
value-added solutions – from offering a 
fast turnaround of digital samples and 
mock-ups to delivering stand-out 
packaging which helps them to 
differentiate their products on-shelf. In 
particular, through combining structural 
and creative packaging design with the 
technical expertise of our product 
development teams, we were pleased to 
work with an international pharmaceutical 
customer in the successful redesign of 
their range of folding cartons.
Customers also responded positively to our 
intention to focus on specialist secondary 
packaging for the health & personal care 
sectors, as stated in our strategic review. 
Reinforcing our commitment to these 
end-markets, in October we created  
a global divisional organisation with 
leadership under a single functional  
team, which will allow us to serve our 
multi-national customers better and with 
greater alignment, and to leverage our 
scale in innovation, best practice transfer 
and talent development. As a result, we 
will be even better positioned to pursue  
a clear strategic direction with common 
purpose, and to provide our customers 
with a consistent global value proposition.
Indicative of our strategic focus on the 
health & personal care sectors, during the 
year we divested our consumer packaging 
site in Bristol which manufactured printed 
paper bags and associated packaging 
solutions for the bakery and food service 
sectors. In addition, the closure of our  
IP5 site – given its significant weighting 
towards folding cartons for the consumer 
goods industry – will not only remove 
significant financial and operational 
challenges, but will also further focus  
our manufacturing footprint on those 
end-markets where we can add greatest 
value with our specialist secondary 
packaging solutions.
Adjusted operating profit decreased 79.1% 
(-80.2% at constant exchange) to £7 .2m, 
equating to a margin of 1.8%. The 620bps 
decline in the margin (-630bps at constant 
exchange) was due to the volume gearing 
effect of revenue decline, the afore-
mentioned ongoing losses at the IP5 site and 
disruption in Puerto Rico, together with a less 
profitable revenue and segment mix in Tapes.
Operational developments
In 2017 , there was substantial investment  
to rebuild operational capability across the 
division, both to help unblock production 
“bottlenecks” and to support growth 
opportunities. New gluing lines were  
installed at our cartons sites in Charlotte,  
US and Barcelona, Spain, with an upgraded 
press at Moorestown, US allowing more 
rapid changeover times and superior colour 
management and vision control. Large 
format folding equipment for literature 
production was also added in Greensboro 
and Indianapolis, US, Manati, Puerto Rico 
and Wolfen, Germany, while enhanced 
digital capability at Glasnevin, Ireland helped 
the facility to secure new cartons business 
with a clinical trials customer for 2018. In 
addition, the introduction of standardised 
colour management technology at site level 
helped to underpin the improvements in 
quality metrics made during the year and 
represent a substantial upgrade to our 
capability in this respect. Indeed, the 
significant focus on operational efficiency  
in general during the year resulted in the 
establishment of a wide range of process 
competencies – from quality and Sales & 
Operations Planning to procurement and 
waste reduction – has helped to stabilise 
the division and to provide solid foundations 
from which to build in the future.
Notwithstanding this investment, our 
strategy review identified the need for 
incremental capital expenditure of £20m  
over three years, to improve the division’s 
capabilities and to support our future growth 
agenda. This upgrade programme to more 
modern equipment should not only continue 
to improve our productivity, service and 
quality, but also help us to drive profitability 
back towards an industry average level over 
the medium term – consistent with our 
strategic objective.

STRATEGIC REPORT | OPERATIONAL REVIEW | HEALTH & PERSONAL CARE PACKAGING economies is being partially mitigated  
by rapid growth in the paper & board 
segment for online shopping use.
Legislation
Increasing regulatory requirements,  
such as the European Falsified Medicines 
Directive, are driving demand for 
tamper-evident packaging, while the more 
standardised pack requirements of the  
EU Tobacco Products Directive potentially 
limit the scope for innovative solutions.
Brand and identity protection and 
verification 
Brand owners have a continued need to 
protect their assets from counterfeiters, 
and to reassure consumers that the 
product they are purchasing is genuine 
and has not been interfered with. 
Increasing consumer communication 
Packaging is increasingly used to 
communicate brand messages, and to 
engage with consumers via promotions  
or competitions. 
Provision of total solutions 
Customers are increasingly seeking a 
partner which can deliver a complete 
offering – from design to end-supply  
– as well as individual products capable  
of providing multiple pack features. 
There is also a clear pattern of “one stop 
shopping” by health & personal care 
customers, benefiting suppliers with a 
breadth of product offering. 
Customer risk management
As customers globalise their own activities, 
they are seeking strategic multi-continental 
partners who can grow with them and 
hence reduce their supply chain risk.
Key account management
As global customers seek to simplify  
their respective supply chains, they are 
increasingly seeking suppliers who  
can meet their requirements across 
multiple jurisdictions.
Emerging segments and technologies
As the pharmaceutical and health & 
personal care sectors continue to evolve, 
so new segments emerge – eg, biopharma, 
cosmaceuticals – with specific packaging 
requirements.
Functionality and convenience 
There is a growing demand for packaging 
which not only offers optimum product 
protection, but is also easy for consumers 
to access without frustration. 
Sustainability and waste reduction 
There is an increasing need for packaging 
to be resealable so as to maintain 
freshness and reduce waste, as well as to 
have a lower environmental impact.
Industry specification
As the industrial and retail sectors 
continue to evolve, there is a growing 
interest in replacing traditional fastening 
solutions with high quality, efficient, 
lighter-weight alternatives.
Key new product opportunities 
 > Investment in technology, to develop 
novel, value-added packaging and brand 
protection solutions, in particular to 
meet legislative and regulatory changes 
 > Investment in equipment and digital 
capability, to meet the growing demand 
for smaller batch manufacturing
 > Creative and secure design solutions to 
provide enhanced communication and 
authentication opportunities 
 > Functional packaging benefits, such as 
opening, closing and tamper-evidence 
 > Eco-friendly packaging solutions,  
such as closing and resealing
 > Replacement of traditional fastening 
solutions (eg, nails, screws) with 
adhesive tapes in industrial and retail 
applications

Who we are and what we do
Our Filter Products business is the only 
global independent supplier of filters.  
Not only do we manufacture standard 
filters, but as the leading supplier of 
special filters we also provide innovative 
solutions that meet the consumer-driven 
demands of the tobacco industry against  
a backdrop of ongoing legislative changes. 
In addition, our offering extends into 
nicotine delivery devices, where we  
have a number of fully-functional and 
packaged e-cigarette products as well  
as solutions for the Heat Not Burn 
segment, which draw upon the broad 
range of technologies which the 
Essentra Group can deliver.
We also increasingly provide adjacent 
services to the tobacco industry. Our 
Scientific Services facility located in the  
UK was one of the first independent, 
externally accredited laboratories for  
the testing of cigarettes, cigarette filters, 
smokeless devices including e-cigarettes 
and low ignition propensity (“LIP”) for 
cigarette papers, and has over 20 years’ 
experience of providing analytical services 
to state monopolies, and both independent 
and multi-national customers. Additionally, 
we offer a full bespoke range for the design, 
packing and packaging of filters of 
roll-your-own brands, providing an efficient 
and cost-effective solution to delivering 
retail-ready products to the market.
We supply over 500 product specifications 
to c. 250 customers, including all the 
multi-national tobacco companies. We  
have seven manufacturing facilities in  
seven countries, supported by a dedicated 
research facility and three regional 
development centres.

How we do it
Innovation is at the heart of our Filter 
Products business, and our objective is  
to develop value-creating partnerships 
with our customers. We seek to leverage 
our long-standing experience, expertise 
and insight to provide brand differentiation 
and identity solutions, as well as excellence 
in both manufacturing and service.  
Our recognised ability to provide new 
value-added products and services is key 
to the future growth of our business, as 
market dynamics in the tobacco industry 
continue to evolve.
Research in filters is carried out at a 
dedicated Technology Centre, supported 
by three regional development facilities. 
Together, they work closely with customers 
to understand their specific needs, and 
strive to deliver innovative solutions which 
will give their brands differentiation and 
relevance, at a pace appropriate to local 
market conditions and legislative 
requirements. Our offering is further 
enhanced by our ability to complement 
our customers’ own strengths and assets 
in a variety of tolling, or outsourced 
management, relationship arrangements, 
as well as our growing adjacent services 
activities.
We continuously upgrade our technology 
and footprint, to ensure we exceed our 
customers’ expectations and remain at 
the forefront of market trends. Our flexible 
manufacturing capability allows us to 
respond rapidly to market changes and 
customer demand for surge volumes, 
while a consistent focus on high standards 
of quality, cost control and production 
efficiency act as further sources of 
competitive advantage.
How we performed in 2017
Financial performance
Revenue increased 3.1% (-3.4% at constant 
exchange) to £277 .5m. Underlying volumes 
were modestly below FY 2016 and pricing 
declined owing to the pass-through of lower 
raw material costs; however, this was offset 
by the positive mix effect of a strong result 
in capsules and growth in flavoured filters, 
particularly in the second half of the year. 
While the nature of outsourcing in the 
tobacco industry implies a certain degree 
of volatility in our pipeline, nonetheless the 
acknowledged capabilities of our business 
– in terms of delivering value-added filters 
which meet the evolving requirements of 
our customers – continued to be successfully 
commercialised during the year. Joint 
development initiatives with multi-
national customers for higher value 
capsule products were particularly successful,  
as well as innovative variants of our 
Combined Performance Superior™ filter, 
which combine a high level of visual 
differentiation with enhanced efficiency. 
Following a weaker performance in FY 2016 
owing to softer underlying market conditions, 
our business in China rebounded strongly, 
supported by recent Superslim and shaped 
filter launches to meet the growing consumer 
trend for smaller diameter and increasingly 
complex formats. Overall, therefore, we 
maintained our track record of supporting 
customers in the development of bespoke 
solutions tailored to their specific needs as 
they seek to respond to global market trends.
In FY 2017 , our Scientific Services laboratory 
continued to leverage its extensive 
experience and expanded portfolio  
of accredited testing methods for both 
traditional tobacco and non-tobacco 
products, to ensure the delivery of 
high-quality analysis which remains  
at the forefront of industry trends and 
evolving regulatory requirements.

STRATEGIC REPORT | OPERATIONAL REVIEW | FILTER PRODUCTS Beyond traditional tobacco products, we 
continued to develop our NGP capabilities 
during the year. While these remained  
a very modest contributor to divisional 
revenue in FY 2017 , nonetheless we have 
product offerings in both e-cigarettes 
(which are located at our Greensboro,  
US site) as well as Heat Not Burn (where 
we are already a provider of filters to one 
of the multi-nationals), and we believe 
that we are well-positioned to support  
our customers as these nascent segments 
continue to rapidly evolve. 
Adjusted operating profit decreased  
7 .2% (-12.6% at constant exchange) to 
£34.8m, and the margin declined by 
140bps (-140bps at constant exchange)  
to 12.5%. Further efficiency improvements 
and productivity gains were offset by  
the impact of modestly lower volume,  
and a timing effect relating to the pass- 
through of acetate tow material costs in 
the first half of the year.
Operational developments
In order to ensure that we maintain  
a flexible and competitive global 
manufacturing base, we benefited  
from a number of operational initiatives  
in FY 2017 .
The previously-communicated transfer  
of a certain line of business to Asia from 
the US was successfully completed,  
further to which our Greensboro site was 
“right-sized” not only to maintain its 
capability in traditional tobacco filters but 
also to become the production hub for our 
e-cigarette offering. In addition, following 
the transfer of our European activity from 
Jarrow, UK in 2016, quality and service 
metrics significantly improved in Hungary, 
with a new development centre also  
being established to serve customers  
in the region.
Continuing to respond to customer 
requirements, additional capacity for 
capsule filters was added in Indonesia, 
Thailand and Dubai, to ensure that we 
remain at the forefront of these innovative 
segments in the growth markets of Asia 
and the Middle East, with additional 
technical and development capability  
also being extended in the region.

STRATEGIC REPORT | OPERATIONAL REVIEW | FILTER PRODUCTS Market trends
The global tobacco market is valued at  
c. US$750bn, with a c. 2% cigarette retail 
volume decline.
Regulation
The tobacco industry is heavily regulated 
around the world on health grounds, with 
significant restrictions on the way in which 
products can be marketed to consumers. 
Legislation continues to evolve, both in 
respect of traditional cigarettes and 
innovations such as e-cigarettes and Heat 
Not Burn devices, as well as surrounding 
the testing and packaging requirements 
for these products.
Illicit trade
Counterfeiting of tobacco products is a 
significant and increasing challenge for 
the industry, undermining brand value, 
presenting a risk to consumers from 
low-quality goods and reducing tax 
revenues. The illicit trade accounts for 
approximately 10% of duty-paid cigarette 
volumes and is estimated to be growing.
“Beyond tobacco” products
The market for products beyond 
traditional cigarettes continues to evolve 
rapidly. There is increased interest in other 
nicotine delivery mechanisms – such as 
Heat Not Burn and e-cigarettes, both of 
which are reportedly delivering rapid 
growth (albeit from a low base) and which 
are forecast to continue doing so.
East versus west
Accounting for approximately 70% of  
total world cigarette volume, the growth 
markets of Asia dominate the global 
tobacco industry and are forecast to  
be flat while western regions continue  
to decline.
Consumer engagement
As per capita income rises – particularly in 
eastern markets – so lifestyles change and 
new segments are created, with different 
consumer expectations and aspirations 
from the products which they purchase.  
As such, there is an increasing demand  
for new products to reflect these changes.
Consumer need
Consumers are increasingly concerned 
with environmental matters, such as 
sustainability and pollution, and the 
impact of products which they purchase. 
Such needs are often unspoken but create 
challenges for the industry to supply 
products which address such 
considerations.
Cost and price
As the price of cigarettes has continued  
to increase, growth opportunities have 
been created for other industry segments 
including roll-your-own and Other Tobacco 
Products, such as chewing tobacco.
Key new product opportunities 
 > Lifestyle solutions (eg, Slims / Superslims, 
low / ultra-low tar, “eco” ranges)
 > Brand-specific requirements, such as 
recessed filters
 > Enhanced user experience, such  
as capsules, flavoured thread and 
activated carbon
 > Full bespoke service for roll-your-own 
brands
 > Provision of scientific services
 > Adjacent sectors, such as Heat Not  
Burn products and e-cigarettes

STRATEGIC REPORT | OPERATIONAL REVIEW | FILTER PRODUCTS Risk management approach
2017 was a year of strategic review  
for Essentra, but it was also a year 
when restoring stability to the business 
was fundamental to securing the 
opportunities to exploit future growth 
prospects. The Principal Risk section  
of the 2016 Annual Report included 
commentary on the failure of the 
Company to manage risks relating  
to the Packaging division during 2016, 
which led to a decline in overall financial 
performance. The 2016 Annual Report 
also highlighted that the Company  
had recognised the need to undertake 
a review of its existing risk management 
structure and processes in order to deliver 
improvements in the identification, 
assessment and mitigation of risk.
In addition to the strategic objectives for 
the respective businesses, the Chief 
Executive has set the objective for the 
Company to continue to improve its overall 
governance, to ensure alignment with FTSE 
250 top quartile best practice by 2020 and 
to underpin the successful delivery of 
strategic growth and business performance. 
During 2017 , the Company has developed 
a well-defined governance improvement 
plan, facilitated in part in conjunction with 
specialist external professional review and 
expertise. The Governance Improvement 
Programme includes a number of specific 
initiatives designed to deliver more effective 
governance, driven by the adoption of risk 
management (enterprise risk and business 
continuity) internal audit, and compliance 
programmes in line with best practice. 
Recommendations from an external 
review of risk management processes are 
being addressed to deliver improvements 
in the identification, assessment and 
mitigation of risk, and a refreshed risk 
appetite statement is being implemented. 
The Chief Executive is sponsoring these 
improvements which are being led by the 
Company Secretary & General Counsel. 
The changes are being implemented with 
the full endorsement of the Board, and  
the Company is increasing its internal 
resources as part of a new Legal, Risk  
& Governance team to support the 
delivery of the Governance Improvement 
Programme. The Board and the Audit 
Committee receive regular reports on the 
progress of the Governance Improvement 
Programme, and are fully engaged with 
and committed to its successful delivery. 
The Group Management Committee 
(“GMC”) has, following the completion of 
the strategic review, undertaken a number 
of formal risk identification, prioritisation 
and mitigation workshops in 2017 . In addition, 
the Board has also conducted a fundamental 
review and discussion of the outputs from 
the work undertaken by the GMC. 
The senior leadership teams of the 
Packaging, Components and Filters 
divisions, and certain enabling functions 
have also undertaken detailed risk 
management discussions in the context  
of the implementation of the outputs  
from the strategy review. Risk mitigation 
activities are being incorporated into 
strategy implementation plans, and 
regular risk discussions will be part of 
leadership meetings of all the divisions  
and enabling functions to embed risk 
management into business as usual activities. 
In order to further strengthen the 
leadership, oversight and governance of 
risk management, the annual cycle of 
Board agenda activities has been updated 
to facilitate additional risk reviews, while 
the Audit Committee focuses on ensuring 
that the new risk management processes 
are being effectively embedded across the 
businesses. In addition, a new Group  
Risk Committee (“GRC”) chaired by the  
Chief Executive has been constituted. The 
first meetings of the new GRC took place 
in January and February 2018, and further 
meetings will take place on at least a 
quarterly basis. The Board will receive 
regular reporting from the Chief Executive 
in his capacity as GRC Chairman to enable 
the Board to challenge and review the 
GRC’s views on the Principal Risks and 
emerging risks, as an important part of 
fulfilling its responsibilities to determine 
the nature and extent of the risks the 
Company is willing to take in meeting 
its new strategic objectives. The Chairman  
of the Board and the Audit Committee 
Chairman receive copies of the minutes of 
each meeting. The Audit Committee will 
engage directly with individual enabling 
functions and divisional businesses, 
including deep dive reviews, as part of 
fulfilling its oversight responsibilities on  
the risk management processes.
The Principal Risks set out below reflect 
the key risks and uncertainties facing the 
business following the updates to the 
strategy and the structure of the Essentra 
Group. As a result, the Principal Risks  
are a combination of new and previously 
disclosed risks. The updated risk 
management practices have facilitated  
a better articulation of the nature and 
characteristics of the major risks and an 
enhanced focus on effective mitigation. 
The development of key risk indicators 
during 2018 will further enable the 
consistent, diligent and effective 
monitoring and management of the  
risks impacting the Company.
The diagram over represents the 
Company’s risk management framework 
under the refreshed structure, along  
with the phases of implementation.
The Company has considered the risks  
it is facing under the following four risk 
category headings and has identified  
13 Principal Risks.
1. Strategic – Internal risks that may 
impede achievement of strategic goals.
2. External – Risks relating to the 
macroeconomic climate, political events, 
competitive pressures or regulatory issues.
3. Operational – Risks that could impact 
day-to-day operations and prevent 
business as usual activities.
4. Disruptive – Risks that could impact 
the business model or viability of the 
Company. Although key disruptive  
risks have been identified and mitigated  
by the Company, none of them are 
considered to be Principal Risks currently.

Overall responsibility for assessing the Group’s Principal Risks, 
setting risk appetite and monitoring risk management.
Chaired by the Chief Executive and compiled of Group Management 
Committee members, the GRC is responsible for monitoring principal 
and key group risks and ensuring the eﬀectiveness of divisional and 
functional risk management.
Each Divisional Board is 
responsible for ensuring their 
divisional risks are captured and 
are being eﬀectively mitigated 
within business as usual 
processes. Risk management is 
a standing agenda item for 
Divisional Board meetings.
Speciﬁc business units or sites 
within each division will 
implement their own risk 
registers, risk and action 
owners. Management will be 
responsible for managing local 
level risk and reporting to the 
respective Divisional Board.
Enabling Functions will be 
responsible for identifying and 
mitigating risks within their 
own functions – applicable to 
Finance, IT, Human Resources 
and Legal & Compliance.
Responsible for 
reviewing the 
eﬀectiveness 
of the Group’s 
risk management 
systems and 
processes.
The Principal Risks detailed over are  
graded for likelihood and impact on  
a gross basis (ie, without accounting for 
existing mitigation), and are not presented 
in any priority. The Board believes that the 
Principal Risks are specific to Essentra and 
reflect the risk profile of the Company at 
the current time.
The continued evolution and embedding 
of improved risk management activities, 
cascading down from the Board through 
the respective divisions and enabling 
functions, will further align risk management 
with the delivery of strategic objectives in 
line with the defined risk appetite.
The Board has reassessed the risk appetite 
in the context of the newly defined strategy 
for the Company and will keep this under 
ongoing review.
In addition to the Principal Risk, other  
key or emerging risks have been identified 
and are being monitored by the Company. 
The materiality of those other key or 
emerging risks as a whole is not sufficient 
for them to be considered as a Principal 
Risk, but the development of mitigation 
actions in response to such risks will form 
an important part of the divisional and 
functional risk reporting to the GRC  
and Board.

Categorisation:  
Company Specific
The Packing division failed to perform  
as expected in 2016. A number of strategic 
initiatives have been undertaken to address 
this in 2017; however, there remains  
a risk that such initiatives fail to address 
performance issues and allow the division 
to provide an acceptable return. This includes 
winning profitable new business, realising 
expected cost savings or initiatives taking 
longer or costing more than anticipated.
Although a Principal Risk relating to the 
decline of the Packaging division was 
reported in 2016, this risk is considered to be 
a new risk where the division has stabilised, 
and therefore risk focus is now on ensuring 
the steps that have been taken are 
effective and allow the division to provide 
an acceptable return. 
The Packaging division has been a key area of focus 
for the Company in 2017 and a number of changes 
have been made to address performance, including:
 > Creation of a new globally managed Packaging 
division, replacing the previous Americas and 
Europe & Asia regional structure and other 
organisational complexity
 > New leadership including divisional Managing 
Director and other senior appointments.  
The Chief Executive has also focused significantly  
on the Packaging division in 2017 and will continue  
to do so in 2018 
 > A new Packaging division strategy has been 
developed, communicated and rolled out.  
This includes initiatives such as the closure  
of the Newport cartons production facility,  
the carve-out of the Tapes business into the  
new Specialist Components division, equipment 
upgrades, improving operational stability and

Filters division MD 
Categorisation:  
Company Specific
The business of the Filters division relates to 
the supply of filter products and packaging 
solutions to manufacturers in the tobacco 
industry. Changes in the traditional tobacco 
market have strategic ramifications for 
Essentra, presenting both potential risks 
and future opportunities. While the 
Company has a strong market position  
in its key existing addressable segments, 
the future growth opportunities for the 
Company and its financial performance 
may be affected by market dynamics 
within the industry and the structural shift 
away from traditional tobacco products 
into Next Generation Products and overall 
declining market growth. Essentra’s 
competitive position cannot be sustained 
unless it manages and adapts its operational 
capacity and innovation capabilities in line 
with key market trends, including global 
consumption shift from western to eastern 
markets, customers’ self-manufacture  
and demand volatility, increasing commercial 
pressures, special filters and New-
Generation Product developments and 
evolving legislation. 
Tobacco-related litigation could also 
adversely affect Essentra, although there  
is no history of the Company being involved 
in such a claim.
Essentra is seeking to mitigate the risk associated 
with changes in the tobacco market dynamics, and 
the overall decline in market growth for traditional 
tobacco products, by focusing on activities with 
longer-term viability and exploiting potential  
growth opportunities emerging from the latest 
market trends. 
 > Increased segmentation and prioritisation  
based on customer categorisation and filter

Ownership:  
Group Operations Director 
Categorisation:  
Company Specific
The Group’s success is dependent on  
its ability to provide its customers with 
quality customer service and on time and  
in full product delivery. The customer base 
is diverse, ranging from an individual  
who may order low cost parts from our 
Components business to multi-national 
blue chip companies that rely on products 
from our Packaging and Filters divisions.  
If the Group is unable to deliver excellence 
consistently and meet all expectations, 
then it is likely to lose business and profit  
to competitors. 
This is a newly identified Principal Risk. 
While it has high importance across the 
Company, it is fundamental that this risk  
is managed within the Packaging division 
which will be reliant on rebuilding customer 
goodwill lost in 2016 and 2017 .
 > Improvements in operational performance have 
been a key focus of the business in 2017 . As well as 
safety metrics, quality and delivery performance 
metrics are tracked and discussed on a daily basis 
at site level, as well as on a weekly and monthly 
basis (within divisions) and on a monthly basis at 
the GMC, in order to identify: a) issues that require 
intervention; and b) ongoing opportunities for 
improvement. The Board also receives a quarterly 
report on operational metrics.
 > In 2017 , all divisions recorded improvements in  
OTIF (delivery performance) and reductions in 
both the number of quality complaints received 
and the incident rate for quality complaints  
(ie, number of complaints per number of  
orders / production volume).
 > The improved performance has enhanced  
the satisfaction of key customers.

Categorisation:  
Industry General
The Group operates internationally and 
with a diverse supplier and customer base. 
As a consequence it is required to comply 
with multiple areas of regulation and good 
practice for areas such as Anti-Trust, 
Anti-Bribery, Sanctions and General Data 
Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) (from May 
2018). Such compliance and good practice 
is resource intensive and processes and controls 
must reach 8,000 plus employees in 30+ 
countries, some of which are higher risk 
territories. Failure to comply with regulation 
could result in significant fines, costs and 
reputational damage to the Group. 
The level of the risk has remained the  
same as there have been no material 
changes in levels of regulation from a 
Company perspective, albeit that the  
GDPR deadline is imminent.
The Group uses a range of controls to manage 
regulatory risk including: 
 > A “tone from the top” from the Board and GMC 
on the importance of ethics and compliance 
 > New internal resource and investment to drive 
better governance practices
 > Group compliance policies and guidance materials
 > Communication and training platforms and 
programmes 
 > A Right to Speak process, in which the  
Chief Executive, Company Secretary & General 
Counsel and Group Human Resources Director  
are key stakeholders
 > A third party risk management process and platform

The Group manufactures multiple products, 
such as filters, pharmaceutical packaging, 
plastic components and oil & gas pipe 
protection products that are subject to 
product regulation. The Group must 
therefore constantly monitor and comply 
with such product regulations, as a breach 
could have a significant financial and 
reputational impact. 
The level of the risk has remained the same as 
there have been no material changes in levels 
of regulation or business operations to affect 
this from the Company’s perspective, although 
the use of certain materials such as plastics 
may lead to some additional reputational risk.
The Group uses a range of controls to manage 
regulatory risk relating to the products that it 
manufactures and distributes, including:
 > A “tone from the top” from the Board and GMC 
on the importance of ethics, compliance and 
strong governance
 > New internal resource and investment to drive

Ownership:  
Chief Information Officer 
Categorisation:  
Industry General
The Company is dependent on it’s IT systems 
for day-to-day operations. Should the Group 
become affected by a general global cyber 
incident or be specifically targeted by a 
criminal network, this could potentially lead 
to suspension of some operations, regulatory 
breaches and fines, reputational damage, 
loss of customer and employee information 
and loss of customer confidence. 
Although there are no indicators to suggest 
that the risk of a cyber attack on the 
Company is higher, the risk has generally 
increased given the higher volume of global 
cyber incidents in 2017 . 
The Company employs multiple layers of cyber 
security threat defences from endpoint protection, 
encryption of data, identity-based access control, 
network firewalls, web and email content protection 
to ongoing vulnerability and penetration testing 
across critical corporate and online services.
As part of the technology transformation 
programme, the cyber security project is enhancing 
capability across people, process and technology  
to ensure Essentra is in-step with the increased risk 
associated with cyber attack.

Categorisation:  
Industry General
Brexit could impact the Company in  
a number of ways, for example:
 > A material element of the operations  
of the Components division involves 
manufacturing products in the UK and 
distributing them into the EU. Should 
trade tariffs and / or a customs border  
be imposed this could lead to increased  
costs and complexity within the division’s 
existing business model. 
 > The Company has multiple manufacturing 
sites in the UK. Should trade tariffs or a 
customs border be imposed, this could 
restrict the supply chain opportunities 
available to these sites. 
 > Depending on the outcome of 
negotiations, Brexit could increase  
the cost of, or restrict funding for,  
the Group’s current and future 
investment plans. 
Brexit has previously been identified  
as a key but not Principal Risk to the 
Company. As UK / EU negotiations 
continue, the Company has determined 
that it should now be managed, mitigated 
and monitored as a Principal Risk. 
During 2017 and the early part of 2018, the Company 
conducted a thorough review of Brexit risks, 
including understanding Essentra’s exposure.  
This included consultation with external experts  
and used third party support.
Coming out of this review, a range of potential 
mitigation options were identified, which the 
Company is now in the process of reviewing.  
These include:
 > Potential changes to the European asset and 
manufacturing footprint to optimise material flows
 > Optimisation of product manufacturing locations 
versus customer locations
 > Seeking alternative raw material supply sources  
to minimise cross-border flows
 > Seeking “Approved Economic Operator” status  
to minimise inspection delays

Operational Resilience 
– Natural Catastrophes  
and Fire
Likelihood: Low  
Impact: High  
Change in risk level: Same  
Ownership:  
Group Operations Director 
Categorisation:  
Industry General
The Group has some single manufacturing 
site dependencies for the production of 
specific products and meeting particular 
customer requirements. All of these sites 
are subject to fire risk and some of them, 
are in locations that are more prone to 
natural catastrophes such as hurricanes, 
floods, storms or earthquakes. The Group 
experienced both employee impact  
and operational disruption as a result of 
such events in 2017 at sites in Puerto Rico 
and Houston, US. Should further events 
occur, this could impact production 
capability and fixed assets, supply chain 
management, customer relationships, 
reputation, revenue and profit. 
Such events will continue to be a threat  
to the normal operation of the Company, 
and consequently the level of the risk 
remains the same.
The Group has reviewed and refreshed its business 
continuity planning processes in 2017 , working closely 
with external parties. Enhanced processes are being 
adopted across the business, and are targeted at 
higher risk sites and processes and ensuring that 
robust continuity plans and site improvements are  
in place. Aligned to this, there is increased focus  
on IT infrastructure. Such plans are to be kept under 
constant review and tested periodically. Other 
mitigating factors that the Group has in place are:
 > Operating within a flexible global infrastructure
 > Developing multi-site capabilities and 
manufacturing flexibility
 > Installing fire and other risk prevention systems 
 > Assessing and managing operational risks via  
the enterprise risk management process 
 > Maintaining a comprehensive insurance programme
Product Quality,  
Liability and 
Contamination
Likelihood: Medium

Change in risk level: New  
Ownership:  
Group Operations Director 
Categorisation:  
Industry General
The Company manufactures a range  
of products for a wide range of customers, 
some of which provide significant 
proportion of Group and / or divisional 
revenues. Should the Company fail to 
provide adequate quality consistently  
in its products, there is a risk of loss of 
customers and / or failure to win profitable 
new business. 
Similarly, there is a risk that some 
manufactured products that reach 
consumers, such as filters, labels or 
component parts could become 
contaminated or cause an accident for 
which the Company is liable. Should this 
occur, this could lead to significant fines 
and / or reputational damage. 
Product Quality, Liability & Contamination 
has been elevated to a Principal Risk to  
the Company, and incorporates any 
potential tobacco-related or Next 
Generation Products litigation.
In addition to the ongoing tracking of quality metrics 
mentioned above, the Group is also undertaking  
a review of its quality management processes  
to ensure they are fit-for-purpose, to minimise the  
risk of contamination or product quality issues.  
This review includes support from external experts  
in some cases, along with alignment of quality 
processes and standards across geographies and 
within divisions, to ensure a single consistent global 
process for customers in multiple jurisdictions.
Divisional capital expenditure plans also include, 
where appropriate, additional spend on inspection 
equipment (eg sensors, cameras) to improve in-line 
inspection and further reduce the likelihood of 
product quality issues.
The Company continues to assess potential 
exposures to litigation arising from tobacco-related 
or Next Generation Products, and seeks to manage 
the supply, packaging and labelling of such products 
accordingly.

Impact: Medium 
Change in risk level: New  
Ownership:  
Divisions and  
Enabling Functions 
Categorisation:  
Company Specific
A number of the issues that have previously 
impacted the Company were due to 
weaknesses in internal business processes 
and controls. Examples of this include 
inadequate acquisition integration, failure 
to document or to update operational 
processes or define business process 
ownership, poor planning and project 
execution and lack of effective training  
and development. The Company has 
acknowledged and begun to review these 
weaknesses in 2017 , and they will remain  
a risk while they are being addressed.
Internal Business Processes have been 
identified as a new Principal Risk to  
the Company.
The scope, key questions to be addressed and 
outcomes of the strategy review were set out in 
detail in the 2017 strategic review. The outputs from 
strategy work streams are being implemented 
across all four divisions with the support of the 
Enabling Functions. The activities will result in the 
implementation of clear business strategies 
supported by better internal business processes  
and improved risk mitigation, through consistent 
adherence to business processes and cultural 
change. Development of the Company’s IT 
capabilities will support the improvement in Internal 
Business Processes. The benefits of these changes 
and the investments being made, including the 
addition of new internal resources, are expected  
to support stabilisation and growth of the Company  
in 2018.
Safety  
(including Regulatory)
Likelihood: Low

Change in risk level: New  
Ownership:  
Chief Executive 
Categorisation:  
Industry General
Safety is of the highest priority for the 
Company. Essentra has 49 manufacturing 
facilities across the world, along with many 
non-manufacturing sites and internationally 
mobile employees. Manufacturing can be 
inherently risky given the use of industrial 
machinery and high speed manufacturing 
processes. In addition, the Company must 
comply with the requirements of multiple 
jurisdictions concerning safety regulation. 
Should an injury or fatality affect any of  
our employees or visitors, or should there  
be any breach of safety regulation resulting  
in prosecution, we could anticipate 
considerable reputational damage as well 
as potentially significant financial costs.
Following the risk reviews during 2017 , the 
Company has reaffirmed its commitment 
to treat Safety as an absolute priority and 
this is reflected through its elevation to one 
of the Principal Risks to the Company.
Throughout 2017 , the “tone from the top” on  
safety has been reinforced throughout Essentra. 
Management teams have been instructed to give  
a higher priority to establishing and reinforcing the 
management systems employed throughout the 
Company, and key Health, Safety and Environment 
senior appointments have been made, including  
a new Group HSE Director reporting to the  
Chief Executive.
During 2017 , a programme was developed  
which will ensure that every Company site has  
a comprehensive and robust approach to the 
identification, prioritisation and remediation of  
risks and hazards. Delivery of this programme will 
continue through 2018 and is supported by central 
resources who provide training, support and 
expertise. The scope of this programme has now 
been broadened to encompass all Essentra sites 
during 2018.

Point of Failure
Likelihood: Medium

Change in risk level: New  
Ownership:  
Group Operations Director 
Categorisation:  
Company Specific
The Company’s supply chain is reliant on 
raw materials and goods being delivered in 
full and on time to its manufacturing sites 
from various international sources and 
suppliers. In some cases, the Company is 
reliant on a limited number of suppliers or a 
single supplier for a key raw material. In the 
case of supplier failure, significant input cost 
increases or transportation / infrastructure 
disruption, could have a material impact  
on the profitability of the Company.
Similarly, the Company is reliant on certain 
sites and their equipment in some cases to 
manufacture specific products. Should such 
machinery not be able to operate for an 
extended period of time this could also 
have a material profit impact.
Supply Chain Single Point of Failure has 
been identified as a new Principal Risk to 
the Company, and the risk incorporates 
Raw Material Supply which was previously 
identified as a Principal Risk.
The Company increased focus in this area in 2017 , 
including working on business continuity planning 
with external parties, as noted above. This focus  
will continue in 2018.
A comprehensive supply chain assessment will  
be completed in 2018, which will focus on
 > Identification of investment requirements 
including additional IT capabilities
 > Identification of alternative sources of supply for 
key raw materials, where necessary and feasible
 > Ensuring comprehensive maintenance plans are  
in place for key manufacturing equipment, and / 
or alternative manufacturing routes are identified
 > Identifying alternative logistics routings, where 
necessary and feasible
The implementation of the Company’s new business 
continuity planning process will continue in 2018, 
ensuring any specific areas of concern are properly 
mitigated.
IT Systems –  
Stability & Reliability
Likelihood: High  
Impact: Medium  
Change in risk level: Same  
Ownership:  
Chief Information Officer 
Categorisation:  
Company Specific
The Company is dependent on a wide 
range of IT systems for its day-to-day 
operations. In some cases, mainly due to  
a lack of historic investment, IT systems are 
relatively old, have not been updated and 
may lack both external and internal 
support. This can lead to IT systems being 
unreliable or having poor functionality to 
support everyday operations which creates 
risk of material impact to customers and 
employees, ultimately impacting 
profitability and reputation. 
The level of risk is considered to be the  
same as reported in 2016, albeit a number 
of initiatives will be completed in 2018  
which are anticipated to reduce the  
risk over time.
The Company began an investment programme  
in Q4 2017 to upgrade and reconfigure the internal 
infrastructure across all divisions and key sites. The 
focus has been to reduce, and ultimately eliminate, 
the number of unplanned outages caused by 
systems failure and avoid any disruption to business 
operations. Core networks and data communications 
are being upgraded and scaled to accommodate 
the forecasted increase in data flows. This includes 
internal data flows in our core supply chain and 
finance systems and external flows to the internet,  
to streamline our digital interactions with customers 
and cloud-based services. 
A three-year IT strategy is being developed to 
address the current challenges and the proposed 
investment to support the necessary improvements, 
and will be subject to detailed review during H1 2018.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
At Essentra, we are committed to doing business 
the right way to continually earn the trust of our 
customers, our other stakeholders and the wider 
marketplace. As we follow the three steps to 
long-term success of Stability, Strategy and 
Growth, our six principles should direct each of  
us in how we behave at all times in the workplace.
Responsible business practice must be at the heart  
of what we do, and we recognise the significance  
and importance of being a responsible corporate 
citizen wherever we carry out business. In pursuing  
our corporate strategy, our objective is to adopt 
business practices that are economically, socially  
and environmentally sustainable, and to promote 
these to our stakeholders in order to strengthen 
relationships, share knowledge and encourage  
best practice. 
Accordingly, we aim to identify and prioritise those 
corporate responsibility issues which are material to  
our business and to our stakeholders – whether specific 
to a particular country or location, or applicable globally 
– and to respond to them in an appropriate and robust
manner. In so doing, our risk management processes
consider the potential impact of corporate responsibility 
issues on Essentra’s performance; our investment
decisions include due evaluation of the potential
consequences for our stakeholders and the environment;
and our policies promote fair and ethical dealings
as a matter of law and conscience.
Essentra’s Ethics Code helps to ensure that everyone 
working for or on behalf of the Company understands 
our expectations and conducts Essentra business in a 
way that is consistent with our six principles and our 
procedures. Each of us is expected to understand and 
embrace the principles of our Ethics Code and: act 
responsibly, honestly and with integrity; show respect, 
and treat others fairly and with dignity; conduct our 
activities based on the highest ethical standards; and 
ensure our business practices comply with all legal or 
regulatory requirements. Reinforcing this commitment 
to best practice governance – and to ensure alignment 
with our six principles – we revised our Ethics Code and 
Right to Speak protocols during the year, with extensive 
employee training undertaken across the organisation.
Essentra’s six principles, which describe the way  
we work, can be found on the Company’s website

Health and safety (“HSE”)
Our overriding commitment in the 
workplace continues to be the health, 
safety and welfare of our employees and 
all those who visit Essentra’s operations,  
as well as those who carry out work on our 
behalf. The Board provides health and 
safety leadership and the Chief Executive 
has primary responsibility for setting the 
principal health and safety objectives 
within which the detailed policies operate, 
and for reviewing progress against those 
objectives. As per our Health & Safety 
policy, we aim to continually reduce the 
number of accidents and incidents, with  
a goal of zero.
In light of our commitment to achieving 
and maintaining the highest standards  
of occupational health and safety,  
and to ensure that HSE remains at the 
forefront of our thinking – as led by our 
Chief Executive, Paul Forman – during  
the year we launched an Essentra-wide 
Assurance Programme (“EAP”), to ensure 
that the foundations are in place to 
sustainably improve safety. This initiative 
will ensure that: every task has a risk 
assessment and standard work document / 
safe operating procedure; all employees 
have access to our incident and near-miss 
reporting programme; and appropriate 
training and competency standards will 
progressively be implemented across all sites.
We continue to use an in-house self-
assessment programme to monitor  
the maturity of local site-based HSE 
management arrangements. 
Underpinning this increased focus was  
a significant investment in Essentra’s HSE 
capability during 2017 , which has resulted 
in additional resources in each of our 
businesses – including newly-appointed 
Group and divisional Health, Safety & 
Environment Directors – to help identify 
and further drive improvements in 
performance and culture.
Although the number of Lost Time 
Incidents was only slightly reduced versus 
2016, the number of days lost as a result  
of these incidents showed a marked 
decline (from 1,834 to 1,490) – suggesting 
that severity of injury declined during the 
year – and with a Lost Time Incident 
Frequency Rate (per 200,000 hours 
worked) of 1.004, this places Essentra as 
“average” for manufacturing companies.

STRATEGIC REPORT | CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY In 2017 , we also standardised our incident 
reporting and investigation guidance,  
to ensure a clear process flow across the 
organisation – from injured / reporting 
person and first aider through immediate 
supervisor to site / production Manager 
and facility HSE lead. In addition, we 
undertook a number of specific HSE 
improvement projects – from machine 
guarding to “hand safe” programmes – 
with a focus on the most frequently 
observed types of incident.
We manage occupational health by 
identifying key risk activities, undertaking 
health assessments and, where appropriate, 
implementing health surveillance 
programmes. We continue to drive  
the Occupational Health & Safety 
Management Systems (“OHSAS”) 18001 
standard into our manufacturing sites 
and, at the end of 2017 , 48% of our 
principal manufacturing facilities had 
achieved accreditation. 
Details of Essentra’s health and safety 
policy and accident performance data  
can be viewed on the Company’s website

Employees 
We are committed to ensuring that Essentra 
is a great place to work and to growing our 
business through positive teamwork. We 
recognise that an engaged and motivated 
workforce is key to the delivery of excellence 
in everything we do and, in return for the 
dedication and expertise of our employees, 
providing them with a safe, respectful and 
diverse working environment in which talent 
can flourish is the foundation of the six 
principles which were developed and rolled 
out during the year – and is Paul Forman’s 
stated priority as Chief Executive.
Accordingly, our objective is to drive 
employee engagement to upper quartile 
levels and – as a critical enabler of that 
improvement – to enhance communication 
and feedback across the organisation. 
Following a challenging year in 2016 – which 
had seen a clear deterioration in motivation 
and morale – in 2017 we undertook two 
engagement surveys, with an excellent 89% 
response rate to the more comprehensive 
annual survey. While we have seen an 
improvement in many areas, nonetheless 
the overall engagement score is still below 
the norm for a company of our size and 
stature, and we are committed to 
responding to the findings and to taking 
action to tackle the issues raised through 
local focus groups and established  
action plans.
We are equally focused on providing a 
respectful and diverse working environment, 
as we believe that this ensures we attract and 
retain the best talent from the widest pool; 
creating a diverse and inclusive culture also 
has a proven positive impact on employee 
engagement and business performance. We 
do not tolerate harassment in any form and 
are committed to equal opportunities at 
work; employees should not engage in or 
support discrimination based on race, colour , 
language, caste, national or ethnic origin, 
indigenous status, sexual orientation, religion, 
disability, gender, marital status, union 
membership, political affiliation or age. 
However, one of the key findings from  
our latest engagement survey is that not 
enough employees believe that diverse 
perspectives are valued at Essentra, and  
we have recently established a Diversity  
& Inclusion Steering Group to address  
these concerns to ensure that we make 
meaningful and consistent improvement 
towards our objective of being exemplary  
in this regard.
The gender of Essentra’s employees as  
at 31 December 2017 was:
Male Female
Non-Executive Directors 4 2
Executive Directors 2 0
Senior Managers 77 13
All employees 5,451 2,832
Our guiding principle is to provide all 
employees with the opportunity to  
develop and advance – subject to personal 
performance and business objectives – and 
to remunerate fairly with respect to skills, 
performance, competitors and local market 
conditions. This includes giving full and fair 
consideration to employment applications 
by disabled people. In the event of 
employees becoming disabled, we make 
every effort to ensure that the training, 
career development and promotion 
opportunities available are as far as possible 
identical to those of non-disabled employees.
Our employees are vital in ensuring that 
we provide quality products and services 
to our customers and operate our business 
activities effectively and efficiently, Indeed, 
their talent and commitment drive the 
innovation which allows Essentra to 
provide added value to our customers, 
enhance supply chain logistics with our 
suppliers and reduce the environmental 
impact of operations. 
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM

STRATEGIC REPORT | CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY Nowhere was this more evident during the 
year than at our two Health & Personal Care 
Packaging sites at Guaynabo and Manati  
in Puerto Rico following the devastating 
impact of hurricane Maria, who continued 
to report for work and provide excellent 
support to our customers despite facing 
significant personal challenges. Our 
employees in the US were also instrumental 
in providing support to their Puerto Rican 
colleagues, both in terms of helping to 
co-ordinate the relief supplies which we 
shipped directly to the facilities, as well as 
assisting with the manufacture of customer 
orders where they exceeded local capacity 
at the time. Over and above our immediate 
relief effort, however, it was clear that there 
was a longer-term impact to address – that 
of damage to homes, cars and belongings.  
For this reason, we set up a fund – The 
Essentra 2017 Hurricane Relief Fund –  
to provide our employees with financial 
assistance in rebuilding their lives, so that 
those people who were impacted are able  
to apply for an amount of money to support 
them. The fund is being managed by a 
team who will review each application on 
a case by case basis, to ensure that the 
money reaches those of our colleagues  
who need it.
In order to deliver our strategic objectives – 
both now and in the future – we need to be 
able to attract, retain and motivate 
employees with the necessary skills and 
talent across the Company. Over and above 
driving excellence in health and safety, our 
Group Human Resources (“HR”) team is 
responsible for overseeing and co-ordinating 
the key strategic aspects of recruitment, 
training and development, to ensure that  
we have a consistent approach across the 
Company. In order to continually improve 
our talent pool at all levels of the 
organisation, we run a number of very 
successful training initiatives – from our 
Leadership Development Centres to our 
Graduate Development Programme – which 
continue to expand their international  
reach: we also offer a number of different 
apprenticeship opportunities across our 
Components and Packaging sites in the UK. 
Our Group team is supported by a regional 
and local network of HR colleagues, who 
have an understanding of the local culture 
and accepted practices in the countries  
in which we operate, and help to ensure 
that we have the necessary structures in 
place to enable best practice people 
management at all our locations.
We operate in 33 countries, and we  
comply fully with all appropriate legislation  
in these jurisdictions. Throughout our 
international operations we support 
human rights – as set down by the United 
National Declaration and its applicable 
International Labour Organisation 
conventions – through our employment 
policies, our supply chain and the 
responsible provision of our products  
and services. This commitment includes  
a mandatory requirement on all our sites  
to avoid the employment of children, as  
well as a commitment to the prevention  
of slavery and human trafficking: this is  
set out in our Modern Slavery Statement 
which can be viewed on the Company’s 
website www.essentraplc.com. Our 
operations based in India, Indonesia  
and Thailand are additionally accredited  
to SA 8000 which details fundamental 
principles of human rights. 
Community
We are proud of our international footprint 
and of being part of the communities in 
which we operate, and it is important to us 
that we play a key role in local society – not 
least because that is where our employees 
come from.
Our commitment to being a responsible 
corporate citizen extends to support for 
appropriate non-political and non-sectarian 
projects across a range of organisations and 
charities. Regardless of regional or national 
boundaries, we aim to support the creation 
of prosperous, educated, sustainable and 
healthy communities in the countries and 
localities in which we operate. In attempting 
to bring benefits back to those communities 
whose support provides a basis for our 
success, we have focused on education and 
enterprise, health and welfare and the 
environment, with support driven at a local, 
rather than a corporate level. Our approach 
is to support and enhance employee efforts 
in their respective communities through 
applying Essentra’s resources, and there are 
many local programmes across the 
Company which involve significant employee 
engagement through direct involvement or 
secondment. We are looking to further 
enhance such relationships with local 
people, business partners and community 
groups, not only to meet our wider corporate 
responsibility objectives but also to improve 
local relationships and build employee  
pride in the communities where they  
live and work.
Marketplace
Our business reputation, together with the 
trust and confidence of the people we do 
business with, is one of our most valuable 
assets. The Essentra Ethics Code applies  
to all our businesses around the world,  
and to everyone who represents, or acts  
on behalf of, the Company and helps 
them to understand their role in upholding 
our principles, procedures and policies.  
Whether on our own behalf, or through  
our relationships with third parties, we are 
committed to free and fair competition,  
plus the prohibition of bribery and political 
donations, as well as to honest and fair 
dealings with suppliers, customers and 
local and national authorities. In particular, 
we seek to confirm that our suppliers 
protect the welfare of their own workers 
and employment conditions, to ensure 
that overall working environments within 
the Essentra supply chain meet or exceed 
internationally recognised standards.
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM

STRATEGIC REPORT | CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY Ethics and compliance
Everyone in the Essentra team shares  
the responsibility for developing and 
maintaining a working environment that 
we can be proud of. The cornerstones of 
this are founded on everyone acting with 
openness, honesty and integrity, treating 
others with respect and being accountable 
for doing what they say they will, and 
speaking up if they feel this is not happening.
Essentra’s Ethics Code is our framework  
to assist in making ethical decisions, and is 
supported by further policies and guidance 
notes. These governance materials are 
approved by the Board and distributed 
globally in all relevant languages, and are 
intended to promote the positive, diverse 
culture and safe and respectful working 
environment which is espoused by our six 
principles. None of these documents can 
address every issue that an Essentra 
employee may face in the performance  
of their duties: however, together with 
common sense, logic and good faith 
behaviour, our Ethics Code provides a 
structure to guide each of us in determining 
the correct course of action. While 
Essentra’s Company Secretarial department 
is accountable for promoting, monitoring 
and enforcing our Ethics Code, responsibility 
for following the Ethics Code and for 
upholding Essentra’s overall integrity and 
reputation – both globally and locally – 
rests with each employee individually. 
Consistent with our commitment to 
operating with integrity and to dealing 
fairly with all our stakeholders at all times, 
Essentra adopts a zero tolerance approach 
to bribery and corruption through our  
Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption (“ABC”) 
policies. This extends to all business 
dealings and transactions in which the 
Company is involved, and includes prohibiting 
political donations, offering or receiving 
inappropriate gifts and making facilitation 
payments: we also expect the same 
standards to apply to any third parties 
providing services on our behalf. All 
employees are required to read our policies 
relating to Conflicts of Interest and Gifts  
& Entertainments, which are reviewed  
on an annual basis and where their 
compliance is recorded either digitally  
or manually. 
Given the number of jurisdictions in which 
we do business, Essentra has adopted a 
Third Party Due Diligence policy. The 
objective of this policy is to ensure that 
appropriate risk-based reviews are 
undertaken and the Company is protected 
from unmitigated risk, with a clear and 
legitimate business reason for every 
third-party relationship. The expectations 
and guidance detailed in this policy are 
supplementary to our existing know your 
customer, procurement or other third-
party engagement processes which we 
have in place, including financial controls 
and quality management requirements.
We are all required to review and confirm 
our acceptance of critical Group policies, 
with the majority of employees being 
required to review and accept all of the 
Group’s policies. These additional Group 
policies and guidance are intended to 
cover the operational and commercial risks 
identified within the divisions on a range of 
material issues – including environmental 
sustainability, modern slavery, human 
rights, and anti-bribery and anti-corruption 
– and we require those relevant colleagues 
to read and certify their compliance with 
these policies, either digitally or manually.
Our Essentra Compliance and Ethics 
programme delivers the appropriate 
training required by legislation and 
regulation, with a focus on communicating 
major compliance events. For example, 
this includes requiring employees to inform 
their line managers of any change in 
circumstances – such as any conflict  
of interest or outside business interest  
– a significant deterioration in the health 
and safety of their working environment  
or their ability to protect Essentra’s assets. 
Employees’ understanding of these policies 
is supported by an e-Learning training 
programme and, where applicable, we 
hold classroom-style training sessions,  
with all divisions being required to identify 
what are the most prevalent risks to their 
respective activities – taking into 
consideration the markets into which  
they do business. 
In all cases, acceptance of our policies  
is reviewed by the Group Assurance team 
as part of their normal internal audit 
processes, with the activity metrics of  
the Compliance and Ethics programme 
also being conveyed – as required – to the  
Audit Committee. Accordingly, the Audit 
Committee is able to address any specific 
risk areas within the organisation, further 
to which Group Assurance then conducts 
appropriate follow-up audits after any 
confirmed compliance incidents. 
 
Our Right to Speak policy and process is  
in place to enable any employee to report 
any circumstances where they genuinely 
and reasonably believe that the standards 
of the Ethics Code, or the Company’s 
wider policies and guidance notes, are  
not being upheld. We are committed to 
ensuring that employees feel able to raise 
any such concerns openly in good faith, 
without fear of victimisation or retaliation 
and with the support of the Company. 
Employees can access the Ethics Reporting 
Line via essentra.ethicspoint.com to report 
any concerns on a confidential basis,  
or use the confidential individual helpline 
telephone numbers which are displayed  
at each business location. 
As part of our Governance Improvement 
Program implemented during 2017 ,  
a new Compliance Strategy has been 
developed and 2018 will see further 
initiatives, with improvements in compliance 
and ethics risk assessment processes to 
better identify and mitigate. The testing  
of the effectiveness of our existing controls 
will continue along with the continued 
evolution of KPIs to support these initiatives, 
and to include metrics on training, culture, 
effectiveness and investigations.

STRATEGIC REPORT | CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY Environment
Consistent with our increased focus on  
all aspects of HSE – and our objective of 
continual improvement – our approach to 
managing environmental impacts during 
the year focused on:
 > Implementing and maintaining 
environmental and energy 
management systems certified by 
accredited bodies to ISO 14001 and ISO 
50001 standard, in all in-scope facilities
 > Measuring and monitoring energy and 
water consumption, and any associated 
emissions to air and water, and setting 
targets to improve performance 
 > Conducting environmental impact 
assessments and developing site 
management plans
 > Providing training to employees on ways 
to reduce their environmental impact
 > Engaging with customers and suppliers 
to identify opportunities to reduce 
environmental footprint across the 
supply chain
 > Providing facilities to segregate and 
reuse or recycle production waste
In the UK, our sites comply with the 
Carbon Reduction Commitment (“CRC”) 
legislation and we continue to apply  
the principles of the CRC to our  
operations worldwide.
To date, all our principal manufacturing 
facilities apply an Environmental 
Management Systems (“EMS”) based on 
the ISO 14001 standard. During 2017 , we 
implemented an Energy Management 
System to the ISO 50001 standard across  
a selection of manufacturing facilities;  
at the end of 2017 , 15% of these sites had 
achieved external third-party accreditation. 
As identified last year, following a review  
of the benefits of external certification 
schemes, it was decided to develop and 
standardise central management of our 
Energy Management and our intention 
remains to pursue a Group certification 
programme during 2018. 
The following core measures of our 
environmental impacts are measured  
and monitored across the whole Group: 
 > Greenhouse gas emissions from energy 
use, including electricity, natural gas, 
heating fuel, transport and travel 
 > Use of resources, including water 
 > Generation and disposal of waste 
We continuously seek ways to improve  
our utilisation of natural resources.  
In particular, a process of continuous 
improvement is applied by our Filter 
Products’ research and development 
facilities in the UK, Asia and the US to 
innovate in the use of renewable resources 
and recyclable, biodegradable products.

The following assumptions, methodology,

have been used to report the Group’s key 
environmental performance indicators in 
2017 . The reported data complies with the 
Companies Act, for the Mandatory 
Reporting of Greenhouse Gases. 
 > Boundary scope – Data from all

ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM

STRATEGIC REPORT | CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY The absolute reduction in Scope 1 and 2 
emissions has been influenced by certain 
site closures and divestments during the 
year which, while not sufficiently material 
to warrant re-stating previous years’ 
environmental data, have nonetheless 
contributed towards the net reduction  
in emissions for the Group as a whole.  
This effect is also reflected in the reduction  
in revenues, being the measure we have 
historically used to calculate an intensity 
ratio. As a result, our emissions per £m 
have decreased by 1.73%.

The effect of the change in business  
mix outlined above has been even more 
pronounced in the water consumption 
data. However, the amount of water being 
consumed is comparatively low, and it is no 
longer considered a material component of 
Essentra’s environmental footprint. There is 
very little process water used in any of our 
operations, and the figures reported mainly 
comprise the water used for cleaning, 
sanitation and hygiene – none of which are 
considered appropriate areas for targeted 
reductions. Following a review during 2017 ,  
it has therefore been decided that this 
measure will no longer form part of our 
environmental targets.

This was mainly hardcore and rubble from 
various construction projects associated 
with the closure of the site, and as such 
has been excluded from the data table.
Given the diversity and scale of Essentra’s 
international operations, the use of energy 
and raw materials has both environmental 
and commercial importance. Local 
management drives environmental 
performance in accordance with Group 
policy (copies of which can be found at

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | BOARD OF DIRECTORS  CHAIRMAN’S CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
Board evaluation
As the Company continues to develop, one 
of the greatest challenges facing the Board 
is to ensure that we have in place the right 
people, culture and process to exploit fully 
the opportunities available to Essentra, and 
to manage effectively the risks to which the 
organisation is exposed. Accordingly, it is 
essential that the Company has a fully 
engaged and committed Board with an 
appropriate mix of skills, experience and 
knowledge that is capable of engaging in 
positive and constructive debate to meet 
these challenges. Having committed to 
look afresh at the composition of the Board 
in 2017 , I believe that the changes which 
have taken place during the year have 
fulfilled our objectives of increasing both 
diversity and international experience 
relevant to the Company and introducing 
valuable new perspective.
At the beginning of the year, the Company 
re-engaged Lintstock, an independent 
third party, to oversee and co-ordinate  
a Board evaluation. The evaluation 
focused particularly on the ways in which 
the Board can maximise its impact in 
support of Paul and the senior management 
team behind the new strategy and a 
reinvigorated and engaging culture.  
Following the evaluation, an appropriate 
action plan has been formulated and 
agreed to deliver further improvements  
in the leadership and effectiveness  
of the Board and progress against this  
plan is being reviewed on a regular basis. 
Particular actions which the Board took 
during 2017 to address some of the 
challenges which had been experienced  
in 2016 included:
 > Board dynamics – improving  
the interaction, engagement and 
communication between the Board  
and management teams
 > Board oversight – ensuring a clear  
cycle of agenda items, to facilitate 
appropriate steering and supervising 
focus on key issues
 > Board support – improving the quality, 
content and timeliness of materials 
submitted to the Board
Summary
As the Company seeks to move towards  
an integrated, co-ordinated and effective 
governance model appropriate for 
Essentra’s purposes, it is anticipated that 
the focus will evolve in nature and extent  
as current activities identify additional risks 
or process gaps which require attention.
Under the direction of the Chief Executive 
– and in support of the Company’s 
strategy – we are collectively committed  
to driving significant improvements in our 
governance practices to secure stability, 
provide a solid foundation for future 
sustainable growth, restore stakeholder 
confidence and make Essentra the  
best company it can be. The Board will 
continue to focus on delivering further 
governance improvements at all levels  
of the organisation, to ensure that the 
fundamental behaviours and processes 
necessary to deliver good governance 
across Essentra are appropriately in place, 
and to rigorously pursue and achieve its 
objective of establishing FTSE 250 upper 
quartile best practice governance by 2020. 
During 2017 the Company has identified  
the processes and procedures to be put in 
place to improve it’s corporate governance 
structure. The next 12 months will see the 
implementation of these processes and 
practices, with increased emphasis and 
focus on the management of risk and the 
embedding of appropriate risk-based 
assurance throughout Essentra.
With the Board having effectively  
energised the corporate governance 
structure, the challenge during 2018  
will be to drive these changes and culture 
throughout the organisation. However,  
with effective and appropriate investment 
in people, time and resources, my Board 
colleagues and I are convinced that the 
benefits of the change programme are 
already evident across the Company. 
PAUL LESTER, CBE
Chairman
2 March 2018
I strongly believe that good  
governance is a cornerstone of a 
successful company, and is founded  
on the principles and behaviours 
established and demonstrated by the 
Board. Accordingly, in line with the 
core elements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”), the 
Company has committed to a fully-
fledged Governance Improvement 
Programme which will establish or 
restore clear leadership, effectiveness 
and accountability at the respective 
Board, Committee and Executive 
Management levels to drive better 
governance practices. As a Board we 
have established a clear commitment  
to ensuring the Company operates 
more effectively and efficiently as a 
result of better planning, improved 
process, more focused reviews and 
higher quality reporting, to deliver 
material performance improvements 
and the cultural change necessary  
for sustainable future growth. 
Ensuring that the principles of the  
other Code elements of Executive 
Remuneration and Stakeholder 
Management are adhered to are other 
important considerations in ensuring 
shareholder trust in the Company,  
and these are discussed in more detail  
in the Remuneration Committee 
Chairman’s Letter on pages 81 to 85.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | CHAIRMAN’S CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK
Our Governance Improvement 
Programme is designed to ensure  
that there is an effective corporate 
governance framework, supported by 
robust processes, procedures and 
controls, which by 2020, is aligned with 
FTSE 250 upper quartile best practice. 
 
Board effectiveness
A high performing Board is a fundamental 
component of any effective corporate 
governance framework, with continuous 
improvement in the contribution of the 
Board being driven by a programme  
of actions arising from a thorough, 
independent Board evaluation process 
each year.
 
In 2017 , the Company engaged Lintstock 
Ltd to facilitate an interview-driven review 
of the performance of the Board and each 
of its Committees.
The first stage of the review involved 
Lintstock engaging with the Chairman 
and the Company Secretary to set the 
context for the evaluation, and to tailor 
survey content to the Company’s specific 
circumstances. Board members were then 
requested to complete an online questionnaire 
addressing the performance of the Board, 
its Committees and the Chairman, as well 
as their own individual contribution to  
the Board.
Lintstock subsequently conducted interviews 
with the Board members, enabling them  
to expand on their responses to the 
questionnaire. The anonymity of all 
respondents was ensured throughout the 
process, in order to promote the open and 
frank exchange of views.
Lintstock presented their report during  
a meeting of the Board, addressing the 
following areas:
 > The current composition of the Board, 
and any particular considerations 
relevant to any potential new Director 
appointments
 > The management of Board and 
Committee meetings, including the 
quality of the Board and Committee 
meeting packs
 > The Board’s relationships with, and 
exposure to, management both inside 
and outside the boardroom
 > The Board’s understanding of the 
component parts of the business, as 
well as the Board’s oversight of strategy, 
major projects and the main risks facing 
the business
 > The delegation of authority from  
the Board to senior management, 
alongside the Board’s oversight of  
the performance of management
 > The identification of the priorities for  
the new Chief Executive, as well as  
the priorities for improving the Board’s 
performance over the coming year
 > The performance of each of the Board 
Committees in fulfilling their mandates
Further to the completion of the 
questionnaires, an action plan was  
drawn up which was and continues  
to be regularly reviewed for progress at 
scheduled Board meetings. The priority 
items to address were identified as:
 
 > Board dynamics – increasing the 
Board’s engagement, support and 
ability to challenge the senior 
management team
 > Board oversight – ensuring clear 
agendas and annual cycle of reviews  
to facilitate appropriate steering and 
supervising focus on key issues
 > Board support – improving quality, 
content and timeliness of materials 
submitted to Board
Essentra has engaged Lintstock to 
conduct a follow-up review in early 2018,  
in order to review the progress made since 
this initial exercise. The findings of the 
detailed review will be presented to the 
Board by Lintstock.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK The Board
The Board’s role is to provide leadership 
to the Company and to be responsible 
to the shareholders for the long-term 
success of the Company.
In fulfilling its role, the Board:
 > Sets, continually reviews and tests  
the Company’s strategic aims
 > Determines the nature and extent  
of acceptable risks in achieving the 
Company’s strategic objectives
 > Oversees the establishment of formal 
and transparent arrangements for  
the application of corporate reporting, 
risk management and internal control 
requirements and principles

and human resources are in place for 
the Company to meet its objectives
 > Sets the Company’s values and standards
 > Reviews the performance of the 
Company’s executive management
 > Presents a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the 
Company’s position and prospects  
to its shareholders
Some matters are reserved exclusively  
for decision by the Board, while others  
are delegated to the Board Committees  
as follows:
The Audit Committee supports the 
Board and is responsible for: monitoring 
the integrity of the Company’s Financial 
Statements; reviewing, challenging and 
approving its accounting policies; and 
scrutinising the effectiveness of the 
internal and external auditors and  
the Company’s internal control and  
risk management systems.
The Remuneration Committee is 
established by the Board and is responsible 
for setting a remuneration policy  
for Directors and senior executives,  
which should be designed to promote  
the long-term success of the Company, 
taking into consideration shareholders  
and other stakeholders. The Remuneration 
Committee should determine an 
appropriate balance between fixed and 
performance-related and immediate and 
deferred remuneration. The Remuneration 
Committee is also responsible for setting 
the fees of the Chairman.
The Nomination Committee is 
responsible for regularly reviewing the 
structure, size and composition of the 
Board for any changes that it considers  
to be appropriate. The Nomination 
Committee will lead the process  
for board appointments and make 
recommendations to the Board. In  
selecting and recommending candidates  
for appointment, the Nomination 
Committee should evaluate the balance  
of skills, experience, independence 
knowledge and diversity on the Board and 
the future challenges and opportunities 
facing the Company.
The terms of reference for each of the 
Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committee can be found on the

is responsible for monitoring principal  
and key group risks, and ensuring the 
effectiveness of divisional and functional 
risk management. Further details of the 
Company’s risk management framework 
can be found on page 40.
Divisional Boards operate within  
a mandated agenda, which includes,  
health and safety, governance, strategy 
and performance.

Figures in brackets denote the maximum 
number of meetings that could have  
been attended.
Tommy Breen was unable to attend one  
of the meetings due to a long-standing 
prior commitment.
Colin Day remained as a Director of the 
Company until after the AGM in April 2017 , 
although he retired as Chief Executive on  
1 January 2017 . Colin was available to 
support the Board during this period,  
but he did not attend the Board meetings 
given the appointment of Paul Forman  
as the new Chief Executive.
The Essentra Board is accountable to  
all the Company’s stakeholders for the 
standards of governance which are 
maintained across Essentra’s diverse  
range of global businesses. 
During the year, Essentra was and 
continues to be subject to the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) 
2016 published by the Financial Reporting 
Council (“FRC”), a copy of which can be 
found on its website www.frc.org.uk. 
The Board has reviewed its operations and 
governance framework and confirms that, 
as at the date of this report, the Company 
has complied with the provisions set out  
in the Code.
The Company applies the Code’s principles 
of openness, integrity and accountability 
through its own behaviour, corporate 
governance best practice and by adopting, 
as appropriate and proportionate for  
a company of the size and nature of 
Essentra, recommendations of relevant 
professional bodies.
The Board is collectively responsible for  
the long-term success of the Company, 
and its role is to provide entrepreneurial 
leadership within a framework of prudent 
and effective controls, which enables risk 
to be assessed and managed in the pursuit 
of the Company’s strategic objectives.
The Board believes that it and its 
Committees have the appropriate 
composition to discharge their respective 
duties effectively with the appropriate level 
of challenge and level of independence, 
and that the members of the Board in 
conjunction with the senior executive 
teams are well equipped to drive, and  
are capable of delivering, the Company’s 
strategic objectives. The Board is of the 
view that it has a highly competent 
Chairman who, together with each of  
the other Non-Executive Directors, has 
considerable international experience  
at a senior level in the management of 
activities broadly similar to those carried 
out by Essentra and the material issues 
likely to arise for the Group.
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive are separately held and are so 
defined as to ensure a clear separation  
of responsibilities.
The Chairman leads the Board and ensures 
its effectiveness, and the Chief Executive is 
responsible for the executive management 
and performance of Essentra’s operations. 
Together with the primary responsibilities  
of the Senior Independent Director (“SID”), 
the other Non-Executive Directors and the 
clear definition of reserved matters and 
delegated authorities, there is a system 
which exists of checks and balances  
in which no individual has unfettered 
decision-making power.

 > Leads the Board
 > Ensures effective communication  
with shareholders
 > Ensures effective communication  
flows between Directors and

programmes
The Board maintains that, for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 , the Non-Executive 
Directors were each considered to be 
independent. In making this assessment  
of independence, the Board considers that 
the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors 
are independent of management, and  
free from business and other relationships 
which could interfere with the exercise  
of independent judgement now and in  
the future. The Board believes that any 
shareholdings of the Chairman and 
Non-Executive Directors serve to align  
their interests with those of shareholders. 
The Board considers that the Non-Executive 
Directors provide an independent view in 
Board discussions and in the development 
of the Company’s strategy. Non-Executive 
Directors also ensure a sound basis for good 
corporate governance for the Company, 
challenging management’s performance 
and, in conjunction with the Executive 
Directors, ensuring that rigorous financial 
controls and systems of risk management 
are maintained as appropriate to the needs 
of the businesses within Essentra. 
The Board is aware of current external 
commitments for all of the Non-Executive 
Directors, who are also required to discuss 
any additional external appointments with 
the Chairman prior to their acceptance,  
in addition, the time commitments of the 
Chairman are the subject of review by  
the SID, in conjunction with the other 
Non-Executive Directors.
While there were no material changes to 
the time commitment of the Chairman 
during the year, the Board took note of 
Paul Lester’s appointment as Chairman  
of McCarthy & Stone plc at its AGM on  
24 January 2018. The Board has considered 
Paul Lester’s commitment of time to the 
Company in light of this and other external 
positions, and concluded that he would 
continue to be able to fully satisfy his 
obligations to Essentra. In considering the 
Chairman’s continued time commitments 
to the Company, the Non-Executive 
Directors also viewed positively his 
exemplary attendance record at Essentra, 
ensuring that he was able to attend 100% 
of Board and Committee meetings 
throughout the year. The Board expects 
this attendance record to continue going 
forward, and Paul Lester has given 
assurances to this end of his continued 
commitments to the Company, in line  
with expectations outlined in his Letter  
of Appointment. 
Regarding the time commitments of 
Tommy Breen, it is noted that he retired  
as the Chief Executive of DCC plc and 
therefore will have sufficient time for the 
Senior Independent Director role which  
he will be undertaking with effect from  
the 2018 AGM.
The Board is content that the Non-
Executive Directors devote sufficient  
time to the business of Essentra.
Executive Directors may accept outside 
appointments, provided that such 
appointments do not in any way prejudice 
the ability to perform their duties on 
behalf of Essentra.
Paul Forman, Chief Executive, currently  
holds one external non-executive position, 
and the Board is of the view that this is not 
detrimental to the performance of his duties 
given the time requirements involved.
Colin Day was an Executive Director until 
April 2017 , during which time he held three 
external non-executive positions. 
The letters of appointment for Non-
Executive Directors are available for review 
at the Company’s registered office and 
prior to the AGM.
The Company’s Articles of Association 
require that all new Directors seek election 
to the Board at the AGM following their 
appointment. In compliance with the 
Code, all eligible Directors will put 
themselves forward for re-election on an 
annual basis. The Board is satisfied that 
each of the Directors being put forward  
for re-election continues to be effective 
and that their ongoing commitment to 
the role is undiminished.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT The conduct of Board matters
In managing the affairs of the Company, 
the Board’s agenda is set by the 
Chairman, in conjunction with the 
Company Secretary & General Counsel, 
and deals with an adopted schedule of 
reserved matters which are to be reviewed 
annually including:
 > Strategy and resources
 > Annual planning
 > Treasury policies
 > Major capital and operating  
expenditure proposals
 > Major acquisitions and disposals
 > Debt facilities
 > Key Group policies
 > Appointments to the Board
 > Systems of internal control
 > Dividend payments
 > Categories of public announcements
 > Risk appetite
 > Health and safety
The detailed implementation of all these, 
and general operational matters, are  
the responsibility of executive senior 
management and regular formal reports 
are provided to the Board.
During the year, there were eight scheduled 
Board meetings. In addition to these 
scheduled formal meetings, the Board met 
on a number of other occasions as required, 
and, in particular, the Directors met to 
review and agree the strategy on two 
separate occasions.
In conjunction with the continuous review 
of the strategy and monitoring the progress 
in stabilising the Company, the Board 
evaluated the appropriate deployment  
of capital in the business, including the 
development of the dividend policy along 
with a clear and increased emphasis on 
cash generation and returns necessary to 
ensure the long-term growth and success  
of the Company.
At each meeting the Board considers  
reports from the Chief Executive and the 
Group Finance Director covering operational, 
financial performance and other significant 
business matters together with regular 
updates on any material issues which  
may impact the Group. Board meetings 
are structured to allow open discussion.
Other noteworthy matters considered  
by the Board in 2017 include:
 > Review of the Governance  
Improvement Programme
 > Agreement to the disposal of the  
Porous Technologies businesses
 > Agreement to the disposal of the 
packaging business based in Bristol
 > Revised strategy and resourcing  
for Health & Safety
 > Agreement to the closure of the 
Newport cartons facility
 > Review of the new Group organisation 
structure
 > Revision of Human Resources strategy, 
including engagement, succession  
and diversity
 > Consideration of Brexit implications 
 > Approval of the Company’s trading 
statements, full year and half  
year results and quarterly trading 
statements
 > Refinancing of the Company’s  
debt facilities
 > Approval of a revised Code of Ethics  
and Right to Speak policy
With the recent changes to the Board,  
and particularly the appointment of the 
Chairman, there has been improved 
communication between the Chairman 
and the Non-Executive Directors, including 
meetings between the Chairman and the 
Non-Executive Directors without the 
Executive Directors present. Led by the 
Senior Independent Director, the Non-
Executive Directors also met without the 
Chairman present to appraise his 
performance. Regular contact is also 
maintained with the Chief Executive. 
Further to the formal Board meetings 
there is an enhanced programme of 
meetings, both formal and informal,  
in line with recommendations of the Board 
evaluation action plan, with members of 
the senior executive management.
During the year, as part of the Company’s 
Governance Improvement Programme 
and in conjunction with the externally 
facilitated Board evaluation conducted  
by Lintstock, the Board undertook a review 
of its meeting processes. This included  
the provision of meeting papers, annual 
schedule of agenda items and the future 
calendar of meetings, and should enable 
the Board to improve its ability to operate 
more effectively. In 2017 the Board held 
one of its meetings at a UK facility and it  
is intended that further locations will host 
meetings during 2018, so that the Board 
has the opportunity to engage with local 
management and derive a better 
understanding of the Company’s 
operations and business model.
Operational matters and the responsibility 
for the day-to-day management of the 
businesses are delegated to the Chief 
Executive, supported by members of senior 
executive management as appropriate, 
within delegated authority limits and in 
accordance with clearly defined systems 
of internal control. 
In support of the operational reports 
provided during the year, the Board 
received detailed presentations from 
senior management across a range  
of businesses within the Company,  
and considered reports from enabling 
functional management about matters  
of material importance to the Company 
which arose from time to time. 
The Board was supported during the year 
by the GMC, which ensures a strong link 
between Essentra’s overall corporate 
strategy and its implementation within  
an effective internal control environment.
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT The GMC, provides general executive 
management of the Company within 
agreed delegated authority limits 
determined by the Board. The GMC 
consists of the Chief Executive, Group 
Finance Director, Divisional Managing 
Directors or Presidents and the respective 
heads of the enabling Group functions.  
Full details of the membership of the  
GMC can be found on pages 60 to 61.
As part of the Governance Improvement 
Programme Essentra has established that, 
in order to continue to implement effective 
corporate governance within the Group, 
the GMC needs to drive new working 
practices and behaviours through the 
establishment of clearly defined annual 
agendas for reporting, reviewing and 
decision making.
The Board Committees are a valuable part 
of the Company’s corporate governance 
structure, and the Board looks to the Audit 
Committee in particular to undertake the 
majority of the work involved in monitoring 
and seeking assurance as to compliance 
with the controls within this structure. 
However, the Board as a whole maintains 
oversight of such important matters and, 
after each Committee meeting, the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee reports 
on the matters which have been reviewed.
Other specific responsibilities are delegated 
to the Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees. These Committees report  
as appropriate to the Board. 
Applying Essentra’s Corporate 
Responsibility principles
The Chief Executive is the Director  
with primary responsibility for the 
implementation and integration of 
Essentra’s Corporate Responsibility 
principles across the Company. During 
2017 , the Group Human Resources 
Director, supported by the Company 
Secretary & General Counsel, was 
responsible for co-ordinating the operation 
of detailed policies on health and safety, 
ethics and the environment which support 
Essentra’s commitment to its Corporate 
Responsibility principles. Further details  
of these policies can be viewed in the 
Corporate Responsibility statement on  
pages 50 to 57 and on the Company’s 
website www.essentraplc.com.
Diversity
Essentra is focused on providing a safe, 
respectful and diverse working environment. 
 
The Company’s new six principles, 
which were communicated during  
2017 (details of which can be found at 
www.essentraplc.com), include specific  
reference to the importance of diversity  
in supporting the Company’s stability, 
strategy and growth objectives. Essentra 
has begun a Diversity & Inclusion 
programme, with some externally 
facilitated support, to ensure behaviours 
fully reflect the principles of diversity and 
inclusion across the Company, and it is 
intended to develop a specific policy as 
part of that programme. Indeed, one of 
the key findings from the 2017 employee 
engagement survey was the importance 
of ensuring that diverse perspectives are 
valued within the Company, and Essentra 
is committed to establishing an inclusive 
culture where diversity is embraced by 
everyone and makes Essentra a rewarding 
and successful place to work.
Conflict of interests
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid 
actual or potential conflicts of interest. 
The Company’s Articles of Association 
permit the Board to consider and, if it sees 
fit, to authorise situations where a Director 
has an interest that conflicts, or may 
possibly conflict, with the interests of the 
Company. During the year, the Conflict  
of Interests policy, which governs the 
responsibilities of Directors in such 
situations, was reviewed. The decision to 
authorise a conflict of interest can only  
be made by non-conflicted Directors  
(ie, those who have no interest in the 
matter being considered) and, in making 
such a decision, the Directors must act 
honestly and in good faith when giving 
authorisation where they think this is 
appropriate, and will be most likely to 
promote the Company’s success. The 
Company Secretary & General Counsel 
maintains a register of Directors’ interests, 
so that any potential concerns are 
addressed before any material issues  
may arise. The Conflict of Interests register 
and the schedule of Directors’ Interests is 
reviewed at each Board meeting. During 
the course of the year, there were no 
material conflicts of interest impacting  
on the conduct of the Board’s activities.
Information and professional 
development
The Chairman, supported by the Company 
Secretary & General Counsel, takes 
responsibility for ensuring that the 
Directors receive accurate, timely and 
clear information.
On appointment, an induction 
programme tailored to their individual 
needs is available to Directors, and  
is designed to assist them in their 
understanding of Essentra and its 
operations. Throughout a Director’s 
tenure, they are encouraged to develop 
their knowledge of the Group through 
meetings with senior management and 
site visits. Directors are also provided with 
updates, as appropriate, on matters such  
as fiduciary duties, Companies Act 
requirements, share dealing restrictions 
and corporate governance matters. 
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT During the year, two new Non-Executive 
Directors were appointed. A comprehensive 
induction programme was embarked upon 
which has involved them visiting a number 
of sites, both in the UK and overseas. There 
have also been a number of meetings held 
with the senior management team, in order 
to gain a better understanding, of the 
Group and the key challenges surrounding 
its future strategic objectives. One of the 
new Non-Executive Directors, Ralf K. 
Wunderlich, undertook additional training  
to reinforce the key considerations that a 
Non-Executive Director should be aware  
of in relation to the role and responsibilities 
for a UK public limited company.
All Directors have access to the advice  
and services of the Company Secretary  
& General Counsel, and for the year under 
review, his advice was sought in relation to 
share dealings. In the furtherance of their 
duties, there are agreed procedures for the 
Directors to take independent professional 
advice, if necessary, at the Company’s 
expense. No Director took independent 
professional advice during the year.
Shareholder communications
The Board recognises the importance  
of effective communication, and seeks  
to maintain open and transparent 
relationships with its shareholders and 
other stakeholders, including providers  
of finance, customers and suppliers. This  
is achieved by regular updates through 
public announcements, the corporate 
website and other published material.
All shareholders can meet any of the 
Directors of the Company should they so 
wish. In particular, the SID is available to 
shareholders should they have concerns  
or wish to share their views. Feedback from 
meetings with shareholders is provided to 
the Board so they are aware of any issues 
or concerns, and ensures that the Board 
has a balanced view from the major 
investors. Additionally, the Board uses  
the AGM as an occasion to communicate 
with all shareholders, including private 
investors, who are provided with the 
opportunity to question the Directors.  
At the AGM, the level of proxy votes  
lodged on each resolution is made 
available, both at the meeting and 
subsequently on the Company’s website. 
Each substantially separate issue is 
presented as a separate resolution,  
and the Chairmen of the Audit, 
Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees are available to answer 
questions from shareholders.
The Company also communicates 
regularly with its major institutional 
shareholders and ensures that all the 
Directors, including the Non-Executive 
Directors, understand the views and 
concerns of major shareholders, and  
can explain business developments  
and financial results as appropriate.  
The Chief Executive, Group Finance 
Director and Investor Relations Director 
have primary responsibility for investor  
relations. Presentations for analysts and 
shareholders were held during the year, 
and meetings were also undertaken  
with key institutional investors to discuss 
strategy, financial performance and 
investment activities. Slide presentations 
are made immediately available after  
the full and half year results, and are  
also available on the Company’s website 
to view and download. The Company 
ensures that any price-sensitive information 
is released to all shareholders at the  
same time, in accordance with regulatory 
requirements.
Board roles
The SID, currently Terry Twigger, can be 
contacted via the Company’s registered 
office. In that role, he is available to 
shareholders to discuss and develop  
an understanding of their issues and  
any concerns which cannot be resolved  
by discussions with the Chairman, the 
Chief Executive or Group Finance Director, 
or where such contact is inappropriate.
Terry will retire as a Director following the 
2018 AGM. Tommy Breen will be appointed 
as the SID from that date subject to his 
re-election as a Director at the 2018 AGM.
Financial reporting
The Directors have acknowledged, in  
the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
set out on page 112, their responsibility for 
preparing the Financial Statements of the 
Company and the Group. The Directors  
are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and Accounts, and they consider 
that the Annual Report and Accounts  
taken as a whole are fair, balanced and 
understandable. The External Auditor has 
included a statement about their reporting 
responsibilities in the Independent Auditor’s 
Report, set out on pages 182 to 190.
The Directors are also responsible for the 
publication of half year results, as required 
by the Disclosure and Transparency Rules 
of the Financial Conduct Authority. This 
provides a general description of the 
financial position and performance  
of the Company and the Group during  
the relevant period. 
Directors’ and Officers’ insurance
In accordance with the Company’s  
Articles of Association, and to the extent 
permitted by the laws of England and 
Wales, the Directors are granted an 
indemnity from the Company in respect  
of those liabilities incurred as a result  
of their office. During the year, the Deed  
of Indemnity was reviewed and updated  
to take into consideration current best 
practice and changes to the applicable 
legislation since the Deed was originally 
drafted. In respect of those matters for 
which the Directors may not be indemnified, 
the Company maintained a Directors’ and 
Officers’ Liability Insurance policy throughout 
the year. It is anticipated this policy will  
be renewed. Neither the Company’s 
indemnity, nor the insurance provides cover, 
to the extent that a Director is proven to 
have acted dishonestly or fraudulently.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT Internal controls
In accordance with the Code, the Board 
acknowledges its overall responsibility to 
shareholders to ensure that an adequate 
system of risk management and internal 
control is in place. This is essential for 
reliable financial reporting and also for  
the effective management of the Group.
Overseeing the effectiveness of the system 
has been delegated to the Audit 
Committee, which assesses the quality of 
the control environment when monitoring 
and reviewing the integrity of the Group’s 
Financial Statements, and any significant 
judgements that were made in their 
preparation. Essentra’s internal controls 
are designed to safeguard the Company’s 
assets, and to ensure the integrity and 
reliability of information used both  
within the businesses and for public 
announcements. The Board has overall 
responsibility for the Company’s system  
of internal control and risk management, 
and for reviewing the effectiveness of  
this system. Such a system can only be 
designed to mitigate, rather than 
eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives, and can therefore  
only provide reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement 
or loss.
In order to strengthen the Company’s 
internal control systems, and in 
accordance with the implementation of 
the Governance Improvement Programme 
a number of actions have been put in 
place which should serve to ensure a clear 
focus by the executive management team 
on the key requirements for effective 
internal control and appropriate reporting 
and monitoring.
The Audit Committee takes responsibility 
for reviewing the Essentra internal controls 
through its engagement with the Group 
Assurance function. While Essentra has a 
well-established internal audit function, 
potential opportunities for improvements 
in its effectiveness to drive a high quality 
internal control system, to deliver value to 
the respective businesses and to support 
change management were identified.  
The Audit Committee is committed to a 
prioritised and structured programme to 
drive improvements in the effectiveness  
of the internal audit function through 
better engagement with the businesses 
and further reduce the risk of error, fraud 
or poor practice. Template agendas for 
Divisional Boards have been implemented 
which ensures that a structured and 
detailed approach is adopted in reviewing 
governance, strategy and performance 
reviews. It is anticipated that this should 
deliver greater visibility on potential 
internal control concerns or process  
gaps and drive appropriate executive  
and management responses on a 
risk-based approach.
The following enables the Board to  
review the effectiveness of the system  
of internal control:
 > The Audit Committee meets regularly 
and reports to the Board, no less 
frequently than at every Board meeting 
following an Audit Committee meeting
 > The terms of reference provide a 
framework for the Audit Committee to 
review and oversee the quality, integrity, 
appropriateness and effectiveness of 
the Group’s internal control framework
 > The Board has the opportunity to review 
the internal control environment at local 
sites when Board meetings are held 
away from the Company’s head office
 > Every month, each division submits 
detailed operating and financial reports 
covering all aspects of performance. 
These are reviewed within the Group’s 
central Finance function, and summary 
reports are communicated to the GMC 
and the Board
 > Certificates are required from the 
businesses to confirm compliance with 
the Group’s policies (including financial)
and procedures at both the half year 
and year end
Policies and procedure – which are subject 
to ongoing review and updated as required 
in response to strategic, operational, 
business, legal or regulatory developments, 
with the approval of the Board or its 
respective Committees as appropriate –  
are communicated across the Group.  
The improvement initiatives for Essentra’s 
internal controls are designed to ensure 
significant risks, investment decisions  
and management issues are identified, 
considered and escalated as necessary  
at the earliest opportunity. Divisional 
Managing Directors and Presidents  
are responsible for ensuring the 
communication of, and compliance  
with, Essentra’s internal controls across 
their respective businesses. 
Control of significant risks
The Board’s responsibility for risk and risk 
management in Essentra encompasses:
 > Determining the Company’s approach 
to risk
 > Setting and instilling the appropriate 
culture throughout the Company
 > Identifying the risks inherent in the 
Company’s business model and 
strategy, including risks from  
external factors
 > Monitoring the Company’s exposure  
to risk and the key risks that could 
undermine its strategy, reputation  
or long-term viability
 > Providing an effective oversight of  
the risk management processes in  
the Company
 > Ensuring the Company has effective 
crisis management systems
There is a Group risk framework in place  
to support the Board in fulfilling these 
responsibilities and to ensure that risk review 
processes are embedded within the business. 
Further details of the Company’s risk 
management framework and activities 
during 2017 are provided on pages  
40 to 49 .

The Nomination Committee is responsible 
for regularly reviewing the structure,  
size and composition of the Board  
for any changes that it considers to be 
appropriate. The Nomination Committee 
leads the process for board, appointments 
and makes recommendations to the  
Board. In selecting and recommending 
candidates for appointment, the 
Nomination Committee evaluates the 
balance of skills, experience, independence 
knowledge and diversity on the Board, 
taking into account the future challenges 
and opportunities facing the Company.
During the year, the Nomination Committee 
met four times to discuss general succession 
planning for the Board and the appointment 
of the new Non-Executive Directors.
The Nomination Committee, and the  
Board as a whole, supports the spirit of  
the recommendations set out in the Lord 
Davies Report “Women on Boards” . 
Securing the right combination of skills, 
experience and expertise allows the Board 
to effectively lead the sustainable growth 
and success of the Company for the benefit 
of all stakeholders. The fundamental 
objective must be to ensure that the best 
people are appointed to do the best job for 
Essentra, taking into consideration other 
factors, such as market and international 
experience, and diversity of thought and 
background. Appointing people on merit, 
without any form of discrimination, is a key 
component of Essentra policies across its 
international operations at all levels.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT AUDIT COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN’S LETTER
Dear Shareholder, 
As Chairman of the Essentra plc  
Audit Committee, I am pleased to 
present the 2017 Audit Committee 
Report to shareholders, and to be  
able to confirm, on behalf of the 
Board, that the Annual Report is  
fair, balanced and understandable.
The report aims to provide the following 
information:
 > How the Audit Committee operates and 
engages with the Company, including 
with the Executive Directors, the Group 
Assurance function and other key 
management
 > The key activities which were reviewed 
by the Audit Committee, including 
those items of regular annual review 
and other current areas of focus
 > The discussions and actions  
undertaken, in conjunction with the 
External Auditor, on any significant 
accounting judgements and / or 
financial reporting issues
 > Details of the ongoing review of the 
External Auditor and the amount  
of non-audit work undertaken
The arrival of Paul Forman as Chief 
Executive at the beginning of 2017 , after a 
period of financial performance challenges 
for the Company, provided the stimulus 
for a reassessment of the overall corporate 
governance practices across the Group. 
The work of the Audit Committee during 
the year has continued to focus on the 
integrity of the financial reporting and 
monitoring the relationship with PwC 
following their formal appointment as  
the Company’s External Auditor at the 
AGM in April 2017 . In addition, with  
Paul’s commitment to the Governance 
Improvement Programme designed to 
deliver FTSE 250 top quartile best practice 
governance by 2020, the Audit Committee 
has spent considerable time assessing the 
nature and extent of the internal control 
environment and engaging with specialist 
external resource in conjunction with the 
Company, to assess opportunities to 
improve the effectiveness of the existing 
risk management, internal audit and 
compliance practices. 
With the creation of a new Legal, Risk  
& Governance function, headed by the 
Company Secretary & General Counsel 
and the addition of new resource, the 
Company has begun to implement  
a number of improvement initiatives in  
a prioritised and structured manner  
agreed by the Board, and that programme 
will continue throughout 2018 and beyond  
into 2020. In accordance with of reference 
and having regard to the continued 
evolution of the improvement programme 
in response to the demands of the Board. 
The Audit Committee has engaged 
extensively in the review and assessment 
of potential improvement opportunities 
and overseen the implementation of a 
number of changes to policy, processes 
and practice.
During the year, the key projects  
in which the Audit Committee has 
participated include:
 > An independent assessment of the 
Company’s internal audit processes  
and capability was undertaken by 
specialist external resource. The review 
was focused on identifying potential 
improvements to the existing 
management framework and resourcing 
practices and priorities, in order to drive 
better engagement with the businesses 
and effectively support the governance 
improvement initiatives. The Company 
is continuing to work with specialist 
external resource in the delivery of an 
internal audit capability aligned with 
best practice risk assurance by 2020, 
while the Audit Committee maintains 
its focus on the robustness of the 
internal control environment through 
the activities of the internal audit team. 
 > A comprehensive review by an expert 
external risk consultant, assessing the 
nature and extent of the risk 
management practices within the 
Company. As a result of that review,  
the Company has implemented new 
policies and management frameworks 
for the better identification, assessment 
and mitigation of enterprise and business 
continuity risks. Further details can be 
found on page 40 in the Management  
of Principle Risks Report. During 2018,  
the Audit Committee will be carefully 
reviewing the consistent implementation 
of the changes which have been agreed, 
and ensuring that the new frameworks 
and processes are providing the 
anticipated improvements in the quality 
and effectiveness of the Company’s risk 
management practices.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | AUDIT COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN’S LETTER  > An independent assessment on  
the effectiveness of Essentra’s data 
management and security processes, 
and the new practices and procedures 
required in preparation for the new EU 
General Data Protection Regulations 
which come into effect in May 2018.  
The Company is undertaking a number  
of actions in response to the findings 
and recommendations of that  
report, and the Audit Committee  
has continued to track progress with  
the implementation programme.
 > A comprehensive review of the 
Company’s insurance programme 
coverage and associated management 
practices and processes, to assess the 
quality of the coverage and compliance 
with fair presentation, disclosure and 
reporting requirements, to ensure the 
effectiveness of the coverage available 
in response to any claims. The review 
was undertaken by Mactavish, and the 
Company is undertaking a number  
of activities in response to their 
recommendations and will continue  
to work with Mactavish during 2018. 
I believe that the Audit Committee 
comprises the necessary experience, 
expertise and financial understanding  
to continue to effectively fulfil its 
responsibilities and to continue to input 
significantly into the various improvement 
initiatives. I am confident that  
Mary Reilly, who has already made a 
significant impact as a member of the 
Audit Committee since her appointment 
in July and is succeeding me as Chairman, 
will bring new and additional experience 
and a fresh perspective and approach, 
which will provide a valuable addition to 
the capabilities of the Audit Committee 
and assist the Company considerably  
in the successful delivery of its 2020 
governance objectives. A key activity  
for the Audit Committee in 2018 will be to 
review the progress of the implementation 
activities and to assess the effectiveness  
of the improvements being made.
In order for the Audit Committee to 
provide positive assurance to the Board, 
that the Annual Report, when taken  
as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable – and also provides the 
information necessary for shareholders  
to assess the Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy 
– the following processes and controls  
were followed during the year:
 
 > An annual update is made to the Audit 
Committee on the fair, balanced and 
understandable requirement, including 
early notification of the matters under 
consideration for inclusion or otherwise 
in the narrative reporting of the 2017  
full year results. The Audit Committee 
undertakes a similar assessment at the 
half year, to ensure a consistent and 
diligent approach to the requirement 
covering the year
 > An experienced core team, with

review and challenge of the reporting
 > Senior management confirms that the 
content regarding their respective area

The diligent adherence to these 
comprehensive processes, as overseen by 
the Audit Committee, provide assurance  
to the Board that the statement required 
by the 2016 UK Corporate Governance 
Code can be given.
As previously reported, following a  
tender process completed during 2016, 
PriceWaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”) were 
formally appointed as the external auditor 
following the 2017 AGM. The transition 
from KPMG has been completed in a 
seamless way, and PwC have performed 
very well during their first year. I am sure 
that they will continue to work effectively 
with Mary and the rest of the Audit 
Committee in the future.
I would like to thank KPMG for their 
approach and assistance in ensuring  
the smooth transition and for their work  
as external auditor since 2005. 
This is my final report as Chairman of  
the Audit Committee, and I would like to 
thank the members and the Board as a 
whole for their work and support during 
my tenure at Essentra, and to wish them 
and the Company as a whole every 
success for the future.

Governance
All the Audit Committee members are 
independent Non-Executive Directors,  
and have financial and / or related 
business experience gained in senior 
positions in other large diverse organisations. 
Terry Twigger has been the Chairman of 
the Audit Committee since 2009, and the 
Board is satisfied that Terry has recent  
and relevant financial experience.
Terry Twigger is retiring from the Board 
and as Chairman of the Audit Committee 
after the 2018 AGM. Mary Reilly will be 
replacing Terry as the Chairman and is 
currently working with him to ensure a 
smooth transition of the role. Further 
details of Mary’s qualifications can  
be found on page 63.
As a whole the Audit Committee believe 
that its members are competent in  
the business sectors within which the 
Essentra Group operates.
The Audit Committee supports the  
Board and reports to it on a regular basis, 
and no less frequently than at every Board 
meeting following a meeting of the  
Audit Committee. 
During early 2017 , the Company engaged 
Lintstock Ltd to facilitate an interview-
driven review of the performance of the 
Audit Committee, in conjunction with  
a full review of the Board and the other 
Board Committees. The particular focus 
for the Committees was to ensure that the 
meeting mandates were fully addressed. 
Recommendations concerning the 
performance of the meetings were made 
and an action plan put in place to address 
these points.
There is an annual cycle of items 
considered by the Audit Committee.  
These items are scheduled in accordance 
with the requirements of the external 
audit cycle and any other requirements  
of the Audit Committee’s responsibilities, 
as detailed in its terms of reference.  
The annual agenda was reviewed during 
the year as part of the ongoing Governance 
Improvement Programme and as part of 
the transition to a new Audit Committee 
Chairman to ensure that it remains 
appropriate.
The current terms of reference for  
the Audit Committee are available at  
www.essentraplc.com. A substantive review  
of the terms of reference is to be carried out 
after the conclusion of the FRC review of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, to 
ensure alignment with best practice in  
the context of Essentra.
The terms of reference provide a 
framework for the Audit Committee’s 
work during the year, to review and oversee 
the quality, integrity, appropriateness and 
effectiveness of the Group including:
 > Financial statements and external 
financial reporting 
 > Significant financial judgements
 > Tax activities
 > Compliance programme
 > Cyber security response
 > Relationship with, and performance  
of the external auditor
 > System of internal control

Financial Statements and  
External Financial Reporting
As part of recommending for approval  
the 31 December 2017 Annual Report and 
Accounts and the 30 June 2017 Half Year 
Report, the Audit Committee reviewed, 
examined and challenged the Group 
Finance Director and External Auditor  
on their respective assessments including,  
in particular; going concern basis of 
preparation; accounting policies and 
disclosures, any financial reporting issues; 
significant financial judgements made 
(see below) and levels of disclosure to 
ensure that the reports are fair, balanced 
and understandable.
Additionally the Audit Committee 
reviewed the contents and suitability  
of the Long-Term Viability Statement  
was reviewed in-depth and the Audit 
Committee challenged the risk scenarios  
and potential impacts outlined by  
the Company prior to confirming its 
support and approval of the statement.
The Audit Committee was presented with 
information and advice regarding new IFRS 
pronouncements that would be applicable 
to Essentra for the 2017 financial period 
and reviewed plans for the implementation, 
in future years, of IFRS 15 Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers, IFRS16 Leases 
and IFRS9 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement.
Significant financial judgements 
Tax liabilities
The Group is, from time to time, subject  
to tax assessments that may represent 
potential future tax exposures, which arise 
in the ordinary course of business from tax 
authorities in a number of the jurisdictions 
in which the Group operates. The Group 
assesses all such exposures in the context 
of the tax laws of the countries in which  
it operates and, where applicable, makes 
provisions for any settlements which it 
considers appropriate.
The Group operates in a number of tax 
jurisdictions, and recognises tax based on 
interpretation of local laws and regulations 
which are sometimes uncertain. Where  
the amount of tax payable is uncertain, 
the Directors are required to exercise 
significant judgment in determining the 
appropriate amount to provide in respect 
of potential tax exposures and uncertain 
tax positions. The Audit Committee 
challenged the nature and extent of the 
tax provisioning of the Company and 
saught assurance that the Company was 
working diligently to resolve outstanding 
liabilities in an appropriate fashion.
Uncertain tax positions continue to be  
a focus of the full year work. There is a 
focus on the uncertainty over the Group’s 
transfer pricing position and deductibility 
of interest as a result of US debt financing 
and tax positions in respect of the Porous 
Technologies disposal. 
The Audit Committee reviewed the tax 
liabilities which existed at the start of  
the year, and those created during the 
year and the effective tax rate – together 
with their corresponding assumptions.  
The Audit Committee questioned and 
challenged the Group Finance Director 
and Group Head of Tax as to the 
Company’s risk attitude in this area. 
Upon consideration of the Company’s 
explanations and the External Auditor’s 
conclusions, the Audit Committee was 
satisfied that the tax liabilities were 
appropriate, and that the Group’s tax 
disclosures were adequate given the 
nature of the Group’s activities. 
Revenue recognition
There are a large number of sales 
transactions that are incurred across the 
Group. Given the risk that revenue may  
be recognised in the incorrect period over 
reporting dates, the Group needs to ensure 
that there are effective controls regarding 
the recording of sales transactions.
Revenue recognition continued to be a  
key area of audit focus, and the external 
auditor addressed the potential issue with 
the Audit Committee during the planning 
and scoping of the external audit process. 
Goodwill and intangible assets
As required by IAS 36, the Company 
undertakes an assessment of the carrying 
value of intangible assets on an annual 
basis, or more frequently if there is an 
indication of impairment. The details  
of the work carried out and the results  
are in note 8 of the Notes to the  
Financial Statements.
In the prior year, an impairment loss  
of £123.9m was recognised against  
the Packaging division (formerly Health  
& Personal Care Packaging (“H&PCP”) 
division), and further potential impairment 
risk was assessed in the H&PCP division 
based on the underlying trading 
performance of particular components 
and the closure of the Newport folding 
cartons site in the UK. The assumptions  
for 2018 and beyond (such as the annual 
growth rate and the terminal growth rate) 
are based on the 2018 annual plan and 
management’s best estimates of the 
performance in subsequent years.  
The impairment reviews performed by 
management contain a number of 
significant judgements and estimates 
including revenue growth, profit margins 
and discount rates. A change in these 
assumptions can result in a material 
change in the valuation of the assets  
and a further impairment charge. 
The Audit Committee evaluated and 
challenged the methodology of the 
impairment review and the assumptions 
on which it was based, including the 
financial plans approved by the Board. 
Taking into account the external auditor’s 
review, the Audit Committee is satisfied 
that the impairment assessment is 
appropriately carried out.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE Exceptional items
The Financial Statements include certain 
items which are disclosed as exceptional. 
The nature of these exceptional items is 
explained within the Group accounting 
policy, and includes transaction costs  
and gains or losses relating to acquisitions  
and disposals of businesses, acquisition 
integration and restructuring costs,  
and other items such as impairment losses. 
Following an extensive review, the Audit 
Committee is satisfied that the Group’s 
definition of exceptional items remains 
clear and that appropriate level of 
disclosure is included. 
The definition remains consistent with  
the prior year, and in the current year the 
Audit Committee has been involved in 
assessing the appropriateness of items 
presented within exceptional items 
including impairment and restructuring 
activities on the basis that they are 
one-off material items which are 
presented separately to allow a better 
understanding of the Group’s ongoing 
activities. Further details can be found  
in note 2.
Tax activities 
The Group Head of Tax presented to the 
Audit Committee a report detailing the 
Company’s tax strategy, governance, 
planning and attitude to tax risk. The 
presentation set out the key activities that 
the tax department was engaged upon 
regarding the management of these 
tax-related matters, and the nature and 
extent of the tax provisions maintained  
by the Company. The Audit Committee 
considered these activities in conjunction 
with advice from the Group Finance 
Director, and was satisfied with the 
approach being taken by the Company.
Compliance programme
The Audit Committee continued its regular 
review of the Group’s compliance activities 
and received regular presentations from 
the Company Secretary & General 
Counsel, including the recommendation, 
for approval by the Board, a revised Ethics 
Code and Right to Speak policy. At each 
meeting, reports are presented detailing 
any claims made under the Company’s 
independent Right to Speak process.
 
The Audit Committee noted the continued 
investment being made by the Company 
in systems designed to better facilitate 
compliance policy management and 
training across the Group, and to deliver 
due diligence processes to assist in the 
management of third-party risk while 
monitoring any developments in the 
regulatory environment and assessing  
any impact to the Company.
 
The Audit Committee has overseen  
the Company’s proposals for the future 
delivery of further improved compliance 
practices, with a new Group Risk & 
Compliance Manager assuming responsibility 
for the strategic development of the 
compliance programme into 2018 and 
beyond, and additional support to better 
enable the delivery of the programme in 
response to key compliance risks. 
Cyber security
Cyber security risk remains an important 
matter for constant monitoring. During the 
course of the year, the Audit Committee 
further assessed the Company’s 
programme to respond to potential 
threats to the integrity of its IT systems 
through a presentation provided by the 
Chief Information Officer. 
External Auditor
During the year the Audit Committee:
 > Reviewed and agreed the scope  
and strategic nature of the audit  
work to be undertaken
 > Agreed the terms of engagement  
and fees to be paid to the  
External Auditor
 > Reviewed the qualifications, expertise, 
resources and independence of  
the External Auditor and assessed  
its performance
 > Reviewed proposals for the  
engagement of the External  
Auditor for non-audit services and 
confirmed that their independence  
was safeguarded
 > Reviewed the level of non-audit work 
being carried out by the External  
Auditor and other external audit 
assignment providers

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE Assessment of the External Auditor 
The Audit Committee is provided with 
reports, reviews, information and advice 
throughout the year, as set out in the 
terms of the External Auditor’s 
engagement. Performance is formally 
assessed by the Audit Committee in 
conjunction with the GMC and the Audit 
Committee remains satisfied that the 
External Auditor is effective and provided 
appropriate independent challenge to the 
Company’s management. In making this 
assessment, the Audit Committee had 
due regard to their expertise, resourcing 
and independence. 
Independence of the External Auditor  
In order to fulfil its responsibility, the  
Audit Committee reviewed a report from 
the External Auditor describing the 
arrangements to identify, report and 
manage any conflicts of interest, and 
reviewed and considered the extent of 
non-audit services provided by the 
External Auditor.
Effectiveness of the External Auditor 
The Audit Committee reviewed the 
External Auditor’s fulfilment of the agreed 
audit plan and variations therefrom; 
reports highlighting the major issues that 
arose during the course of the audit; and 
feedback from the businesses, evaluating 
the performance of each audit team.
Engagement of the External Auditor
The External Auditor is engaged to express 
an audit opinion on the truth and fairness  
of the Financial Statements. The audit 
includes the review and testing of the 
system of internal financial controls and  
the data contained in the Financial 
Statements to the extent necessary.
As reported last year, and in line with  
the changes made to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code in 2012 (which 
recommended that the external audit  
is put out to tender at least every ten  
years), PwC were selected as the 
Company’s External Auditor for the  
year ending 31 December 2017 and  
were duly appointed at the 2017 AGM.
In order to protect independence and 
objectivity and provide fresh challenge  
to the business, the External Auditor 
periodically changes the audit partners  
at a Group, divisional and country level,  
in accordance with professional and 
regulatory standards. Such changes are 
carefully planned to ensure that the  
Group benefits from staff continuity 
without incurring undue risk of inefficiency. 
The External Auditor is required to rotate  
the lead partner every five years, and such 
changes will be carefully planned to ensure 
business continuity without undue risk or 
inefficiency. The current audit partner is 
Nicholas Stevenson.
The Audit Committee has been kept 
up-to-date with the development of new 
EU-wide regulations concerning audit 
tenure and the longevity of audit firm 
relationships with companies they audit. 
The Company will continue to consider  
on a regular basis any potential benefits 
from tendering the audit process having 
regard, in particular, to the importance of 
audit quality or the continued independence 
of the External Auditor . There are no 
contractual obligations in place that restrict 
the Company’s choice of statutory auditor .
Non-audit services policy
The Audit Committee believes that it is 
important to maintain the objectivity and 
independence of the External Auditor by 
minimising its involvement in projects of  
a non-audit nature. It is, however, also 
acknowledged that, due to its detailed 
understanding of the Company’s business, 
it may sometimes be necessary to involve 
the External Auditor in non-audit related 
work, principally comprising further 
assurance services relating to due  
diligence and other duties carried out  
in respect of acquisitions, disposals,  
tax services (outside the EU) and other 
services. The Audit Committee reviewed 
and agreed a new policy reflecting best 
practice in relation to the engagement of 
the External Auditor to supply non-audit 
services with defined parameters and 
approval requirements in relation to any 
such appointments.
The Audit Committee Chairman is 
authorised by the Company to engage the 
External Auditor on non-audit related work 
where the fees per project are not 
considered to be significant, provided that 
the annual aggregate of non-audit related 
fees shall not to exceed 70% of the 
average of the fees paid in the last three 
consecutive financial years, without the 
approval of the Committee. The External 
Auditor may not be engaged to provide  
a non-audit service when the objectives  
of the service would be regarded by  
a reasonable and informed third party  
as conflicting with the objectives of the 
external audit. 
Details of the fees paid to KPMG to  
April 2017 , and afterwards PwC up until  
31 December 2017 , can be found in note  
2 to the Financial Statements on pages  
132 to 134, which includes fees paid to the 
External Auditor and its network firms for 
audit services, audit-related services and 
non-audit services.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE Internal control and internal audit
The Audit Committee reviewed the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
controls and disclosures made in the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements, 
and takes responsibility for reviewing the 
Group’s internal controls through its 
engagement with the Group Assurance 
function. The Group Head of Assurance  
is responsible for providing assurances  
as to the adequacy of internal controls 
throughout the Company and attends 
each Audit Committee meeting, presenting 
regular reports which included the 
consideration of any issues relating to the 
status of internal controls and potential  
risks, and assessed the progress of actions  
in response to any identified concerns.
The Audit Committee agreed the  
annual internal audit plan, which is drawn 
up by the Group Head of Assurance on  
a risk-based approach across a broad 
section of the Company’s activities. The 
Audit Committee reviewed any significant 
findings from internal control audits 
undertaken during the year , to ensure they are 
appropriately investigated, and necessary 
actions have been taken to address and 
rectify any weaknesses identified. 
In preparation for their audit activities,  
the new External Auditor carried out a 
review of the Company’s existing IT systems 
and concluded that, in keeping with the 
practice adopted by the previous External 
Auditor, the external audit approach 
would continue to be a fully substantive 
one, with a greater focus on detailed 
sample testing rather than full reliance  
on automated processes and controls.
The impact of these findings means  
that there are some additional risks  
the business faces. The findings across 
applications supports the current IT 
strategy already instigated to improve  
the IT control environment.
Having regard to the findings of the 
internal control audits presented during 
the year, the report of the external 
specialist resource and the report of the 
External Auditor, the Audit Committee 
was satisfied that the Company maintains 
an appropriate and effective control system.
As reported in last year’s Report of the 
Audit Committee, while Essentra has a 
well-established internal audit function, 
potential opportunities for improvements 
to deliver additional value to the respective 
businesses and to support change 
management were identified. Specialist 
external resource was engaged to conduct 
a comprehensive review of the internal 
audit function, in order to benchmark 
Essentra against best practice and to 
recommend potential improvements to 
deliver a capability aligned with FTSE 250 
upper quartile best practice.
The Audit Committee prioritised the 
development of a structured programme  
to drive the implementation of the effective 
recommendations and improvements 
identified by specialist external resource. 
As detailed in the Audit Committee 
Chairman’s Letter on pages 74 to 75, the 
best practice objective endorsed by the 
Audit Committee during 2017 envisages 
the development of the existing internal  
audit function into an integrated risk 
assurance capability by 2020. 
Risk management processes  
and practices 
In addition to the work on internal  
audit, the Audit Committee reviewed  
the effectiveness of the Company’s risk 
management activities as assessed  
by expert external consultant. 
The Audit Committee’s discussions and 
considerations on risk extended beyond 
enterprise risk into business continuity 
management, as the Company assessed 
the quality of its existing practices.  
A new policy and framework for the 
effective management of business 
continuity management risk was endorsed 
by the Audit Committee, and it is anticipated 
that during the course of 2018 it will assess 
the outputs from the testing of newly-
developed business continuity plans. 
Further details on the risk management 
initiatives reviewed by the Audit Committee 
can be found on pages 40 to 49 in the 
Management of Principal Risks Report.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN’S LETTER
Dear Shareholder, 
As Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee I am pleased to present  
our Remuneration Report for the 
financial year ended 31 December 2017 . 
Key principles
There are three key principles that have 
underpinned our approach this year:
 > Linking reward to the new strategy 
The Remuneration Committee agreed 
with the Chief Executive to emphasise 
the incentive system to support the 
stability agenda and strategy 
development. This will include recognising 
the importance of cash in the early 
stages of the recovery and use the 
reward policy to reinforce the cultural 
shift to achieve this. We also discussed 
the importance of a capital return 
measure which we heard from 
shareholders was important to them. 
This now forms part of our new policy 
and is already reflected in the Company’s 
Key Performance Indicators on pages 20 
to 21 and is most likely to be implemented 
in the 2019 Long Term Incentive Plan 
(“LTIP”).
 > Ensuring targets are appropriately 
stretching  
We recognise past outcomes have 
demonstrated that Essentra’s policy 
delivers a wide range of outcomes  
linked to performance and we want to 
continue this policy. We believe we have 
set stretching targets which will drive 
the recovery in the life of the policy.
 > Ensuring we have the right reward 
tools to support Paul Forman in 
attracting and developing the team 
around him 
The Remuneration Committee has 
worked with the Chief Executive in 
ensuring he is able to attract talent into 
the business. In addition, the bonus 
structure for the Executives covers  
c. 180 managers, not just the Executive 
Directors, thus enabling the Chief 
Executive to focus his senior team on 
achieving the right outcomes in driving  
the recovery. The personal objectives for 
the senior management throughout the 
Company were focused on delivering  
the outcomes that supported stability 
and strategy development.
Summary of key points
2017 saw widespread stability restored  
to Essentra and the development of  
a new strategy for the Company. The 
remuneration outcomes for the year 
reflect the performance of the Company 
during this period;
 > Our new Chief Executive, Paul Forman, 
was appointed in January 2017 on  
a salary of £625,000 per annum 
 > Paul Forman has chosen not to take  
a salary increase with effect from  
1 April 2018. The salary increase that  
had been recommended to the Board 
by the Remuneration Committee was in 
line with the average increase provided  
to the wider UK workforce
 > The single figure for Paul Forman as 
Chief Executive for 2017 is £1,267 ,000. 
This is the first year for which Paul 
Forman was Chief Executive and  
as a result no long-term incentives 
vested in the year
 > The annual bonus outcomes for 2017 
were for the Chief Executive 48% of 
maximum and for the Group Finance 
Director 41% of maximum. The levels  
of bonuses reflect the restoration of 
stability, the development of the new 
strategy and the performance of 
Essentra during the year
 > No LTIP awards vested in the year  
in line with three-year performance
 > Our proposed new Remuneration Policy 
is straightforward and updated. It will 
be put to our shareholders for their 
approval at the AGM in April 2018

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN’S LETTER Rewarding performance in 2017
Following a challenging year in 2016,  
2017 saw widespread stability restored to 
Essentra – as well as the development and 
communication of a new strategy for  
the Company – as set out in the Chief 
Executive’s Review on pages 10 to 17 . 
The Remuneration Committee set stretching 
targets for the year based on the key 
performance indicators for the Company. 
The management of cash is vital to 
delivering our new strategy, and the Net 
Working Capital target set for the year was 
exceeded. Notwithstanding the significant 
progress made during 2017 , the targets for 
Adjusted Operating Profit and Adjusted Net 
Income for the 2017 annual bonus were not 
achieved. This was largely due to a shortfall 
in Health & Personal Care Packaging, owing 
to the profit drop-through impact from 
lower revenue, a material operating loss at 
our Newport cartons facility, and the impact 
of hurricane Maria on our two sites in Puerto 
Rico – together with a less profitable revenue 
and segment mix in Tapes. The Remuneration 
Committee believes that the overall annual 
bonus outcomes for the Executive Directors 
shown below are a balanced reflection of 
what has been achieved in 2017 . 
The performance targets for the 2015 to 
2017 LTIP awards were not met and these 
awards lapsed in full.
More information on the financial and 
operating performance of Essentra in  
2017 is set out on pages 22 to 39 in the 
Strategic Report.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN’S LETTER Aligning pay and strategy –  
2018 Remuneration Policy and  
shareholder approval
The current Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
Report was approved by our shareholders 
at the AGM in 2015. We are required by law 
to put a new Policy to our shareholders  
for approval three years later at the  
2018 AGM.
 > Strategy alignment  
Since his appointment in January  
2017 , Paul Forman has completed  
a full strategic review of the Company. 
The results of that review were set  
out during our Capital Markets Day  
on 28 July 2017 . The strategy review 
emphasised that Essentra’s future 
success will be driven by a focus on 
restoring stability and delivering 
consistent growth in a sustainable and 
profitable manner . The clear priorities  
of our new strategy are reflected in  
our straightforward updated 
Remuneration Policy.
 > Shareholder consultation 
We have proactively engaged with our 
major shareholders and proxy voting 
agencies on the updated Remuneration 
Policy prior to publication. 
 > Summary of key changes 
The key proposed changes in our 
updated Policy are summarised below 
with full details set out on pages 86  
to 96. These changes bring our Policy  
in line with current mainstream market 
practice and are consistent with our 
new corporate strategy.
Policy change Rationale for change and implementation in 2018
Amended approach 
to LTIP awards
Annual LTIP awards will be calculated as a percentage of salary. This will replace the non-market standard 
feature of the 2015 Policy Report whereby the former Chief Executive and Group Finance Director received  
an award over a fixed number of LTIP shares each year.
Extended LTIP 
release date
LTIP awards granted to Executive Directors will be released five years after grant. Performance will be 
measured over an initial three-year period and then there will be a new additional two-year holding period.
Amended LTIP 
performance 
conditions
LTIP awards may be subject to a combination of relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”), Earnings Per Share 
(“EPS”), cumulative adjusted operating cash flow and a capital return measure. The addition of cash flow and 
capital return as potential measures reflect our evolving strategic priorities and feedback from our shareholders. 
After careful consideration the Remuneration Committee has decided that 2018 LTIP awards will be subject  
to a combination of relative TSR, EPS and cash flow measures. The Remuneration Committee will most likely 
introduce a capital return measure for LTIP awards to be made in 2019 and subsequent years. In the interests 
of simplicity, we would try to have no more than three measures in any one award.
Amended approach 
to salary reviews
Executive Director salaries will be reviewed on an annual basis in April each year. This will replace the current, 
non-market standard approach whereby the former Chief Executive’s and Group Finance Director’s salaries 
were fixed throughout the Policy period. 
Reduced future 
pension provision
The revised Policy Report includes a commitment to reduce the maximum level of pension provision for any 
future Executive Director appointments to 20% of salary compared to the current 25% of salary maximum.
Amended minimum 
shareholding 
guideline 
Executive Directors will be expected to build up a minimum shareholding worth 200% of salary over six years. 
This is consistent with the Remuneration Committee’s assessment of a reasonable period over which the 
Executive Directors should be expected to reach the guideline target, given the level of annual LTIP awards 
that will be made. This is a reduction from the previous shareholder requirements and reflects the relatively 
recent appointments of the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director. Since Paul Forman’s appointment  
he has invested personally in the Company and has already made good progress in building his personal 
shareholding in Essentra.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN’S LETTER 2017 LTIP award
As outlined in our 2016 Remuneration 
Report, we delayed the granting of LTIP 
awards in 2017 until after the completion 
of our new Chief Executive’s strategic 
review. This was to ensure that the awards 
would be appropriately aligned with our 
revised strategy and the updated Policy 
described above.
 > As disclosed in the 2016 Remuneration 
Report, our new Chief Executive 
received a 2017 LTIP award over shares 
of 200% of salary (which is lower than 
the 300% of salary LTIP award made 
each year to our former Chief 
Executive). He also received a one-off 
recruitment award of shares of 100% of 
salary to compensate him for incentives 
forgone when he left his previous 
employer. The Group Finance Director 
received a 2017 LTIP award over shares 
of 150% of salary. Granting an LTIP 
award at a level linked to his salary,  
rather than as a fixed number of shares, 
represents a change from the approach 
envisaged in our 2016 Remuneration 
Report but is consistent with our 
updated Policy and the approach we 
adopted for 2017 LTIP awards 
throughout the Company. 
 > Given the importance of the generation 
of cash in the successful execution of 
our new strategy, LTIP awards granted in 
2017 are partially subject to an adjusted 
operating cash flow measure in addition 
to the previous relative TSR and EPS 
measures. 
 > Anticipating our updated Policy from 
2018, the 2017 LTIP awards granted  
to the Chief Executive and the Group 
Finance Director are subject to a 
three-year performance period, plus  
an additional two-year holding period. 
Full details of these awards are shown  
on pages 100 to 101. 
2018 pay decisions
The annual base salaries of the Executive 
Directors will be reviewed now in April each 
year. The Chief Executive, chose not to 
take the recommended salary increase 
with effect from 1 April 2018. The salary 
increase that had been recommended  
to the Board by the Remuneration 
Committee for both Executive Directors 
was in line with the average increase 
provided to the wider UK workforce.  
The salary of the Group Finance Director 
will increase by £9,700 from April 2018  
to £369,700 pa.
The structure of the 2018 annual bonus 
plan and 2018 LTIP awards for Executive 
Directors will be broadly unchanged from 
2017 although the Remuneration 
Committee has decided to drop Adjusted 
Net Income as a separate measure in the 
bonus plan, in order to simplify and focus 
our approach. Adjusted Operating Profit 
will therefore now account for 50% of the 
2018 annual bonus opportunity. 
The LTIP award for the Chief Executive will 
be 200% of salary and the LTIP award for 
the Group Finance Director will be 150%  
of salary (as applied at the start of the last 
Policy period in 2015).

Committee membership
I would like to thank my colleagues on the Remuneration Committee for their work this year. Terry Twigger will be retiring as a Director 
from Essentra following the 2018 AGM and as such will be relinquishing his appointment on the Remuneration Committee, and I would 
like to thank him for his contribution over the years. I am delighted that Ralf K. Wunderlich was appointed to the Remuneration 
Committee effective from 1 March 2018.
Conclusion
I hope you will find this report to be clear and helpful in understanding our remuneration practices and that you will be supportive  
of the resolutions relating to remuneration at the AGM. As ever, the Remuneration Committee welcomes any questions or comments  
from shareholders.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN’S LETTER REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT
Our Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
Report (“the Policy Report”) sets out 
the policies under which the Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors are 
remunerated. The Policy Report is 
designed to be in full compliance with 
the requirements of the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013, the UK Corporate 
Governance Code as issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council and  
the Listing Rules. 
The current Policy Report was approved  
by shareholders at the 2015 AGM and, 
therefore, an updated Policy Report is 
required by law to be approved by 
shareholders at the 19 April 2018 AGM.  
The current Policy Report can be found  
in full in the Essentra Annual Report 2014, 
a copy of which can be obtained from  
the Company’s registered office or 
downloaded from www.essentraplc.com.
As outlined in the Remuneration Committee 
Chair’s letter, the Remuneration Committee 
has reviewed the continued appropriateness 
of the current Policy Report in the context  
of the Company’s corporate strategy 
following the appointment of Paul Forman 
as Chief Executive. Following that review, 
shareholder approval will be sought at the 
19 April 2018 AGM for the updated Policy 
Report set out below. Subject to 
shareholder approval, the updated Policy 
Report will take effect immediately after 
the 19 April 2018 AGM and will apply to  
the 2018 financial year.
The key changes in the updated Policy 
Report are outlined in the Remuneration 
Committee Chairman’s Letter. The updated 
Policy Report also contains a number of 
minor clarificatory changes and, where 
relevant, updated terminology to reflect 
our current strategic priorities.
Remuneration Policy Report
This section of the Remuneration Report 
will be subject to a binding shareholder 
vote at the 2018 AGM.
Overview
The Remuneration Committee determines 
and recommends to the Board the 
framework for the remuneration of the 
Executive Directors, Company Secretary  
and the Chairman of the Board. The 
remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors 
is the responsibility of the Board as a whole. 
No Director is involved in determining or 
voting on their own remuneration.
The Chief Executive’s remuneration 
proposals for the other members of the 
Group Management Committee (“GMC”) 
are reviewed by the Remuneration 
Committee, and recommendations as 
regards those proposals are made to  
the Board.
The Remuneration Committee also  
takes note of the remuneration policy  
as detailed by the Chief Executive in 
respect of other levels of management  
in the Company, and makes such 
recommendations to the Chief Executive 
as the Remuneration Committee deems 
appropriate. The Remuneration Committee 
has regard to the proposed remuneration 
policy for other management and 
employees across the Group, when 
determining recommendations on 
remuneration for the Executive Directors 
and other senior executives.
The Remuneration Committee places 
significant focus on and spends 
considerable time reviewing the risks 
surrounding the Company’s existing 
remuneration policies on an annual basis 
and has determined that there are no 
significant concerns with the structure  
or operation of the remuneration policy.
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT The Remuneration Committee’s main 
responsibilities are to:
 > Develop the Company’s Remuneration 
Policy for the Executive Directors, the 
Company Secretary and other senior 
executives, covering basic salary,  
bonus, long-term incentives, retirement 
provisions and other benefits
 > Strike an appropriate balance between; 
(i) the fixed and variable; and (ii) the 
cash and equity-related components  
of total remuneration packages
 > Review and determine the terms  
of employment and remuneration  
of the individual Executive Directors, 
including any specific retirement or 
severance terms
 > Determine the remuneration of the 
Chairman of the Board
 > Establish and review the operation  
of any employee share plans, including 
the granting of awards, the setting  
and testing of performance conditions 
and exercising of any awards under 
long-term incentive plans
 > Select, appoint and determine the 
terms of reference for independent 
consultants to advise the Remuneration 
Committee on remuneration matters
In determining the policy for the Executive 
Directors, the Remuneration Committee’s 
key objectives are to:
 > Ensure that senior executives’ 
remuneration is designed so as to 
attract, retain and motivate high 
quality executives in a manner that 
aligns their remuneration with the 
interests of shareholders and other 
stakeholders, particularly in the design 
of the performance-related elements  
of their remuneration packages and 
their shareholding guidelines
 > Promote the achievement of both the 
Company’s annual and longer-term 
strategic objectives. The Remuneration 
Committee considers the alignment  
of Company performance and the 
remuneration of its senior executives, 
including the Executive Directors, to be 
of the utmost importance. It believes 
that senior executives should be highly 
rewarded (on a market-competitive 
basis) for the delivery of stretching goals 
but should also receive reduced rewards 
when the business does not perform  
to expectations
 > Encourage Executive Directors to act in 
a fair and responsible manner without 
unnecessary risk taking having regard  
to the long-term performance of  
the Company
The Remuneration Committee considers  
all elements of the remuneration package  
as a whole. It looks to ensure that an 
appropriate balance is maintained 
between them so that the need for  
both short-term success and long-term 
sustainable growth is recognised. The 
Remuneration Committee also ensures 
that non-financial business measures  
and individual objectives reflect adequately 
the Company’s environmental, social and 
governance (“ESG”) responsibilities.
Summary of components of Executive 
Directors’ remuneration
The Remuneration Committee structures 
Executive Director remuneration in two 
distinct parts: (i) fixed remuneration of 
basic salary, pension and benefits; and  
(ii) variable performance-related 
remuneration in the form of cash bonuses, 
deferred share bonuses and long-term 
incentive arrangements.
Remuneration for Executive Directors  
is structured so that the variable 
performance-related pay element forms  
a significant portion of each package.  
The majority of total remuneration at the 
maximum performance level will derive 
from the Company’s long-term incentive 
arrangements. All incentives are designed 
to be aligned to delivery of Essentra’s 
strategic priorities.

Basic salary
To reflect the 
particular skills  
and experience  
of an individual  
and to provide  
a competitive  
basic salary.
Generally reviewed annually with any 
increase normally taking effect from  
1 April although the Remuneration 
Committee may award increases at 
other times of the year if it considers  
it appropriate. The review takes into 
consideration a number of factors, 
including (but not limited to) :
 > The individual Director’s role, 
experience and performance
 > Business performance
 > Pay and conditions elsewhere in  
the Group
 > Market data for comparable roles  
in appropriate pay comparators
No absolute maximum has been set  
for Executive Director base salaries. 
Any annual increase in salaries is at the 
discretion of the Committee taking into 
account the factors stated in this table 
and the following principles: 
 > Salaries would typically be increased 
at a rate consistent with the average 
salary increase (in percentage of 
salary terms) for permanent UK 
employees. 
 > Larger increases may be considered 
appropriate in certain circumstances 
(including, but not limited to, a change 
in an individual’s responsibilities or in 
the scale of their role or in the size and 
complexity of the Group) . 
 > Larger increases may also be 
considered appropriate if a Director 
has been initially appointed to the 
Board at a lower than typical salary.
Not applicable.

Annual bonus
To ensure the 
delivery of 
Company 
performance-
related objectives, 
and to aid 
retention and to 
align Directors’ 
interests with those 
of the Company’s 
shareholders.
One half of the total annual bonus is paid 
in cash shortly after the announcement 
of the annual results.
The other half is deferred into shares in 
the Deferred Annual Share Bonus (“the 
DASB”) which will normally vest after 
three years subject to continued service.
Performance is assessed against 
measures and targets which are 
established on an annual basis by  
the Remuneration Committee.  
As performance increases so does the 
percentage payable up to the maximum. 
The bonus is subject to malus and 
clawback provisions for a period of  
three years following the determination 
of the bonus. Circumstances in which 
these provisions could be applied by  
the Remuneration Committee are 
material misstatement in the Company’s 
Financial Statements, error in assessing 
the performance conditions, serious 
misconduct by an individual or serious 
reputational damage to the company  
or a relevant business unit.
An additional payment (in the form  
of cash or shares) may be made in 
respect of shares which vest under 
deferred awards to reflect the value  
of dividends which would have been  
paid on those shares during the vesting 
period (this payment may assume  
that dividends had been reinvested in 
Company shares on a cumulative basis) .
Chief Executive – 150% of basic salary.
Other Executive Directors – 125% of  
basic salary.
The bonus will be based on 
performance assessed over 
one year using appropriate 
financial, strategic and 
individual performance 
measures.
The majority of the bonus  
will normally be determined by 
measure(s) of the Company’s 
financial performance. 
The remainder of the bonus 
will be based on financial, 
strategic or operational 
measures appropriate to  
the individual Director. 
The selected measures for the 
next financial year are set out 
below in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration on page 105.
No more than 20% of each 
financial measure will vest  
at threshold performance.
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT Policy table
Purpose and link

Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
To drive the 
long-term delivery 
of the Company’s 
strategic 
objectives, aid 
retention and to 
align Directors’ 
interests with those 
of the Company’s 
shareholders.
An annual award of performance  
share awards usually with a three-year 
performance and additional two-year 
holding period.
Awards are subject to malus and 
clawback provisions for a period of three 
years following the vesting of the awards. 
Circumstances in which these provisions 
could be applied by the Remuneration 
Committee are material misstatement  
in the Company’s Financial Statements, 
error in assessing the performance 
conditions, serious misconduct by  
an individual or serious reputational  
damage to the Company or a relevant 
business unit.
An additional payment (in the form of 
cash or shares) may be made in respect 
of shares which vest under LTIP awards  
to reflect the value of dividends which 
would have been paid on those shares 
during the period up to the release of  
the shares (this payment may assume 
that dividends had been reinvested in 
Company shares on a cumulative basis) .
An award to any Executive Director  
would be limited to a maximum of  
300% of salary.
Vesting will be subject to 
performance conditions  
as determined by the 
Remuneration Committee  
on an annual basis. 
The performance conditions 
will usually be some 
combination of relative  
TSR, adjusted EPS, adjusted 
cumulative operating cash 
flow and a capital return 
measure although the 
Remuneration Committee  
will retain discretion to include 
alternative performance 
measures which are aligned  
to the corporate strategy. 
The Remuneration Committee 
may adjust the weightings of 
the performance conditions 
for each award although 
usually each condition would 
have a weighting in the range 
of 20% – 40% of the award. 
Performance will usually  
be measured over a three-
year period.
Up to 25% of each element 
vests at threshold performance, 
usually rising on a straight-line 
basis for performance up to 
the maximum level for full 
payment. Below threshold 
performance, that element  
of the award will not vest.

All Employee Plans
To create 
alignment of 
employees’ 
interests with those 
of shareholders 
and an awareness 
of the Company’s 
share price 
performance.
Under the UK Sharesave, employees 
(including Executive Directors) are invited 
to enter a savings contract of three years 
or five years, whereby the proceeds can 
be used towards the exercise of an option 
granted at the time they participate.  
The option price can be up to a 20% 
discount on the share price at the time 
invitations to participate are issued.
An equivalent US Plan is operated in  
a similar manner to the UK plan.
For the UK plan, shares worth up to the 
value of the savings an Executive Director 
agrees to make over the saving period at 
the previously agreed option price. The 
savings amount is subject to the HMRC 
limit, currently £500 per month.
The US Plan is limited to the monthly 
dollar equivalent of the UK Sharesave 
plan and an option price of up to a  
15% discount.
No performance conditions 
apply to All Employee Plans.
Pension
To provide 
cost-effective 
long-term benefits 
comparable with 
similar roles in 
similar companies.
A contribution to a defined contribution 
plan or paid as a cash supplement.
Any future Executive Director 
appointment will have a maximum 
pension provision of 20% of salary.
The current Executive Directors have 
pension provision of 25% of salary  
(Chief Executive) and 20% of salary 
(Group Finance Director).
Not applicable.
Other benefits
To provide 
cost-effective 
benefits 
comparable with 
similar roles in 
similar companies.
Other benefits include medical expenses, 
life insurance, and a company car or cash 
allowance. 
The Remuneration Committee may vary 
these benefits from time to time to suit 
business needs, but they will be provided 
on broadly similar terms to those offered 
to other Group employees.
Executive Directors are entitled to 
reimbursement of reasonable expenses.
There is no overall maximum as  
the level of benefits depends on the 
annual cost of providing individual 
items in the relevant local market  
and the individual’s specific role.
Not applicable.

Shareholding requirement
To align the  
interests of 
Executive Directors 
and shareholders, 
encourage a focus 
on long-term 
performance and 
risk management.
These shareholding guidelines are  
to be built up over six years from date  
of appointment.
The Remuneration Committee will review 
progress towards the guidelines on an 
annual basis, and has the discretion to 
adjust the guidelines in what it feels are 
appropriate circumstances.
The guideline minimum level for 
Executive Directors is 200% of salary. 
Non-Executive Directors are encouraged 
to hold a minimum of 7 ,500 shares.
Not applicable.
Non-Executive Directors
To attract 
high-calibre 
Non-Executive 
Directors with the 
relevant experience 
and skills.
A basic fee is payable to all Non-Executive 
Directors with supplementary fees for 
those with additional responsibilities, 
such as acting as Senior Independent 
Director or chairing a Board Committee.
Fees are reviewed periodically with 
reference to market levels in companies 
of a comparable size and complexity,  
and taking account of the responsibilities 
and time commitment of each role.
No Non-Executive Director participates  
in the Group’s incentive arrangements  
or pension plan or receives any other 
benefits other than where travel to the 
Company’s registered office is recognised 
as a taxable benefit in which case a 
Non-Executive Director may receive the 
grossed-up costs of travel as a benefit. 
Non-Executive Directors are entitled to 
reimbursement of reasonable expenses.
Fees for the current year are stated in 
the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Fee increases may be greater than those 
of the wider workforce in any particular 
year as they reflect changes to 
responsibilities and time commitments 
and the periodic nature of any increases. 
A resolution to amend the Company’s 
Articles of Association for aggregate 
annual fees for “Non-Executive 
Directors” fees to be increased to 
£1,000,000 will be proposed at the  
2018 AGM.
Not applicable.

Remuneration Committee discretion
The Remuneration Committee will operate 
the annual bonus plan and long-term 
incentive plans according to their respective 
rules and will be consistent with normal 
market practice, the Listing Rules and HMRC 
rules where relevant, including flexibility  
in a number of regards. These include:
 > When to make awards and payments
 > How to determine the size of an  
award or a payment, or when and  
how much of an award should vest
 > Who receives an award or payment
 > How to deal with a change of control  
or restructuring of the Group
 > Whether a participant is a good /  
bad leaver for incentive plan purposes,  
and whether and what proportion of 
awards vest and timing of delivery
 > How and whether an award (or an 
award of shares outlined in this Policy 
that is yet to be granted) may be 
adjusted in certain circumstances  
(eg, rights issues, corporate restructuring, 
events and special dividends)
 > What the weighting, measures and 
targets should be for the annual bonus 
plan and LTIP from year to year
The Remuneration Committee also retains 
the ability within the Remuneration Policy 
to adjust the targets and / or set different 
measures and alter weightings for the 
annual bonus plan, and to adjust targets 
for the LTIP if events occur which cause  
it to determine that the conditions are unable 
to fulfil their original intended purpose.
The Remuneration Committee may make 
minor amendments to the Remuneration 
Policy set out in this Remuneration Policy 
Report (for regulatory, exchange control, 
tax or administrative purposes or to  
take account of a change in legislation) 
without obtaining shareholder approval  
for that amendment.
Existing awards
The Remuneration Committee reserves  
the right to make any remuneration 
payments and / or payments for loss of 
office (including exercising any discretions 
available to it in connection with such 
payments) notwithstanding that they are 
not in line with the Remuneration Policy 
2015 (set out above) where the terms of 
the payment were agreed: (i) before the 
2015 AGM (the date the Company’s first 
shareholder-approved Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy came into effect);  
(ii) before the Remuneration Policy set out 
above came into effect, provided that the 
terms of the payment were consistent 
with the shareholder approved Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy in force at the time 
they were agreed; or (iii) at a time when 
the relevant individual was not a Director 
of the Company and, in the opinion of the 
Remuneration Committee, the payment 
was not in consideration for the individual 
becoming a Director of the Company.  
For these purposes “payments” includes 
the Remuneration Committee satisfying 
awards of variable remuneration and, in 
relation to an award over shares, the terms 
of the payment are “agreed” at the time 
the award is granted.
Choice of performance measures  
and approach to target setting
The Remuneration Committee sets 
performance metrics under both the 
annual bonus plan and LTIP which are 
clearly aligned to the Group’s strategy  
and are usually part of its Key Performance 
Indicators (“KPIs”). Personal objective 
performance measures within the annual 
bonus are also directly linked to key 
strategic objectives. 
Targets are set at the start of each 
performance period by the Remuneration 
Committee taking into account relevant 
internal and external reference points and 
are designed to be appropriately stretching.
Remuneration mix 
The graph below demonstrates the 
potential remuneration mix for both  
of the Executive Directors in 2018 in three 
theoretical scenarios: minimum, meeting 
expectations and maximum.
Assumptions: 
 > Salary: received during 2018: Paul Forman 
£625,000; Stefan Schellinger £360,000 to  
31 March 2018 and £369,700 thereafter.
 > Pension: Paul Forman 25% of salary;  
Stefan Schellinger 20% of salary.
 > Benefits: 2017 reported taxable benefits. 
 > Bonus maximum of 150% of salary for  
Paul Forman and 125% of salary for  
Stefan Schellinger.
 > LTIP award of 200% of salary for Paul Forman 
and 150% of salary for Stefan Schellinger.
 > Meeting expectations scenario assumptions  
– 50% of annual bonus maximum paid and 
25% of LTIP award vests.
 > Maximum scenario assumptions – 100%  
of annual bonus maximum paid and 100%  
of LTIP award vests.
 > No share price growth or dividend  
accrual considered.
 > Sharesave awards have been ignored.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT New appointments
 > Basic salary 
Will be set based on relevant market 
data, experience and skills of the 
individual, internal relativities across the 
Company and the individual’s current 
basic salary. Any annual increase in 
salary for a new appointment would be 
at the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee and would typically be 
broadly consistent with the average salary 
increase for UK employees. However, 
larger increases may be considered 
appropriate in certain circumstances.  
For example, where new appointees have 
initial basic salaries set below market 
rates, any shortfall will be managed with 
phased increases (which may be greater 
than those offered to the wider workforce) 
over a period of two to three years, 
subject to their development in the role. 
 > Pension  
A contribution to a defined contribution 
plan or a cash supplement may be offered 
with the relevant maximum not exceeding 
the maximum in the Policy Table.
 > Other benefits  
As provided to current Executive Directors. 
Where necessary the Remuneration 
Committee may approve the payment  
of relocation expenses to facilitate 
recruitment, and flexibility is retained for 
the Company to pay for legal fees and 
other costs incurred by the individual in 
relation to their appointment.
 > Bonus 
The annual bonus described in the 
Remuneration Policy Report Table on 
page 89 will apply to a new appointee 
with the relevant maximum not 
exceeding that for the current Chief 
Executive; and, in the first year, being 
pro-rated to reflect the proportion of 
employment during the year. In the first 
year, the Remuneration Committee may 
set different performance measures and 
targets for the bonus to those of the 
other Executive Directors, depending on 
the timing and scope of any appointment. 
In order to facilitate recruitment  
the Remuneration Committee may 
compensate for any bonus forgone 
when the individual leaves their  
previous employer.
 > Share incentives  
New appointees will be granted awards 
under the LTIP up to the limit described  
in the Policy Table. An award may be made 
shortly following a new appointment.  
In the first year, the Remuneration 
Committee may set different performance 
measures and targets for the LTIP to 
those of the other Executive Directors, 
depending on the timing and scope  
of any appointment.
 > Buy-out awards  
To potentially facilitate the recruitment 
through the buy-out of existing awards 
and compensation arrangements from 
their current employer, the Remuneration 
Committee will retain the ability to make 
a one-off buy-out award. In doing so, the 
Remuneration Committee will take 
account of all relevant factors, including 
any performance conditions attached to 
incentive awards, the likelihood of those 
conditions being met, the proportion  
of the vesting / performance period 
remaining and the form of the award 
(eg, cash or shares). The overriding 
principle will be that any buy-out award 
should be of comparable commercial 
value to the compensation which has 
been forfeited. Buy-out awards will  
be made using existing incentive 
arrangements where possible, but it may 
be necessary to use the exemption under 
Listing Rule 9 .4.2. Shareholders will be 
informed of any such payments at the 
time of appointment.
 > In the case of internal appointments or 
appointments following the Company’s 
acquisition of or merger with another 
company or business, any variable pay 
element or legacy arrangements in 
respect of the prior role would normally 
be allowed to pay-out according to its 
terms, adjusted as relevant, to take into 
account the appointment. 
 > For external and new internal 
appointments, the Remuneration 
Committee may set lower share 
ownership guidelines, or permit  
a longer period for them to be met.
 > Non-Executive Directors 
In the event of the appointment  
of a new Non-Executive Director, 
remuneration arrangements will 
normally be in line with the structure  
set out in the Policy Table for Non-
Executive Directors. In the event that  
a Non-Executive Director is required  
to temporarily take on the role of an 
Executive Director, their remuneration 
may include any of the elements listed  
in the Policy Table for Executive Directors. 
Service contracts and exit payments
Service contracts normally continue until 
the Director’s agreed retirement date or 
such other date as the parties agree.
 > The policy for executive service 
contracts is that notice periods will 
normally not exceed 12 months. Paul 
Forman has a service contract dated 
2 January 2017 and Stefan Schellinger 
has a service contract dated 8 October 
2015, both with a notice period of 12 
months from either party. The service 
contracts for the Executive Directors are 
available for inspection by shareholders 
at each AGM and during normal 
business hours at the Company’s 
registered office.
 > The Remuneration Committee’s policy 
in relation to termination of service 
contracts is to apply an appropriate 
level of mitigation, having regard to all 
of the circumstances of the individual, 
the termination of employment, and to 
any legal advice received. The Company 
has the right to make a payment in lieu 
of notice (such payment being  
made based on salary and at the 
Remuneration Committee’s discretion 
as to the value of benefits), and any 
such payment may be made in  
monthly instalments at the Company’s 
discretion, with a requirement for  
the individual to make reasonable

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT endeavours to find alternative 
employment and may be reduced  
to take into account any sums earned 
during the payment period by way  
of employment elsewhere.
 > There are no enhanced provisions  
on a change of control.
 > In certain circumstances, such as  
gross misconduct, the Company may 
terminate employment immediately 
without notice or payment. 
 > The Remuneration Committee reserves 
the right to make any other payments  
in connection with a Director’s cessation 
of office or employment where the 
payments are made in good faith in 
discharge of an existing legal obligation 
(or by way of damages for breach of 
such an obligation) or by way of a 
compromise or settlement of any claim 
arising in connection with the cessation 
of a Director’s office or employment. 
Any such payments may include, but 
are not limited to, paying any fees for 
outplacement assistance and / or the 
Director’s legal and / or professional 
advice fees in connection with his 
cessation of office or employment.
 > The service contract for any new 
appointment would be on a similar  
basis to that described above.
 > The payment of any annual bonus will 
be at the Remuneration Committee’s 
discretion, based on the individual 
circumstances and would usually be 
pro-rated for the period of service  
and may be paid entirely in cash. In 
determining the level of bonus to be 
paid, the Remuneration Committee 
may, at its discretion, take into account 
performance up to the date of cessation 
or over the financial year as a whole 
based on appropriate performance 
measures as determined by the 
Remuneration Committee.
 > Under the rules of the LTIP , outstanding 
awards may vest if a participant leaves 
for specified reasons, including injury, 
disability, ill health, death, retirement 
with the Company’s agreement, 
redundancy, or the business or company 
in which the participant is employed 
ceasing to be part of the Group or  
on a change of control. In these 
circumstances a participant’s award 
vests on an appropriate time pro rata 
basis (unless the Remuneration 
Committee decides it is inappropriate  
to do so) subject to the satisfaction of 
the relevant performance criteria at the 
normal vesting date with the balance  
of the award lapsing. The Remuneration 
Committee has discretion to determine 
that the performance period should end 
on the date of cessation of employment 
if it feels this is appropriate. If, however, 
the termination of employment is not 
for one of the specified reasons, and  
the Remuneration Committee does not 
exercise its discretion to allow an award 
to vest, a participant’s award lapses in 
full on date of cessation.
 > The DASB awards may vest if  
a participant leaves for specified 
reasons including death, the business  
or company in which the participant  
is employed ceasing to be part of the 
Group, retirement with the agreement 
of the Company or at the discretion of 
the Board. DASB awards will either vest 
on the normal vesting date or at the 
point of the participant leaving date  
if deemed a good leaver by the 
Remuneration Committee.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors do not  
have service contracts and do not 
participate in any Company pension,  
share or incentive schemes. In accordance 
with best practice, letters of appointment 
have been issued for all Non-Executive 
Directors for an initial period of three 
years, but may be terminated by either 
party with three months’ notice. No 
compensation is payable on termination, 
except for fees and expenses accrued  
to date. These letters are available for 
inspection by shareholders at each AGM 
and during normal business hours at the 
Company’s registered office.
Relationship between remuneration  
of Executive Directors and other 
employees
The Remuneration Committee is kept 
informed of pay and employment 
conditions in the wider Group and this is 
factored into deliberations when setting  
the Remuneration Policy for Executive 
Directors. The Group-wide salary increase 
budget and the proposed increase for UK 
based employees, or employees of such 
other jurisdiction within which the Executive 
Directors operate or reside, is considered  
by the Remuneration Committee when 
determining any basic salary increase for 
Executive Directors. 
As stated previously, the overall 
remuneration package for Executive 
Directors is structured so that the variable 
performance-related pay element forms a 
more significant portion compared to pay 
for other employees. This policy is to ensure 
there is a clear link between the individual 
and corporate performance achieved, the 
value this creates for shareholders and  
the overall reward to Executive Directors. 
The weighting of variable pay will vary 
throughout the Group based on the 
seniority of the individual, the role and 
specific responsibilities. The Essentra Annual 
Management Bonus Plan also provides  
a consistent approach for the Executive 
Directors and Managers within Essentra by 
aligning the same performance conditions 
for their bonus plans. 
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM
95
DIRECTORS’ REPORT | REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT The Board are awaiting the finalised views 
of the Corporate Governance Code to 
consider the most appropriate future 
approach to employee consultation on 
remuneration decisions. Essentra currently 
manages a number of employee forums 
including the European Information and 
Consultation forum, Diversity & Inclusion 
Steering Group and employee engagement 
focus groups. 
How the views of shareholders are 
taken into account
The Remuneration Committee has 
consulted with major shareholders and 
investor bodies in the past when material 
changes to the Policy have been proposed, 
and this approach will continue in the future 
with the overall aim to maintain an open 
and transparent dialogue. A thorough 
consultation process was undertaken with 
our major shareholders and representative 
bodies before this updated Policy  
Report was submitted for the approval  
of all shareholders.
External appointments
Essentra recognises its senior executives  
can benefit from serving in a personal 
capacity as Non-Executive Directors of 
non-Essentra Group companies. It is, at  
the same time, conscious of the corporate 
governance recommendations that 
Executive Directors should take account  
of the time commitment required by a 
non-executive position. Executive Directors 
are permitted to accept non-executive 
directorships offered by listed companies 
and other organisations, which provide 
industry experience or public service. Such 
outside appointments are subject to prior 
Board approval, taking into account existing 
duties, potential conflicts of interest and 
time commitments outside of Essentra’s 
responsibilities. Any fees earned from  
these roles may be retained by the 
Executive Director.

  Stefan Schellinger’s outstanding LTIP B, LTIP 2015 and DASB awards granted in 2013, 2014 and 2015 were all granted when he was a member  
of the Group Management Committee and before he was appointed as an Executive Director.
A total of 981,251 (2016: 894,904) share incentive awards under the LTIP 2015 and the DASB were granted during the year ended  
31 December 2017 to Executive Directors and other senior executives on the Group Management Committee.
LTIP awards included in the Total Single Remuneration Table (audited)
All LTIP awards (except for 2017) are subject half to a relative TSR performance condition and half to an adjusted EPS  
performance condition.
The TSR performance conditions are measured against the FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts) index at the beginning of the 
performance period, over a three-year performance period from the date of grant. 25% of the TSR element of the awards vests  
if Essentra is median ranked, increasing to 100% vesting if Essentra is upper quartile ranked.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION The adjusted EPS performance targets for April 2015 and April 2016 awards are 8.0% pa to 15.0% pa. 25% of the EPS element of the 
awards vests for achieving the lower target, increasing to 100% vesting for achieving the higher target. 
For the 2017 LTIP awards granted to the Executive Directors in 2017 , one third of the awards is subject to a TSR performance condition 
as stated above, one third is subject to an cumulative adjusted operating cash flow threshold of £226m, to a maximum cumulative 
adjusted operating cash flow of £276m and one third of the awards is subject to an adjusted EPS performance condition, with an 
adjusted EPS 2019 threshold of 27 .4p to a maximum of 32.0p.
The performance outturn for the LTIP awards included in the 2017 Total Single Remuneration Table is summarised below.
The LTIP B awards granted to Stefan Schellinger in April 2015 will vest in April 2018. The EPS performance period for these awards is 
complete. The TSR performance period will end in April 2018 so the figures below are estimates as at 31 December 2017 .

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION Implementation of Remuneration Policy for 2018 (unaudited)
Salary
Basic salary for each Executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the roles, responsibilities, 
performance experience of the individual and market movement. Salaries are reviewed in April each year and the budgeted pay 
increase for UK employees in 2018 is 2.7%.
Paul Forman has declined a pay increase for 2018 and therefore his basic salary will not increase.
Stefan Schellinger’s salary for 2018 will increase by £9,700 to £369,700. This is the first pay increase since Stefan’s appointment in 2015.

Annual salary effective from 1 April 2018 £625,000 £369,700
Annual salary effective from 1 April 2017 £625,000 £360,000
Benefits
Executive Directors are provided with the following benefits:
 > Car, fuel or car allowance
 > Private medical insurance with family level cover
 > Life insurance cover of four times basic salary
Pension
Paul Forman will receive a supplementary payment equal to 25% of annual salary to permit him to secure pension benefits. 
Stefan Schellinger will receive a supplementary payment of 20% of his basic salary to permit him to secure pension benefits.
Annual bonuses
Each year, the Remuneration Committee reviews the annual bonus, to ensure the performance measures and targets remain 
appropriate and aligned with the Company’s short-term strategy, while remaining within the appropriate risk profile.
Under the terms of the annual bonus arrangements for 2018, Paul Forman is potentially entitled to a maximum bonus of up to 150% 
of basic salary and Stefan Schellinger is potentially entitled to a maximum bonus of up to 125% of basic salary. Bonus payments are 
normally made one half in cash and one half in shares in the Company, the entitlement to such shares being deferred for three years, 
in accordance with the rules of the DASB. 
It is an important principle of Essentra’s pay philosophy that the structure of pay should complement and support business strategy. 
The Remuneration Committee has determined the performance measures for 2018 incentive plan that are consistent with current 
strategic priorities as shown below:
Performance criteria Weighting (%)
Adjusted Operating Profit 50.0
Net Working Capital 30.0
Personal objectives 20.0
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM
105
DIRECTORS’ REPORT | ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION The Remuneration Committee believes that Adjusted Operating Profit and Net Working Capital targets are commercially sensitive, and will 
not disclose the targets on a prospective basis. The targets and actual performance against them will be disclosed on a retrospective basis 
in the 2018 Remuneration Report.
In addition to the financial measures, the Remuneration Committee has also set personal performance targets for Paul Forman and Stefan 
Schellinger, which are designed to deliver progress by the Company towards its strategic objectives.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion, within a three-year period after the determination of the bonus, to withhold or recover 
annual cash bonuses or DASB awards through malus and clawback provisions in specified circumstances. These circumstances take into 
account where the original bonus was paid to a greater extent than it should have done, due to a material misstatement in the Company’s 
Financial Statements or due to an error in assessing the applicable performance conditions or if there has been serious misconduct by an 
individual or if there has been serious reputational damage to the Company or a relevant business unit.
Essentra LTIP
An award granted under LTIP consists of a conditional right to receive shares in the Company, subject to satisfaction of performance 
conditions. 
The following LTIP awards are intended to be granted to Executive Directors during 2018. 
Paul Forman Stefan Schellinger
The award to be granted in April 2018 as annual award 200% 150%
A share award under LTIP will not normally be exercisable before the third anniversary of its award and an additional two-year holding 
period, and may only be exercised to the extent that the applicable performance conditions have been satisfied. The awards are 
structured as nil cost options. 
For awards to be granted to the Executive Directors in 2018, one third of the awards will be subject to a TSR performance condition, 
one third will be subject to cash flow and one third of the awards will be subject to an adjusted EPS performance condition. The 
Remuneration Committee believes that these conditions provide appropriate alignment with the strategic priorities. In particular 
there will be a greater emphasis on balance sheet management. The TSR performance condition assesses Essentra’s TSR performance 
relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts) index. Performance is measured over three years from the 
time of grant. 25% of the TSR element vests for median performance, increasing on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting for upper 
quartile performance or above.
The Remuneration Committee’s determination of the targets for TSR, EPS and Cumulative Adjusted Operating Cash Flow 
performance measures are as follows:
Performance Conditions 
(25% vests at threshold; 100% vests at maximum)
Relative TSR Relative to FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts)
Threshold is median; maximum is upper quartile
Adjusted EPS 2018 - 2020 Threshold is 6%; maximum is 15%. 
Cumulative Adjusted Operating Cash Flow Threshold is £252m; maximum is £292m.
Awards granted under the LTIP 2015 are subject to malus and clawback provisions for a period of up to three years following the 
vesting date of the award. Potential circumstances in which the malus and clawback provisions may be applied are consistent with 
those applying to annual bonus awards as described above.

to allot shares for cash without first 
offering them to existing shareholders in 
proportion to their existing shareholdings. 
That approval expires at the end of the 
forthcoming AGM and resolutions 15 and 
16 in the Notice of AGM seeks to renew it.
As per previous years, the Company  
seeks a resolution which authorises 
disapplication of pre-emption rights in 
respect of up to an aggregate nominal 
amount of £3,286,978 (representing 
13,147 ,912 ordinary shares). This aggregate 
nominal amount represents approximately 
5% of the issued ordinary share capital of 
the Company (excluding treasury shares). 
In addition to the above Resolution,  
the Company seeks a Resolution which 
authorises disapplication of pre-emption 
rights in respect of up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £3,286,978 
(representing 13,147 ,912 ordinary shares)  
in connection with acquisitions and other 
capital investments as contemplated by 
the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of 
Principles. This aggregate nominal amount 
represents an additional 5% of the issued 
ordinary share capital of the Company 
(excluding treasury shares).
These authorities will expire at the 
conclusion of the following AGM or, if 
earlier, on 19 June 2019. The proposal 
conforms to the guidelines issued by the 
institutional investment protection bodies 
to ensure that existing shareholders’ 
interests are safeguarded.
Purchase of own shares
At the 2017 AGM, shareholders approved  
a special resolution to enable the Company 
to purchase its own shares. That approval 
expires at the end of the forthcoming AGM. 
At this year’s AGM, the Directors consider it 
expedient to seek shareholders’ approval to 
enable the Company to purchase, in the 
market, up to 10% of its issued share capital 
(excluding any treasury shares) for 
cancellation, or to be held in Treasury, such 
power to apply until the end of next year’s 
AGM (or if earlier, 19 June 2019) . In 
accordance with the requirements of the 
Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority, the minimum price (exclusive of 
expenses) which may be paid for a share is 
its nominal value and the maximum price 
(exclusive of expenses) for shares which may 
be paid is the highest of: (i) an amount 
equal to 105% of the average market value 
for a share for the five business days 
immediately preceding the date of the 
purchase; and (ii) the higher of the price of 
the last independent trade and the highest 
current independent bid on the trading 
venues where the purchase is carried out. 
The Directors have no present intention of 
exercising the authority to make market 
purchases, however the authority provides 
the flexibility to allow them to do so in the 
future. The Directors will only utilise this 
authority if satisfied that to do so would 
be in the best interests of the Company 
and its shareholders generally, and could 
be expected to result in an increase in 
earnings per share of the Company. 
During the financial year ending  
31 December 2017 , 116,027 ordinary shares 
were transferred out of Treasury by the 
Company to satisfy share options under 
the Company’s Sharesave and executive 
share incentive plans.
No dividends have been paid on shares 
while held in Treasury and no voting rights 
attach to the treasury shares.
Changes to aggregate annual limit of 
Director fees as set out in the Articles 
of Association
Article 86 of the Company’s Articles of 
Association limits the aggregate total  
fees which may be paid to Directors to 
£500,000 per annum, or such higher 
amount as may be decided by ordinary 
resolution of the Company. At this year’s 
AGM, shareholders will be asked to 
approve an increase to the level of this 
limit to £1,000,000 per annum in 
aggregate. This limit will cover the total 
annual fees paid to the Chairman and  
the Non-Executive Directors.
The Directors believe it is desirable to 
increase this limit to provide flexibility for 
any future increases in Director’s fees to 
attract the best Board members available. 
The increase would also provide flexibility 
for any increase in the number of 
Directors, thereby facilitating the effective 
review and management of the composition 
of the Board. Any remuneration policy as 
may be approved by the shareholders 
from time to time will continue to apply.  
If this increase is approved, the Directors 
would not anticipate needing to propose 
any further change for a number of years.
External Auditor
PricewaterhouseCoopers have expressed 
their willingness to continue to be appointed 
as External Auditor of the Company.  
Upon the recommendation of the Audit 
Committee, resolutions to appoint them  
as External Auditor and to authorise the 
Directors to determine their remuneration 
will be proposed at the AGM.
Recommendation
The Directors believe that the resolutions in 
the Notice of Annual General Meeting are 
in the best interests of the Company and its 
shareholders as a whole, and unanimously 
recommend that shareholders vote in 
favour of each resolution.
Derivatives
Information related to derivatives is 
included in the Accounting Policies on 
page 124 and in note 14.
Going concern statement
The Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company has 
adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable 
future and accordingly have adopted  
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION the going concern basis in preparing the 
consolidated Financial Statements. 
Information regarding the financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, 
liquidity position, and borrowing facilities 
are described in the Financial Review on 
pages 22 to 23. In addition, note 18 to the 
Financial Statements includes the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for 
managing its capital, its financial risk 
management objectives, details of its 
financial instruments and hedging 
activities and exposures to credit, market 
and liquidity risk. Cash balances and 
borrowings are detailed in note 21. Essentra 
is primarily funded by a series of US Private 
Placement Loan notes from various 
financial institutions. An $80m Loan note 
which was repaid in April 2017 was 
refinanced in November 2017 with three 
new Loan notes totalling $75m and the 
new Revolving Credit Facility of £375.0m. 
At 31 December 2017 available bank 
facilities totalled £374.2m (2016: £414.2m). 
The US Private Placement notes have 
original maturities ranging from seven and 
twelve years and the Revolving Credit 
Facility matures in November 2022. 
The Directors have prepared plans and 
forecasts for a period of at least twelve 
months from the date of signing these 
Financial Statements. Based on these, and 
taking into consideration the risks detailed 
in note 18, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company has 
adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable 
future, and accordingly have adopted  
the going concern basis in preparing the 
consolidated Financial Statements.  
This disclosure has been prepared in 
accordance with the Financial Reporting 
Council’s UK Corporate Governance Code.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of  
the Corporate Governance Code, the 
Directors have assessed the longer-term 
viability of the Group over the period to 
December 2020.
The assessment has been based on the 
Group’s strategy and implementation 
programme, balance sheet and financing 
position, and the potential impact of the 
key risks and uncertainties described 
above. The Group strategy has been 
translated into a three-year strategic plan 
comprising a one-year detailed budget 
and a financial forecast for the following 
two years. The plan will be subject to 
annual updates by management and 
review by the Board. As a consequence, 
the Directors have chosen a three-year 
time horizon for the Longer-Term Viability 
Statement (“LTVS”) as being an appropriate 
time frame for assessing the viability of 
the company. However, the Directors have 
also given due consideration to any 
potential risks beyond this time horizon 
In order to support the assessment of the 
viability, the Directors have considered the 
following realistic and plausible scenarios:
Scenario 1
Brexit (middle scenario) 
Packaging under performance by 10 - 15%
National catastrophic event
Scenario 2
Brexit (severe scenario) 
Packaging under performance by 10 - 15%
Supply chain single point failure  
– Nottingham Tapes
Scenario 3
Brexit (middle scenario)
Cyber event 
Supply chain single point failure  
– Nottingham Tapes
In addition to the modelling of the three 
scenarios, the Directors have also added  
a further stress test of the most severe 
scenario by aggregating the three scenarios.
In modelling the scenarios, the Directors 
have assumed that the individual risks are 
independent and there is therefore a very 
remote probability that the three risks in 
each scenario would all crystallise in the 
time period considered. 
In making the assessment, the Directors 
have made a number of assumptions  
and considerations:
 > Capital markets and bank funding will 
continue to be available over the period 
 > In the event of a major risk crystallising, 
the Company would take corrective 
capital action to preserve the cash 
resources of the firm 
 > Management would be in a position to 
implement effective mitigation action 
to reduce the impact a potential risk event
Based on the modelling undertaken, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue  
in operational existence and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period  
of the assessment.
Directors’ statement as to disclosure  
of information to the External Auditor
As required by section 418(2) of the 
Companies Act 2006, the Directors who 
were members of the Board at the time  
of approving this Report, having made 
enquiries of fellow Directors and of the 
external auditor, confirm that:
 > As far as each Director is aware, there  
is no relevant audit information of  
which the Company’s External Auditor  
is unaware
 > Each Director has taken all steps that  
they ought to have taken as a Director  
to ascertain any relevant audit 
information, and to ensure that the 
Company’s External Auditor is aware  
of that information
The Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, 
including the Report of the Remuneration 
Committee, were approved by the Board 
on 2 March 2018.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT | OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
Financial Statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulation.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare Financial Statements for each 
financial year . Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group Financial 
Statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”)  
as adopted by the European Union and 
Parent Company Financial Statements  
in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure 
Framework” , and applicable law) . In preparing 
the Group Financial Statements, the 
Directors have also elected to comply with 
IFRSs, issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (“IASB” ). Under company 
law the Directors must not approve the 
Financial Statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and 
Parent Company and of the profit or loss 
of the Group and Parent Company for 
that period. In preparing the Financial 
Statements, the Directors are required to:
 > Select suitable accounting policies  
and then apply them consistently
 > State whether applicable IFRS as 
adopted by the European Union and 
IFRS issued by IASB have been followed

subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the Financial

disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Group

as regards the Group Financial Statements,

United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of Financial Statements 
may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.

is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group and 
Parent Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy.

ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS a. Basis of preparation
The consolidated Financial Statements 
have been prepared and approved by the 
Directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union (“EU”) in accordance 
with EU law (IAS Regulation EC 1606 / 
2002) (“adopted IFRS”) and International 
Financial Reporting Standards as issued  
by the International Accounting Standards 
Board, and with those parts of the Companies 
Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS. The Company has elected to 
prepare its individual company Financial 
Statements in accordance with Financial 
Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework (“FRS 101”); these are presented 
on pages 170 to 181.
The Financial Statements are prepared 
under the historical cost convention except 
for derivatives which are stated at fair 
value and retirement benefit obligations 
which are valued in accordance with  
IAS 19 Employee Benefits. 
The preparation of Financial Statements 
that conform with adopted IFRS requires 
the use of estimates and assumptions  
that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities at the date of the 
Financial Statements and the reported 
amounts of income and expense during 
the reporting period. Although these 
estimates are based on management’s 
best knowledge of the amount, event or 
actions, actual results may ultimately 
differ from those estimates.
For the purposes of these Financial 
Statements “Essentra” or “the Group” 
means Essentra plc (“the Company”)  
and its subsidiaries.
The estimates and underlying assumptions 
are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions 
to accounting estimates are recognised in 
the period in which the estimate is revised 
and future periods if relevant.
On 25 August 2016, Essentra entered  
into a sale and purchase agreement with 
Filtration Group to dispose of the Group’s 
entire operations in Porous Technologies. 
The transaction completed in March 2017 . 
The results of the Porous Technologies 
business are presented as results from  
a discontinued operation in the income 
statement. The assets and liabilities of 
Porous Technologies have also been 
presented as held for sale on the balance 
sheet as at 31 December 2016.
The accounting policies used in the 
preparation of these Financial Statements 
are detailed below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all periods presented. 
Information regarding the financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, 
liquidity position, and borrowing facilities 
are described in the Financial Review on 
pages 22 to 23. In addition, note 18  
to the Financial Statements includes the 
Group’s objectives, policies and processes 
for managing its capital, its financial  
risk management objectives, details of  
its financial instruments and hedging 
activities and exposures to credit, market 
and liquidity risk. Cash balances and 
borrowings are detailed in note 21. 
Essentra is primarily funded by a series  
of US Private Placement Loan notes from 
various financial institutions. An $80m  
Loan note which was repaid in April 2017 
was refinanced in November 2017  
with three new Loan notes totalling $75m.  
A Revolving Credit Facility of £375m was 
made available upon completion of the 
November 2017 Loan note issuance.  
At 31 December 2017 available bank 
facilities totalled £374.2m (2016: £414.2m). 
The US Private Placement notes have 
original maturities ranging from seven  
and 12 years and the Revolving Credit 
Facility matures in November 2022. 
 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Directors have prepared plans and 
forecasts for a period of at least 12  
months from the date of signing these 
Financial Statements. Based on these,  
and taking into consideration the risks 
detailed in note 18, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company 
has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable 
future, and accordingly have adopted  
the going concern basis in preparing  
the consolidated Financial Statements.  
This disclosure has been prepared in 
accordance with the Financial Reporting 
Council’s UK Corporate Governance Code.
Changes in accounting policies
In the current financial year, Essentra 
adopted the following pronouncements:
 > Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition  
of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised 
Losses: these amendments clarify how 
to account for deferred tax assets 
related to debt instruments measured 
at fair value. 
 > Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure 
Initiative require disclosure of information 
about changes in liabilities arising from 
financing activities, including cash flows 
and non-cash changes. As Essentra 
provides disclosure on reconciliation of 
individual elements of net debt, these 
amendments did not have a significant 
impact.
The adoption of these amendments did not 
have an impact on the Group in relation to 
measurement, recognition and presentation. 
Other than these, the accounting policies 
and presentation in this set of Financial 
Statements are consistent with those 
applied in the prior years. 
The following standards or interpretations 
have not yet been adopted by the Group. 
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM
121
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | ACCOUNTING POLICIES a. Basis of preparation continued 
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers establishes a new five-step 
model that will apply to revenue arising 
from contracts with customers, and 
provides a more structured approach to 
measurement and recognition of revenue. 
The review of the impact of IFRS 15 requires 
an assessment of each revenue stream 
and review of contracts and / or supply 
agreements in place with our customers  
in order to establish and confirm the full 
impact of adopting this standard.
Based on the review and assessment 
undertaken, management conclude that 
the new standard will not have a material 
impact on revenue recognition for the Group, 
given the nature of products and services 
offered by the Group.
Information on the nature of revenue 
recognition within each division is outlined 
below, with key areas highlighted where 
the adoption of IFRS 15 will have an  
impact on the current accounting policies. 
Further information about these individual 
divisions can be found on pages 4 to 5 
(“Essentra at a Glance”).
 > Component Solutions 
Within our Component Solutions 
division, we supply over 90,000 
customers across the globe with more 
than 30,000 products. The majority  
of sales are for the supply of standard 
Essentra parts available from stock  
that are sold on standard terms.
 > Health & Personal Care Packaging 
In the Health & Personal Care Packaging 
division, Essentra generally manufactures 
customer specific products. There is no 
significant impact on the recognition of 
revenue on these products.
 > Filter Products 
Within the Filter Products division, 
Essentra primarily manufactures 
customer specific products for the 
tobacco industry. There is no significant 
impact on the recognition of revenue  
on these products.
The following areas were specifically 
considered by the Group:
 > Revenue will continue to be recognised 
net of any trade discount or rebate 
schemes and any anticipated warranty 
liabilities, there is no material change 
under the new standard to the 
calculation of liabilities arising from 
rebate schemes or product warranties.
 > In a small number of instances, Essentra 
provides services to the customers in 
addition to the supply of goods. Where 
previously revenue was only recognised 
on the supply of goods under IFRS 15, an 
element of revenue will be attributed to 
the additional services provided where 
these are distinct from the goods being 
supplied. The total value of revenue 
attributable to such services is not 
significant.
 > The incremental costs of obtaining a 
contract will be recognised as an asset  
if the Group expect to recover those 
costs. These costs were not significant  
in the past, and are not expected to  
be significant.
 > Where a customer has committed to 
purchase goods in advance of production, 
revenue may be recognised on production 
rather than on transfer of control to the 
customer . Such arrangements are rare and 
insignificant to the total Group revenue.
The individual and aggregate impact of 
the above is not material to the Group.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments introduces 
new requirements for classification  
and measurement, impairment and  
hedge accounting and replaces IAS 39 
Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement and all previous versions  
of IFRS 9. The amendment to IFRS 9  
is effective from 1 January 2018 and will be 
adopted by the Group in the accounting 
year beginning 1 January 2018. 
Based on an analysis of the Group’s 
financial assets and financial liabilities  
as at 31 December 2017 and on the basis  
of facts and circumstances that exist at 
that date, the Directors of the Company 
have assessed the impact of IFRS 9 to  
the Group’s consolidated Financial 
Statements as follows:
Classification and measurement: IFRS  
9 contains three principal classification 
categories for financial assets which are 
amortised cost, fair value through other 
comprehensive income (“FVOCI”) and fair 
value through profit or loss (“FVTPL ”). The 
standard eliminates the existing IAS 39 
categories of held-to-maturity, loans  
and receivables and available-for-sale 
financial assets. 
At 31 December 2017 , the Group has  
no financial assets designated as 
held-to-maturity or available-for-sale.  
The Group has £251.1m of loans and 
receivables which have been reviewed 
against the requirements of IFRS 9 and will 
continue to be disclosed as amortised cost 
items following the implementation of IFRS 
9. Based on its assessment, the Group 
does not believe that the new classification 
requirements will lead to a change in 
accounting treatment. 
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM
122
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | ACCOUNTING POLICIES a. Basis of preparation continued
Impairment – Financial assets were 
assessed for impairment using the IAS 39 
incurred loss model as at 31 December 
2017 . IFRS 9 replaces this with the expected 
credit loss model which requires expected 
credit losses and changes to expected 
credit losses at each reporting date to 
reflect changes in credit risk since initial 
recognition. Financial assets measured at 
amortised cost or FVOCI will be subject  
to the impairment provisions of IFRS 9.  
The Group intends to apply the simplified 
model to recognise lifetime expected 
credit losses for its trade receivables  
and other receivables, including those  
due in greater than 12 months, by making 
an accounting policy election. The 
implementation of the expected credit loss 
model will lead to earlier and increased 
recognition of credit losses as the Group 
will no longer need to wait until a 
receivable is past due before recognising a 
provision. Additionally, the recognition of 
losses based on forward-looking estimates 
reflecting current and forecast conditions 
may lead to greater volatility in credit loss 
provisions. The quantitative impact of the 
implementation will be disclosed in the 
2018 Financial Statements, with a 
reconciliation between the closing IAS 39 
and opening IFRS 9 loss provision, and this is 
not assessed to be material. 
Hedging – the new hedge accounting 
requirements of IFRS 9 will align hedge 
accounting relationships with the Group’s 
risk management objectives and strategy 
and lead to the application of a more 
qualitative and forward-looking approach 
to assessing hedge effectiveness.  
The Group uses derivatives to manage 
currency and interest rate risk arising from 
underlying business activities. The Group 
has confirmed that its current hedge 
relationships will continue to qualify as 
accounting hedges upon the adoption  
of IFRS 9. The types of hedge accounting 
relationships that the Group currently 
designates meet the requirements of IFRS 9 
and are aligned with the Group’s risk 
management strategy and objective. 
Consistent with the Group’s current hedge 
accounting policy, the Directors do not 
intend to exclude the forward element  
of foreign currency forward contracts  
from designated hedging relationships. 
Therefore the Directors conclude that the 
application of the IFRS 9 hedge accounting 
requirements will not have a material 
impact on the Group’s consolidated 
Financial Statements. 
The Group will take advantage of the 
exemption allowing it not to restate 
comparative information for prior periods 
with respect to classification and 
measurement (including impairment) 
changes. Differences in the carrying 
amounts of financial assets and financial 
liabilities resulting from the adoption of IFRS 
9 will therefore be recognised in retained 
earnings and reserves as at 1 January 2018. 
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 Leases which is effective from 1 
January 2019, eliminates the classification 
of leases as either operating leases or 
finance leases and introduces a single 
lessee accounting model under which a 
lessee is required to recognise assets and 
liabilities for all leases with a term of more 
than 12 months, unless the underlying 
asset is of low value, and depreciation of 
lease assets separately from interest on 
lease liabilities in the income statement. 
The Group is currently assessing the 
impact of IFRS 16.
Other standards and interpretations
The Group does not currently expect the 
adoption of the following standards or 
interpretations to have a material impact 
on the consolidated results or financial 
position of the Group.
Narrow-scope amendments to IFRS 2 
Share-based Payment – Classification and 
Measurement of Share-based Payment 
Transactions provide guidance on the 
accounting for the effects of vesting and 
non-vesting conditions on the 
measurement of cash-settled share-based 
payments, share-based payment 
transactions with a net settlement feature 
for withholding tax obligations and 
modification to the terms and conditions 
of a share-based payment that changes 
the classification of the transaction from 
cash-settled to equity-settled.
IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions  
and Advance Considerations addresses  
the exchange rates to be used for advance 
consideration paid or received in a  
foreign currency.
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax 
Treatments addresses how to reflect 
uncertainty in accounting for income 
taxes, providing guidance on considering 
uncertain tax treatments separately or 
together, examination by tax authorities, 
the appropriate method to reflect 
uncertainty and accounting for changes  
in facts and circumstances.
Amendments to IAS 40 Transfer of 
Investment Property clarify the accounting 
requirements on transfers to or from 
investment property.
Amendments to IAS 19 Plan Amendment, 
Curtailment or Settlement specify that in 
the event of a plan amendment, 
curtailment or settlement during a 
reporting period, an entity is required to 
use updated information to determine 
current service cost and net interest for 
the period following such an event.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | ACCOUNTING POLICIES b. Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by 
Essentra. Control exists when Essentra is 
exposed, or has rights, to variable returns 
from its involvement with the investee  
and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the investee. The 
Financial Statements of subsidiaries are 
included in the Financial Statements from 
the date that control commences until  
the date that control ceases.
(ii) Transactions eliminated on 
consolidation
Intragroup balances and any unrealised 
gains and losses or income and expense 
arising from intragroup transactions are 
eliminated in preparing the consolidated 
Financial Statements. 
c. Foreign currency
Items included in the Financial Statements 
of the Group’s subsidiaries are measured 
using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the subsidiary 
operates (“functional currency”). The 
consolidated Financial Statements are 
prepared in sterling (functional currency  
of the Parent Company).
(i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are 
recorded at the rate of exchange at the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies at the balance sheet date are 
translated into sterling at the exchange 
rate ruling at that date and recognised  
in the income statement unless hedge 
accounting criteria apply (see policy  
for financial instruments).
(ii) Financial statements of foreign 
operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign 
operations, including goodwill and  
fair value adjustments arising on 
consolidation, are translated into sterling 
at the exchange rate ruling at the balance 
sheet date. The revenues and expenses of 
foreign operations are translated into 
sterling at average exchange rates. 
(iii) Net investment in foreign operations
Exchange differences on retranslation at 
the closing rate of the opening balances  
of overseas entities are taken to other 
comprehensive income, as are exchange 
differences arising on related foreign 
currency borrowings and derivatives 
designated as net investment hedges, to 
the extent that they are effective. Other 
exchange differences are taken to the 
income statement. Differences arising 
prior to 1 January 2004 are included in 
retained earnings.
d. Financial instruments
In accordance with IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement (“IAS 39”), interest bearing 
loans and borrowings and other financial 
liabilities (excluding derivatives) are held at 
amortised cost, unless they are included in 
a hedge accounting relationship. See note 
14 for separate disclosure of hedge types. 
Derivatives are measured initially at fair 
value. Subsequent measurement in the 
Financial Statements depends on the 
classification of the derivative as follows: 
(i) Fair value hedges
Where a derivative is used to hedge the 
foreign exchange exposure of a monetary 
asset or liability, any gain or loss on the 
derivative is recognised in the income 
statement. 
(ii) Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative is designated as a 
hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge, 
the change in fair value is recognised in 
other comprehensive income to the extent 
that it is effective and any ineffective 
portion is recognised in the income 
statement. Where the underlying 
transaction results in a financial asset, 
accumulated gains and losses are 
recognised in the income statement in the 
same period as the hedged item affects 
profit or loss. Where the hedged item results 
in a non-financial asset the accumulated 
gains and losses previously recognised in 
other comprehensive income are included 
in the initial carrying value of the asset. 
(iii) Hedges of net investment in 
foreign operations
The gain or loss on an instrument used  
to hedge a net investment in a foreign 
operation that is deemed effective is 
recognised in other comprehensive 
income. Any ineffective portion is 
recognised in the income statement.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | ACCOUNTING POLICIES e. Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated 
at cost less accumulated depreciation  
and impairment losses. Previously revalued 
properties were treated as being held  
at deemed cost upon transition to 
adopted IFRS.
Where parts of an item of property, plant 
and equipment or other assets have 
different useful lives, they are accounted 
for as separate items. The carrying values 
of property, plant and equipment and 
other assets are periodically reviewed for 
impairment when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying 
values may not be recoverable.
Property, plant and equipment are 
depreciated over their estimated 
remaining useful lives on a straight line 
basis at the following annual rates: 
Freehold land Not depreciated
Buildings
2% or life of lease  
if shorter
Plant and machinery 7 - 20%
Fixtures, fittings  
and equipment 10 - 33%
The assets’ useful lives and residual values 
are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, 
at each balance sheet date.
f. Leases
Rentals associated with operating leases 
are expensed to the income statement on 
a straight line basis. Lease incentives are 
amortised in the income statement over 
the life of the lease.
g. Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill is stated at cost less any 
impairment losses. 
Acquisitions are accounted for using the 
purchase method. For acquisitions that 
have occurred since 1 January 2004 goodwill 
represents the difference between the fair 
value of the assets given in consideration 
and the fair value of identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities of the 
acquiree. For acquisitions made before 1 
January 2004, goodwill is included on the 
basis of its deemed cost, which represents the 
amount previously recorded under UK GAAP . 
Since 1 January 2010, the Group has 
expensed costs attributable to acquisitions 
in the income statement. Given their one-off 
nature, these costs are generally presented 
within exceptional operating items.
(ii) Research and development
Research costs are expensed to the 
income statement in the year in which 
they are incurred. 
Development costs relating to new 
products are capitalised when the Group  
is able to demonstrate the technical 
feasibility of completing the intangible 
asset so that it will be available for use  
or sale, its intention to complete and its 
ability to use or sell the asset, how the 
asset will generate future economic 
benefits, the availability of resources  
to complete the asset and the ability  
to measure reliably the expenditure  
during development.
(iii) Other intangible assets
An intangible asset acquired in a business 
combination is recognised at fair value to 
the extent it is probable that the expected 
future economic benefits attributable  
to the asset will flow to the Group and 
that its cost can be measured reliably. 
Intangible assets principally relate to 
customer relationships, which are valued 
using discounted cash flows based on 
historical customer attrition rates, and 
developed technology, which is valued
using an income approach. The cost of 
intangible assets is amortised through the 
income statement on a straight line basis 
over their estimated useful economic life. 
Other intangible assets which are not 
acquired through a business combination 
(“non-acquired intangible assets”) are 
recognised at cost to the extent it is 
probable that the expected future economic 
benefits attributable to the asset will flow 
to the Group and that its cost can be 
measured reliably, and amortised on  
a straight line basis over their estimated 
useful economic life.
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM
125
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | ACCOUNTING POLICIES h. Impairment
All assets are reviewed annually to 
determine whether there is any indication 
of impairment. Goodwill is tested annually. 
An impairment loss is recognised whenever 
the carrying amount of a non-financial 
asset or the cash generating unit to which 
it belongs exceeds its recoverable amount, 
being the greater of value in use and fair 
value less costs to sell, and is recognised  
in the income statement. Value in use is 
estimated based on future cash flows 
discounted using a pre-tax discount rate 
based upon the Group’s weighted average 
cost of capital.
i. Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of  
cost (on a first in, first out basis) and  
net realisable value. For work-in-progress 
and finished goods, cost includes an 
appropriate proportion of labour cost  
and overheads.
j. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise  
cash balances and fixed term investments 
whose maturities are three months or  
less from the date of acquisition. Bank 
overdrafts repayable on demand form  
an integral part of Essentra’s cash 
management and are included as part  
of cash and cash equivalents in the 
statement of cash flows.
k. Loans and borrowings
Loans and borrowings are initially measured 
at cost (which is equal to fair value at 
inception) and are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. Any difference between the 
proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the 
settlement or redemption of borrowings is 
recognised in the income statement over 
the term of the borrowings.
l. Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised  
at fair value and subsequently measured  
at amortised cost, which is generally 
equivalent to recognition at nominal  
value less impairment loss.
m. Trade and other payables
Trade payables are non-interest bearing 
and are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently at amortised cost.
 
n. Catalogue costs
The costs associated with the production 
and printing of catalogues are expensed  
to the income statement when access is 
received to those goods.
o. Income tax
Income tax in the income statement 
comprises current and deferred tax.Income 
tax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognised in equity or other comprehensive 
income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on 
the taxable income for the year using the 
applicable tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date and any 
adjustment to tax payable in prior years.
Deferred tax is provided, using the balance 
sheet liability method, on temporary 
differences arising between the tax bases 
and the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the Financial Statements. The 
following temporary differences are not 
provided for: goodwill not deductible for 
tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets 
or liabilities that affect neither accounting 
nor taxable profit or loss, and differences 
relating to investments in subsidiaries to 
the extent that they will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. Deferred tax is determined 
using tax rates that are expected to apply 
when the related deferred tax asset or 
liability is settled, using the applicable tax 
rates enacted or substantively enacted at 
the balance sheet dates.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to 
the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profit will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised. Deferred 
tax assets are reduced to the extent that  
it is no longer probable that the related 
tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset 
when there is a legally enforceable right to 
set off current tax assets against liabilities 
and when they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same tax authority and the 
Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
p. Revenue
Revenue from the sale of goods is 
recognised in the income statement net  
of expected returns when the significant 
risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred to the customer. Revenue is 
measured at the fair value  
of consideration receivable. 
A significant proportion of the Group’s 
businesses sell goods on an ex-works basis, 
where the Group as a seller makes its goods 
ready for collection at its premises on an 
agreed upon sales date and the buyer incurs 
all transportation and handling costs and 
bears the risks for bringing the goods  
to their chosen destination. The Group 
operates non ex-works terms with customers 
in some of its businesses, and in these 
businesses, revenue is recognised when the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership 
have been transferred to the customer. 
These terms include some consignment 
stock agreements, where revenue is 
recognised when the customer removes 
the goods from consignment stock.
q. Finance income and expense
Finance income and expense is recognised 
in the income statement as it accrues.
r. Segment reporting
A segment is identified on the basis of 
internal reports that are regularly reviewed 
by the Group Management Committee in 
order to allocate resources to the segment 
and assess its performance. 
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | ACCOUNTING POLICIES s. Pensions
(i) Defined contribution schemes
Obligations for contributions to defined 
contribution pension schemes are 
expensed to the income statement  
as incurred.
(ii) Defined benefit schemes
The significant pension schemes in  
Europe and the US have been accounted 
for on a defined benefit basis.
The net obligations in respect of defined 
benefit pension schemes are calculated 
separately for each scheme by estimating 
the amount of future benefit that 
employees have earned in return for their 
service in the current and prior periods;  
that benefit is discounted to determine  
its present value, and the fair value of any 
scheme assets is deducted. The discount 
rate is the yield at the balance sheet date 
on AA credit-rated bonds that have 
maturity dates approximating to the terms 
of Essentra’s obligations. The calculation  
is performed by a qualified independent 
actuary using the projected unit credit 
method. Net interest on defined benefit 
assets is presented within finance income, 
and net interest on defined benefit liabilities 
is presented within finance expense.
Actuarial gains and losses that have arisen 
are recognised in full in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income.
The amounts charged to operating profit 
are the current service cost, past service 
cost (including curtailments) and gains 
and losses on settlement. 
The value of a net pension asset is limited 
to the amount that may be recovered 
either through reduced contributions or  
agreed refunds from the scheme.
t. Share-based payments
Essentra operates equity-settled, 
share-based incentive plans. A charge is 
made in the income statement based  
on the fair value of option awards using 
the Monte Carlo or binomial valuation 
models and relevant quoted share price 
information with a corresponding increase 
in equity. The fair value is measured at 
grant date and spread over the period 
between grant date and vesting date of 
the options. The amount recognised as an 
expense will be adjusted to reflect the 
actual number of share options that vest 
with the exception of options that fail to vest 
because market conditions are not met.
u. Exceptional items in the 
consolidated income statement
The exceptional operating items below are 
separated from other items by virtue of 
their size and incidence (considered for 
each operating segment). They are shown 
as a separate line item within operating 
profit on the face of the income statement 
in order for the reader to obtain a clearer 
understanding of the results from the 
ongoing operations. These items exclude 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
which are also presented separately in the 
income statement.
(i) Transaction costs relating  
to acquisitions and disposals  
of businesses
In 2017 and 2016, Essentra incurred one-off 
costs (such as professional fees) as a result 
of acquisitions including transactions that 
did not complete in 2016 (refer to note 23). 
In addition, costs incurred in 2017 and 2016 
in relation to the disposal of Porous 
Technologies (which are presented as 
discontinued operations) are also included 
in this category within discontinued 
operations (refer to note 23).
(ii) Acquisition integration  
and restructuring costs
Costs relating to the integration of 
acquired businesses and restructuring 
associated with acquisitions.
(iii) Other exceptional items
In 2017 , this represented costs arising from 
the closure of the folded cartons facilities 
at Newport and amounts in respect of the 
strategic review undertaken during the 
period associated reorganisation costs, 
and an adjustment on contingent deferred 
considerations on a prior acquisition. 
In 2016, this represented impairment loss 
on certain assets of the Health & Personal 
Care Packaging Strategic Business Unit, 
further costs arising from the closure of 
the Filter Products site in Jarrow, offset by 
the net release of property provisions on 
disposal of properties, and an adjustment 
on contingent deferred considerations  
on a prior acquisition.
v. Investment in own shares
The shares held in the Essentra Employee 
Benefit Trust for the purpose of fulfilling 
obligations in respect of share option  
plans are treated as belonging to the 
Company and are deducted from its 
retained earnings. The cost of shares  
held directly (treasury shares) are also 
deducted from retained earnings. 
w. Provisions
A provision is recognised when there is a 
probable legal or constructive obligation 
as a result of a past event and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the outflow of 
resources that will be required to settle the 
obligation. The outflow is the present value 
of management’s best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the present 
obligation at the balance sheet date.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | ACCOUNTING POLICIES x. Government grants
Government grants are recognised  
when it is reasonable to expect that  
the grants will be received and that all 
related conditions will be met, usually on 
submission of a valid claim for payment. 
Government grants in respect of capital 
expenditure are included within the carrying 
amount of the related property, plant and 
equipment, and are released to profit or 
loss on a straight-line basis over the expected 
useful lives of the relevant assets. Grants  
of a revenue nature are credited to  
profit or loss so as to match them with  
the expenditure to which they relate.
y. Net debt
Net debt is defined as cash and cash 
equivalents, net of interest bearing  
loans and borrowings.
z. Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability in  
the period in which they are approved by 
the shareholders of the Company (final 
dividend) or paid (interim dividend).
aa. Assets and disposal groups held  
for sale and discontinued operations
Non-current assets, or disposal groups 
comprising assets and liabilities, are 
classified as held-for-sale if it is highly 
probable that they will be recovered 
primarily through sale rather than through 
continuing use. Such assets, or disposal 
groups, are generally measured at the 
lower of their carrying amount and fair 
value less costs to sell. Impairment losses 
on initial classification as held-for-sale  
and subsequent gains and losses on 
remeasurement are recognised in profit  
or loss.
A disposal group qualifies as discontinued 
operation if it is a component of an entity 
that either has been disposed of, or is 
classified as held for sale, and:
 > Represents a separate major line  
of business or geographical area  
of operations;
 > Is part of a single co-ordinated plan  
to dispose of a separate major line  
of business or geographical area  
of operations; or
 > Is a subsidiary acquired exclusively  
with a view to resale.
Discontinued operations are excluded  
from the results of continuing operations 
and are presented as a single amount as 
profit or loss after tax from discontinued 
operations in the income statement.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following provides information on 
those policies that management considers 
critical because of the level of judgement 
and estimation required which often 
involves assumptions regarding future 
events which can vary from what is 
anticipated. The Directors believe that the 
Financial Statements reflect appropriate 
judgements and estimates and provide  
a true and fair view of Essentra’s 
performance and financial position. 
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
(i)  Pensions
Essentra accounts for its defined benefit 
pension schemes in accordance with  
IAS 19. The application of IAS 19 requires 
the exercise of judgement in relation  
to the assumptions used and for each 
assumption there is a range of possible 
outcomes (see note 17). In consultation 
with Essentra’s actuaries, management 
decides the point within those ranges  
that most appropriately reflects Essentra’s 
circumstances. Small changes to these 
assumptions can have a significant  
impact on valuations. The Group performs 
a sensitivity analysis for the significant 
assumptions used in determining 
post-employment costs and liabilities,  
as detailed in note 17 .
(ii)  Business combinations  
and intangible assets
IFRS 3 requires the identification of 
acquired intangible assets as part of  
a business combination. The methods 
used to value such intangible assets 
require the use of estimates and 
judgements such as customer attrition, 
cash flow generation from the existing 
relationships with customers and returns 
on other assets. Future results are 
impacted by the amortisation periods 
adopted and changes to the estimated 
useful lives would result in different  
effects on the income statement  
and balance sheet. 
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested 
annually for impairment, along with the 
finite-lived intangible assets and other 
assets of the Group’s cash generating 
units. Tests for impairment are based on 
discounted cash flows and assumptions 
(including discount rates, timing and growth 
prospects) which are inherently subjective. 
Judgement is also required in identifying the 
events which indicate potential impairment, 
and in assessing fair value of individual 
assets when allocating an impairment  
loss in a cash-generating unit or groups  
of cash-generating units. The Group 
performs various sensitivity analyses  
in respect of the tests for impairment,  
as detailed in note 8.
The useful lives of the Group’s finite-lived 
intangible assets are reviewed following 
the tests for impairment annually.
Judgement may also be required in 
determining the fair value of other  
assets acquired and liabilities (including 
contingent liabilities) assumed.
(iii) Taxation
Liabilities for tax contingencies require 
management judgements and estimates  
in respect of tax audit issues and 
exposures in each of the jurisdictions  
in which it operates. Management is  
also required to make an estimate of  
the current tax liability together with an 
assessment of the temporary differences 
which arise as a consequence of different 
accounting and tax treatments. Where 
management conclude that a tax position 
is uncertain, a current tax liability is held 
for anticipated taxes that are considered 
probable based on the information 
available. Key judgement areas for the 
Group include the pricing of intercompany 
goods and services as well as the tax 
consequences arising from restructuring 
operations. 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
Included in the tax payable is a liability  
of £18.9m (2016: £15.1m) for transfer  
pricing matters and £19 .0m (2016: £10.6m) 
for other uncertain tax positions.  
The movement is due to adjustments for 
current year transactions, including the 
disposal of Porous Technologies, foreign 
exchange movements, expiry of statute  
of limitations following the passage  
of time and agreement reached with  
tax authorities on previous matters. 
The group is aware of the European 
Commission press release on 26 October 
2017 where the Commission opened  
an in-depth investigation into the UK’s 
finance company partial exemption  
from controlled foreign company rules  
to determine whether EU state aid rules 
have been breached. Management do  
not consider it probable that an outflow  
of cost will arise to the group as a 
consequence of this and so no current or 
deferred tax liability is held. Management 
consider it impracticable to calculate the 
potential contingent liability since there is 
too much uncertainty regarding how the 
process may conclude. Management will 
monitor the progress of this investigation.
Management may engage with 
professional advisors in making their 
assessment and, if appropriate, will liaise 
with the relevant taxation authorities  
to resolve the matter. The tax liability  
is reassessed in each period to reflect 
management’s best estimate in light  
of information available. If the final 
outcome of these matters differs to the 
liability held in the Financial Statements, 
the difference may impact the income tax 
expense / (credit) in the year the matter  
is concluded. 
ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS
(i)  Exceptional items
Judgement is required to determine 
whether items should be included within 
exceptional operating items by virtue of 
their size or incidence. Details of the items 
categorised as exceptional are disclosed  
in note 2.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES 1. Segment analysis
In accordance with IFRS 8, Essentra  
has determined its operating segments 
based upon the information reported  
to the Group Management Committee. 
These segments are as follows:
Component Solutions consists of the 
Components business, the Extrusion 
business, the Pipe Protection Technologies 
business and the Security business. The 
Components business is a global market 
leading manufacturer and distributor  
of plastic injection moulded, vinyl dip 
moulded, and metal items. The Extrusion 
business is a leading custom profile 
extruder located in the Netherlands which 
offers a complete design and production 
service. The Pipe Protection Technologies 
business specialises in the manufacture  
of high performance innovative products 
from commodity resins to engineering-
grade thermoplastics and polymer alloys 
for use in the oil & gas industry. The  
Card Solutions business has been at  
the forefront of ID technology for over  
30 years, and has access to the widest 
portfolio of products and services, including 
printers, software and consumables from 
leading manufacturers.
Health & Personal Care Packaging  
consists of the Health & Personal Care 
Packaging business and the Speciality 
Tapes business. Health & Personal Care 
Packaging is a leading global provider of 
packaging and authentication solutions  
to a diversified blue chip customer base  
in the health & personal care, consumer 
and specialist packaging sectors, and  
to the paper and board industries. The 
Speciality Tapes business has expertise  
in coating multiple adhesive systems  
in numerous technologies.
The Filter Products business is the only 
global independent provider of filters and 
related solutions to the tobacco industry, 
and supplies not only standard filters but 
also special variants which provide 
innovative solutions that meet the 
consumer-driven demands of the sector 
against a backdrop of ongoing legislative 
changes. 
Discontinued operations represent the 
Porous Technologies business, a leading 
developer and manufacturer of innovative 
custom fluid-handling components used in 
a variety of end-markets, engineered from 
a portfolio of technologies that included 
bonded and non-woven fibre, polyurethane 
foam and porous plastics. The Porous 
Technologies business was disposed of on 
6 March 2017 and the results are presented 
as results from discontinued operations  
in both the current and prior period. The 
assets and liabilities of Porous Technologies 
have also been presented as held for sale 
on the balance sheet at 31 December 2016.  
No finance income or expense related to 
discontinued operations, and the income 
tax expense related to discontinued 
operations amounted to £24.9m  
(2016: £3.9m).
The adjusted operating profit / (loss) 
presented for each operating segment 
includes the effect of allocation of certain 
functional costs such as finance, human 
resources, legal and IT, as well as costs 
relating to management of the divisions 
on an internal management methodology. 
NOTES
Therefore for continuing operations,  
the adjusted operating profit presented 
below of £84.9m (2016: £110.4m) differs 
from the amount presented as operating 
profit before intangible amortisation  
and exceptional operating items of 
£84.6m (2016: £108.7m) as a result of  
costs allocated to Porous Technologies  
of £0.3m (2016: £1.7m) under the  
internal management methodology.
With effect from 1 January 2018, a  
new organisation structure has been 
implemented, comprising four different 
divisions (see note 28 for further details).

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | NOTES 2. Net operating expense continued
No income or expense (2016: £nil) was recognised in operating expense during the year in respect of ineffective cash flow hedges. 
Essentra’s hedges of net investments were also entirely effective in 2017 and 2016, as defined by IAS 39, and therefore no hedge 
ineffectiveness has been recognised in net operating expense in 2017 (2016: £nil). Research and development expenses (including 
relevant staff costs) charged to profit or loss during the year amounted to £5.2m (2016: £5.0m). Other operating expenses include

other costs in relation to redundancy and other closure-related costs;
 > £17 .3m in respect of the strategic review undertaken during the period and associated reorganisation cost, including £5.3m in relation to senior 
management restructuring and £4.7m write-down of IT-related assets which are not in line with the Group’s revised strategies. The remaining costs 
relate to external consultancy and project costs attributable to reviews into the various aspects of the Group’s operations, systems and processes  
under the strategic review; and 
 > £1.9m relating to the closure and relocation of the security seals production from Ipoh, Malaysia to Rayong, Thailand as a result of the strategic review. 
 
  Other exceptional items incurred in 2016 related to further costs of £2.7m associated with the closure of the Filters site in Jarrow and integration of previous 
Jarrow operations into the Hungary site offset with the net release of property provisions of £1.3m on the disposal of certain properties in Filtration Products 
(including a £0.5m loss of property disposal in Porous Technologies) and the release of £1.1m provision for contingent deferred consideration in relation to  
a prior period acquisition. 
5
  Exceptional tax items of £11.4m in 2017 primarily related to the revaluation of deferred tax balances as a result of tax reform in the US. The tax effect of the

Essentra operates in many countries and is subject to income tax in many different jurisdictions (the most significant jurisdictions 
being the UK, US, Singapore, Hungary, Thailand and Indonesia). Essentra calculates its average expected tax rate as a weighted 
average of the applicable corporate income tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which it operates.

Income tax credit in the UK is £3.6m (2016: £9.0m expense). This is primarily due to the trading performance and exceptional costs  
of the UK businesses. 
1
   The change in the weighted average applicable tax rate is caused by a change in the geographical balance of the Group’s profits and changes in corporate 
tax rates in these geographies. The prior year weighted average tax rate was distorted due to the impairment loss in relation to the Health & Personal Care 
Packaging Strategic Business Unit.
2
   This includes primarily depreciation on assets not qualifying for capital allowances, costs incurred in relation to the disposal of the Porous Technologies 
businesses and closure of the cartons site in Newport, UK. Permanent disallowable items may vary in future years dependent on the nature of future 
expenditure.
3
   The 2016 impairment to the Health & Personal Care Packaging goodwill was disallowable for tax purposes.
4
   The disposal of the Porous Technologies businesses gives rise to taxable gains, the basis of which is different to the accounting gains.
5
   In 2016 gains from the adjustment to contingent deferred consideration in relation to prior acquisitions were non-taxable.
6
   The US Tax Reform enacted during 2017 generates a tax credit as deferred tax liabilities are rebased to reflect the reduction to the US Federal tax rate  
from 1 January 2018. Given the material nature of this impact, it is presented as an exceptional tax credit.

   See further information regarding deferred tax asset recognition in note 15.

  Essentra is able to control the timing and amount of remitted earnings so this amount may vary in future years.

  This reflects changes to substantially enacted or enacted corporate tax rates during the year excluding the impact of the US Tax Reform.

were not depreciated during the year.
Contractual commitments to purchase property, plant and equipment amounted to £5.7m at 31 December 2017 (2016: £3.8m including 
Porous Technologies). The net book value of assets under finance leases amounted to £2.7m as at 31 December 2017 (2016: £3.3m).
Impairment charge in 2017 of £12.3m related primarily to the write-down of assets as a result of the closure of the folded cartons 
facility at Newport (see note 2) which was reported within the Health & Personal Care Packaging division for segmental reporting 
purposes. The assets have been written down to their recoverable amount, which represents fair value less costs of disposal.
Impairment charge in 2016 of £3.7m related primarily to the write-down of certain plant and machinery in the Health & Personal Care 
Packaging division as a result of detailed impairment assessment of assets held by the individual cash generating units in that division.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | NOTES 8. Intangible assets continued
Other intangible assets principally comprise trade names acquired with Reid Supply, developed technology acquired with Richco, 
order backlog and eCommerce development costs. Amortisation of intangible assets arising from business combinations (“acquired 
intangible assets”) is presented separately on the face of the income statement. 
The eCommerce development costs were not acquired through a business combination, and their amortisation is included within 
operating profit before intangible amortisation and exceptional operating items.
The eCommerce development costs were impaired by £4.4m during the year to their value in use. The eCommerce development  
costs were incurred and reported within the Component Solutions division for segmental reporting purposes. 
The weighted average remaining useful economic lives of customer relationships and other intangible assets (including Porous 
Technologies) at the end of the year were 9.2 years and 10.6 years (2016: 10.3 years and 7 .2 years) respectively.
Essentra tests intangible assets annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications of impairment. A discounted cash 
flow analysis is computed to compare the discounted estimated future operating cash flows to the net carrying value of the goodwill 
and other intangible assets for each cash generating unit or group of cash generating units as appropriate.
Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash generating units, being the operating segments, as follows:

  These were included in assets in disposal group held for sale as at 31 December 2016. The assets were disposed of with the Porous Technologies business in 
March 2017.
The Health & Personal Care Packaging business faced significant operational and commercial challenges during 2016. Integration of  
the acquired Clondalkin operations and the associated site rationalisation programme has experienced significant issues and resulted  
in losses of customers, particularly in the UK, the US and the Netherlands. Furthermore, there has been significant scaling back of 
high margin security feature business in the tear tape operations. Issues were also experienced in the integration of the European 
speciality tapes activities into the European tear tapes business. As a result, impairment losses were recognised in 2016 for £32.5m of 
goodwill, £88.0m of customer relationship intangible asset and £3.4m of property, plant and equipment (primarily plant and machinery) .
At 31 December 2017 , management has performed impairment assessments of the assets in each division based on the new 
organisational structure (which became effective from 1 January 2018). In management’s view, as the annual impairment test of 
goodwill is performed on 31 December, it is more appropriate to apply the new organisational structure for the test as at 31 December 
2017 . Following this impairment assessment, no impairment loss was recognised in 2017 .
The impairment assessment for intangible assets (excluding goodwill) and property, plant and equipment is performed on the  
cash generating units within the divisions. The cash generating units are primarily the manufacturing sites. Goodwill is tested at the 
divisional level, which is the level that management monitor goodwill at. The recoverable amount is estimated on the basis of value  
in use, ie, discounted cash flow projection expected to be generated by the group of cash generating units. For assets in the cash 
generating units assessed to be impaired, their fair value less costs to sell is also considered in determining the impairment loss to be 
recognised, if any. In these cases the fair value less costs to sell is based on estimated market prices reflecting the age and condition 
of the asset.
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM
142
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | NOTES 8. Intangible assets continued 
The impairment tests for goodwill and 
intangible assets are based on the 
following assumptions:
 > Cash flows for the next year are based 
upon the Group’s annual Plan (“the Plan”) . 
The key assumptions in the cash flow 
projections for the Plan are the revenue 
growth and operating margin for each 
strategic business unit. Operating 
margin is primarily based on the levels 
achieved in 2017 , which are disclosed  
in note 1, adjusted by targets set for 
revenue expansion and cost control  
and reduction for each individual 
division within the Plan period.
 > In relation to the test for the Components 
and Specialist Components divisions, 
cash flows beyond the Plan period are 
based on Plan cash flows with growth 
rates specific to each business of up  
to 2% (2016: up to 2%).
 > The estimated cash flows are discounted 
using a pre-tax discount rate based 
upon Essentra’s estimated post-tax 
weighted average cost of capital of 
8.8% (2016: 8.2%). The specific pre-tax 
discount rates applied for each group  
of cash generating units to which 
significant goodwill is allocated  
are as follows: 11.9% for Packaging, 
11.6% for Components and 11.3% for 
Specialist Components (2016: 10.6%  
for Health & Personal Care Packaging, 
10.6% for Component Solutions and 
10.6% for Filtration Products).
 > There is no goodwill held by the Filter 
Products division.
 > In relation to the test for the Packaging 
division, management carried out a 
more detailed assessment of the growth 
and profit margin assumptions for  
each of the next four years after the 
Plan period, and applied a terminal 
growth rate of 2.0% (2016: 1.0 - 1.5%) 
subsequently. The growth and profit 
margin assumptions are based on 
management’s assessment of market 
condition and scope for cost and 
profitability improvement, taking into 
account realisable synergies following 
the recent integration activities. The  
key assumption is that operating 
margins in this division will return to 
industry average margins by the end of 
the forecast period following a number 
of changes made as an outcome of the 
Group-wide strategic review. 
The following reasonably possible change 
to key assumptions will cause the carrying 
amount to exceed the recoverable amount 
in the Packaging division:
 > An increase in discount rate of four  
basis points 
 > A reduction in terminal annual growth 
rate of four basis points 
 > A reduction in each year’s growth rate 
by 13 basis points 
 > A reduction of six basis points in the 
operating profit margin in the fifth  
year of the five-year period

Cash flow hedges are hedges of the currency risk exposure to variability in cash flows. They relate to trading transactions and interest 
payments denominated in foreign currencies.
 
Hedges of net investments are hedges of the currency risk exposure to changes in the carrying value of net investments in  
foreign operations. 
The net fair value gains or losses on open forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge foreign currency risk of anticipated future 
sales, purchases and interest payments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The fair value will be transferred to the income statement 
when the forecast transactions occur. All of the hedged transactions are expected to occur over the next 15 months and all derivative 
instruments mature within the next 15 months. 
Essentra had US dollar and euro denominated borrowings which it designated as hedges of its net investments in subsidiary undertakings. 
The exchange gains of £7 .4m (2016: losses of £40.8m) on the US dollar borrowings and the losses of £4.4m (2016: losses of £16.1m)  
on the euro borrowings were recognised in other comprehensive income. In addition, certain foreign exchange contracts were also 
designated as hedges of the Group’s net investments in foreign operations.
Finance income and expense arising on financial assets and financial liabilities held at amortised cost are those amounts, excluding 
interest on pension scheme assets and interest on pension scheme liabilities, detailed in note 3.

1
  A deferred tax liability arises on property, plant and equipment as the tax value of assets is lower than the corresponding accounting value. This arises as tax 
deductions are determined by the applicable tax laws in each country the Group operates in whereas accounting depreciation is calculated in line with the 
Group’s accounting policy. The decrease during the year is due to the disposal of the Porous Technologies business and the impact from the US Tax Reform.
2
  A deferred tax liability is provided on temporary differences arising on the Group’s intangible assets as in the majority of cases the local tax authorities do 
not allow deduction for amortisation of these intangible assets. The decrease during the year is due to the disposal of the Porous Technologies business 
and the impact from US Tax Reform.
3

No deferred tax liability is provided in respect of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries where Essentra is able to control the 
remittance of earnings and it is probable that such earnings will not be remitted in the foreseeable future, or where no liability would 
arise on the remittance. At the year end it is expected that earnings from certain overseas Group companies will be remitted and  
a deferred tax liability of £4.5m (2016: £4.2m) has been recognised accordingly. This represents withholding taxes payable on the 
remittance of these earnings under local tax laws. The amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries 
and branches for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is £107 .8m as at 31 December 2017 (2016: £113.7m), and the 
associated amount of unrecognised deferred tax is £11.5m (2016: £11.7m).

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | NOTES 15. Deferred tax continued
Based on available information, management determined whether it is probable for some or all of the deferred tax assets to be 
realised. In determining this management considered the cumulative losses in prior years, the history of tax losses, the manner in 
which assets can be used (including time limitations under local laws), future earnings potential and expectation of future reversal  
of taxable temporary differences. Following management assessment, gross deferred tax assets of £0.2m (2016: £0.2m) in respect  
of capital losses and unutilised tax losses of £31.9m (2016: £46.1m) have not been recognised as their realisation is not probable.  
The capital losses have an unlimited expiry date. The tax losses expire as follows: £0.1m within five years, £4.5m in five to ten years,  
£0.1 in over 10 years and £27 .2m with no expiry. If future conditions change the amount of unrecognised deferred tax assets will be  
reassessed. This may impact the income tax expense / (credit) in the year of remeasurement.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | NOTES 16. Provisions continued
Reorganisation provisions are generally 
held against restructuring and redundancy 
costs, primarily related to the integration 
of acquired businesses and restructuring 
associated with acquisitions. Reorganisation 
provisions made during 2017 primarily 
related to the exceptional restructuring 
costs arising from the closure of the folded 
cartons facility at Newport (see note 2).
Other provisions relate primarily to vacant 
properties, lease dilapidations, employees’ 
compensation claims and other claims. 
Non-current provisions are generally 
provisions for vacant properties and lease 
dilapidations which are expected to be 
utilised within the next 10 years. The 
release of other provisions during the year 
relates mostly to claims and property-
related provisions.
17 . Employee benefits 
Post-employment benefits
The Group operates a number of defined 
benefit and defined contribution pension 
schemes around the world covering  
many of its employees. The Group also  
has a number of other post-employment 
obligations in certain countries, some  
of which are required under local law.
The defined benefit plans are administered 
by boards of trustees and the assets  
are held independently from Essentra.  
The boards of trustees comprise member 
nominated trustees, employer nominated 
trustees and independent advisory trustees. 
The articles of the plans prohibit a majority 
on the boards to be established by either 
the member or employer nominated 
trustees. The defined benefit plans operate 
within the wider regulatory framework of 
the country in which the plan is operated. 
Pension costs of the defined benefit 
schemes are assessed in accordance  
with the advice of independent 
professionally qualified actuaries. Full 
triennial actuarial valuations were carried 
out on the principal European defined 
benefit schemes as at 5 April 2015 and 
annual actuarial valuations are performed 
on the principal US defined benefit schemes. 
The assets and liabilities of the defined 
benefit schemes have been updated to 
the balance sheet date from the most 
recently completed actuarial valuations 
taking account of the investment returns 
achieved by the schemes and the level  
of contributions.
The principal European defined benefit 
schemes entitle remaining members  
to a pension calculated on 1.25% or 2%  
of their capped final pensionable pay 
multiplied by the number of pensionable 
years of service. Some members have 
historical entitlements to accrual rates  
of 1.67% - 1.9% and 3% for certain tranches 
of their service. The principal US defined 
benefit schemes entitle certain articipating 
employees to annuity benefits equal to 
50% of final average pensionable salary, 
reduced for years of service less than 30, 
and other participating employees to 
annuity benefits equal to $49 per month  
for each year of service.

During 2015, the principal defined benefit pension schemes in the UK and the US were closed to future accrual, and curtailment  
gains were recognised in profit or loss accordingly. Following the closure of the Group’s principal defined benefit pension schemes to 
future accruals, the schemes are funded by the Group’s subsidiaries and employees are not required to make any further contribution. 
The funding of these schemes is based on separate actuarial valuations for funding purposes for which the assumptions may differ 
from those used in the valuation for IAS 19 purposes.

The allocation of assets between different classes of investment is reviewed regularly and is a key factor in the trustees’ investment  
policies. The allocation of assets is arrived at taking into consideration current market conditions and trends, the size of potential  
returns relative to investment risk and the extent to which asset realisation needs to match liability maturity. There are risks 
underlying these considerations. If asset returns fall below the returns required for scheme assets to match the present value of 
scheme liabilities, a scheme deficit results. Persistent deficits represent an obligation the Group has to settle through increased  
cash contributions. If asset maturities are not properly matched with liability maturities, there is also the risk that the Group could  
be required to make unplanned short-term cash contributions to resolve resulting liquidity issues. Scheme assets are invested by  
the trustees in asset classes and markets that are considered to be reasonably liquid, so this matching and liquidity risk is considered  
to be sufficiently mitigated.
The fair value of scheme assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short-term and may be subject to significant change 
before they are realised, and the present value of the pension scheme liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over 
long periods and are therefore inherently uncertain, are:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | NOTES 17 . Employee benefits continued
The equity, corporate bond and government bond assets are either direct investments or investments made via a managed fund  
for those asset classes. All of these assets have a quoted market price in an active market. The other asset class relates primarily  
to property and hedge funds, which are valued at their cumulative unit offer price. No direct investment in property is held.  
No plan assets are invested directly in the shares of Essentra plc.
The pension surplus in Europe is not restricted as the asset is considered realisable on the basis of the Group’s unconditional right to  
a refund.
The average expected duration of the Group’s European defined benefit pension liability at 31 December 2017 is 20.0 years  
(2016: 20.0 years). The average expected duration of the Group’s US defined benefit pension liability at 31 December 2017 is 12.7 years 
(2016: 12.8 years).
The Group’s contributions to its defined benefit pension schemes are determined in consultation with trustees, taking into consideration 
actuarial advice, investment conditions and other local conditions and practices. In 2018, the Group expects to make defined benefit 
contributions of $3.5m to its US schemes. As the Group’s European schemes are in a surplus position the Group does not expect to 
make further contributions in 2018.

Share-based incentives
Essentra operates equity-settled share-based incentive plans for its Executive Directors and employees. The total expense (including 
discontinued operations) in respect of these plans during the year was £1.3m (2016: £2.0m), of which £0.6m (2016: £nil) in relation to 
senior management restructuring was included within exceptional operating costs. The expense also includes a credit of £1.9m which 
relates to the reversal of charges incurred in prior years on options which will no longer vest. Details of these plans are set out below:

18. Financial risk management
Essentra’s activities expose the business to a number of key financial risks which have the potential to affect its ability to achieve  
its business objectives.
The Board has overall responsibility for Essentra’s system of internal control and financial risk management and for reviewing the 
effectiveness of this system. Such a system can only be designed to mitigate, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can therefore only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
Essentra has a centralised treasury function to manage funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk. 
Treasury policies are approved by the Board and cover the nature of the exposure to be hedged, the types of derivatives that may  
be employed and the criteria for investing and borrowing cash. Essentra uses derivatives only to manage currency and interest rate 
risk arising from underlying business activities. No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken. The treasury function is 
subject to periodic independent reviews by the Group Assurance department. Underlying policy assumptions and activities are 
reviewed by the Treasury Committee.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | NOTES 18. Financial risk management continued
The following describes Essentra’s financial risk exposure and management from a quantitative and qualitative perspective.
i) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty to a financial asset or liability fails to meet its contractual obligations, 
and arises principally from trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents. Essentra has no significant individual concentrations  
of credit risk. The following is an overview of how Essentra manages its credit risk exposures.
Trade and other receivables
Essentra’s exposure to credit risk is driven by the profile of its customers. This is influenced by the demographics of the customer base, 
including the industry and country in which customers operate. 
Essentra monitors significant customers’ credit limits and there is an allowance for impairment that represents the estimate of potential 
losses in respect of trade and other receivables. The components of this allowance are a specific allowance for individual losses and  
a collective allowance for losses that have been incurred but not yet identified. The collective allowance takes account of historical 
experience and the profile of customers.
As at 31 December 2017 , gross trade receivables (including amounts relating to disposal group held for sale) were £173.3m  
(2016: £220.1m) of which £39.3m (2016: £45.0m) were past due but not impaired. The ageing analysis of trade receivables past due  
but not impaired is as follows:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | NOTES 18. Financial risk management continued
Derivative assets
Credit risk with respect to derivatives is controlled by limiting transactions to major banking counterparties where internationally 
agreed standard form documentation exists. The credit ratings of these counterparties are monitored.
Cash and cash equivalents
Credit risk relating to cash and cash equivalents is monitored daily, on a counterparty by counterparty basis. The credit limits imposed 
specify the maximum amount of cash which can be invested in, or with, any single counterparty. These limits are determined by 
geographic presence, expertise and credit rating. Essentra monitors the credit ratings of counterparties.
The following credit risk table provides information regarding the credit risk exposure of Essentra by classifying derivative assets and 
cash and cash equivalents (including amounts relating to disposal group held for sale) according to credit ratings of the counterparties. 
AAA is the highest possible rating and all of the assets are neither impaired nor past due.

Essentra’s maximum credit risk exposure is £251.5m (2016: £303.9m) and no collateral is held against this amount (2016: £nil).
ii) Market price risk
Market price risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect income or the value of financial assets 
and liabilities. Essentra has produced a sensitivity analysis that shows the estimated change to the income statement and equity of  
a 1%, 5% or 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all other currencies or an increase or decrease of 50 basis points (“bps”), 
100bps and 200bps in market interest rates. The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates and actual results  
in the future may materially differ. 
Essentra is exposed to two types of market price risk: currency risk and interest rate risk.
a) Currency risk
Essentra publishes its consolidated Financial Statements in sterling but conducts business in several foreign currencies. Therefore  
it is subject to currency risk due to exchange rate movements which affect the translation of results and underlying net assets of its 
operations and their transaction costs. 
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM
157
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | NOTES 18. Financial risk management continued
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations
The majority of Essentra’s net assets are in currencies other than sterling. The Company’s normal policy is to limit the translation 
exposure and the resulting impact on shareholders’ funds through measures such as borrowing in those currencies in which the Group 
has significant net assets. Essentra’s US dollar-denominated assets were approximately 36% (2016: 32%) hedged by the US dollar-
denominated borrowings. Essentra’s euro-denominated assets were approximately 65% hedged by the euro-denominated borrowings 
(2016: 73%). 
Transaction exposure hedging
The majority of Essentra’s transactions are carried out in the functional currencies of its operations and therefore transaction exposure is 
limited. However, where such exposure does occur, Essentra uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to movements 
in exchange rates on its highly probable forecast foreign currency sales and purchases over a period of up to 18 months. 
Essentra does not formally define the proportion of highly probable forecast sales and purchases to hedge, but agrees an appropriate 
percentage on an individual basis with each business by reference to the Group’s risk management policies and prevailing market 
conditions. The Group documents currency derivatives used to hedge its forecast transactions as cash flow hedges. To the extent that 
cash flow hedges are effective, gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs, 
at which point the gains and losses are transferred either to the income statement or to the non-financial asset acquired.
The following table shows Essentra’s sensitivity to a 1%, 5% and 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all currencies.  
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year all currencies’ average rates have been increased or decreased by  
1%, 5% or 10%. The translational effect on equity is limited as a proportion of US dollar and euro exposure is hedged. Accordingly  
the effect on equity is calculated by increasing or decreasing the closing rate of all currencies with an adjustment for the movement 
in currency hedges. It is assumed that all net investment and cash flow hedges will continue to be 100% effective.

b) Interest rate risk
Essentra’s strategy is to ensure that at least 30% of the total debt with maturities of more than one year is protected with fixed 
interest rates or approved interest rate derivatives.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | NOTES 18. Financial risk management continued
The following table shows Essentra’s sensitivity to a 50bps, 100bps and 200bps decrease or increase in sterling, US dollar and euro 
interest rates. To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year, the interest rates on all external floating rate interest 
bearing loans and borrowings have been increased or decreased by 50bps, 100bps or 200bps and the resulting increase or decrease  
in the net interest charge has been adjusted for the effect of Essentra’s interest rate derivatives.

(iii) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that Essentra, although solvent, will encounter difficulties in meeting obligations associated with financial 
liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.
Essentra’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility. Essentra is primarily funded by a series  
of US Private Placement Loan notes from various financial institutions totalling US$155m and syndicated multi-currency five-year 
revolving credit facilities of £285.0m and €100.8m from its banks. The $80m Loan note repaid on its due date in April 2017 was 
replaced with three new Loan notes totalling $75m in November 2017 . A Revolving Credit Facility of £375m was made available upon 
completion of the November 2017 Loan note issuance . The new series of Loan notes have original maturities ranging from seven and 
12 years and the revolving credit facilities mature in November 2022. The refinancing exercise undertaken in November 2017 also 
included the new Revolving Credit Facility of £375.0m. At 31 December 2017 , the available bank facilities totalled £374.2m (2016: £414.2m) 
of which £155.9m (2016: £311.0m) was drawn down. In addition, uncommitted and overdraft facilities are maintained to provide 
short-term flexibility. 
Amounts drawn by Essentra on its committed facilities are subject to standard banking covenants. The financial covenants require 
the net debt to EBITDA ratio to be less than 3.0x and interest cover to be greater than 3.5x. There has been no covenant breach during 
the period. 
Essentra’s available undrawn committed facilities at 31 December were:

Expiring after two years 218.3 103.2
Any loans drawn on these facilities would bear interest at floating rates with reference to LIBOR for the currency and period of the loan.

Total trade and other receivables (including amounts relating to disposal group held for sale) carried at £209.6m (2016: £250.4m) 
include prepayments of £10.5m (2016: £8.4m) which are not financial assets and are therefore excluded from the above analysis.  
Fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps have been calculated at year-end forward exchange  
rates compared to contracted rates. These are determined to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The only financial instrument with fair value determined by reference to significant unobservable inputs, which is classified as  
level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, is the deferred contingent consideration of £4.5m relating to the acquisitions of Micro Plastics  
and a previous acquisition (2016: £1.3m relating to previous acquisitions). The fair value of the deferred contingent consideration  
is estimated based on an assessment of the likely outcome of the acquired business’ financial performance. There have been  
no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy. There are no non-recurring fair value measurements. During the year, a fair 
value gain of £0.1m (2016: fair value gain of £1.1m) in respect of financial instruments at level 3 fair value hierarchy was recognised 
within exceptional items (see note 2), and £nil (2016: £nil) was settled in cash. No other fair value gains or losses were recorded  
in profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
Included within interest bearing loans and borrowings are $155m (2016: $160m) US Private Placement Loan notes. The Loan notes  
are held at amortised cost with a carrying value of £114.8m (2016: £128.7m). The Group estimates that the total fair value of the  
Loan notes at 31 December 2017 is £117 .8m (2016: £136.5m).
All other financial assets, classified as “loans and receivables”, and trade and other payables, classified as “amortised cost’, are held at 
amortised cost and mostly have short terms to maturity. For this reason, their carrying amounts at the reporting date approximate 
the fair values. Unsecured bank loans, included within interest bearing loans and borrowings, incur interest at floating rates and as  
a result their carrying amounts also approximate their fair values at the reporting date.

iv) Capital structure
Essentra defines its capital structure as its equity and non-current interest bearing loans and borrowings, and aims to manage this  
to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for 
other stakeholders.
Essentra sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. Essentra manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in  
the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the 
capital structure, Essentra may return capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, issue new shares or sell assets  
to reduce debt. 
Essentra monitors its capital structure on the basis of the medium-term net debt to EBITDA ratio. EBITDA is defined as operating profit 
before depreciation and other amounts written off property, plant and equipment, share option expense, intangible amortisation and 
exceptional operating items. During 2017 , Essentra’s strategy was to maintain the medium-term net debt to EBITDA ratio in the range 
1.0 to 2.0. This represents a change from 2016, where the strategy was to maintain a ratio in the range 1.0 to 2.5.
The net debt to EBITDA ratios at 31 December were as follows:

20. Reserves
Within retained earnings the Company has deducted the value of own shares purchased for an employee trust and treasury shares 
held by the Company with a total cost of £12.2m (2016: £15.4m). 
Employee trust shares are ordinary shares of the Company held in an employee benefit trust. The purpose of this trust is to hold 
shares in the Company for subsequent transfer to Executive Directors and employees relating to deferred share awards and options 
granted under the Company’s share-based incentive plans. Full details are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration on pages  
97 to 107 . The assets, liabilities and expenditure of the trust have been incorporated in these Financial Statements. At 31 December 
2017 , the trust held 1,179,507 (2016: 1,517 ,883) shares, upon which dividends have been waived, with an aggregate nominal value of 
£0.3m (2016: £0.4m) and market value of £6.2m (2016: £7 .0m).
The Company holds 1,170,925 (2016: 1,286,952) ordinary shares with a nominal value of £0.3m (2016: £0.3m) in treasury. This represents 
0.4% (2016: 0.5%) of the number of ordinary shares in issue.
The other reserve relates to the Group reorganisation, which took place as part of the de-merger from Bunzl plc. It represents the 
difference between Essentra plc’s share capital and Essentra International Limited’s share capital and share premium on 6 June 2005 
and is not distributable.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | NOTES 23. Acquisitions and disposals
2017 acquisition: Micro Plastics
On 12 December 2017 , Essentra acquired 100% of the share capital of Micro Plastics Inc (“Micro Plastics”). Micro Plastics is a leading 
manufacturer and distributor of nylon fasteners and other plastic components for a wide range of industrial end-markets – including 
general industrial, automotives and white goods – and is reported under the Company’s Component Solutions division (Components 
under the new organisational structure – see note 28). The acquisition of Micro Plastics expands the division’s product range, adds 
manufacturing capacity in the US and extends the division’s geographical presence primarily in Mexico.
On acquisition the assets and liabilities of the business acquired were adjusted to reflect their fair values to Essentra. Due to the timing 
of the transaction, the purchase price allocations including the split between goodwill and intangible assets and fair value adjustments 
are provisional and subject to finalisation for up to one year from the date of acquisition.
Had the acquisition been completed on 1 January 2017 , the contribution to the Group’s revenue and operating profit would have been 
£20.1m and £1.4m higher respectively.
Related transaction costs of £0.5m were recognised in the income statement in exceptional operating items.

ESSENTRA PLC COMPANY ACCOUNTING POLICIES
c. Investment in subsidiary 
undertaking
Investment in subsidiary undertaking  
is held at cost less any provision for 
impairment. The Company assesses  
at each balance sheet date whether  
the investment in its subsidiary has  
been impaired.
d. Share-based payments
The fair value of share options is measured 
at grant date. It is recognised as an 
addition to the cost of investment in the 
subsidiary in which the relevant employees 
work over the expected period between 
grant and vesting date of the options, with 
a corresponding adjustment to reserves. 
Detailed disclosures for the share-based 
payment arrangements of the Company 
are provided in note 17 to the consolidated 
Financial Statements.
e. Own shares
The shares held in the Essentra Employee 
Benefit Trust for the purpose of fulfilling 
obligations in respect of share incentive 
plans are treated as belonging to the 
Company and are deducted from its 
retained earnings. The cost of shares 
held directly (treasury shares) is also 
deducted from retained earnings.
f. Dividends
Dividend distributions to the Company’s 
shareholders are recognised as a liability  
in the period in which they are approved  
by the shareholders of the Company  
(final dividend) or paid (interim dividend).
Dividend income is recognised when the 
right to receive payment is established.
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM
172
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | ESSENTRA PLC COMPANY ACCOUNTING POLICIES g. Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are 
recorded using the rate of exchange  
ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated using the rate of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date and the 
gains or losses on translation are included 
in the profit and loss account. Exchange 
differences arising from movements in 
spot rates are included in the profit and 
loss account as exchange gains or losses, 
while those arising from the interest 
differential elements of forward currency 
contracts are included in external interest 
income or expense.
h. Financial assets
Loans and receivables are non-derivative 
financial assets with fixed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They are included in current 
assets, except for those with maturities 
greater than 12 months after the end of 
the reporting period which are classified  
as non-current assets. The Company’s 
loans and receivables comprise receivables 
in the balance sheet.
Receivables are recognised initially at  
fair value and subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less provision for impairment. 
Interest income is recognised accordingly 
using the effective interest method.
i. Financial liabilities
Interest bearing loans and borrowings  
and other financial liabilities (excluding 
derivatives) are initially recognised at fair 
value net of transaction costs incurred. 
They are subsequently held at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method. 
Any difference between the proceeds,  
net of transaction costs, and the 
settlement or redemption of borrowings  
is recognised in profit or loss over the  
term of the borrowings.
The Company holds financial instruments 
which hedge the net investments in  
the foreign operations of its subsidiary 
undertakings. Gains and losses on these 
instruments are recognised in the profit 
and loss account of the Company.
j. Taxation
Income tax in the profit and loss account 
comprises current and deferred tax. 
Income tax is recognised in the profit and 
loss account except to the extent that  
it relates to items recognised in equity  
or other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable  
on the taxable income for the year  
using the applicable tax rates enacted  
or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date and any adjustment to tax 
payable in prior years.
Deferred tax is provided, using the balance 
sheet liability method, on temporary 
differences arising between the tax bases 
and the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the Financial Statements.  
The following temporary differences are 
not provided for: goodwill not deductible 
for tax purposes, the initial recognition  
of assets or liabilities that affect neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss,  
and differences relating to investments  
in subsidiaries to the extent that they will  
not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates 
that are expected to apply when the related 
deferred tax asset or liability is settled,  
using the applicable tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance  
sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only  
to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profit will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised. Deferred 
tax assets are reduced to the extent that  
it is no longer probable that the related 
tax benefit will be realised.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | ESSENTRA PLC COMPANY NOTES INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ESSENTRA PLC
Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion:
 > Essentra plc’s Group financial statements and parent company financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a true  
and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit  
and cash flows for the year then ended;
 > the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
 > the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable 
law); and
 > the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards  
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report, which comprise: the Consolidated and Company 
Balance Sheets as at 31 December 2017; the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Consolidated and Company Statements of Changes in Equity, and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year then 
ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies; the accounting 
policies; and the notes to the financial statements.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB
As explained in the Accounting Policies to the financial statements, the Group, in addition to applying IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
In our opinion, the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided 
to the Group or the parent company.
Other than those disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the Group or the parent 
company in the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017 .

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT Our audit approach
Overview
 > Overall Group materiality: £3.7m, based on 5% of profit before tax before intangibles 
amortisation and exceptional items.
 > Overall parent company materiality: £7 .1m, based on 1% of net assets.
 > There were no significant components within the Group.
 > We performed full scope audit work on 25 reporting units, and specified procedures 
over certain balances on 33 reporting units.
 > This provided coverage of 67% revenue, 62% profit before tax, and 67% net assets.
 > Tax liabilities.
 > Goodwill impairment.
 > Presentation of exceptional items.
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. 
In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates 
that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the Group and the industries in which it operates, 
and considered the risk of acts by the Group which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud. We designed 
audit procedures at Group and significant component level to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment 
by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. We focused on laws and regulations that could give rise 
to a material misstatement in the Group and parent company financial statements, including, but not limited to, the Companies Act 
2006, the Listing Rules, Tax legislation, Employment regulation, Health and Safety legislation, and other legislation specific to the 
industries in which the Group operates. Our tests included, but were not limited to, review of correspondence with the regulators, review of 
correspondence with legal advisors, enquiries of management, enquiries with component auditors’ and review of internal audit reports 
in so far as they related to the financial statements. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above  
and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial 
statements, the less likely we would become aware of it.
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including testing journals and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors 
that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation  
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the 
results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by  
our audit.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Tax liabilities
The Group operates in a number of tax jurisdictions and recognises 
tax based on interpretation of local laws and regulations which 
are sometimes uncertain. At 31 December 2017 , the Group has 
current and non-current tax payables of £43.1m. Where the 
amount of tax payable is uncertain, the directors are required  
to exercise significant judgment in determining the appropriate 
amount to provide in respect of potential tax exposures and 
uncertain tax positions.
We focused on the judgements made by management in 
assessing the likelihood and quantification of material exposures.
See page 129 for management’s disclosure of this  
significant judgement.
We assessed management’s process for identifying uncertain 
tax positions and the accounting policy for providing for tax 
exposures.
We considered management’s assessment of known areas of 
uncertainty and the provisions held against these. Through 
review of management’s analysis of these positions, including 
testing of detailed workings and consideration of advice received 
from their tax advisors, we determined that the provisions 
recognised and the disclosures in the financial statements  
were reasonable.
Goodwill impairment
The Group has goodwill of £347 .5m. In the prior year an 
impairment of £123.9m was taken against the Health & Personal 
Care Packaging (‘HPC’) division and further impairment risk was 
identified in the HPC division based upon underlying trading 
performance of particular components and the planned closure 
of a site in the UK.
All cash generating units (CGUs) containing goodwill and 
indefinite-lived intangible assets must be tested for impairment 
annually. Management must also determine the recoverable 
amount for other finite-lived assets where impairment 
indicators are identified.
The impairment reviews performed by management contain  
a number of significant judgements and estimates including 
revenue growth, profit margins and discount rates. A change  
in these assumptions can result in a material change in the 
valuation of the assets.
See page 129 for management’s disclosure of this  
significant judgement.
We have assessed the methodology applied by management in 
performing their impairment review including the identification 
of CGUs under the new divisional structure, and the 
appropriateness of the valuation models.
We evaluated the future cash flow forecasts for each CGU, 
including short term cash flows, and the process by which  
they were drawn up, and tested the underlying value in use 
calculations. In doing this, we compared the cash flow forecasts 
to the latest Board approved plans and compared prior year 
budget to actual data, in order to assess the quality of the 
forecasting process. The results of our evaluation proved to  
be satisfactory. 
We also tested key assumptions including exchange rates and 
long-term growth rates by comparing them to third party 
published economic and industry forecasts; and the discount 
rate by recalculating the Group’s cost of capital. In respect to 
the HPC division we specifically considered the assumptions 
regarding the recovery of site operating margin to industry 
average levels across the forecast period in light of management’s 
action plans to improve the performance of the business.  
We also verified the assumptions regarding industry average 
performance levels to third party data. We found the 
assumptions to be reasonable.
We performed sensitivity analysis around the key assumptions 
to ascertain the extent of change in those assumptions that, 
either individually or collectively, would be required for the 
goodwill to be impaired. As included within note 8, a reasonably 
possible change in assumptions for the HPC division would 
result in an impairment. However this is expected as the value 
was impaired down to the value in use during 2016 and therefore 
the headroom against which assumptions are sensitised is low.
Disclosures included within note 8 have also been assessed  
for compliance with requirements and deemed reasonable.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Presentation of exceptional items
The financial statements include certain items which are 
disclosed as exceptional. The nature of these exceptional items 
is explained within the Group accounting policy and includes 
transaction costs relating to acquisitions and disposals of 
businesses, acquisition integration and restructuring costs,  
and other items such as impairment.
In continuing operations these exceptional costs relate to the 
fundamental restructuring programme of £19.2m, the closure  
of the Newport cartons site of £35.4m, and acquisition and 
disposal costs of £1.6m. In discontinuing operations exceptional 
items comprise a gain on disposal of the Porous Technologies 
business of £132.4m. In addition, £11,4m relating to the benefit 
arising as a result of the US tax reform has been disclosed as 
exceptional.
We focused on this area because items classified as exceptional 
require judgement by the directors as to whether the items 
meet the definition in the Group’s accounting policy.
Consistency in identifying and disclosing items as exceptional is 
important to maintain comparability of the results year on year.
See page 129 for management’s disclosure of this  
significant judgement.
We assessed the appropriateness of the Group’s accounting 
policy for the recognition of exceptional items with reference  
to the applicable accounting standards.
We evaluated whether each of the items disclosed as exceptional 
met the criteria set out in the accounting policy and were 
consistent with the treatment adopted in previous accounting 
periods, to confirm that items were appropriately classified.
We agreed a sample of restructuring costs incurred to invoices 
or other form of evidence such as payroll records. Specifically, 
we have considered the inclusion of certain asset impairment 
charges and an onerous contract as part of the exceptional 
item and we are satisfied that these charges have arisen as  
a result of the strategic review process.
We tested a sample of site closure costs incurred to invoices or 
other form of evidence such as payroll records and the property 
lease agreement. We have specifically considered the nature of 
these costs and concluded that the classification as exceptional 
is appropriate. 
We read the sale and purchase agreement for disposal of  
the Porous Technologies business and verified the proceeds to 
bank receipts. Adjustments to the profit on disposal were also 
sampled and agreed to supporting documentation such as 
invoice or asset write off details. We consider the classification 
to be appropriate given the nature of the disposal meets the 
definition of a discontinued operation.
Other acquisition and disposal costs were agreed to invoices  
to confirm they meet the group policy definition for  
exceptional items. 
We have considered the presentation of benefit arising as  
a result of the US tax reform as exceptional and agreed the 
calculation of the benefit to management’s impact assessment 
and detailed deferred tax workings without exception.
The disclosures included in note 2 were read and  
deemed reasonable.
We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the parent company to communicate in our report.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the parent company, the accounting processes and controls, and the 
industry in which they operate.
The Group is split into three divisions being Components Solutions, Health & Personal Care Packaging, and Filter Products. Each division 
consists of a large number of controller sites spread globally across 37 territories. There are 268 reporting units within the consolidation, 
which include the controller sites and other consolidation units.
We did not identify any individually significant components within the Group, with the largest contribution to revenue being 6% from 
one controller site, and the average being 1%. We determined the most effective approach was to engage PwC local component teams 
to perform full scope procedures over 20 reporting units, with the Group audit team performing full scope audit work over a further  
5 reporting units. In addition, specified audit procedures were performed by component auditors over certain balances, including 
revenue, at a further 6 reporting units in the Americas. This approach ensures that appropriate audit coverage has been obtained  
over all financial statement line items.
Where work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement we needed to have in that 
audit work to ensure we could conclude that sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained for the Group financial statements 
as a whole. We issued written instructions to all component auditors and had regular communications with them throughout the audit 
cycle. This included a clearance meeting with each component team and review of all significant matters reported.
In addition the Group engagement partner has visited controller sites in the US, Singapore, Thailand and UK, including meeting with 
local audit teams and local management as part of these visits.
Based on the detailed audit work performed across the Group, we have gained coverage of 67% of total revenue, 62% of profit before 
tax, and 67% of net assets.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.  
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of 
our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, 
both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM
186
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements
Parent company financial 
statements
Overall materiality £3.7m £7.1m
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax before intangibles 
amortisation and exceptional items.
1% of net assets.
Rationale for benchmark applied The Group is profit-oriented, therefore it 
is considered most appropriate to apply a 
rule of thumb based upon a profit-based 
benchmark. The directors, management 
and the users of the Group financial 
statements focus on adjusted numbers, 
being adjusted operating profit, adjusted 
net income or adjusted pre-tax profit. 
The Group defines “adjusted” as 
excluding the impact of intangible 
amortisation and exceptional items. 
Based on this, we consider an adjusted 
metric of profit before tax before 
intangibles amortisation and exceptional 
items to be the most appropriate 
benchmark.
The entity is a holding company of the 
rest of the Group and is not a trading 
entity. Therefore an asset based measure 
is considered appropriate.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality.  
The range of materiality allocated across components was between £0.2m and £3.3m. Certain components were audited to  
a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £0.2m  
(Group audit) and £0.2m (Parent company audit) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted 
reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add  
or draw attention to in respect of the directors’ statement in  
the financial statements about whether the directors considered 
it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting  
in preparing the financial statements and the directors’ 
identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and 
the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern 
over a period of at least twelve months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the directors’ statement relating  
to Going Concern in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT Reporting on other information
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ 
report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this 
report, any form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are 
required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies 
Act 2006 have been included.
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, (CA06), 
ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as 
described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic report and Directors’ report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and parent company and their environment obtained in the course  
of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency  
or liquidity of the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
 > The directors’ confirmation on page 72 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal  
risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
 > The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
 > The directors’ explanation on page 111 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially 
less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; 
checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”);  
and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the Group and parent company 
and their environment obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules).
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 | WWW.ESSENTRAPLC.COM
188
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT Other code provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when:
 > The statement given by the directors, on page 71, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced  
and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s and parent company’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and parent 
company obtained in the course of performing our audit.
 > The section of the Annual Report on pages 77 to 78 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
 > The directors’ statement relating to the parent company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from  
a relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with  
the Companies Act 2006. (CA06).
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on pages 112 to 113, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true  
and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation  
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative 
but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial 
statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company’s members as a body in accordance  
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

 > adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not  
been received from branches not visited by us; or
 > certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 > the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not  
in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Appointment
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed by the directors on 20 April 2017 to audit the  
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 and subsequent financial periods. This is therefore our first year
