Integration and future growth
We have made good progress  
in integrating T ullett Prebon  
and ICAP .
Integration
The acquisition of ICAP and formation 
of TP ICAP in December 2016 was 
transformational for our stakeholders. One of 
the driving factors behind the transaction was 
the potential for the combined Company to 
successfully integrate and generate significant 
synergies and cost savings. These cost savings 
are focused on our support and infrastructure 
areas and the process of the integration will 
take three years to achieve, with 2017 being 
the first year of the integration.
As we stated last year, our synergy target is 
for £80m of synergies by 2019 and a further 
£20m of annualised synergies from process 
optimisation by the end of 2020. Our initial 
target was to achieve £10m of synergies in 
2017 followed by £50m in 2018 and £20m in 
2019. In 2017, we achieved synergy savings 
and reduced costs of £27m, compared with 
proforma 2016, and annualised run rate 
synergy savings of £52m. The costs to 
achieve these synergies were £79m, which 
compares to an original target of £40m. 
Although we are ahead of our initial 
guidance we reiterate our synergy target 
of £100m synergies by 2020 as many of 
the synergy savings in 2017 have been 
accelerated from 2018. 
Our approach to the integration has been to 
bring the two broadly similar global support 
functions together in a manner that ensured 
and enhanced delivery of service and in a 
way that improves efficiency and reduces 
costs. For example, we have created single 
support functions in Finance, Legal, Risk, 
Compliance and HR by removing duplication 
and successfully co-locating staff. The 
management structure of the Company 
has also been unified so that there are 
single leaders for all divisional, functional 
and corporate support areas. 
Over the next 12 months, the integration will 
focus on the transformation of our services 
as we build for the future. This will involve 
the delivery of a more efficient and scalable 
IT and operations structure as well as 
consolidating our real estate footprint. This 
will further enhance our ability to service our 
customers in an efficient manner. We are also 
planning to further increase headcount in our 
Belfast Support Services Centre as part of 
the second phase of the integration, which 
will further enhance our IT capabilities and 
improve efficiency within the organisation.
As a result we anticipate that, whilst total 
synergies will be in line with our £100m target, 
greater synergies are expected to be achieved 
outside IT than previously anticipated.
TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
2 Strategic report Future Growth 
The acquisition of ICAP has opened up a 
number of growth opportunities for the 
combined business as we leverage our scale 
and position as the largest interdealer broker 
in the world. We are focused on integrating 
the two businesses but it is also important 
that we continue to evolve and expand our 
Company to adapt and compete in a fast 
changing financial services market place. 
Global Broking
For our Global Broking division we are 
planning to invest in new client facing 
technology that will improve the speed 
and ease of execution for our customers as 
well as making our brokers more productive. 
During 2017, we invested in a number of 
new products that achieved these aims. This 
included TP US credit, a volume matching 
solution that is purely electronic and has 
generated £1.2m of revenues during the 
period. We have also added hybrid volume 
matching capability in UK gilts, and 
electronic capabilities in US high yield bonds. 
£27m
In 2017 we achieved £27m of synergies¹
£52m
2017 year end annualised run rate  
of synergy savings¹
We plan to build on this success in 2018 and 
expand our Electronic Markets team that is 
responsible for improving hybrid platform 
functionality; developing pure-electronic 
services; and enhancing our clients’ 
workflows. Through the evolution of these 
solutions, we continue to work hard to 
provide our customers with more efficient 
and effective ways of trading via multiple 
protocols, such as Central Limit Order 
Books (‘CLOB’), Volume Matching, Crossing 
Solutions and Request for Quote (‘RFQ’). 
Institutional Services 
Our Institutional Services division has recently 
been established to focus on providing 
brokerage and execution services for buy-side 
clients such as hedge funds, asset managers 
and insurance companies. We believe that 
there is a need in capital markets for a high 
quality agency sales and execution services 
business, that does not take balance sheet 
risk, but acts as a key source of liquidity. 
We can source this liquidity from traditional 
and non-traditional pools that may not be 
available to the buy-side and importantly 
we can do this without conflicts of interest 
and on an anonymous basis. 
We have made good progress in expanding 
this business with the acquisition of COEX 
Partners in November 2017 . COEX provides 
trade and execution services in listed 
derivatives and OTC FX for a range of hedge 
funds, asset managers and other clients. The 
Institutional Services division will continue 
to focus on expanding the business both 
organically and inorganically over the next 12 
months as it looks to capitalise on a growing 
demand for high-quality execution services. 
Data & Analytics 
On completion of the ICAP acquisition 
TP ICAP became the leading provider of 
over the counter (‘OTC’) pricing data in 
the world. This is an important part of 
our business and we have for the first time 
disclosed the gross operating margin on the 
£112m of revenues we achieved in 2017 . The 
gross operating margin of the business was 
62% in 2017 (2016: 67%). This data margin 
reflects minimal cost of sales. The reduction 
in the margin in 2017 reflects the investment 
the business has made for MiFID II and to 
develop a market data distribution platform.
In 2017, we hired Eric Sinclair from the 
Toronto Stock Exchange where he spent 
16 years building out their data business. 
Eric now runs Data & Analytics at TP ICAP. 
We are in a unique position as TP ICAP as 
we have highly valuable proprietary OTC 
data. As part of our overall strategy, we 
are looking to expand our data offering 
and take advantage of the numerous 
opportunities that present themselves, 
from regulation to advanced analytics 
and cloud based technologies. 
Energy & Commodities
TP ICAP is the world’s largest Energy & 
Commodities broker with offices in 20 
locations globally, and coverage of a broad 
set of energy and commodities products 
across the three brands we operate (Tullett 
Prebon, ICAP and PVM). Our strategy is to 
continue to grow our presence through 
recruiting more brokers and through bolt-on 
acquisitions. At the start of 2018, we 
acquired SCS Brokers, a US-based oil and 
softs brokerage company, and we will 
continue to look for further value-enhancing 
opportunities in a consolidating market. 
At the same time, we will look to make the 
business and our brokers more efficient by 
investing in our technology platforms so as 
to exploit our leading market position.

Our business model
We provide our clients with a  
wide choice of execution services,  
data products and analytics.
How we create value
The Group’s business model is primarily 
based on generating a return from providing 
an intermediation service to clients, enabling 
them to trade efficiently and effectively. This 
service can be provided without actively 
taking credit and market risk. As well as 
providing an intermediary service, we also 
have a Data & Analytics business that sells 
OTC pricing data that is generated from our 
broking activities. This data is proprietary 
as well as neutral.
Our business is structured along business 
division (see pull-out) and regional lines, 
and is operated under competing brands as 
this provides our clients with different sources 
of liquidity. The intermediary service we 
provide is across a wide range of financial 
and commodity products, which are traded 
in numerous markets and geographies. These 
trades may be bespoke in nature, complex 
and of high nominal value so the access our 
brokers have to the largest pools of liquidity 
provides us with a competitive advantage. 
Our brokers’ relationships with market 
participants, together with the operations 
and infrastructure they are provided with, 
are key determinants of the ongoing success 
of the Group and a key source of value.
The graphic opposite shows the way we 
operate across voice execution, electronic 
execution and hybrid voice execution. For 
the majority of the products that we trade, 
TP ICAP operates electronic venues. Every 
aspect of an electronic trade, from order 
capture to external messaging, is offered 
electronically to our clients who will choose 
the most efficient form of execution for the 
product they are trading. At TP ICAP we add 
the voice broking element to our electronic 
capabilities as our highly skilled brokers can 
add real value through the lifecycle of a trade.

and operating 
review see p18
TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
4 Strategic report Executing Broker
The remainder of the Group’s broking 
revenue is derived from operating as an 
Executing Broker, where the Group executes 
transactions on certain regulated exchanges 
as per client orders, and then ‘gives-up’ the 
trade to the relevant client (or its clearing 
member). The majority of the Group’s 
revenue generated under the Executing 
Broker model relates to listed equity 
derivatives and listed interest rate futures 
and options.
Our people
Our workforce includes a truly global range 
of nationalities and backgrounds of skilled 
and specialist brokers and data experts 
who have extensive product and industry 
experience and deep and trusted 
relationships with clients. 
They work in close partnership with our 
technology developers who are experienced 
at developing applications, software and 
electronic platforms that are tailored to the 
client needs of the markets in which we focus.
Our businesses are supported by our finance, 
operations, risk, compliance, legal, HR and 
facilities functions.
We pride ourselves on our dynamic, 
professional, ambitious and collaborative 
culture. Our values of Honesty, Integrity, 
Respect and Excellence underpin everything 
we do. We have a zero tolerance approach to 
regulatory and professional ethics violations. 
To read our financial 
and operating 
review see p18
This ‘hybrid’ form of execution takes place 
on regulated venues where our emphasis 
on regulatory compliance and appropriate 
conduct and culture are paramount. By 
providing market insight and the ability to 
source liquidity for large and complex trades 
we believe that our brokers will continue to 
be central to the trading of OTC derivatives. 
Name Passing
Around three quarters of the Group’s broking 
revenue is derived from Name Passing 
activities, where the Group identifies and 
introduces a buyer and seller who wish to 
transact but is not a counterparty to the 
trade itself, and where its exposure to a 
client is limited to outstanding invoices 
for commission. Almost all of the Group’s 
activities in derivatives, such as forward FX, 
FX options, interest rate swaps, interest rate 
options, credit derivatives, and the vast 
majority of the Energy & Commodities 
business are transacted under the Name 
Passing model.
Matched Principal
Around one fifth of the Group’s broking 
revenue is derived from Matched Principal 
activities, where the Group is the counterparty 
to both the buyer and the seller of a matching 
trade. The vast majority of the Group’s 
activities conducted under the Matched 
Principal model are in government and 
agency bonds, municipal bonds, mortgage 
backed securities, and corporate bonds. 
The Group bears the risk of counterparty 
default during the period between 
execution and settlement of the trade.

5 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements Our strategy
The Group continues to develop  
its business in the wholesale financial, energy  
and commodities, data and institutional services 
markets to deliver superior performance,  
underpinned by strong financial discipline.
Our strategy
The Group will build revenue in  
the most attractive areas of the  
markets through:
1 Seeking to add brokers to maintain 
and grow presence in those products 
with high market attractiveness 
where the business has a high ability 
to compete, and where its presence 
can be developed.
2 Seeking to continue to build the 
business’s activities in energy 
and commodities products.
3 Extending the business’s broking 
offering to service institutional 
investors such as asset managers, 
hedge funds and insurers (the 
‘buy-side’).
4 Continuing to develop Data & 
Analytics where the product suite and 
delivery channels can be expanded.
 
The Group will improve the functions  
that support the revenue generating 
divisions through:
5 Investing in technology and 
realigning the mix between 
owned and outsourced platforms to 
maximise the business’s intellectual 
property to ensure that the business 
has the technology capabilities that 
customers seek.
6 Investing in client relationship 
management to bring focus and 
discipline to how the business targets 
and covers clients, to seek to broaden 
and institutionalise relationships.
7 Developing the business’s 
capability to source, execute 
and integrate acquisitions.

6 Strategic report What we did
During 2017, we took actions to develop our business as a leader in wholesale  
OTC markets in broking and information services through:
New products:
 > adding hybrid volume matching capability in UK gilts; 
 > enhancing electronic capabilities in US high yield bonds;
 > increased electronic capabilities in US Corporate bonds;
 > adding new pricing data sets in LNG (liquid natural gas), including JKM (Japan, Korea 
Marker), PVB (Spain) and DKI ( Dubai Kuwait, India);
 > introduce a Foreign Exchange Currency Option (‘FXO’) Request for Quote (‘RFQ’) solution 
which captures hybrid and pure electronic liquidity and provides real time option pricing, 
analytics and dynamic historic data; and 
 > expanding the African products we transact in to include non-deliverable forwards 
(‘NDFs’) and sovereign bonds, and Foreign Exchange Currency (‘FX’) for Mauritius,  
Zambia and Botswana.
New trading types:
 > preparing for the launch of 11 venues, six OTFs and five MTFs, to be ready for the go-live  
date for MiFID II;
 > acquiring a specialist listed futures and options broker, COEX, adding more than 
50 brokers in London, Paris and New York, that serves a diverse client base; and
 > redesigning our client onboarding process for our Institutional Services division by 
providing a single point of contact from inception to conclusion and then subsequent 
client relationship management.
New initiatives: 
 > launching ‘Big Push’ days in our post trade risk mitigation service, TP Match, resulting 
in record nominal value of transactions processed in individual runs and significantly 
enhanced overall volumes; and
 > building our brand awareness through the sponsorship of the cycling event, L ’Etape. 
What we are going to do
In the coming year, we will continue to 
develop and enhance our venues, add to 
our brokerage footprint, expand and 
improve the tools that we provide our 
brokers, and enhance our corporate 
services and clients through:
 > integrating the corporate services to 
build a lean, scalable and efficient 
operating model;
 > reviewing our broking capability footprint 
in TP ICAP and hiring selectively to add 
to our roster of products and expertise;
 > proactively engaging with our clients 
to understand clearly their needs and 
to collaborate in technology-based 
strategies for their needs;
 > ensuring the robustness of our 
venues and continuing to provide 
an environment where our clients 
can transact with confidence;
 > enhancing our electronic platforms 
to provide easier client workflow, 
greater convenience and ease of use; 
 > capturing a greater proportion of the 
data produced on our venues and 
converting that into products that 
meet our clients’ requirements;
 > using our technology to provide clients 
with easier ways to manage large flows 
of market information to enable them 
to increase their efficiency in selecting 
and executing trades; and
 > establishing our Belfast Support Services 
Centre for an array of support functions.

Comment
Revenue growth reflects not only the market 
conditions we operate in but also our ability 
to further diversify and strengthen our 
franchise. Revenue growth in the past has 
been driven not only by volatility and market

9 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements Chairman’s statement
Dear shareholder,
We started the year as TP ICAP plc and our 
task was clear: to progress the integration 
of the Tullett Prebon and ICAP businesses 
and to maintain our focus on enhancing 
the services we offer to our clients. I am 
pleased to report that, on both targets, 
we have succeeded.
Trading and dividend
Reported revenue of £1,757m in 2017 was 
4% higher than in 2016 on a pro forma basis 
(1% higher at constant exchange rates) with 
underlying operating profit increasing by 
10% to £263m
1 
compared to pro forma 2016. 
On a statutory basis operating profit 
decreased by 44% on a pro forma basis 
to £102m reflecting the costs to achieve 
synergies arising from the integration. Our 
underlying performance reflected improving 
levels of activity in our rates business, as 
the long period of near-zero interest rates 
appears to be coming to an end, and a 
strong performance in our oil businesses. 
Rupert Robson
Chairman
Our Information and Risk Management 
Services businesses showed pleasing growth, 
and we continued to build capabilities 
and revenues in our most recently formed 
division, Institutional Services. 
The underlying operating profit margin in 
2017 of 15.0% was 0.8 percentage points 
higher than in 2016 on a pro forma basis. The 
statutory operating profit margin in 2017 of 
5.8% was 4.9% lower than in 2016 on a pro 
forma basis. Basic earnings per share was 
15.8 pence and underlying earnings per 
share for 2017 of 33.3 pence was 0.7 pence 
lower than 2016 on a pro forma basis.
The Board declared an interim dividend of 
5.6 pence per share paid on 10 November 
2017 and is recommending a final dividend 
of 11.25 pence per share to be paid on 17 May 
2018 (with a record date of 6 April 2018). 
Board and governance
The Board is committed to high standards 
of corporate governance and to instilling 
the right culture, behaviour and approach 
to how we do business. 
I said in the Annual Report for 2016 that we 
were seeking to expand the Board. In the last 
six months, we have appointed Edmund Ng 
and Michael Heaney to the Board as 
Independent Non-executive Directors. 
Edmund brings many years of experience of 
the Asian financial markets having worked in 
the asset management and investment bank 
sectors in Hong Kong. He also held a senior 
position at the Hong Kong Monetary 
Authority. Michael brings expertise of the 
US markets, having held senior positions 
at Morgan Stanley in New York. He is also 
Chairman of the Fixed Income Market 
Structure Advisory Committee at the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission.
TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
10 Strategic report The Board has a wide range of relevant 
expertise, perspectives and insights. It has 
also recently achieved greater diversity. All 
this will prove invaluable given the greater 
complexity of our Group following the 
acquisition and the fast pace of change in 
the sector in which we operate. It will also be 
important as we look to take advantage of 
the wider opportunities available to TP ICAP . 
This latter task will rise up the Board’s 
agenda as the integration process reaches 
its conclusion.
During 2017, we held our June board 
meeting in New York and our September 
meeting in Singapore. We used those 
occasions to spend a number of days 
meeting our employees at many levels in 
those regions. This has enhanced the Board’s 
understanding of the TP ICAP business and 
I hope has also increased the visibility and 
accessibility of the Non-executive Directors. 
It has enabled us to gain greater insight 
into the behaviour, beliefs and values 
that underpin our organisation and how 
we should shape and embed our culture. 
I have addressed this matter in more detail 
on page 49.
We continued to engage with our 
shareholders during 2017 . The Board 
stays abreast of the development of 
shareholder views on governance, 
remuneration, and other key issues. 
During 2018 we will examine how the Group 
engages with the many other stakeholders 
who are part of the TP ICAP network and 
how we ensure we understand their 
perspectives in the decisions we take.
Outlook
Throughout 2018 we will continue to focus on 
achieving the synergies of the combination of 
T ullett Prebon and ICAP , and the optimisation 
and transformation of our business model. 
We will invest to ensure we can thrive  
in a changing regulatory and political 
environment, and look for other 
opportunities to deliver our objectives 
to build revenue and raise the quality 
and quantity of earnings.

11 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements Chief Executive’s review
Dear shareholder,
On 31 December 2016, Tullett Prebon 
acquired the Global Broking and 
Information Business of ICAP plc, creating 
TP ICAP, the world’s largest interdealer 
broker. As a result, 2017 was a year of 
significant change, growth and achievement 
for our new firm and our employees. 
TP ICAP has a unique position at the heart 
of the world’s financial and energy markets, 
providing liquidity and data to a broad 
and diverse array of market participants 
including banks, asset managers, hedge 
funds and energy and commodities firms. 
John Phizackerley
Chief Executive
Financial performance
During 2017, we have seen the benefit of 
the diversity of our product portfolio and 
geographic footprint and this has enabled 
us to deliver a resilient performance in a 
low interest rate, low volatility environment.
Underlying operating profit was £263m, 10% 
higher than the pro forma for 2016 of £240m 
and underlying operating profit margin of 
15.0% is 0.8 percentage points higher than 
in 2016 pro forma. Underlying earnings 
and earnings per share were £184m and 
33.3 pence per share compared to £188m 
and 34.0 pence per share pro forma for 2016.
Reflecting costs of the integration, statutory 
operating profit was £102m, 44% lower 
than the pro forma for 2016 of £181m and 
statutory operating profit margin of 5.8% is 
4.9 percentage points lower than in 2016 pro 
forma. Statutory earnings and earnings per 
share were £87m and 15.8 pence per share 
compared to £128m and 23.2 pence per 
share pro forma for 2016.
Integration progress
A key driver behind the transaction that 
created TP ICAP was the identification of 
synergies inherent in its combination. At the 
time of announcement of the transaction we 
estimated this to be £60m per year with the 
full run-rate to be achieved over three years. 
This has subsequently increased to a stretch 
target of £100m per year to be reached by 
2020. The majority of these savings come 
from support and infrastructure areas. 
Launching the integration was our top 
priority in 2017 and by the end of that  
first year we achieved annualised  
run-rate savings of £52m per year. 
We started the integration by appointing 
a unified senior management team made 
up of the best people from the two firms. 
TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
12 Strategic report Single leaders for divisional, functional and 
corporate support areas were key to providing 
early clarity and direction to the organisation. 
At the same time, we moved quickly to 
constitute our governance structures, 
committees, policies and procedures. We have 
created single support functions in Finance, 
Legal, Risk, Compliance and HR, successfully 
co-located support staff and removed 
duplication. We have migrated our finance 
systems on to a single general ledger 
platform, rationalised our internal approvals 
processes, brought in globally aligned “Know 
Your Customer” and anti money laundering 
policies, and consolidated our swap execution 
facilities (‘SEFs’) from three to two. We have 
also embarked on the process of reducing the 
large number of redundant legal entities in 
the new combined corporate structure. 
In 2018, we are moving to phase 2 of 
the integration programme which will 
take us increasingly from integration to 
transformation. Not only do we aim to 
combine the infrastructure platforms of the 
two businesses but we seek to optimise and 
transform our operations to create a more 
efficient and scalable corporate function 
infrastructure. We will increase our 
capabilities and headcount in our Support 
Services Centre in Belfast as part of this 
programme. We also plan to extract 
efficiencies from procurement and from 
our non-compensation expense base.
In mid-2018, we will move in to our new US 
Headquarters in Lower Manhattan where all 
our New York brokers will be located under 
one roof. In addition, our combined UK-
based Energy & Commodities team will be 
housed in a single location in London’s West 
End. There are other office moves planned 
including a new London office in early 2019.
Business development
Our business lines are organised into four 
global divisions (Global Broking, Energy 
& Commodities, Data & Analytics and 
Institutional Services) and they all have 
inherent growth opportunities in 2018. 
Global Broking is the largest contributor to 
revenues and profits in the Group. Our focus 
is very much on increasing productivity 
through a range of initiatives including 
adopting and leveraging technology, 
selective new hires, active management of 
underperformers and a few selective desk 
mergers to leverage stronger relationships 
and liquidity pools where appropriate.
We provide our customers with efficient 
and effective ways of trading via multiple 
protocols, such as Central Limit Order 
Books (‘CLOB’), Volume Matching, Crossing 
Solutions and Request For Quote (‘RFQ’).
The Electronic Markets team is an integral 
part of the Global Broking division and is 
responsible for improving hybrid platform 
functionality, developing pure-electronic 
services, and enhancing our clients’ 
workflows. In 2017, our electronic Volume 
Matching platforms were functionally 
enriched and deployed into new products 
globally, resulting in record traded volumes 
and revenues were up 30% year-on-year. 
We launched an RFQ platform for FX 
Options, delivering a hybrid workflow with 
effective price discovery and the ability to 
disseminate liquidity to the market through 
an Applications Programme Interface (‘API’). 
Our brokers remain vital to our clients and 
key to our success and we focus on retaining 
star performers. While average broker 
pay-outs as a percentage of commissions 
declined again in 2017, actual revenue 
and contribution per broker rose.
TP ICAP is the world’s largest Energy & 
Commodities broker with offices in 20 
locations globally and coverage of a very 
broad set of products across three brands – 
T ullett Prebon, ICAP and PVM. It also has 
our most diverse customer base, with nearly 
90% of its revenue coming from non-banking 
clients, such as commodity producers and 
consumers, refiners, energy companies, 
utilities, hedge funds, asset managers and 
trading companies. 
“TP ICAP ended 2017 a larger ,  
stronger and more confident business.  
Our Group is more diverse in product  
offering and client reach than 
ever before.”

13 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements Chief Executive’s review 
continued
Average revenue per broker is the highest in 
this division. In January 2018, we acquired 
SCS Brokers, a US-based oil and softs 
brokerage company. We are consolidating 
seven back office deal management systems 
into one global platform. As in other parts of 
our business, we invest in technology, taking 
opportunities to deploy innovative solutions 
to give our clients the best service. 
In 2017, the Coalition survey of major bank 
revenues noted that commodities revenues 
have reached their lowest levels since 2006 
because of ongoing weakness in energy 
products, lower volatility, reduced client 
activity and trading underperformance.
Despite this difficult environment, we 
retained our leading position. With our 
diversified portfolio of businesses we are 
well-placed to take advantage of any 
increased market activity.
We plan to continue to grow our presence 
through recruiting more brokers. At the 
same time, we will continue to make the 
business more efficient and continue to 
invest in our platforms. 
We are enthusiastic about the prospects for 
our Data & Analytics business because it 
stands to benefit from rising demand for 
independent pricing products. We already 
represent the broadest global coverage in 
proprietary neutral OTC data, generated 
by our execution divisions, and we see 
the opportunity to add value through 
enhancing this existing dataset. 
We also have the potential to reach a 
wider customer base through the use of 
new technologies. In 2017 we continued 
to innovate, rolling out new services and 
products across a wide spectrum of asset 
classes. We added a pricing product in 
Government bond strips for GBP and EUR. 
We have added pricing products for the 
liquid natural gas markets. 
The implementation of MiFID II is also 
increasing demand for unbiased OTC pricing 
data. We are investing in our data sales 
capability and how we make those sales. 
We are also looking at increasing the range 
and pace of new product development 
and we are exploring the possibility of 
collaborating on creating OTC indices 
products underpinned by our data feeds. 
During 2017 , the Institutional Services division 
added agency FX, FX options, listed futures 
and options, and rates to its range of flow 
products. The division is also working closely 
with clients to develop and provide structured 
product solutions, such as asset backed loans, 
property derivatives, and secondary trading 
of hedge fund, private equity and real estate 
investments. We see great potential to grow 
our breadth of activities in this division and 
our acquisition of COEX Partners in November 
is an important part of this strategy. The 
company provides execution services in listed 
futures and options and FX, and brings more 
than 50 client facing employees with strong 
customer relationships. COEX has recently 
expanded its product range to include equity 
derivatives in the US.
This year, our focus will be on adding 
more breadth and depth to our footprint 
in EMEA, expanding in the US, and 
evaluating potential bolt on acquisitions.
People
We invested in and engaged with all our 
employees in 2017 . Retaining, recruiting and 
cultivating a diverse and talented workforce 
remains a key objective for the Group. 
We continued our multi-year recruitment 
campaign to bring in the next cohort of 
brokers. In June 2017, we conducted our first 
engagement survey as TP ICAP, achieving 
a 70% response. Understanding employee 
sentiment across a broad array of issues has 
allowed us to prioritise actions and shape 
our culture positively. 
Change has been a consistent theme 
throughout the year, and supporting our 
employees by providing formal training has 
helped equip them with the skills to achieve 
our integration objectives. As we continue 
to implement specific integration targets 
such as right-sizing the Group, we have 
endeavoured to be open and fair. 
We have created an employee representation 
forum in London called ‘involve’ and have 
mechanisms in place to consult and 
communicate with our staff. By the end of 
2017 , we achieved alignment across our main 
centres for key health benefits (medical, life 
assurance and income protection) reinforcing 
the importance of equitable treatment and 
emphasising the importance we attach to 
wellbeing at TP ICAP. 
Conduct and culture
We take every opportunity to emphasise 
the importance of conduct and culture at 
all levels of the Group. With regular 
communication we promote our agenda 
using events such as formal Town Halls, 
informal listening sessions and regular 
team meetings. 
At the end of 2017 all TP ICAP employees 
were required to watch a bespoke video 
called ‘Respect@Work’ which clearly set out 
the Company’s expectation for how people 
should interact and treat one another and 
what they should do if they see anything 
contrary to this in the workplace. Training 
employees on our standards and compliance 
with our policies is ongoing. 
In 2017, we published a new ‘Culture and 
Conduct Monitor’. This will assess specific 
elements of our culture and we will issue it 
twice a year. 
Finally, we continue to embed strong 
discipline in performance management 
through our annual year-end appraisal 
process for corporate support staff, 
and for our brokers we have instigated 
‘Performance, Conduct and Bonus’ forms 
which assess non-financial factors tied to our 
core values of Honesty, Integrity, Respect 
and Excellence. 
TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Corporate responsibility
We know society has increasingly high 
expectations of us. We also know that our 
employees, and the next generation, care 
deeply about the sort of company they want 
to work for. 
Inter-dealer broking has always been an 
area where talented individuals can flourish, 
and it is our responsibility to ensure we cast 
the net far and wide when looking for, 
and developing, new talent. We call this 
‘A Voice for All’.
Our emphasis on corporate social 
responsibility and good corporate 
citizenship means we look for opportunities 
to help our communities and inform those 
who want to participate. For example, 
employees are given two days paid 
volunteering leave a year, and we make 
funds available to support their personal 
charitable fund-raising efforts. ICAP has a 
strong record in charitable support, and on 
5 December, held the 25th annual ICAP 
Charity Day. This long-established and 
well-loved tradition sees us come together 
across the globe to raise money for good 
causes, while also having a great deal of 
fun. As usual, the team participation was 
outstanding. This year we welcomed a host 
of celebrities and our guest of honour, the 
Duchess of Cornwall, to our offices in 
London, and events were held in locations 
around the globe. We raised more than 
£4.7m for this year’s chosen charities, 
bringing the grand total we have raised 
over the last 25 years to nearly £140m.
MiFID II
The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 
II (‘MiFID II’) is a European Union law that 
provides harmonised regulation across the 
Member States with the aim of increasing 
competition and protection in investment 
services. Preparing for MiFID II, which came in 
to force on 3 January 2018, was a major 
workstream for TP ICAP during 2017 and the 
culmination of several years of investment 
and effort in many corporate areas. 
MiFID II has a broad impact on many facets 
of the functioning of European markets, 
including the trading in OTC products. The 
directive requires the trading of some OTC 
financial instruments to take place on a 
multilateral trading facility (‘MTF’) or an 
organised trading facility (‘OTF’) – the latter 
is a new type of venue that covers hybrid 
broking activity. These venues resemble 
in many ways traditional exchanges. 
We received regulatory approval for all 11 
of our venues in 2017. 
TP ICAP is a leading liquidity and market 
data provider in many major OTC asset 
classes. MifID II requires market participants 
to pursue best execution. We are confident 
that our venues will become the go-to hubs 
for the best liquidity, keenest pricing and the 
required data and analytics, assisting in 
this best execution obligation. The cost 
and sophistication to provide institutions 
with this value-chain requires significant 
resources. We believe that liquidity will 
gravitate towards the market players who 
can handle this complexity and make this 
level of investment. As a result, we are 
confident that MiFID II strengthens our 
value-proposition as a market infrastructure 
player and venue operator.
Brexit
Our work to prepare for Brexit has been 
hampered by political uncertainty which 
persists into 2018. As a result, we have 
now moved from analysis and planning, 
to decisions and action without a full 
understanding of the final outcome of the 
negotiations between the UK Government 
and the EU. We already have an extensive 
Continental European footprint including 
branches and subsidiaries, premises and 
front office and support staff that service EU 
clients from Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam and 
Madrid. We are now in talks with a number 
of European financial regulators to establish 
what we and they require should TP ICAP 
base its post-Brexit European hub in one of 
their locations. During the coming year, we 
will need to do what is necessary to ensure 
we can provide uninterrupted service to our 
clients after Brexit and seek to avoid any 
consequential reductions in trading volumes.
Awards
We were pleased to win a number of industry 
awards during 2017, including Global 
Capital Overall Broker and Overall Interest 
Rates Broker of the Year, Credit Derivatives 
Interdealer Broker of the Year, and Data and 
Analytics Vendor of the Year. These awards 
are an endorsement of the strength of our 
offering, and testament to our commitment 
to excellent client service.
Looking ahead
TP ICAP ended 2017 a larger and stronger 
business. Our Group is more diverse in product 
offering and client reach than ever before and 
this positions us well to manage the cyclical 
and divergent nature of the markets and 
sectors we serve. I firmly believe that we will 
continue to play a central role providing 
liquidity at the heart of the global financial 
and energy markets enabling them to trade 
effectively and transparently.
Looking forward, political and economic 
factors are likely to continue to affect asset 
prices and volatility during 2018. This will 
present numerous opportunities. With a clear 
strategy and sustained focus on operational 
excellence, I am confident TP ICAP will 
continue to be resilient and successful. 
We are a truly international and culturally 
diverse business, employing people to 
provide first-rate services and expertise 
to our clients. I would like to thank everyone 
at TP ICAP for their hard work in 2017, and 
hope they will take pride in the business they 
helped create, and in the future success we 
intend to enjoy.

17 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements Financial and operating review
The Group generates broking revenue from 
commissions it earns by intermediating and 
executing customer orders. The level of 
revenue depends substantially on customer 
trading volumes, which are affected by 
the conditions in the financial markets, 
by customers’ risk appetite, and by their 
willingness and ability to trade.
2017 represented a mixed year for market 
activity in OTC financial markets marked by 
ongoing low levels of volatility. These cyclical 
factors still affect the interdealer broker 
industry as well as the presence of structural 
factors, such as bank regulation, that have 
had a significant impact on the industry 
since the financial crisis. Volatility, and the 
steepness and absolute level of yield curves, 
are key drivers of activity in the financial 
markets. Measures of financial market

Interim Chief Financial Officer
volatility fell compared with 2016, which 
was affected by the Brexit vote and the US 
presidential elections. Despite low levels of 
volatility there were still sporadic increases 
in trading volumes in many product areas. 
The diversified nature of our business meant 
that there was growth in at least one of our 
products at any one time. 
2017 marked a gradual shift in the interest 
rate cycle with the US in particular seeing 
three interest rate rises during the year in 
March, June and December. The UK also 
increased interest rates and the ECB 
announced plans to scale back quantitative 
easing. When rates did rise, we saw 
increased activity in our business particularly 
in our Rates and FX & Money and Markets 
businesses. Generally a change in the shape 
of the yield curve is positive for the business 
but it is perhaps too early to tell whether 
these interest rate rises will be sustained. 
In 2017, the Group benefited from the 
strategic decision to target ‘buy-side’ 
customers through the creation of the 
Institutional Services division. The business 
experienced strong revenue growth 
principally due to the authorised 
representative arrangement with COEX 
partners for the first 11 months of the year 
and the subsequent acquisition of the 
business in November. We believe that 
we are well positioned to grow this 
business further in the future.
The Data & Analytics business also 
performed strongly and remains a strategic 
priority. This business built on the progress of 
last year and benefited from the continued 
expansion of its client base, geographical 
presence and the enhancement of its sales 
capability. During the year the business 
extended the data content it provides to 
customers, particularly from its expanded 
high quality Energy & Commodities data sets.

Operating margin and cost management
As we noted in our interim results in July, the 
Group has continued to invest in developing its 
operational capabilities, its control and 
support functions and on strategic initiatives. In 
particular there has been an increase in costs 
during the year driven by our need to comply 
with various regulatory demands such as MiFID 
II. Costs relating to MiFID II of £14m (£7 m of 
which were capitalised) were necessary and as 
a result we were MiFID II compliant at its launch 
in January 2018. While this cost was one-off in 
nature the burden of regulatory requirements is 
unlikely to abate in 2018 and we expect to incur 
costs in relation to making the Group ready for 
the impact of Brexit. 
During 2017 there was further investment in 
value enhancing strategic initiatives with 
increased investment on the development 
of our Belfast Support Services Centre, our 
early talent programme and building out the 
management of our Institutional Services 
division. Costs associated with these 
initiatives are expected to generate increased 
earnings for the Group over the short to 
medium term. Other costs incurred in the year 
include £9m of legal costs, an increase of 
£4m on the prior year reflecting expenditure 
incurred defending investigations. 
During the year the Group implemented a 
cost improvement programme. The objective 
of the programme was to both preserve the 
variable nature of broking compensation and 
thus reduce it as a percentage of broking 
revenue, as well as exiting non-performing 
brokers and closing loss making offices in 
Luxembourg and Poland. This ensures the 
business is well positioned to respond to less 
favourable market conditions and to maintain 
its operating margins. The £32m cost of the 
actions taken in 2017 has been charged as an 
exceptional item in the 2017 Consolidated 
Financial Statements (see page 102).
Underlying operating profit increased by 
10% on a pro forma basis to £263m. The 
underlying operating profit margin in 2017 
of 15.0% is 0.8 percentage points higher 
than in 2016 on a pro forma basis, reflecting 
the benefits of the cost improvement 
programme. Underlying earnings per share 
for 2017 of 33.3 pence are 9.2 pence lower 
than for 2016 as reported, and 0.7 pence 
lower on a pro forma basis. 
www.tpicap.com
19 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements The period-end broking support headcount 
of 1,789 was 14% lower than at the end of 
2016, primarily reflecting the impact of 
headcount reductions as part of the actions 
taken to achieve synergy savings.
The tables below analyse revenue by business 
division as well as revenue and underlying 
operating profit by region for 2017 compared 
with the equivalent period in 2016. 
Comparative data is shown on both a 
pro forma basis and as reported. The 
performance of the business has primarily 
been compared with the pro forma 
comparative as opposed to the Tullett 
Prebon (‘TP’) standalone statutory reported 
comparative, as this is more relevant for 
the users of the Annual Report. 
Statutory operating profit of £102m was 44% 
lower than in 2016 on a pro forma basis, and 
statutory operating margin of 5.8% is 4.9 
percentage points lower than 2016 on a pro 
forma basis. Statutory operating profit is 
after acquisition, disposal and integration 
costs and exceptional items, and is described 
further on page 30. Statutory earnings per 
share for 2017 of 15.8 pence are 2.0 pence 
lower than for 2016 as reported and 
7.4 pence lower on a pro forma basis. 
Period end broker headcount decreased by 
9% to 2,715 at December 2017 from 2,981 in 
December 2016. Average broker headcount 
during 2017 was 6% lower than during 2016 
on a pro forma basis, and with a 10% 
increase in average revenue per broker, the 
resulting broking revenue was 1% higher 
than in 2016 (at constant exchange rates).
Revenue
Revenue by business division
A significant portion of the Group’s activity is 
conducted outside the UK and the reported 
revenue is therefore affected by the 
movement in the foreign exchange rates 
used to translate the revenue from non-UK 
operations. The tables therefore show 
revenue for 2016 translated at the same 
exchange rates as those used for 2017, with 
growth rates calculated on the same basis.

20 Strategic report Heading into 2018, TP ICAP faced one of the 
biggest regulatory changes our industry has 
seen in many years, with the introduction 
of MiFID II on 3 January. It was a significant 
undertaking for us, our customers and the 
wider industry, and we had to be ready for 
the deadline. This compulsory agenda had 
to take priority over our IT integration plans 
for both Tullett Prebon and ICAP . 
Our dedicated MiFID II team, made up 
of almost 200 experts in areas such as 
regulation, IT and infrastructure, worked 
tirelessly throughout 2017, implementing 
hundreds of updates to our systems and 
processes to ensure we were ready.

21 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements Overall revenues were slightly lower than last 
year when the business benefited from the 
volatility created around the US elections. 
Compared with pro forma 2016 and at 
constant exchange rates, the FX & Money 
Markets and Equities businesses have seen 
growth in revenue of 1% and 2% respectively. 
FX & Money Markets have benefited from 
the uncertainty created around the Brexit 
negotiations with Forward FX in Sterling and 
Euro performing well. In Equities, the business 
performed strongly in Structured Products 
and Index Delta One desks, which helped 
increase revenues during the year. 
Energy & Commodities revenue was 5% 
lower than the pro forma 2016 at constant 
exchange rates. The decline reflects 
challenging market conditions where 
subsidised green energy has flattened power 
curves and a lack of clarity in environmental 
markets has resulted in lower volumes, which 
has also been seen in the commodities 
business. Q4 was a particularly tough quarter 
with low volatility across all asset classes. 
The decline in the Energy & Commodities 
business has been offset by the continued 
Total revenue of £1,757m in 2017 was 1% 
higher than pro forma 2016 at constant 
exchange rates, and 4% higher at actual 
exchange rates. 
Global Broking revenue was in line with the 
prior year at constant exchange rates. The 
business benefited from volatility around the 
UK election, an increase in the US Federal 
Funds interest rate and a gradual shift in the 
inflationary stance of the ECB and Bank of 
England, which provided opportunities, 
particularly in the rates business which saw 
growth of 1% compared with pro forma 
2016. Rates has also benefited from the 
increased performance of the Risk 
Management Services business.
Credit markets continued to see challenging 
market conditions in 2017 with low volatility 
and restrictions on clients’ balance sheets 
resulting in lower trading volumes throughout 
the year. As a result of these conditions 
revenue fell by 6% on a pro forma basis to 
£117m. The Emerging Markets division covers

emerging markets such as Latin America, 
Central and Eastern Europe and Africa. 
growth in the oil business where revenues 
were up 5% on the pro forma comparative.
Institutional Services revenue has seen a 
significant increase in revenue in the year 
due to the inclusion of the COEX business. 
Up until the end of November this year, 
when the acquisition of COEX was 
completed, the revenue was included 
in Institutional Services as part of an 
Appointed Representative Agreement.
Data & Analytics revenue was 8% higher 
than pro forma 2016 at constant exchange 
rates as the business continues to see growth 
in demand for its expanded high quality 
Energy & Commodities data sets including 
oil data from the PVM brokerage.
There has also been a growing trend towards 
buy-side asset owners and managers 
sourcing independent financial data. 
This trend continues and combined with 
regulatory reform, offers significant revenue

22 Strategic report TP ICAP’s Global Broking businesses were at 
the forefront of innovation last year, breaking 
boundaries in international markets. 
In March 2017, ICAP again proved to be a 
market leader by executing the first IDB 
transacted Icelandic interest rate swap since 
the Icelandic banking crisis. The transaction, 
with a notional of ISK500m (£3.5m) and 
with a four year maturity, proved that the 
country’s banks could once again begin to 
hedge exposure in the financial markets as 
the Iceland Central Bank began to lift their 
market restrictions.

their own FX business. Overall revenues have 
materially increased by 143% year on year. 
Following the acquisition of COEX at the end 
of November, the full COEX results are now 
reported as part of the TP ICAP Group results 
so that one month of COEX’s 2017 result is 
included in the income statement.
Average broker headcount in the region 
was 7% lower than last year, with average 
revenue per broker up 9%, primarily as a 
result of the cost improvement programme. 
Period-end broker headcount was 1,189.
Americas
Americas revenue was 2% lower in 2017 than 
on a pro forma constant currency basis. The 
Americas have reduced underperforming 
broker headcount since 2016, increasing 
revenue per broker by 3%, further positioning 
the business to take advantage of growth 
opportunities within both the TP and 
ICAP brands.
Within our Global Broking business, general 
market conditions continued to be subdued 
during 2017 . Financial markets saw a slight 
increase in activity early on in 2017 with 
interest rate movements, but activity in the 
second half remained constricted, especially 
relative to the market activity that had built 
up in anticipation of the 2016 Brexit vote 
and U.S. Presidential election.
Rates revenue was down 1% with strategic 
hires and brief periods of volatility in interest 
rate derivatives offsetting subdued volumes 
and lack of issuance in the government bond 
market. Our Rates business continues to 
be the region’s largest asset class.
Despite historically low levels of volatility in the 
U.S. Equities markets in 2017 (VIX nearing 
historic lows at points during the year), Equities 
revenue was down only 2% on the back of 
expansion into new product areas. Within 
Credit, the region benefited from TP’s addition 
of 14 credit derivative brokers in September 
2016 largely offsetting restricted volumes in 
corporate credit and mortgages. Credit and 
Equities remain opportunities for growth in 
the Americas given the large number of U.S. 
market participants as well as strategic fits 
within the competing TP and ICAP brands.
Both Local Markets and FX & Money Markets 
businesses saw lower revenues in 2017 due to 
increased regulatory constraints in cash and 
deposits markets and recent desk closures 
Revenue by region
Comparisons to 2016 are on a pro forma 
constant currency basis. 
EMEA
Revenue in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and 
Africa) was 2% higher than the prior year  
on a pro forma constant currency basis. 
Within Global Broking all products, with the 
exception of Credit, grew revenues year on 
year particularly in FX & Money Markets 
reflecting the performance of the forward FX 
desk. The Rates division increased revenues 
by 1% year on year driven by the strong ICAP 
franchise and good performance from 
TP particularly within Gilt IDB, Repo and 
government bond desks during the year. 
For Equities, 2017 was a strong year for the 
structured products business of the ICAP 
brand, with revenue across desks increasing 
by 47% year on year. Emerging Markets 
benefited from volatility across a number of 
local markets, with the central medium term 
interest rate swaps ICAP desk increasing 
revenues 87% year on year and the PLN and 
CZK desks also performing well. Credit 
products struggled generally across both 
Tullett Prebon (‘TP’) and ICAP brands in the 
year, with corporate bond performance 
challenging, particularly in Paris 
and Frankfurt.
Revenue from Energy & Commodities 
decreased by 4% in the region year on year, 
with the TP and PVM brands flat overall, but 
the ICAP brand revenue declining by 23% 
compared with the prior year, although this 
business represents less than one fifth of the 
total Energy & Commodities revenue in the 
region. The steep decline in revenues reflects 
the product splits of the various brands with 
the ICAP brand heavily weighted towards 
power and commodities markets which have 
been under considerable pressure. Overall 
revenues from the TP and PVM oil desks 
increased by 6% year on year offsetting 
the more challenging power and 
commodity markets. 
The Institutional Services division within 
the region has seen a period of growth 
and transition in a number of different areas, 
but also some challenges. There has been 
significant headcount change in the Mirexa 
business during the year, resulting in an 11% 
decline in revenue year on year. 2017 saw a 
full year of the revenues from the COEX 
business (against only six months in 2016), 
mainly from their exchange traded 
Financial and operating review 
continued
and restructurings. These conditions offset 
improved performance in select offshore 
emerging markets areas.
Energy & Commodities business also saw lower 
revenue in 2017 . Increased revenue in financial 
oil products (a business we continue to expand) 
were offset by poor year-on-year comparables 
in U.S. power and natural gas due to the 
heightened activity in 2016 in anticipation 
of energy policy change surrounding the U.S. 
Presidential election. The recent acquisition of 
SCS Commodities in January 2018 will bolster 
the Americas’ position in U.S. Oil markets. 
Energy & Commodities continues to be a 
targeted growth area across the TP , ICAP 
and PVM brands. 
Average broker headcount in the Americas 
was 5% lower than in 2016, with average 
revenue per broker 10% higher. Period-end 
broker headcount in the Americas was 935.
Asia Pacific
Revenue in Asia Pacific was 2% higher than 
last year on a pro forma constant currency 
basis, reflecting increased revenue from the 
Global Broking division, which more than 
offset a fall in Energy & Commodities revenues. 
Global Broking revenue in the region has 
seen growth in equity derivatives and rates 
products growing by 7% and 2% year on year 
respectively . The Equities business benefited 
from the strength of the ICAP branded business 
in Hong Kong and Japan, in both single stock 
products and in index products. The interest 
rate swaps desks in ICAP Australasia, TP Hong 
Kong and TP Singapore all increased revenue, 
benefiting from their respective market leading 
positions, which took advantage of an upward 
movement in actual and expected interest 
rates, growing revenue by 5%. This was 
tempered somewhat in the second half of the 
year by the disruptive effect of a competitor 
attack on the ICAP Australia business.
Energy & Commodities revenues benefited 
from continued growth in the oil related 
business under both the TP and PVM brands. 
However, this was offset by challenging market 
conditions in the commodities and power 
markets which were affected by falling market 
volumes due to slowing Chinese demand. 
Average broker headcount in the region was 
5% lower than in 2016 with average revenue 
per broker up 14%. Period-end broker 
headcount in Asia Pacific was 591.

Americas
In the Americas, the underlying operating 
profit of £64m is 12% higher than in 2016 on a 
pro forma basis and the underlying operating 
profit margin has improved by 0.9 percentage 
points to 10.2% compared to pro forma 2016. 
Actions taken to remove underperforming 
brokers has helped improve contribution. The 
operating profit margin has also benefited 
from synergy savings during the year. 
EMEA
Underlying operating profit in EMEA of 
£170m was 6% higher than in the prior year 
on a pro forma basis, and with revenue up 
4%, the underlying operating profit margin 
has increased by 0.4 percentage points, to 
19.4% on a pro forma basis. The overall 
contribution and revenue per broker 
increased as the business benefited from 
actions taken under the cost improvement 
programme. The region also experienced a 
decrease in broker headcount due to the 
removal of underperforming brokers. 
The benefit of improved contribution has 
been offset by higher management and 
support costs due to the investments being 
made in strengthening and developing 
the business, and one-off costs relating 
to technology and regulatory projects.
Asia Pacific
Underlying operating profit in Asia Pacific 
has increased by 26% to £29m compared to 
2016 on a pro forma basis. Overall revenue 
and contribution per broker increased 
during the year. In Global Broking a number 
of steps were taken to improve contribution, 
including some rightsizing of broker 
headcount on certain desks, some selective 
withdrawal from non-profitable products 
and some measured adjustments to bonus 
structures. These actions were the principal 
reason for the improvement in the underlying 
operating profit margin.

29 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements Exceptional and acquisition,  
disposal and integration items
The Group presents its Consolidated Income 
Statement in a columnar format to aid the 
understanding of its results by separately 
presenting its underlying profit before 
acquisition, disposal and integration costs 
and exceptional items (see Note 2(c) to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
Underlying profit is reconciled to profit 
before tax on the face of the Consolidated 
Income Statement and is disclosed separately 
to give a clearer presentation of the Group’s 
underlying trading results. Acquisition, 
disposal and integration costs are excluded 
from underlying results as they reflect the 
impact of acquisitions and disposals rather 
than underlying trading performance.
There is a £34m exceptional charge in 2017. 
£32m of this exceptional charge relates to 
the TP ICAP cost improvement programme 
and reflects costs incurred in restructuring 
broker employment contracts and removing 
underperforming brokers. Exceptional items 
have been excluded from underlying results 
as they are non-recurring and do not relate 
to the underlying performance of the 
business. While a £5m cost improvement 
programme charge arose in 2016, it reflected 
the remaining actions of a discrete 
programme implemented in 2015. 
The Group does not expect to incur 
exceptional costs of this nature for the 
foreseeable future. The Group also incurred a 
£2m charge in the year relating to long-term 
employee benefit obligations, which is 
one-off and exceptional in nature.
Costs of £79m relating to the integration of 
ICAP includes the cost of individuals, the 
majority of whose time is dedicated to 
delivering the integration. Other integration 
costs include professional fees and staff 
severance costs. In the 2016 Annual Report, 
we set out the expected integration savings 
and associated costs to achieve those savings. 
For 2017 we estimated that we would make 
savings of £10m and we would spend £40m 
on integration. Due to the acceleration of 
the integration programme we have made 
savings of £27m during the year and the 
costs to achieve those savings have increased 
from an expected £40m to £79m. 
The annualised run rate of synergy savings 
achieved at the end of the year was £52m. 
We remain committed to delivering £100m 
of synergy savings over the duration of the 
integration programme.
As part of the acquisition of PVM in 
November 2014, the payment to each 
individual vendor of their share of up to 
US$48m of deferred consideration (which is 
subject to achieving revenue targets in the 
three years after completion) was linked to 
their continued service with the business, and 
is therefore amortised through the income 
statement over the relevant service period. 
The final amortisation charge of the earn out 
was recognised in 2017 of £9m (2016: £16m).
A charge of £40m has been incurred through 
the income statement reflecting the 
amortisation of intangible assets other than 
goodwill arising on the acquisition of ICAP, 
PVM, MOAB and COEX, reflecting brand 
value, the value of customer relationships 
and other intangible assets. Amortisation of 
intangible assets arising on consolidation is 
excluded from underlying results to present 
the performance of the Group’s acquired 
businesses consistently with its organically 
grown businesses where such intangible 
assets are not recognised.

30 Strategic report Net finance expense
The underlying net finance charge of £33m comprises: £28m interest payable on the outstanding Sterling Notes including £24m from the 
£500m January 2024 Sterling Note issued in January 2017 to refinance the £470m bank bridge loan; £4m interest payable on the revolving 
credit facility; and commitment fees for the bridge facility prior to its refinancing; £3m of amortisation of debt issue and arrangement costs; 
and other net interest income of £2m. 
The underlying net finance income of £3m comprises the £3m non-cash income on the Retirement Benefit Asset.

Tax
The effective rate of tax on underlying profit before tax is 26% (2016: 23% pro forma and 18% as reported). The rate is higher than the 
underlying 18% reported in 2016 primarily due to the inclusion of the ICAP business in the current year results, which has driven an increase 
in the mix of taxable profits in the period in tax jurisdictions with higher statutory rates of tax, principally the US. The rate is higher than the 
2016 pro forma rate of 23% reflecting a change in the mix of taxable profits and an increase in non-deductible expenditure.
The effective rate of tax on statutory profit before tax is a 4% credit to income rather than a tax charge. This reflects the increase in the tax 
credit included in acquisition, disposal and integration costs due to a £24m decrease in deferred tax liabilities that arises from the reduction 
in the US federal rate of tax (see Notes 10 and 20).
The effective tax rate on underlying profit before tax is expected to remain in line with the 2017 rate of 26% despite the recent change in 
the headline rate of corporation tax in the US from 35% to 21%. This is due to other aspects of the tax legislation, which have the effect of 
broadening the US tax base.
Basic EPS
The average number of shares used for the basic EPS calculation of 551.8m reflects the 554.1m shares in issue less the 1.9m held by the Employee 
Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) at the beginning of the year, less the time apportioned element of the 0.7m shares acquired by the EBT to satisfy deferred 
share awards made to senior management.

Capital expenditure of £41m includes the development of our electronic broking capabilities including ‘straight through processing’ 
technology, investment in IT and communications infrastructure, as well as property-related capital expenditure for office moves.
1 The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of £46m in the consolidated Cash Flow Statement is after additional cash flows reflecting dividend payments of £58m,  
net receipts from changes in debt of £27m, cash acquired with subsidiaries of £1m and the outflow of £54m relating to the purchase of financial assets.
Financial and operating review

TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
32 Strategic report Initial contract payments (‘ICPs’) increased in 2017 as the business looked to lock in brokers on long-term contracts that reflects increased 
market competition for their services. ICPs are amortised over the life of the contract, typically three years, so this increased expenditure 
will impact the reported level of broker compensation in future years. 
The other working capital outflow in 2017 primarily reflects an increase in trade receivables as some customers have experienced delays in 
their payment cycles and bonus payments in respect of the strong performance in the final quarter of 2016. 
The £32m cash outflow for the 2017 cost improvement programme reflects the charge in the income statement. 
ICAP integration expenditure of £73m is lower than the £79m charged in the income statement. The income statement charge also includes 
the write off of intangible assets and the share based payment charge relating to the transformational LTIP .
The Group paid £4m to purchase its own shares in order to satisfy deferred share awards made to senior management during the year. 
Included within 2017 was also a £7m cash outflow for stamp duty paid on the shares acquired as part of the ICAP transaction and charged 
to equity in 2016. 
Interest payments in 2017 reflect the underlying income statement charge for net cash finance expenses excluding the charge for the 
amortisation of debt issue costs.
Tax payments in 2017 of £27m are higher than in the prior year reflecting the inclusion of payments of the acquired ICAP companies.
The £6m of acquisition consideration and investments cash outflow in 2017 is deferred consideration in relation to the MOAB and Creditex 
acquisitions an initial upfront payment for COEX Partners Limited, and investments in Glia Ecosystems and LiquidityChain.

Pensions
The Group has one defined benefit pension scheme in the UK. The scheme is closed to new members and future accrual.
The triennial actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 30 April 2016 was concluded in April 2017 . The actuarial funding surplus of the scheme at 
that date was £61m and under the agreed schedule of contributions the Company will continue not to make any payments into the scheme. 
The assets and liabilities of the scheme are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accordance with IAS 19. The fair value of the 
scheme’s assets at 31 December 2017 was £260m (31 December 2016: £317m). The decrease reflects the investment return on the assets less 
amounts paid as benefits and transfers and the effect of the bulk annuity transaction explained below. The value of the scheme’s liabilities 
at the end of December 2017, calculated in accordance with IAS 19, was £203m (31 December 2016: £217m). The valuation of the scheme’s 
liabilities at the end of the period reflects the demographic assumptions adopted for the most recent triennial actuarial valuation and a 
discount rate of 2.4% (31 December 2016: 2.5%). Under IAS 19, the scheme shows a surplus, before the related deferred tax liability, of £57m 
at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: £100m). 
On 11 May 2017 the Group announced that the T rustees had insured the defined benefit liabilities of the scheme through a bulk purchase annuity 
transaction with Rothesay Life for the payment of a premium of £270m to insure all scheme liabilities, which had an accounting value of £214m 
at that time. The policy is in the name of the scheme and is a scheme asset. The purchase of the policy represents a bulk annuity ‘buy-in’ and has 
been accounted for in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ . Under IAS 19, the accounting value of the purchased 
policy is set to be equal to the value of the liabilities covered, calculated using the current IAS 19 actuarial assumptions for the defined benefit 
obligation. As the actual purchase price of the policy was higher than the accounting value of the policy, a reduction of £56m in the Scheme’s 
assets was recorded. This reduction is included within the Return on Scheme assets (excluding deemed interest) and reported as part of the 
Group’s ‘re-measurement of defined benefit pension schemes’ included within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
34 Strategic report Regulatory capital
The Group’s lead regulator is the Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’).
The Group has a waiver from the consolidated capital adequacy requirements under CRD IV . The Group’s current waiver took effect on 
30 December 2016, following the acquisition of ICAP, and will expire on 30 December 2026. Under the terms of the waiver, each investment 
firm within the Group must be either a limited activity or a limited licence firm and must comply with its individual regulatory capital 
resources requirements. TP ICAP, as the parent company, must continue to maintain capital resources in excess of the sum of the solo notional 
capital resources requirements for each relevant firm within the Group, the ‘Financial Holding Company test’.
The terms of the waiver require the Group to eliminate the excess of its consolidated own funds requirements compared with its consolidated 
own funds (‘Excess Goodwill’) over the ten-year period to 30 December 2026. The amount of the excess goodwill must not exceed the amount 
determined as at the date the waiver took effect and must be reduced in line with a schedule over the ten-years, with the first reduction of 25% 
required to be achieved by June 2019. The Group expects to achieve this reduction within its current business plan. The waiver also sets out 
conditions with respect to the maintenance of financial ratios relating to leverage, debt service and debt maturity profile.
The Group’s regulatory capital headroom under the Financial Holding Company test calculated in accordance with Pillar 1 was £1,702m 
(2016: £1,922m). Many of the Group’s broking entities are regulated on a ‘solo’ basis, and are obliged to meet the regulatory capital 
requirements imposed by the local regulator of the jurisdiction in which they operate. The Group maintains an appropriate excess of 
financial resources in such entities.
Information disclosure under Pillar 3 is available on the Group’s website: www.tpicap.com.
Going concern
The Group has considerable financial resources both in the regions and at the corporate centre comfortably to meet the Group’s  
ongoing obligations.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Annual Report and Financial Statements continue to be prepared on the 
going concern basis. 
Viability Statement 
The Directors have assessed the prospects for, and viability of, the Group over a three year period to the end of December 2020. We believe 
that a three year time horizon remains the most appropriate timeframe over which the Directors should assess the long-term viability of the 
Group. This is on the basis that it has a sufficient degree of certainty in the context of the current position of the Group and the assessment of 
its principal risks, and it matches the business planning cycle with particular regard to the integration of the ICAP business and the delivery of 
synergies. The assessment has been made taking into account the following:
 > the current liquidity position of the Group including its base case and stressed case cash flow forecasts;
 > the liquidity stress testing and reverse stress testing undertaken by the Group;
 > the ICAAPs undertaken by the Group’s FCA regulated entities;
 > the assessment of the Group’s principal risks, including those that would threaten the Group’s business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity. These risks are discussed in the risk management report on pages 36 to 41; and 
 > the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems. 
The Directors consider that they have undertaken a robust assessment of the prospects of the Group and its principal risks over the three year 
period, and, on the basis of that assessment, have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over at least the period of assessment. In arriving at this conclusion, the Directors have made the following assumptions:
 > the Group maintains access to liquidity through the Group’s £250m revolving credit facility (Note 23 on page 132);
 > the Group reduces its excess goodwill in accordance with the terms agreed with the FCA in the Group’s waiver from consolidated capital 
adequacy requirements under CRD IV;
 > the Group does not lose its waiver from consolidated capital adequacy requirements under CRD IV due to changes in the regulatory rules;
 > the Group successfully refinances the £80m Notes that mature in June 2019 (Note 23 on page 132);
 > the Group achieves the successful integration of the ICAP business and delivery of the expected synergies; and
 > the Group takes appropriate action to mitigate potential adverse effects arising from Brexit.

35 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements Governance 
The Group has implemented a risk 
management governance structure 
based on the industry-standard three 
lines of defence that segregates risk 
management (first line of defence) from 
risk oversight (second line of defence) 
and risk assurance (third line of defence). 
The Board has overall responsibility for 
the management of risk within the Group. 
This includes:
 > determining the Group’s risk appetite 
and defining expectations for the 
Group’s risk culture; 
 > ensuring that the Group has an 
appropriate and effective risk 
management framework; and 
 > monitoring the Group’s risk profile 
to ensure that it remains within the 
Group’s stated risk appetite.
The Group’s risk governance structure 
ensures the effective oversight and 
management of risk through the 
implementation and operation of the 
ERMF . It comprises:
 > Board Risk Committee (‘BRC’);
 > Group Executive Risk Committee 
(‘GERC’);
 > Regional risk committees (in EMEA, 
Americas and Asia Pacific); and
 > other function-specific committees.
Risk management
Effective risk management is essential  
to the financial strength and resilience of  
the Group and for the achievement  
of its business objectives. 
This section describes how risk is managed 
by the Group through its Enterprise 
Risk Management Framework and 
describes the Group’s principal risks. 
Enterprise Risk Management Framework
The Enterprise Risk Management Framework 
(‘ERMF’) enables the Group to understand 
the risks it is exposed to and to manage them 
in line with its business objectives and within 
the stated risk appetite. The ERMF comprises 
four mutually reinforcing components: risk 
management philosophy, risk management 
culture, risk management governance and 
risk management processes. 
Philosophy and culture 
The Group’s risk management philosophy is 
underpinned by a set of core principles that 
establish the context for risk management 
activities. The principles dictate that risk 
management is value enhancing, addresses 
the expectations and requirements of 
key stakeholders and is integrated into 
the business processes. The approach is 
proportionate to the type and complexity 
of the business model and the nature of the 
associated risks. Furthermore, risk oversight 
and assurance functions are sufficiently 
independent of business decision taking 
and supported by adequate resources. 
The Board recognises that embedding a 
sound risk management culture throughout 
the Group is fundamental to the effective 
operation of the Group, specifically to ensure 
that all employees are aware of, and act in 
conformity with, the desired values and 
behaviours adopted by the Group in their 
day-to-day activities. 
The Group seeks to achieve the 
implementation of its risk management 
culture through a combination of frameworks, 
policies, practices and incentive schemes.
First line of defence
Risk management within the business
The first line of defence comprises the 
management of the business units and 
support functions.
The first line of defence has primary 
responsibility for ensuring that the 
business operates within risk appetite  
on a day-to-day basis. 
Second line of defence
Risk oversight and challenge
The second line of defence comprises 
the risk and compliance functions, 
which are independent from 
operational management.
The functions are responsible for 
overseeing and challenging the first line of 
defence as it undertakes the identification, 
assessment and management of risks, and 
for assisting the Board (and its various 
committees) in discharging its overall risk 
oversight responsibilities. 
Third line of defence
Independent assurance
Internal Audit provides independent 
assurance on the design and 
operational effectiveness of the 
ERMF and associated activity.

Risk appetite
The Group’s risk appetite represents the type and level of risk which it is willing to accept in pursuit of its business objectives.  
Risk appetite is articulated by the Board through the Group’s risk appetite statements, which are reviewed on at least an annual basis. 
The Group’s risk appetite statements refer to five ‘risk impacts’ and are summarised as:
Impact Statement
Capital The Group must ensure it holds sufficient capital to meet any applicable regulatory capital requirements in both 
expected and stressed business conditions.
Liquidity Each operating entity must maintain, or have access to, sufficient liquidity to meet all of its funding obligations 
and comply with any minimum regulatory requirements, in both normal and stressed conditions. 
Reputation The Group’s objective is to maintain its reputation for being a sound, trusted and reliable market intermediary, 
with market integrity at the heart of its business, as articulated in the Group’s Cultural Framework.
Regulatory 
standing
The Group’s objective is to maintain its good standing with all of its regulators and to fully comply with all applicable 
laws and regulations to which the Group is subject. 
Access to 
capital markets
The Group’s objective is to ensure that it maintains access to the capital markets, and complies with existing  
bank lending covenants, even in stressed operating conditions.
The Group implements its risk appetite statements through the adoption of risk thresholds at individual risk level. These thresholds constitute 
the operational parameters within which the first line of defence must operate on a day-to-day basis.

41 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements Corporate social responsibility
Our corporate social responsibility (‘CSR’) 
strategy’s primary aim is to support our 
business objectives, while demonstrating 
leadership in conduct and culture through 
our actions – for the benefit of our business, 
our colleagues, our customers and the wider 
communities in which we operate. 
Our values
We have a defined set of values that 
underpin everything we do. We are known 
in the market for our honesty, integrity and 
excellence in the provision of service to 
our clients. Above all else, we respect our 
clients and each other, without bias.
Our corporate social responsibility 
ethos – ‘A Voice for All’
As a business we have been proud to employ 
people whatever their background. ‘ A Voice 
For All’ is our commitment to step up providing 
improved access and opportunities for 
everyone, regardless of where they are from.
This year we launched ‘A Voice for All’ –  
our corporate social responsibility strategy. 
Its three pillars guide our efforts across 
our business, from fund raising and 
engaging with charities through to our 
recruitment processes.
Inform
Inspire
Include
‘ A Voice for All’
We support creative initiatives 
that inspire new generations  
and give them the confidence  
to succeed.
We recognise that aspiration and achievement are 
linked. Where young and disaffected people have 
low expectations and poor confidence levels, they 
are less likely to do well in education or employment.
We promote skills development  
in the communities within  
which we operate, to increase 
participation in local economies.
Certain skills — especially digital and financial 
literacy — are essential life skills and have been 
identified by the OECD as increasingly vital to 
successful economies.
We are building the diverse  
and skilled workforce the 
financial services sector  
needs for the future.
Financial services has seen a sharp rise in skills 
shortages in recent years. At the same time, the 
sector faces challenges over low levels of gender, 
ethnic and socio-economic diversity in the workforce.
TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
42 Strategic report We continued to support ICAP’s Charity Day 
which raised an incredible £4.7 million in 
2017 for good causes around the globe.
We also made donations of £103,200 
to the relief of disasters such as the 
Grenfell Tower fire and Hurricane Harvey. 
Excluding Charity Day, we donated less 
than £200,000 to charitable causes in 2017.
Human rights 
We fully support the UN Guiding Principles 
on Business and Human Rights. This includes 
implementing our obligations under the 
UK Modern Slavery Act and respecting 
freedom of association for our employees.
Our statement for the Modern Slavery Act 
is located on our main website in line with 
legislative requirements: www.tpicap.com.
As a global Company, we rely on several 
thousand suppliers of products and services 
from more than 31 countries. 80% of our top 
30 suppliers are leading global providers of 
IT, telephony and professional services. 
We will not tolerate slavery in our supply chain. 
We are in the process of introducing a supplier 
code of conduct, for new and renewed 
contracts, which will set out our expectations 
for suppliers to comply with our approach. 
Our initial analysis of our top 30 direct 
suppliers shows that they are all located 
in the US and EMEA and are, on balance, 
viewed as low risk. Many of our suppliers 
have their own comprehensive policies 
related to modern slavery.
Developing and delivering our  
CSR strategy
As the world’s largest inter-dealer broker we 
have a responsibility to lead our sector in 
culture and conduct, to ensure that we fulfil 
our primary role of creating economic value 
in a way that is efficient, effective and 
sustainable. Our CSR strategy, ‘A Voice for 
All’ recognises that in order to be a high-
performing, sustainable business we need 
to continue to develop and improve our 
culture, but also improve the communities 
in which we operate.
The three pillars of the strategy – Inspire, 
Inform and Include – link strongly to social 
mobility. We want the work we do in setting 
a sector-leading culture to enable our best 
talents to flourish and to inspire others to 
raise their aspirations, improve their skills 
and ultimately create the path for the 
next generation. In 2018 we will embed 
‘A Voice for All’ throughout our Group and 
communicate it externally to our stakeholders. 
Charitable giving and volunteering
In 2017, we launched a new TP ICAP 
Charitable Giving policy to support our 
employees’ fund-raising and volunteering 
aspirations with a pool of funding and we 
allow our employees the choice to take two 
days of paid volunteering leave. We believe 
empowering our employees to get involved 
in charitable initiatives helps link our business 
more closely with the communities in which 
we operate.
Since its launch in June, this initiative has 
been well-received by our employees and we 
have supported causes across our three main 
regions. In 2017, we contributed over £15,000 
to employee-matched giving and direct 
sponsorship causes, benefitting 32 charities. 
In addition, our employees volunteered 
around 500 hours of their time to help 
19 charitable causes. 
We have undertaken a number of steps to 
address the issue of modern slavery and 
human trafficking, including training our 
employees on modern slavery issues and 
how to identify them, starting dialogue with 
our top 30 suppliers through surveys, and 
creating a new in-depth introduction process 
for new suppliers, which covers a number of 
sustainability issues, including an assessment 
of modern slavery and forced labour 
practices. More information is available 
on our website.
Sustainable procurement 
We take the sustainability of our supply chain 
and procurement exceptionally seriously, 
and in 2017 implemented a number of 
initiatives that support this including:
 > printing reduction via secure login 
and print management to reduce 
paper wastage;
 > introducing Corporate Uber and a 
new global travel provider to reduce 
our CO
2
 footprint;
 > stopping the supply and usage of 
14,500 plastic bottles of water per week 
in the UK;
 > agreeing to use Equinix for TP ICAP’s core 
London Data Center. Equinix’s power 
supply comes from the Slough Heat & 
Power renewable energy station, which 
generates hot water and electricity by 
burning wood chips and fibre cubes 
made from used paper and cardboard;
 > investigating more cloud-hosted products 
to reduce our global data centre foot 
print and power consumption including, 
Icelandic Data Clouds;
 > conducting a top ten vendor assessment 
every year, including monitoring their CO
2
 
data, as well as slavery prevention; and
 > assessing the environmental impacts of 
new suppliers’ operations.

25 years of giving
Since 1993, thanks to the efforts of our 
customers, staff and suppliers, ICAP Charity 
Day has made a big difference to a diverse 
range of charities around the world and has 
enabled us to fund entire projects across a 
range of charitable causes. 
On Charity Day the workforce comes 
together with one aim, and one goal – to 
raise as much money as possible for charities 
For 25 years, ICAP Charity Day has made an 
enormous impact – by giving away 100% 
of ICAP revenues and commissions on just 
one day. During this time it has positively 
changed the lives of hundreds of thousands 
of people. On 5 December 2017, £4.7 million 
was raised globally, bringing the total 
amount raised over 25 years to almost 
£140 million .

45 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements Resources, relationships and responsibilities
moved to ‘CV-blind’ assessment centres and 
away from historic reliance on the annual 
campus recruitment rounds. We proved 
in 2017 that we can attract high calibre 
candidates through this method. Through 
a combination of hiring strategies, we 
achieved our goal of adding 52 trainee 
brokers to the Group. We aim to hire another 
50 trainees in 2018. Asia Pacific is the 
priority for 2018 as we continue to focus 
on increasing the overall diversity of new 
trainee cohorts. 
We have also been busy in lateral hiring as 
we actively seek to attract a diverse pool 
of candidates using low and no fee sources. 
Learning and talent development
Through the change programmes sponsored 
by HR, we have given employees across 
the Group ways to manage stress and be 
resilient. Early this year we were able to 
release our learning management system to 
all employees across the Group. This means 
there is a consistent ‘one place’ to access 
content related to development, whether 
that be on-line mandatory training or 
performance-related documents such as 
setting objectives and doing annual reviews. 
We have provided employees access to 
training calendars with courses covering 
key personal effectiveness skills. We have 
scheduled additional programmes when 
courses are oversubscribed to meet 
employee demand. 2017 also saw the rollout 
of a rebranded TP ICAP ‘Respect@Work’ 
course. Originally released to Tullett Prebon 
employees in 2015, this course has been 
refreshed and relaunched in 2017 across 
the Group. The course focuses on us as 
individuals, reinforcing that we each 
contribute to the environment and culture 
at TP ICAP and that every one of us is 
accountable for it. The course is a reminder 
that all employees should feel empowered 
to report unacceptable behaviour.
We aim to manage our business responsibly. 
This is reflected in our ongoing commitment 
to maintaining a professional culture with 
sound business practices and relationships 
as well as developing all our employees. 
Supporting employees
As a new business formed from the 
combination of Tullett Prebon and ICAP, 
TP ICAP has created two forums to improve 
the support we offer our employees. The first 
is our employee engagement forum named, 
‘involve’, a permanent body made up of 
elected employee representatives, who act 
as a collective voice, speaking on behalf 
of employees on important issues in the 
workplace. The forum gives a voice to 
employees around collective consultation, 
information and communication and 
employee feedback. The second is ‘connect’, 
our employee-led engagement network 
which brings together employees from 
around the world to create networks and 
development opportunities, as well as 
events to talk about topical issues and 
encourage the diversity of our Group. These 
two programmes help drive employee 
engagement to help us achieve the aim of 
being the leading employer in our sector. 
To support our employees, we have 
global policies in place to ensure we 
respect the backgrounds, beliefs and cultures 
of all employees, and that the working 
environment is free from discrimination, 
harassment and bullying. In the event that 
an employee becomes disabled, the Group’s 
policy is to make reasonable adjustments, 
including arranging training, to enable the 
employee to continue working for the Group.
Recruitment
Our resourcing team has been successful in 
recruiting new trainee brokers within the 
US and the UK as part of the Early Careers 
Programme. In both locations we have 
Employee numbers, gender pay and diversity
We are focused on addressing the challenge 
of diversity in our organisation which, like 
many businesses in the financial services 
sectors, has a lower ratio of female to male 
employees, particularly in broking roles.
Since the creation of TP ICAP in December 
2016, we have taken steps to address the 
imbalance, including the appointment  
of a diversity champion on our GEC and 
introducing CV-blind recruiting in our broker 
recruitment process which is a first in our 
sector. This has transformed the way we 
recruit trainee brokers at TP ICAP . The 
Company will report its Gender Pay Gap 
data in line with regulations.
At 31 December 2017, the TP ICAP Board 
comprised two women and six men, 
the same as last year. The mix of senior 
managers at 31 December 2017 was 18% 
women and 82% men. Overall employee 
numbers on 31 December 2017 were 22% 
women and 78% men. 
Culture
During 2017 we have been articulating our 
culture at TP ICAP and describing what we 
want that culture to be. In summer 2017, we 
were able get our first full set of employee 
engagement feedback which told us how 
engaged employees are and asked 
questions about how they perceive our 
culture. Collating this feedback is one 
way of gauging employee sentiment and 
wellbeing. Communicating and acting 
on the feedback gives our employees a 
voice and the ability to shape our culture. 
Social media and online policy
At TP ICAP we understand the importance 
of social media and its impact on society 
and our employees. Our Group policy for 
social media and online activity is designed 
to safeguard our brand, reputation and 
employees when communicating on social 
media or online. 
TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
46 Strategic report Our policy has clear rules on the use of social 
media and online communications and has 
been communicated to our employees. 
We also have a social media best practice 
guide and monitor all the mainstream social 
media channels to ensure compliance with 
our standards.
Working with government and regulators
We work with governments and regulatory 
authorities to maintain a detailed, up to 
date, understanding of any legislation and 
regulation that affects us and our customers. 
This allows us to respond efficiently to 
change. It is the Group’s policy not to make 
cash contributions to any political party. 
During 2017, no political donations were 
made by the Group (2016: £nil). 
Whistleblowing, anti-money  
laundering and bribery and corruption
TP ICAP recognises its responsibility 
to fully meet its legal and regulatory 
requirements to protect the integrity 
and stability of the financial markets 
and makes a commitment to:
 > not being used by criminals to launder the 
proceeds of crime or by sanctioned 
individuals and entities;
 > help combat terrorist financing;
 > comply with economic and trade 
sanctions issued by relevant governments 
and organisations in every jurisdiction  
in which we operate;
 > prohibit the acceptance, or offering  
of a bribe in any form;
 > prohibit the solicitation of business,  
by the offering of any form of bribe;
 > prohibit the offering of employment, 
with the intention of receiving an 
improper business advantage; and
 > prohibit the making of 
facilitation payments.
TP ICAP strives to maintain the highest 
standards of honesty, openness and 
accountability and recognises that all those 
who work with or within the Group have an 
important role to play in achieving this goal. 
Accordingly, the Group has implemented 
a global whistleblowing policy which 
encourages employees and third parties, 
to report suspicion of wrongdoing in 
relation to TP ICAP activities including: 
criminal activity, failure to comply 
with legal or regulatory requirements, 
miscarriages of justice, danger to health 
and safety, damage to the environment, 
bribery, financial fraud, negligence, breach 
of TP ICAP’s policies and unauthorised 
disclosure of confidential information. 
Tax and other social payments
In December 2017, the Group published a 
Group tax strategy. This is available on 
TP ICAP’s website, www.tpicap.com. The 
Group tax strategy explains that the Group 
is committed to complying with tax laws in 
a responsible manner and to having open 
and constructive relationships with tax 
authorities wherever we operate, and 
that the Group’s tax risk appetite is low. 
The Group made payments to tax authorities 
for 2017 of £281m (2016: £215m), comprising 
corporation tax, premises taxes, employer’s 
social security payments, income taxes and 
social security paid on behalf of employees 
in the UK and the USA (the main jurisdictions 
in which it operates), and VAT/sales taxes.  
In addition, the Group makes further tax 
payments to the tax authorities in other 
tax jurisdictions in which it operates. 
HM Treasury has adopted the requirements 
set out under CRD IV and issued the Capital 
Requirements Country-by-Country Reporting 
Regulations 2013. The legislation requires 
the publication of additional information, 
including certain tax payments, in respect 
of the year ended 31 December 2017, by 
31 December 2018. This information will 
be available by this date on TP ICAP’s 
website, www.tpicap.com.
Environment
TP ICAP recognises it has a responsibility to 
help protect and preserve the environment. 
To this end, we try to carry out all reasonably 
practical measures to meet our responsibilities 
to reduce our impact on the environment. 
Responsibility for environmental matters rests 
with the Board, and is included in its terms of 
reference. The Chief Executive is the Board 
member responsible for corporate social 
responsibility, and as such, is responsible  
for the Company’s environmental policy.
As an office-based business we do not 
generate a large environmental impact. The 
main impact of our business is greenhouse 
gas emissions as a result of office-based 
business activities and from business travel. 
Statistics relating to these are set out in the 
Directors’ Report, on page 90, where we also 
publish our annual carbon footprint figures. 
TP ICAP makes a commitment to:
 > ensure compliance with all current 
environmental legislation;
 > identify forthcoming environmental 
legislation to ensure timely compliance 
with such new legislation;
 > improve its management of energy, 
emissions, use of resources and waste 
performance to prevent pollution and 
provide resources to support 
effective improvement opportunities;
 > monitor and report the Group’s annual 
energy usage and greenhouse 
gas emissions, as appropriate; and
 > adopt sustainable procurement practices 
and work with customers and suppliers to 
improve energy performance throughout 
the Company’s supply chain.
The 2017 Strategic report, from pages 1 to 47, 
has been reviewed and approved by the 
Board of Directors on 13 March 2018.

47 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements Chairman’s introduction to governance
Rupert Robson
Chairman
Dear shareholder,
As a Board, we take our governance 
responsibilities seriously and recognise that 
instilling and promoting a culture rooted in 
our core values of honesty, integrity, respect 
and excellence is particularly important 
during a period of integration and change. 
We have made good progress during 
2017, further strengthening the 
governance and compliance frameworks 
that regulators, clients, shareholders 
and other stakeholders expect from the 
world’s leading interdealer broker. 
Evolution and reform
We remain committed to continual 
improvement in governance, culture and 
compliance. Recognising the increasing focus 
society places on corporate governance, 
the Board determined during the year that 
the Nominations Committee should take 
increased responsibility for overseeing 
governance matters. 
The renamed Nominations and Governance 
Committee will take the lead in ensuring the 
Company is prepared to react and adapt 
in response to legislative and business-led 
corporate governance measures implemented 
under the UK Government’s corporate 
governance reform. You can find further detail 
on the work of the Committee during 2017 , 
including its work on succession planning, 
on page 60.
Over the following pages you will also 
gain greater insight into the work of the 
Board and each of the other main Board 
Committees, and will see how we have 
fulfilled our governance responsibilities 
throughout the year.
More generally, with the slightly larger size of 
the Board now, we aim to move to a position 
where we refresh the Non-executive Director 
complement of the Board at the rate of one 
person every 12 months or so. This is not 
intended to be a hard and fast rule, as it is 
important to maintain flexibility. Nonetheless, 
an approach of this sort allows for staggering 
of Board rotation at an appropriate pace. 
Therefore, we are actively considering 
what further Board changes will need to be 
made in the coming 12 to 24 months. We are 
conscious of the fact that some non-executive 
members of the Board will have completed 
a number of years on the Board during 
this period.
Andrew Baddeley was Chief Financial 
Officer until he stepped down in November 
2017 . The search for Andrew’s replacement 
continues. Though not formally on the Board, 
Robin Stewart, Deputy CFO, has taken up the 
CFO responsibilities on an interim basis, and 
I thank him for his considerable efforts since 
November last year.
The Board recently concluded its annual 
evaluation of the Board and its committees. 
Given that the previous year’s evaluation 
was externally facilitated, this year it was 
an internal questionnaire-based exercise. 
The results of this evaluation confirmed 
that the Board and its committees continue 
to operate effectively, but also identified 
areas for further development. These are set 
out on page 57 of this report.
Compliance with the Code 
We have reviewed our governance framework 
with reference to the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, and a statement of compliance with the 
Code is set out on page 55.
Rupert Robson 
Chairman  
13 March 2018
Leadership
Against the background of T ullett Prebon’s 
acquisition of ICAP at the end of 2016, the 
Board committed to ensuring that it was  
fit for the future by appointing two new 
independent, international Non-executive 
Directors. I was delighted to welcome Edmund 
Ng on to the Board in November 2017, and 
in January 2018 we were joined by Michael 
Heaney. Edmund and Michael bring a range 
of relevant expertise and perspectives of 
financial markets in Asia and the Americas 
respectively, and also enhance the cultural 
diversity of the Board. We also have two 
women on the Board, Angela Knight and 
Carol Sergeant. Overall, we believe we have 
made significant progress in achieving a 
diverse set of Board members.
While I believe the Board’s composition 
provides an excellent blend of experience, 
expertise and challenge, we remain mindful 
of the need to bring in fresh perspectives. 
We will therefore continue to challenge 
ourselves to develop our Board succession 
plan, ever cognisant of the benefits that 
diversity, in all its forms, brings.
Stephen Pull has indicated that he would 
like to retire from the Board in the first few 
months of 2019. He will have been on the 
Board for seven and a half years by that 
point. To that end, we have recently 
embarked on a search for a new 
independent Non-executive Director, 
who will also start as a new member of the 
Remuneration Committee. With impending 
changes to the scope of the Remuneration 
Committee arising from the Financial 
Reporting Council’s (‘FRC’) review of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’), 
we are giving careful consideration to the 
skills required of this new individual. 
TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
48 Governance report Q 
How comprehensively has the Board 
considered the importance of TP 
ICAP’s culture, and how it wishes to instil 
this culture throughout the Company?
A 
The Board regularly discusses the 
culture of the Company, and how 
it is progressing towards becoming the 
employer of choice and role model for 
the sector. We have a culture rooted in our 
core values of honesty, integrity, respect 
and excellence. This is something I 
mentioned briefly in my statement in last 
year’s Annual Report and I’m pleased with 
the progress we have made over the past 
12 months. Nonetheless, there are always 
areas that can be improved and over the 
past year, we have been looking closely 
at the culture of the combined organisation 
as it establishes itself following the early 
stages of integration. 
As well as having the Company’s culture 
in mind throughout the year, the Board has 
begun receiving regular updates on culture 
and conduct. The culture monitor is a 
biannual internal report which provides 
commentary against specific goals and 
seeks to measure progress against them. 
Our Risk Committee also considers culture 
as a topic for review and discussion. 
Q 
How do TP ICAP’s values assist 
with harmonising the culture  
across the organisation?
A 
At TP ICAP, we believe it is 
fundamental to our success that the 
culture we promote within the organisation 
resonates with our employees in all 
our locations. Our core values of honesty, 
integrity, respect and excellence apply 
everywhere. These are set out in numerous 
places with examples of the behaviour 
we would expect to see to exemplify each 
value. The values are hard-coded into the 
performance management process for all 
employees. Our Code of Conduct is our guide 
to appropriate conduct and summarises 
standards to ensure that people are clear 
on what it means to ‘do the right thing’. We 
also welcome feedback from our employees 
to show how these values are working within 
the organisation and to identify any areas 
where we can continue to improve.
Q 
How has the Board considered 
the extent to which the business 
model and strategy relies on culture?
A 
Culture is fundamental to the long-
term success of a business and forms 
a significant part of our discussions on the 
business model and strategy of the Group. 
At TP ICAP, we believe the conduct of 
individuals and the Group is as important 
as the products and services we deliver. 
Ensuring the culture of the Company is based 
on our identified values helps us meet our 
clients’ needs, and creates a sustainable 
business model. Our reputation in the market 
is incredibly important to us and contributes 
to the success of the business.
Q 
To what extent do internal or 
external board evaluations include 
insights on the culture of the Board?
A 
Both the internal and external 
evaluations look at the culture of 
the Board and how it helps the Board 
operate effectively. I am proud of the culture 
of the Board, which I believe is one that 
encourages openness, challenge and 
collegiality amongst the members. The 
evaluations also consider the culture of the 
organisation as a whole.
Q&A with Rupert Robson on the importance of culture, ethics and integrity at TP ICAP
Q 
How does the Board ask for 
feedback from stakeholders, 
including employees, on the culture they 
would like to see within the Company?
A 
The Board welcomes feedback 
from all stakeholders. The Board 
is conscious of the obligations under s172 
of the Companies Act 2006 and has 
increased its focus on the appropriate 
approach to stakeholder engagement.
The Board has delegated to the 
Nominations and Governance Committee 
responsibility for considering how the 
Company can most effectively seek 
feedback from stakeholders. Some of the 
key stakeholders who frequently contribute 
are our shareholders, regulators, clients and 
employees. There are various avenues for 
shareholders to provide this feedback, 
including at the Annual General Meeting 
or through more informal discussions with 
the Chief Executive. Other colleagues on 
the Board, including most obviously the 
Senior Independent Non-executive Director 
and the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, are also available to 
shareholders. In addition, we hold regular 
meetings with regulators to ensure that the 
dialogue between us is as meaningful and 
open as possible. We ask all employees to 
complete an Engagement Survey, which 
allows them to express views on a number 
of matters, including culture. We review the 
results carefully. There is also an employee 
representation forum in the UK called 
‘involve’ which is made up of elected 
representatives. This forum provides a 
place for meaningful consultation and 
two-way dialogue on a number of issues. 
This has been especially important over 
the last 12 months, when we have been 
focused on creating a unified culture for 
the combined organisation.
“Instilling and promoting 
a culture rooted in
our core values.”

51 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements Leadership
For the majority of the year, the Board 
comprised two Executive Directors, five 
independent Non-executive Directors and 
a Non-executive Chairman. Well over half 
the Board was composed of independent 
Non-executive Directors throughout 2017 . This 
remains the case as at the date of this report. 
The Chairman, Rupert Robson, was 
independent of the Company and 
management at appointment but, as 
Chairman, is not classified as independent 
under the Code. His other significant 
commitments are noted in his biography 
on page 50.
The Directors’ biographies demonstrate the 
depth and breadth of the Board’s experience 
and skills. Eight of the current Directors 
(including six of the Non-executive Directors 
and the Non-executive Chairman) have 
extensive experience at senior levels in the 
financial services sector, including at an 
international level. With the most recent two 
appointments of Non-executive Directors, the 
Board has added extensive experience of 
financial markets in the Americas and Asia. 
One Non-executive Director is a chartered 
accountant and was an audit partner in a 
major firm of accountants. 
Independence
The Board has determined that all of the 
Non-executive Directors are independent 
in character and judgement.
At the start of each meeting, the Directors 
are invited to advise of any conflicts or 
potential conflicts in respect of any item 
on that meeting’s agenda.
The Nominations and Governance 
Committee will review at each of its 
meetings the Company’s Conflicts and 
Relevant Situations Register, which sets out 
information on Directors’ conflicts that have 
either been authorised (in accordance with 
s175 of the Companies Act 2006) or declared 
(in accordance with s177 of the Companies 
Act 2006), as well as setting out Directors’ 
other directorships. 
The Board believes that there are no 
relationships, conflicts of interest or 
other circumstances which are likely 
to affect, or could appear to affect, 
any Director’s judgement. 
The Senior Independent Non-executive 
Director is responsible for discussing with 
shareholders any concerns they have failed 
to resolve through the normal channels of 
Chairman, Chief Executive or Chief Financial 
Officer, or for which such contact is 
inappropriate. The Senior Independent 
Non-executive Director also provides a 
sounding board for the Chairman and is 
available to act as an intermediary for 
other Directors when necessary.

TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
52 Governance report Terms of appointment
The terms of the Directors’ service 
agreements and letters of appointment 
are summarised in the Report on Directors’ 
Remuneration on page 69. The letters of 
appointment of each of the Non-executive 
Directors in office throughout the year and 
that of the Chairman were refreshed in 
November 2017, not only to reflect increased 
fees as a result of increased workloads, but 
also to update terminology and references. 
Each of the Directors is subject to annual 
re-election by shareholders. The service 
agreements and the letters of appointment 
are available for inspection during normal 
business hours at our registered office, and 
at the AGM from 15 minutes prior to the 
meeting until its conclusion.
External appointments
The Directors’ other directorships are set 
out in the biographies on pages 50 and 51. 
The Board allows Executive Directors to take 
up appointments with other companies 
provided the time involved is not too 
onerous and would not conflict with their 
duties at TP ICAP . 
Board succession planning and diversity 
The Board recognises that a balanced Board, 
with a broad range of skills, experience, 
knowledge and diversity, is more likely to be 
an effective Board. The Nominations and 
Governance Committee, led by the Chairman, 
makes recommendations to the Board on 
Board appointments and succession planning, 
having regard to diversity aspirations, to 
the need to ensure there is an appropriate 
balance of skills and experience, and to 
ensure progressive refreshing of the Board. 
In considering diversity, we look at it in its 
widest sense, not just in respect of gender, 
but also age, experience, ethnicity and 
geographical expertise. 
We continue our commitment to increase the 
percentage of female Board members as 
quickly as we are able. Although we appear 
to have weakened gender diversity in terms 
of proportionality, in fact the dilution has 
been the result of initiating a search and 
appointing two additional Non-executive 
Directors has brought wider geographic 
expertise as well as cultural and ethnic 
diversity to the Board. The search was 
based on objective criteria, though with due 
regard to the Board’s diversity goals. During 
that search, we also considered female 
candidates. The two appointments were 
made on merit and on the basis that they 
were considered the best candidates to 
promote the success of the Company. Further 
detail about the recruitment of the two new 
Non-executive Directors is set out on page 60.
Our ability to increase our female 
representation at Board level depends 
on the availability of suitable candidates. 
During 2018, the Company will be reviewing 
its approach to diversity at all levels of the 
organisation, including at senior management 
level, to determine what further action we 
can take to improve diversity within TP ICAP . 
The continued entry of diverse candidates 
to our sector is vital, as is the retention and 
development of current talent within the 
Company. As a Board, we are committed to 
increasing further the percentage of women 
and the broader diversity of the Board.

Role of the Board and its committees 
The Board has a formal Schedule of Matters 
reserved to it for decisions. The roles of the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive are 
separate and a formal Statement of Division 
of Responsibilities has been adopted by 
the Company. The Board has Audit, 
Nominations and Governance, Risk and 
Remuneration Committees, to which it 
delegates some of its responsibilities 
through agreed Terms of Reference.
The Schedule of Matters Reserved, the 
Statement of Division of Responsibilities 
and each committee’s Terms of Reference 
are subject to annual review to ensure 
they cover best practice in their respective 
areas and are available on the Company’s 
website at www.tpicap.com. 
All members of the Board and committees 
have access to the services of the Company 
Secretary. The Company maintains liability 
insurance for its Directors and officers, 
and to the extent allowed by law and the 
Company’s Articles of Association, the 
Company provides a standard indemnity 
against certain liabilities that a Director 
may incur in their capacity as Director of 
the Company.
The Company has clearly defined policies, 
processes, controls and procedures which 
are subject to continuous review in order to 
meet the requirements of the business, the 
regulatory environment and the market. 
A framework is in place, approved by the 
Board, setting out authority levels delegated 
by the Board to individual Directors and 
senior management.

Chaired by the Chief Executive, the Global 
Executive Committee (‘GEC’) oversees the 
strategy and management of TP ICAP . The 
GEC is experienced in strategic and change 
management, building high-performing 
teams, managing risk and setting 
high standards of professionalism and 
accountability. As part of a continuing 
review of the senior management structure, 
regional leadership was consolidated during 
2017 so that in each of EMEA, Americas and 
APAC regions there is a sole regional chief 
executive officer. The GEC membership 
was consequently reduced. The names, 
responsibilities and biographies of members 
of the GEC can be found on the Company’s 
website at www.tpicap.com. 
Compliance with the Code
The Board reviewed the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) and its compliance with the Code 
throughout 2017 .
Following this review, the Board is pleased to confirm that throughout the year ended 31 December 2017 , the Company has fully complied with 
the Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’) in April 2016. A copy of the Code can be found on the FRC’s website: www.frc.org.uk.

The Board’s activities
The Board has a schedule of eight meetings 
a year to discuss the Group’s ordinary course 
of business in accordance with a detailed 
annual forward agenda developed by the 
Chairman and the Company Secretary, and 
agreed by the Board. Every effort is made to 
arrange Board meetings so all Directors can 
attend; additional meetings are occasionally 
arranged as required. The diagram on page 
55 shows the cycle of meetings, the table on 
page 52 shows the Board attendance record 
during the year and the pie chart on that 
page shows how the Board spent its time 
during the year.
During 2017, the Board held its June meeting 
in New York and its September meeting in 
Singapore. The locations of these meetings 
were chosen as they are the principal head 
office locations of the Americas and Asia 
Pacific regions, and gave the Board the

Board Strategy Day
In May 2017, the Board held a Strategy Day to discuss key areas of focus related to future strategy. The Board was joined by members of 
the Global Executive Committee and advisers, and considered and deliberated upon presentations on the following key strategic themes: 
 > MiFID II 
 > Acquisition and investment strategy, and the impact of regulation
 > The Institutional Services strategy 
 > The Data & Analytics strategy 
into each region’s performance, objectives, 
opportunities and risks during this critical 
period of integration, and to interact with 
regional management and staff. A meeting 
with only Non-executive Directors present 
was also held in Singapore to discuss 
various governance matters, including the 
development of the Nominations and 
Governance Committee. The Board and 
senior management also held a Strategy 
Day in May 2017 . One additional meeting 
of the Board was held at short notice in 
February in order to discuss necessary 
adjustments to the Remuneration Policy 
following shareholder feedback.
Keeping the Board informed 
The Board and its committees are provided 
with appropriate and timely information. 
All Directors receive written reports before 
each meeting, helping them make informed 
decisions on corporate and business issues.
The Group has a comprehensive system for 
financial reporting, subject to review by 
internal and external audit. Budgets, regular 
forecasts and monthly management accounts 
including KPIs, income statements, balance 
sheets and cash flows are prepared and the 
Board reviews consolidated reports of these.
All Board meetings are minuted and 
any unresolved concerns are recorded  
in the minutes. The Company Secretary 
is responsible for ensuring the Board stays 
up to date with key changes in legislation 
which affect the Company, and there are 
procedures in place for taking independent 
professional advice at the Company’s 
expense, if required.
Key agenda items discussed by the Board
During the year, main areas of focus of 
Board meeting discussion and review were 
performance against the integration plan, 
progress on planned synergy savings and 
process optimisation. There are regular 
business and management presentations. 
The other key areas discussed and reviewed 
by the Board in 2017 were as shown below:

Getting around the business: 
A view from Carol Sergeant
Individual performance evaluation
As a separate part of the annual evaluation 
process, there is a review of the effectiveness 
and commitment of individual Directors and 
the need for any training or development is 
assessed. This is carried out as follows:
 > The Chairman meets with the  
Non-executive Directors to evaluate 
the performance of the Chief Executive 
 > The Chairman meets each Non-executive 
Director individually 
 > The Senior Independent Non-executive 
Director and the other Non-executive 
Directors meet to evaluate the Chairman’s 
performance, having first obtained 
feedback from the Chief Executive
As part of the evaluation, an individual’s 
commitment of time to the Company in light 
of their other commitments, as noted in their 
biographies on pages 50 and 51, is reviewed. 
Angela Knight and Stephen Pull were subject 
to rigorous evaluation, in line with the Code, 
given that each will have served over six 
years by the time of the AGM in May 2018.
I have been fortunate in the last 12 
months to have the opportunity of 
visiting the head offices in each of our 
three regions more than once, not only 
as part of the main Board cycle visits 
during the year, but also leveraging 
my own personal travel itinerary to 
visit regional risk function colleagues 
and learn more about local issues 
and challenges.
TP ICAP continues to make good 
progress strengthening risk policies 
and infrastructure, and I have seen for 
myself how some of the new monitoring 
and control processes work in practice. 
It is pleasing to see so many colleagues 
embracing change. 
Professional development  
and corporate awareness
All Directors receive a comprehensive 
induction on joining the Board. Further detail 
with regard to the induction provided to the 
two Non-executive Directors appointed since 
the last AGM is set out in the Nominations 
and Governance Committee Report on 
page 60 and 61.
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring 
Directors continually update their skills 
and knowledge, and familiarity with the 
Company, so as to fulfil their role. Each of 
the main Board committees receives regular 
briefings on relevant current developments. 
The Board is kept informed of any material 
shareholder correspondence, broker reports 
on the Company and sector, institutional 
voting agency recommendations and 
documents reflecting current shareholder 
thinking. In addition, members of the 
GEC make regular presentations to the Board. 
The Non-executive Directors take advantage 
of relevant conferences, seminars and 
training events, and receive training 
materials from the Company and other 
professional advisers. They are also able 
to meet members of the management 
teams regularly, and periodically visit the 
Company’s international offices, usually 
in connection with other activities.
TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
58 Governance report Stakeholder engagement
As a Board, we endeavour to maintain 
good communication with a range of 
stakeholders. The ways we do this with 
some of our key stakeholders are set 
out in the following paragraphs.
Shareholders
The Board recognises the  
importance of communicating with 
shareholders. The Company website, 
www.tpicap.com/investors, provides 
information for shareholders 
and prospective investors on the 
Group’s activities, results, products 
and recent developments.
We enjoy regular dialogue with institutional 
investors, fund managers and analysts, 
which includes providing presentations of 
the results announcements, and meetings 
on request. The Company held a number of 
investor roadshows in the UK and USA, 
as well as individual meetings with 
shareholders and sell-side analysts.
The Company also recorded a webcast 
of its 2017 interim results presentation, 
which is available to download on the 
Company’s website. 
In November 2017, the Company held 
its first Capital Markets Day since the 
acquisition of ICAP . This presented 
institutional shareholders, potential 
investors and analysts with a good 
understanding of what TP ICAP does 
and the context in which we operate, 
presented the wider management team 
and provided a high-level view of the 
Company’s three-year strategy. A webcast 
of the day and slides are also available to 
download on the Company’s website.
The Chairman calls the top 15-20 shareholders 
each year to offer a telephone conversation 
or a meeting. All Non-executive Directors 
are also available to meet shareholders, 
if requested, and the Board is regularly 
updated on shareholder feedback and, in 
particular, any specific comments from 
institutional shareholders.
The Board uses the AGM to communicate 
with shareholders and welcomes their 
participation. We send notice of the AGM 
and related papers to shareholders at least 
20 working days before the meeting. The 
Chairman aims to ensure all Directors, 
including chairs of the committees of the 
Board, are available at AGMs to answer 
questions and meet shareholders. The proxy 
votes cast on each resolution proposed at 
general meetings are disclosed at those 
meetings. To encourage shareholder 
participation, shareholders whose shares 
are held on the CREST system are offered 
the facility to submit their proxy votes 
through CREST.
Employees 
Engagement with employees across the 
Group happens in a number of different 
ways. Employees are asked to complete 
an engagement survey that asks a broad 
range of questions to help us understand 
employee sentiment. The outputs of this 
survey have been shared with the Board, 
the management team and all employees. 
In addition to the survey, in the UK we have 
created an employee representation forum 
made up of elected individuals. This forum 
provides a regular opportunity for two-way 
dialogue on a number of topics. In every 
region, the Chief Executive holds frequent 
listening sessions in order to engage and 
answer questions from employees. We have 
also held ‘town hall’ meetings in all regions 
at which the Chief Executive presented on a 
number of topics to employees and held 
Q&A sessions. The Board also receives 
periodic reports from HR on matters such 
as employee engagement and culture. Given 
possible changes to the Code, the Board is 
considering other potential approaches to 
workforce and employee engagement.
Regulators 
As the Group is lead regulated by the Financial 
Conduct Authority (‘FCA ’), there is a pro-active 
system of engagement with the FCA:
 > to better understand their views and 
concerns and respond accordingly; 
 > to receive valuable feedback on our 
policies, procedures and our ways 
of working; and
 > to enable us to put our views across such 
that the FCA understand our positions.
Engagement is typically with the FCA ’s 
supervisory team but depending on the issues 
to be discussed we may meet with the FCA’s 
policy or competition teams. In addition to 
this close dialogue, we frequently engage 
with the FCA and other regulatory bodies via 
sector consultation and round table exercises. 
Other engagement with relevant agencies 
and the form of that engagement depends 
on the issues to be discussed.
Through engagement with various trade 
bodies, we also actively share our experience 
and expertise to help to raise standards and 
approaches across the sector. We advocate 
positions on a number of issues relevant to 
our business via the trade bodies or on our 
own account. 
The Board is kept apprised of discussions 
with the regulator through presentations 
from the Group General Counsel and Global 
Head of Compliance. Summaries of the 
meetings and discussions are also included 
in the regular legal and compliance updates 
that the Board receives.
Clients
Our relationships and engagement with 
our clients are fundamental to the success of 
TP ICAP . We recognise that we need to have 
regular and effective dialogue with our 
clients to understand what their needs are 
and how satisfied they are with our business, 
and to identify any areas that we could 
improve in order to serve them more 
comprehensively. Progress has been made 
throughout 2017 to foster and institutionalise 
relationships, not just between traders and 
brokers, but also between firms at a senior 
level. The Board receives regular updates on 
our clients through the Chief Executive and 
specific reports from our client relationship 
management team are periodically 
included on the agenda.

59 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements Report of the Nominations and  
Governance Committee
Dear shareholder,
I am pleased to have the opportunity of 
summarising the various matters that the 
Committee has been dealing with during 
a busy year. 
Succession planning
An important responsibility of the 
Committee is to oversee succession planning. 
The Committee recognises the importance 
of succession, not only at Board level but at 
all levels of senior management, to ensure 
there is a talent pipeline to draw from. 
At our meeting in March 2017, the 
Committee was joined by the Chief Executive 
and the Group Head of HR to review 
succession, talent development and 
recruitment initiatives – at broker level, 
through senior management levels and 
ultimately at Executive Director level. The 
meeting reviewed and discussed a formal 
senior management development 
programme and potential successors to 
those in the Global Executive Committee. 
There was also a detailed review of potential 
successors to the Executive Directors and 
any leadership development requirements 
identified for those individuals. During 2018, 
and beyond, the Committee intends to 
conduct a succession review twice a year.
Recruitment and appointment of directors
I advised in last year’s report that a search 
would commence for two new Non-executive 
Directors, one from the Americas and 
another from Asia, to provide the Board 
with more global representation and 
cultural diversity. Early in 2017, the 
Committee considered candidates’ other 
desirable attributes, and discussed the 
selection process, including the appointment 
of an independent recruitment consultant, 
Korn Ferry, which has no other connection 
with the Company. 
Over the following months there was 
long-listing of candidates, then shortlisting, 
and interviews were conducted by the 
Chairman, Chief Executive and other 
Non-executive Directors before final 
selection. In the case of both searches, a 
considerable effort was made to ensure 
that the final shortlists included women. 
The Committee then recommended to the 
Board the appointment of Edmund Ng, 
who was appointed on 1 November 2017, 
and Michael Heaney, who was appointed 
on 15 January 2018. 
The search is continuing for suitable 
candidates for the Executive Director 
position of Chief Financial Officer, 
following Andrew Baddeley stepping 
down from the Board in November 2017.
As previously mentioned, Stephen Pull, 
chairman of the Remuneration Committee, 
will be retiring from the Board in the first few 
months of 2019. A search has begun recently 
for his replacement and we are considering 
appropriate further refreshment of the 
non-executive membership of the Board 
over the coming 12 to 24 months.

60 Governance report Key responsibilities of the Committee
The Board has delegated responsibility 
to the Committee for:
 > reviewing the balance and skill, 
knowledge and experience of the 
Board, and considering membership  
of the Board Committees;
 > overseeing Board and senior 
management succession 
planning processes;
 > making recommendations to the 
Board on all proposed new 
appointments, elections and  
re-elections of Directors at AGMs;
 > overseeing the Board performance 
review process;
 > considering various governance 
matters, including compliance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code;
 > reviewing conflicts;
 > considering social and 
environmental matters;
 > reviewing the Company’s code 
of conduct; and
 > reviewing and approving the 
Company’s share dealing code and 
related policies.
Induction
Each of the new Non-executive Directors 
received a comprehensive induction 
programme. Prior to their first meetings, 
each was taken through a briefing with 
external legal advisers on Directors’ duties, 
roles and liabilities. Each received access to 
the Board and Committee packs (including 
minutes and papers) from previous Board 
cycles, and had one-to-one induction 
meetings with GEC members and other 
senior managers, including the Company 
Secretary. Company constitutional, 
compliance and governance documentation, 
as well as information relating to the Group 
structure and the expenditure control 
framework, was also provided. 
Governance
Towards the end of the year, the Committee 
recommended for adoption, and the Board 
approved, new Terms of Reference, which 
significantly widened the Committee’s remit 
and responsibilities to include overseeing 
governance matters. This followed a review 
of how the governance framework might 
need to be organised and resourced, 
to ensure it was fit for the future, and 
recognising the benefits of a more focused 
forum – one with a comprehensive forward 
agenda mapping areas of significant change 
both in the corporate governance and the 
regulatory environment. I am convinced that 
the transition to becoming a Nominations 
and Governance Committee will help us 
ensure our Board is as effective as possible.
Election and re-election of Directors
The Committee takes into account the results 
of the evaluations of individual Directors 
(see page 58 for further information) to assist 
in determining whether to recommend to the 
Board the election or re-election of Directors 
at the Annual General Meeting, as required in 
accordance with the Company’s Articles of 
Association. The Committee has considered 
the mix of skills and background of the 
members of the Board and considers that this 
mix is currently appropriate to the Company’s 
requirements, subject to the points made 
earlier about further refreshing the Board over 
the coming 12 to 24 months. In particular, the 
Board exhibits gender and cultural diversity, 
and the range of skills and backgrounds 
encompasses commercial, operating, control, 
political and international attributes. Further 
information on the Board’s approach to 
diversity can be found on page 53.
The Committee is pleased to recommend 
all Directors for election or re-election at 
the AGM in 2018.

61 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements Report of the Audit Committee
Dear shareholder,
As Chairman of the Audit Committee, I am 
pleased to introduce this report setting out 
how we have discharged our responsibilities 
during the year. The Committee’s primary 
focus is to ensure the integrity of financial 
reporting by reviewing the controls in place, 
and those areas where judgement is required. 
We have focused on a number of key areas 
this year including the recruitment of a new 
Chief Internal Auditor, as well as continuing to 
assist the Board with integration matters. 
Further in this report, I give an update on the 
action the Committee has taken in relation to 
its significant judgements in connection with 
the 2017 financial statements and how the 
Committee made its ‘fair, balanced and 
understandable’ recommendation to the 
Board. I also provide regular reports to the 
Board on the activities of the Committee 
and how we have discharged our duties.

Effectiveness
I am pleased to say the Committee has 
continued to be effective throughout 2017 , as 
reflected in the annual effectiveness review of 
our performance. The review did not identify 
any particular areas of concern. However, we 
are not complacent. In the coming year, for 
example, we will task internal audit under its 
new Head, with ensuring that management 
always takes full ownership and 
accountability for required improvements 
and to work with the Risk and Compliance 
functions to build a combined assurance map 
of the organisation. The Committee as a 
whole has solid recent and relevant financial 
experience and has competence relevant to 
the sector that the Company operates in. 
Outside of formal Committee meetings, 
I engage regularly with members of financial 
and risk management, as well as with 
external and internal audit, both in the 
UK and our principal overseas locations. 
This reinforces my understanding of the 
challenges facing the Group.
Key responsibilities of the Committee
The Board has delegated responsibility 
to the Committee for:
 > considering significant financial 
reporting judgements;
 > reviewing the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements and  
half-year results;
 > considering Group tax matters;
 > reviewing the going concern and the 
longer term viability statement;
 > reviewing the effectiveness of 
external audit;
 > assessing external auditor independence;
 > developing a policy for non-
audit services provided by the 
external auditor;
 > considering the effectiveness of the 
Group’s systems of risk management 
and internal control, including all 
material controls;
 > approving the internal audit’s risk 
assessment, internal audit charter and 
annual audit plan;
 > considering the results and findings 
of internal audit’s work;
 > reviewing the effectiveness of 
internal audit; and
 > reviewing whistleblowing arrangements.

These judgements, how the Committee

63 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements External auditor 
Effectiveness 
The Committee has a discussion with the 
external auditor at least once a year, without 
the Executive Directors being present, to 
ensure that there are no unresolved issues 
of concern. This helps ensure that the 
external auditor is able to operate 
effectively and challenge management 
sufficiently when required.
During the year as part of the 2017 
effectiveness review of both the 
external auditor and the 2017 audit, 
the Committee considered:
 > the quality of Deloitte’s 2017 external audit;
 > the effectiveness of the external audit 
process including the expertise, efficiency, 
global service delivery and cost 
effectiveness of the auditor;
 > the external auditor’s plans and 
feedback from senior management; and
 > effectiveness of management in relation 
to the timely identification and resolution 
of areas of accounting judgement, 
analysing those judgements, the quality 
and timeliness of papers, management’s 
approach to the value of independent 
audit and the booking of any audit 
adjustments arising, and the timely 
provision of draft public documents 
for review by the external auditor 
and the Committee. 
The Committee is pleased to report that the 
effectiveness review of the external auditor 
did not note any significant findings.
In addition, the Committee concluded that 
the 2017 external audit had been effective.
Independence and non-audit services
When considering the 2017 Annual Report, 
the Committee reviewed the objectivity 
and independence of the external auditor. 
We also considered the professional 
and regulatory guidance on auditor 
independence and Deloitte’s policies and 
procedures for managing independence. 
The Committee was satisfied with the 
auditor’s representations.
Fair, balanced and understandable 
In addition, as requested by the Board prior 
to its approval, we have reviewed and 
considered the processes and controls in 
place to help ensure that the 2017 Annual 
Report presents a fair, balanced and 
understandable view of the business. When 
conducting these reviews, the Committee:
 > examined the preparation and 
review process;
 > considered the level of challenge 
provided through that process and 
whether the Committee agreed with 
the results; and
 > considered the continuing 
appropriateness of the accounting 
policies, important financial reporting 
judgements and the adequacy and 
appropriateness of disclosures. 
We concluded that the processes and 
controls were appropriate, and were 
therefore able to make the following 
assurance to the Board: 
 > in our view, the Annual Report, taken  
as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Group’s position, performance, 
business model and strategy. 
Going concern and viability statement
The assumptions relating to the going 
concern review and viability statement were 
considered, including the medium term 
projections, stress tests and mitigation plans.
On the basis of the review, we advised  
the Board that it was appropriate for the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements  
to be prepared on a going concern basis.  
We also reviewed the long-term viability 
statement taking into account the Group’s 
current position and principal risks and 
uncertainties, and advised the Board that 
the viability statement and the three-year 
period of the assessment were appropriate.
To safeguard the external auditor’s 
independence and objectivity, the Company 
does not engage Deloitte for any non-audit 
services except where it is work that they must, 
or are clearly best suited to, perform. All 
proposed services must be pre-approved in 
accordance with the non-audit services policy, 
which is reviewed and approved annually. 
The Committee reviewed the level of fees 
paid to the external auditor for the various 
non-audit services provided during 2017 
(which are disclosed in Note 6 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements).

Audit and non-audit fees
During the period under review, the 
non-audit services performed by the external 
auditor amounted to £1.08m, 19% compared 
to the £4.66m of audit fees. Non-audit 
services primarily relate to regulatory 
reporting, the interim review of the Group’s 
half year financial statements and audits 
of subsidiary financial statements not 
mandated by law. These services are 
typically, or required to be, performed by 
the external auditor. More information 
can be found in Note 6 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
Report of the Audit Committee 
continued
TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
64 Governance report The Board is also responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal control and for reviewing 
its effectiveness. The system is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives, and can 
provide only reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against misstatement or loss.
The Audit Committee carried out an annual 
review of the effectiveness of the internal 
control and risk management systems and 
reported back to the Board to enable it to 
discharge its responsibilities. We conducted 
a formal review of the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal control systems for 2017 , 
considering reports from management, 
external audit and the work of the Group Risk 
and Internal Audit functions. The process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the 
principal risks faced by the Company is 
reviewed regularly by the Board and has been 
in place for the year under review and up to 
the date of approval of the Annual Report. It 
is also in accordance with the FRC’s ‘Guidance 
on Risk Management, Internal Control and 
Related Financial and Business Reporting’ . 
Internal audit 
The Committee is responsible for monitoring 
and reviewing the effectiveness of the 
internal audit function. We approve the 
internal audit plan and keep it under review 
during the year, to reflect the changing 
business needs and to ensure it considers 
new and emerging risks. 
During 2017, to ensure the audit plan 
had been completed effectively, the 
Committee reviewed:
 > the work and reports of internal audit;
 > how internal audit recommendations 
had been implemented; and
 > monitored progress against the internal 
audit plan during 2017 .
External audit tenders
Deloitte has been the Company’s auditor 
since the listing of its predecessor company 
in 2001. In 2013, the Board put the external 
audit contract out for tender and concluded 
that Deloitte should be re-appointed and 
that a new lead audit partner, Robert Topley, 
would be appointed to the Company’s audit 
by Deloitte in 2014, in accordance with 
normal rotation practices. The Committee 
will monitor legal requirements and 
developments in best practice with  
regard to audit tender arrangements. 
In the context of the acquisition of the ICAP 
business, the Committee considered the audit 
arrangements for the combined Group going 
forward. It concluded that in light of the 
recent audit tender referred to above, and 
taking into account the results of the review of 
the effectiveness of the external audit above, 
the Committee would recommend to the 
Board the re-appointment of Deloitte as 
external auditor of the newly enlarged Group. 
The Company confirms its compliance with 
the requirements of the Statutory Audit 
Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive 
Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014 throughout 
the year ended 31 December 2017.
Risk management and internal control
The Board is responsible for:
 > setting the Group’s risk appetite;
 > ensuring the Group has an appropriate 
and effective enterprise risk management 
framework (‘ERMF’); and
 > monitoring the ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating, managing and 
reporting the significant risks faced by 
the Group. 
The ERMF and principal risks are described 
in the Risk Management section of the 
Strategic report on pages 36 to 41. 
The Committee reviewed and approved the 
internal audit plan for the new internal audit 
year, running from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2018, 
prepared by the Head of Internal Audit, and 
reviewed the work and reports of internal 
audit since 1 January 2017 . Subsequent to 
the year end, the Committee has approved 
the updated internal audit plan for the 
combined business for the first half of 2018.
In addition to the review conducted last year, 
the Committee further considered the 
internal audit arrangements. The decision 
was made to move to a co-source 
arrangement with an in-house head of 
internal audit to work alongside the 
outsourced internal audit provider.
Consequently, we are also pleased to 
announce the appointment of Bernadine 
Burnell as our new Chief Internal Auditor. She 
has significant experience in leadership roles 
with a number of major financial institutions 
and, under her leadership, we expect our 
internal audit function to evolve alongside, 
and in response to, our growing business.
Whistleblowing
The Committee reviewed arrangements by 
which employees may, in confidence, raise 
concerns about improprieties in matters of 
financial reporting or other matters. In 
conducting the review, the Committee 
ensured that the policies remained in 
line with guidance published by the relevant 
statutory and regulatory regimes.

How the Commi tt ee spent

Dear shareholder,
As chairman of the Risk Committee, I am 
pleased to report how the Committee 
discharged its responsibilities during 2017 .  
As I said last year, the Committee’s role is not 
to eliminate risk, but to ensure that the risks TP 
ICAP takes in achieving its business objectives 
are reasonable and appropriate for the 
Group, can be managed and controlled 
within acceptable limits and are adequately 
supported by capital, liquidity, technology 
and skilled and committed people.
The work of the Risk Committee this year was 
dominated by integration and the need to 
respond to significant regulatory changes, 
notably MiFID II. At the same time the 
essential work on culture, conduct, and 
systems and process resiliency (including 
cyber risk) continued and we maintained our 
oversight of capital, liquidity and regulatory 
compliance. I am pleased to say that the 
organisation remained comfortably within 
risk appetite throughout this period, and in 
compliance with regulatory requirements.
Integration
The significant immediate integration risks 
(loss of key staff, client retention, operational 
issues, clarity of accountabilities, resource 
stretch, potential distraction from “business 
as usual”) were regularly monitored and 
challenged. At the same time there was a 
major re-build of the Risk and Compliance 
infrastructure to meet the needs of the new 
enlarged organisation. This is ongoing. This 
was supported by a risk based review of the 
combined activities of TP and ICAP, with 
a particular focus on the more complex 
activities and those businesses and activities 
that were new to either of the predecessor 
organisations. The Committee reviewed 
and approved a new Enterprise Risk 
Management Framework and risk taxonomy; 
a new organisational structure and 
operating model for Risk and Compliance; 
a new suite of policies and risk appetites, 
taking the opportunity to improve and 
streamline the legacy policies of TP and 
ICAP; and considered the adequacy of 
resourcing of the Risk and Compliance 
functions post-merger. There was a strong 
focus on the underlying culture of the new 
organisation in order to build a solid 
foundation for risk and compliance, as 
well as the effectiveness of training and 
communication necessary to embed them 
and make them part of the DNA of TP ICAP . 
A great deal has been achieved in 2017, but 
the focus will continue in 2018 to ensure that 
the new approach is fully embedded and 
working as intended. The key immediate 
risks of integration will also remain under 
close scrutiny as 2018 will likely see some 
of the more challenging aspects of the 
integration programme.
Regulatory changes
MiFID II has required significant changes 
to the way the Company operates and has 
been closely scrutinised by the Committee. 
It was made more challenging by the lack 
of regulatory clarity and certainty around 
some key aspects until fairly late in the 
process. However, as reported elsewhere, the 
necessary regulatory approvals were secured 
and TP ICAP is successfully operating 11 
compliant trading venues. As I write this 
report, all of these trading venues are 
operating well. However it is early days and 
the Committee will continue to monitor 
MiFID II implementation closely to ensure 
that any snags that may arise are promptly 
and effectively addressed.
The Committee’s terms of reference are 
available on the Company’s website: 
www.tpicap.com
TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
66 Governance report “There was a strong focus 
on the underlying culture 
of the new organisation 
in order to build a solid 
foundation for risk 
and compliance.”
Although MiFID II was the dominant 
regulatory challenge in 2017, the Committee 
also spent time reviewing the Company’s 
readiness for the General Data Protection 
Regulation (‘GDPR’) and the Senior 
Managers and Certification Regime 
(‘SMCR’). I can report good progress  
on both of these initiatives.
Finally it is worth noting that in addition to 
the continuing enhanced supervision that 
regulators world-wide are implementing 
in the financial services industry in general, 
the merger of TP and ICAP has made us 
the biggest in our industry and therefore 
inevitably subject to increased regulatory 
attention. The Committee is very conscious 
that the Company will be held to the highest 
regulatory standards and is mindful of this in 
our oversight and challenge.
Other key issues considered
IT and operational resilience were regularly 
on the agenda. We considered “end of life” 
systems issues and undertook a review 
of cyber risk, including an independent 
external review of the robustness of the 
Company’s defences and a review of 
contingency planning in the event of a 
successful attack. In addition, the Company 
conducted a full crisis management 
simulation exercise hosted and observed by 
an external specialist consultancy on which 
the Committee received positive feedback.
As part of our work on culture and conduct 
we reviewed with HR how job descriptions, 
objective setting and performance scorecards 
incorporate appropriate assessment of 
cultural behaviours and compliance with 
risk and conduct requirements. 
Review of Committee effectiveness
As mentioned earlier in the Annual Report, 
the Board and Committees undertook 
an internally facilitated self-assessment, 
which for Risk included the non-executive 
committee members, other non-executive 
attendees and senior executives who 
regularly attend the Committee. 
The Committee considered the evaluation 
report and concluded that the Committee 
is working well with no significant areas of 
concern but identified some areas of focus 
for the forthcoming year including:
 > continuing to focus on cultural 
underpinnings for risk, conduct and 
compliance and ways to monitor 
corporate culture;
 > developing the ways we systematically 
assess the risks in our corporate strategy; 
and
 > continuing to focus on our technology and 
data security risks. 
Capital and liquidity risk were examined 
regularly and showed that the Group had 
adequate capital and liquidity even in 
stressed scenarios.
We reviewed and responded to interactions 
and feedback from our regulators. I met 
with our lead regulator the Financial 
Conduct Authority last year and again 
this January, which enabled me to hear 
their views first hand and brief the Risk 
Committee accordingly. 
Because of the workload associated with 
integration and MiFID II, our programme of 
more detailed business and cross functional 
reviews was somewhat curtailed , however 
we still managed to conduct in-depth 
reviews of the Energy business, the Exchange 
Give Up business model, client on-boarding 
processes, IT and Operations and the Risk 
and Compliance functions in Asia Pacific. 
During the year the Risk Committee held 
meetings in Asia Pacific and the Americas 
alongside the Board meetings in the regions, 
which gave us all the opportunity to meet 
with Risk, Compliance and business leaders 
in those regions, on a one to one basis.
I have continued to hold regular meetings 
with the Risk and Compliance staff in EMEA, 
based in the UK and took the opportunity 
of non TP ICAP related visits to Singapore 
and New York to spend time with the Risk, 
Compliance and Business staff there, 
including meeting a number of our new 
colleagues from ICAP . I have also spent time 
with our monitoring team and seen for myself 
the key monitoring tools in action. I was able 
to report positively to the Committee on 
the increasing effectiveness of the systems 
and the knowledge and experience of the 
monitoring team personnel. In 2018 I plan 
to attend and observe a meeting of each 
the key executive risk and compliance 
committees throughout the Group and 
report back to the Risk Committee.

Conclusion
Overall I am satisfied with the developments 
and achievements this year and congratulate 
the executive team in particular on finding 
a good balance between the considerable 
demands of integration and MiFID II 
implementation and achieving 
successful outcomes for both in 2017.
I am grateful to Committee members for their 
contributions and support. Between them the 
Committee members have deep experience 
and knowledge in financial services, risk, 
compliance, regulation, IT , operations and 
audit, and with Edmund Ng and Michael 
Heaney joining the Committee, we will have 
the added benefit of first hand and current 
experience in Asia Pacific and the Americas.
But we are not complacent. We can always 
do better and the expectations of our various 
stakeholders are not diminishing. At our last 
meeting in 2017 we agreed a substantial 
work plan for 2018 which starts from a 
detailed bottom up risk mapping of all our 
businesses by type of activity and location. 
This will support more detailed work on risk 
costs and risk appetite, which should provide 
commercial as well as deeper risk insight 
benefits. There will also be significant 
new regulatory challenges to address.

TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
68 Governance report Directors’ Remuneration Report
Chairman’s statement
Dear shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
present the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
(‘DRR’) for the year to 31 December 2017 . 
The report comprises:
 > the Annual Report on Remuneration, 
which explains how we applied our 
Policy in 2017; and
 > the approved Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy for 2017-2019.
There will be an advisory vote on the 2017 
Annual Report on Remuneration, together 
with this opening statement, at the AGM 
to be held in May 2018. The Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy (the ‘Policy’) for 
2017-2019 was approved at the 2017 AGM, 
and has been applied during the year. 
We have included the approved Policy 
in full on pages 83 to 86 of this report, 
for information.
Background
As disclosed in last year’s DRR, the 
Committee undertook a fundamental 
review of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy in light of the acquisition of ICAP.
A one-off, Transformation Long Term 
Incentive Plan (‘Transformation LTIP’) was 
introduced with demanding targets aligned 
to the three-year integration period to 
reward the Executive Directors for value 
created from the acquisition, with no further 
awards under the Long Term Incentive 
Scheme (‘LTIS’) over this period and reduced 
potential annual bonus payments. The 
integration is currently on track after year 
one of the three-year integration period, and 
is entering the challenging second phase. 
The Transformation LTIP was designed to 
drive sustained performance throughout 
the three years of the integration period.
In developing the Policy, the Committee 
took into account the fact that TP ICAP is 
the world’s largest interdealer broker; the 
markets in which we operate are global 
and competition for talent is intense. Our 
principal competitors are BGC Partners Inc. 
and Compagnie Financière Tradition neither 
of which are listed on the UK stock market. 
We are pleased to report that this Policy was 
approved by more than 89% of shareholders 
at the 2017 AGM. No changes to the Policy 
are proposed this year, as the integration of 
the two businesses continues to progress.
Performance and reward  
outcomes for 2017 
Our Policy rebalances compensation 
towards long term performance, through 
the Transformation LTIP, with the annual 
bonus opportunity for Executive Directors 
substantially reduced. This is reflected in 
the reward outcomes for 2017. Our Chief 
Executive received an annual bonus for 2017 
49% lower than for 2016 and our Chief 
Financial Officer received a bonus 35% lower 
than 2016 on an annualised basis. In each 
case, 50% of the gross bonus is awarded in 
shares with a three-year deferral period. The 
2015 LTIS award will vest as to 61% out of a 
possible 75% arising from the TSR and cash 
flow measures. The remaining 25% of the 
award depends upon a comparative RoE 
metric and its percentage vesting will be 
determined during Q2 2018.
Financial performance for 2017 delivered 
an increase in underlying operating profit 
of 10%.

continued
Non-executive Director (‘NED’) fees were 
reviewed during the year. The NED base fee 
will remain unchanged for 2018. However 
the fees for chairing the Audit, Risk and 
Remuneration Committees have each 
been increased to £20,000 per annum 
effective 1 November 2017, and the Senior 
Independent Director fee has also been 
increased to £10,000 per annum. 
Fees of £10,000 per annum will be paid for 
membership of the Audit, Risk and 
Remuneration Committees. As we reported 
in last year’s Annual Report, the Board 
decided to appoint new NEDs from Asia and 
from the Americas, and we were pleased 
to report the appointment of Edmund Ng 
as the new NED from Asia, and Michael 
Heaney from the Americas. The Board has 
introduced a fee supplement of £45,000 for 
the Asia and Americas NEDs to recognise 
the significant additional time commitment 
required of these NEDs in attending Board 
meetings. The Chairman’s fees increased 
to £250,000 from £200,000 effective 
1 November 2017. Increased fees reflect 
a significant increase in workload and 
followed an external benchmarking exercise. 
The Board is currently in the process of 
considering candidates for the position 
of CFO and will announce the appointment 
in due course. Details of the CFO’s 
remuneration will be included in next 
year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
Looking ahead to 2018
John Phizackerley will receive a salary 
increase in line with the planned average 
percentage increase to the broader 
workforce of 3%, for 2018. The annual bonus 
will continue to be based on a scorecard of 
annual financial and strategic performance 
targets, aligned to the three-year integration 
plan, and conduct and risk KPIs. There are no 
changes to the maximum bonus opportunity 
of 2.5x base salary for the Chief Executive. 
50% of the total bonus awarded will be 
deferred into shares vesting after three years. 
There will be no further long-term incentive 
awards during the operation of the 
Transformation LTIP .
As discussed in last year’s Remuneration 
Report, the T ransformation L TIP was also 
intended to reward Global Executive 
Committee (‘GEC’) members to ensure the 
GEC’s long-term reward potential is aligned 
to the same overarching performance goals 
and behaviours as the Executive Directors. 
Accordingly, GEC members also participate 
in the Transformation LTIP and have received 
confirmation of their individual awards. 
Whilst the T ransformation L TIP is the principal 
element of Executive Director remuneration, 
replacing the previous L TIS grants for the 
2017-19 period, the Transformation LTIP is an 
additional remuneration element for GEC 
members and is therefore awarded at a 
substantially lower quantum.
Pension
There has been growing pressure from 
investors for downward alignment of pension 
allowances for Executive Directors with the 
broader workforce. At TP ICAP, Executive 
Directors are eligible for the same level of 
Company pension contributions as applies 
to other employees. Furthermore, where 
executives are unable to receive pension 
contributions due to HMRC limits, the 
Company’s current practice is not to provide 
cash in lieu of pension, so the Chief 
Executive’s current pension benefit is zero. 
Departing Chief Financial Officer
As announced on 3 November 2017, Andrew 
Baddeley stepped down from the Board, 
and remained an employee for the first two 
months of his six month notice period to 
ensure a smooth transition whilst the search 
commenced for his replacement. Andrew 
left employment on 31 December 2017 
(the ‘Termination Date’). He was awarded 
a bonus for 2017, based on performance 
achieved, with 50% of the bonus deferred 
and awarded in shares with a three-year 
vest. He will also retain a time-reduced 
portion of his Transformation LTIP award, 
which will vest in 2020 subject to the 
performance conditions. His outstanding 
deferred bonus awards will vest at the 
normal time, and his outstanding 2016 LTIS 
award is time pro-rated in line with the rules 
of the plan and will vest in 2018 based on 
performance assessed to the Termination 
Date. Full details on the payments made to 
Andrew Baddeley are set out on pages 78 
and 79.

As stated in last year’s DRR, the fixed remuneration of the Chief Executive, John Phizackerley, was increased following the acquisition to 
£600,000 effective from 1 January 2017 . This reflected the increase in scope of his role, his strong performance over the previous two years 
and, took into account negligible benefits and no pension allowance. The Chief Executive’s fixed remuneration remains significantly below 
market competitive levels.
Andrew Baddeley, the Chief Financial Officer, also received an increase in salary to £425,000 effective from 1 January 2017 in view of the 
changes to his role following the acquisition. 
For 2018, the Chief Executive’s base salary has been increased by 3%, in line with the planned average percentage salary increase to the

The Remuneration Committee considered that comparison of the Chief Executive’s remuneration with that of Senior Management would accordingly be more meaningful 
than comparison with all employees.
This table shows the change of the Chief Executive’s fixed and variable remuneration compared on a like for like basis to Senior Management 
employed throughout 2016 and 2017 .
As discussed in last year’s Remuneration Report, the Chief Executive’s salary was increased from £550,000 to £600,000 in light of his 
performance over the previous two years, his enlarged role following the acquisition of ICAP, and external market data. As the Chief 
Executive does not receive a pension allowance and benefits are negligible, the Chief Executive’s total fixed pay remains significantly below 
the market median.

TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
82 Governance report Directors’ Remuneration Policy (unaudited)
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM and is included here for information only.  
The Remuneration Policy table applicable to 2016 can be found in previous copies of the Annual Report and Accounts.
Background
In reviewing and approving the general principles of the Company’s Remuneration Policy which applies throughout the Group, the 
Remuneration Committee took account of the Company’s goal to become the world’s most trusted source of liquidity in hybrid OTC  
markets and the best operator in global hybrid voice broking. The Remuneration Committee was mindful that the Group’s strategy to  
achieve that objective is to continue to develop its business, operating as an intermediary in the world’s major wholesale OTC and exchange 
traded financial and commodity markets, with the scale and breadth to deliver superior performance and returns, underpinned by strong  
financial management disciplines and without actively taking credit and market risk.
The Remuneration Committee also took into account general practices in the parts of the financial services sector in which the Company 
operates, and in particular those of the Company’s competitors which include BGC Partners Inc. and Compagnie Financière Tradition.  
These practices are characterised by high levels of variable remuneration. The Remuneration Committee concluded that it is in the best 
interests of the Company and shareholders to pay remuneration in line with market practice in the sectors in which the Company operates.
The Company’s Remuneration Policy is designed to attract, motivate and retain employees with the necessary skills and experience to deliver 
the strategy, in order to achieve the Group’s objectives.
Risk
The Remuneration Committee considered the relationship between incentives and risk when approving the Remuneration Policy which will 
apply throughout the Group.
Details of the Group’s key risks and risk management are set out in the Strategic report of this Annual Report and Accounts on pages 36 to 41. 
The majority of transactions are brokered on a Name Passing basis where the business is not a counterparty to a trade.
Commissions earned on these activities are received monthly in cash. The business does not take any trading risk and does not hold principal 
trading positions. The business only holds financial instruments for identified buyers and sellers in matching trades which are generally settled 
within one to three days. The business does not retain any contingent market risk and is not exposed to any material counterparty credit risk. 
The business does not have valuation issues in measuring its profits.
The Remuneration Committee also concluded that the Company’s Remuneration Policy reflects the risk profile of the Group, is consistent with  
and promotes sound and effective risk management, and does not encourage risk taking.
The Remuneration Committee considers that the Company’s Remuneration Policy is consistent with the measures set out in the Group’s 
compliance manuals relating to conflicts of interest.
The Company’s policy is to ensure that variable remuneration is not paid through vehicles or methods that facilitate avoidance of the 
Remuneration Code.

Annual discretionary bonus
Aim is to motivate and retain Executive 
Directors, consistent with the risk appetite 
determined by the Board and thereby to 
achieve superior returns for shareholders. 
It provides a direct link between  
the achievement of annual business 
performance targets and reward. 
The shareholding requirements align 
Directors’ interests with shareholders.
Annual assessment of performance against strategic and financial objectives. The strategic and 
financial objectives will be set on an annual basis and disclosed retrospectively.
Executive Directors will have a mandatory 50% Bonus Deferral each year – such deferral to be 
awarded in Company shares with a three-year deferral period. These shares can be used to meet  
the investment requirement.
The maximum CEO annual 
bonus will be 2.5 x base salary.
The maximum CFO annual 
bonus will be 2 x base salary.
Annual strategic and financial targets will 
be set. 
The targets will include key financial metrics 
and applicable behavioural metrics.
Achievement of on-target performance 
will result in 60% payout.
Malus and claw-back provisions apply to the whole annual 
bonus which enables the Committee to recoup payouts 
under the Plan either by reducing or cancelling any 
unvested deferred awards or reclaiming amounts paid.
Malus or claw-back may be applied where there is a 
material adverse, misstatement of performance for the 
period to which the bonus related event or a material 
misstatement of results for the period to which the bonus 
related or, an Executive Director’s conduct is found to 
amount to gross misconduct and/or fraud, wilful dishonesty 
or accounting malfeasance.
Minimum shareholding
Aligns Directors’ interests with 
shareholders by focusing on 
longer term shareholder returns.
Directors must hold a minimum number of the Company’s ordinary shares equivalent to 300% of 
base salary in respect of the Chief Executive and 200% of base salary for all other Executive Directors 
built up over a five year period. 
None None None
Transformation LTIP
Aligns Directors’ interests with 
shareholders by focusing on 
longer term shareholder returns.
One-off three-year LTIP (2017-2019) linked directly to achievement of strategic targets for  
the integration.
TSR will be measured from Q1 2017 to Q1 2020. Underlying EPS will be full year 2019 underlying EPS.
Shares will be subject to a holding period and will be released 1/3 in April 2021, 1/3 in April 2022 and 
1/3 in April 2023. During the holding period the shares cannot be sold (other than to cover the cost of 
any applicable taxes thereon).

85 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements Policy on Directors’ remuneration compared with employees generally (unaudited)
As a general rule, the same principles are applied to Directors’ fixed remuneration, pension contributions and benefits as are applied to 
employees throughout the Group. A competitive level of fixed remuneration is paid to all employees taking into account their responsibilities 
and experience and minimal pension provision and benefits are provided, the Board considering that employees are best placed to 
determine priorities for funds set aside for remuneration.
There are a number of different bonus schemes in operation throughout the Group for Brokers, Senior Management and other employees. 
Brokers’ bonus schemes are described below; all other bonuses are generally discretionary. In addition, the Deferred Bonus Plan introduced 
for Senior Managers for the 2015 bonus year continued in 2016 and it has again been operated for the 2017 bonus year. Under this Plan, 
employees identified as Senior Managers had 20% of their discretionary 2017 bonus award deferred into equity for a three-year period.  
The grants of equity are expected to be made in Q2 2018 and are subject to forfeiture, in whole or in part, in the event the employee resigns  
or employment is terminated for gross misconduct as defined in the Employee Handbook. 112 employees participated in the 2017 Deferred 
Bonus Plan with participants located in London, New York, New Jersey, Paris, Frankfurt, Sydney and Singapore.
Throughout the annual discretionary bonus review cycle the Group General Counsel and Global Head of Compliance and the Chief Risk Officer 
are consulted in order to validate that there are no reasons why an employee ear-marked to received a bonus should have their bonus withheld.
The Remuneration Committee does not believe that a formal capping of bonuses for Senior Management and Brokers is consistent with the 
delivery of enhanced returns to shareholders and accordingly no caps have been introduced on Senior Management’s or Brokers’ bonuses at 
this time. We will continue to review this matter in light of any future changes to the Remuneration Code.
Remuneration policies for brokers (unaudited)
The Company’s Remuneration Policy for Brokers is based on the principle that remuneration is directly linked to financial performance, 
generally at a desk team level, and is calculated in accordance with formulae set out in contracts of employment. These formulae take into 
account the fixed costs of the Brokers; variable remuneration payments are therefore based on the profits that the Brokers generate for the 
business together with an assessment of individual performance and conduct against core Group values – Honesty, Integrity, Respect and 
Excellence. Initial contract payments are only paid upfront when a claw-back provision is included in the contract of employment. Typically, 
Brokers receive a fixed salary paid regularly throughout the year, with a significant portion of variable remuneration dependent on their 
revenue, conduct and performance, which is paid after the revenue has been fully received in cash.
Remuneration policies for control functions (unaudited)
The Company’s Remuneration Policy for Control Functions is that remuneration is adequate to attract qualified and experienced employees, 
is in accordance with the achievement of objectives linked to their functions, and is independent of the performance of the business areas 
they support. Employees in such functions report through an organisation structure that is separate to and independent from the business 
units. Heads of Control Functions are designated as Remuneration Code Staff and accordingly their remuneration is reviewed by the 
Remuneration Committee as part of the Senior Manager bonus review undertaken in January/February each year.

87 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements Executive Directors’ service agreements and loss of office entitlements (unaudited)
The Chief Executive’s contract may be terminated by either party on the expiry of six months’ written notice by either party (save in 
circumstances justifying summary termination) or by making a payment in lieu of notice at the Company’s election. The Company will 
consider the scope for requiring the Executive Director to mitigate his loss when taking account of all the circumstances surrounding 
the termination of employment. The Executive Director would also be entitled to a payment for accrued but untaken holiday.
The Chief Financial Officer’s contract may be terminated by either party on the expiry of six months’ written notice by either party (save  
in circumstances justifying summary termination) or by making a payment in lieu of notice at the Company’s election. The Company will 
consider the scope for requiring the Executive Director to mitigate his loss when taking account of all the circumstances surrounding the 
termination of employment. The Executive Director would also be entitled to a payment for accrued but untaken holiday.
Where the Executive Director is deemed to be a ‘good leaver’, the Remuneration Committee may, at its sole discretion, award a part-year 
bonus for the period worked. The bonus will be assessed on demonstrated performance over the part-year. Post-termination restrictive 
covenants also apply to each Executive Director. The determination of ‘good leaver’ status will be determined at the sole discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee.
In addition to the contractual rights to a payment on loss of office, any employee including the Executive Directors may have additional 
statutory and/or common law rights to certain additional payments, for example in a redundancy situation.
When determining payments for loss of office, the Company will take account of all relevant circumstances on a case by case basis 
including (but not limited to): the contractual notice provisions and outstanding holiday; the best interests of the Company; whether the 
Executive Director has presided over an orderly handover; the contribution of the Executive Director to the success of the Company during 
their tenure; and the need to compromise any claims that the Executive Director may have or to pay the Executive Director’s legal costs on 
a settlement agreement.
The LTIS rules provide for an award to lapse in all circumstances where an Executive Director ceases to hold office or employment with a 
Group company other than death, unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, in which case any award would vest to the 
extent that the performance conditions had been met and the extent that the performance period had elapsed.
Under the Transformation LTIP, the full terms and conditions of the awards are contained in the Plan documents. In the event that an Executive 
Director leaves employment prior to 31 December 2019, the default position is that they will forfeit participation in the Transformation LTIP . 
The Remuneration Committee can choose to exercise their discretion and consider the employee to be a ‘good leaver’. Good leavers will  
(other than in exceptional circumstances) be eligible for a time reduced participation under the Transformation LTIP at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee. The time-reduced participation level will reflect the period of active employment from 1 January 2017 to the 
Termination Date subject to relevant shareholder and proxy guidelines. Any vesting will be subject to the performance conditions and shares 
awarded at the Normal Vesting Date subject to the Rules of the Transformation LTIP.
Non-executive Directors’ appointment letters (unaudited)
The Non-executive Directors serve under letters of appointment which are terminable on the earliest of the Director not being re-elected at 
an AGM, removed as a Director or required to vacate office under the Articles of Association, on resignation, at the request of the Board or 
subject to six months’ notice for the Chairman or three months’ notice for the other Non-executive Directors.

TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
88 Governance report Recruitment of Directors (unaudited)
The Remuneration Committee’s approach to setting remuneration for new Executive Directors is to ensure that the Company pays market rates, 
with reference to internal pay levels, the external market, location of the Executive and remuneration received from the previous employer.
Salary will be provided in line with market rates, and the Remuneration Committee reserves discretion to offer appropriate pension 
and benefit arrangements, which may include the continuation of benefits received in a previous role in exceptional circumstances only. 
Ongoing variable pay awards for a newly appointed Executive Director will be as described in the Policy table, subject to the same 
maximum opportunities. It is not currently intended that future service contracts for Executive Directors would contain terms differing 
materially from those summarised in this report, including with respect to notice provisions.
The Remuneration Committee may consider offering additional cash or share-based payments to buy-out existing awards forfeited by a  
new Executive Director when it considers these to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Any such buy-out payments 
would mirror so far as possible the remuneration lost when leaving the former employer. The Remuneration Committee may avail itself of  
the current Listing Rule exemption to make such buy-out awards where doing so is necessary to facilitate, in exceptional circumstances, the 
recruitment of the relevant individual.
Relocation payments may also be set, within limits to be determined by the Remuneration Committee, where considered appropriate and in 
the Company’s best interests to do so.
In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal promotion, the Group will honour any contractual commitments made 
prior to their promotion to Executive Director.
The fee payable to a new Non-executive Director will be in line with the fee structure for Non-executive Directors in place at the date of appointment.

90 Governance report Directors’ conflicts
The Directors are required to notify the Company of any potential conflicts of interest that may affect them in their roles as Directors of 
TP ICAP. All potential conflicts of interest are recorded and reviewed by the full Board at least annually.
Directors’ indemnity arrangements
The Company has made qualifying third party indemnity provisions for the benefit of its Directors, which remain in place at the date of 
this report. The principal employer of the Tullett Prebon Pension Scheme has given indemnities to the Directors who are trustees of that 
Scheme. The Company maintains liability insurance for its Directors and officers.
Appointment and replacement of Directors
With regard to the appointment and replacement of Directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of Association (the Articles), the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Companies Act 2006 and related legislation. The Articles may be amended by special resolution of the 
shareholders and were last amended at the Company’s AGM in May 2017 . At each AGM, all the Directors who held office on the date seven 
days before the Notice of that AGM must retire from office and each Director wishing to continue to serve must submit themselves for election 
or re-election by shareholders.
Share capital and control
The Company has one class of ordinary shares, which carry no right to fixed income. Each share carries the right to one vote at general 
meetings of the Company.
No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid.
The voting rights of the ordinary shares held by the Tullett Prebon plc Employee Benefit Trust 2007 are exercisable by the trustees in 
accordance with their fiduciary duties. The right to receive dividends on these shares has been waived. Details of employee share schemes 
are set out in Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Restriction on transfer of securities and voting rights
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the transfer of shares, both of which are governed by the provisions in the 
Articles and prevailing legislation. The Directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that may result 
in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights, nor are there any arrangements by which, with the Company’s co-operation, 
financial rights carried by securities are held by a person other than the holder of those securities.
Powers of the Directors
As granted by shareholders at the 2017 AGM, the Directors have the authority to allot shares and to buy the Company’s shares in the market. 
At the last AGM, resolutions were passed to authorise the Directors to allot up to a nominal amount of £92,355,445 (subject to restrictions 
specified in the relevant resolutions) and to purchase up to 55,413,267 ordinary shares. These authorities are set to expire so similar authorities 
will be proposed at this year’s AGM. 
At the date of this Annual Report, no shares had been purchased in the market under the authority granted at the 2017 AGM. The allotment 
and buy-back authorities will expire at the conclusion of the 2018 AGM or, if earlier, on 1 July 2018, unless renewed before that time.
Further powers of the Directors are described in the Schedule of Matters Reserved for the Board, which is available on the Company’s website.

and pro ration for time, if appropriate. 
The Company is not aware of any other significant agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company 
following a takeover bid, nor any agreements with the Company and its employees or Directors for compensation for loss of office or 
employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.

Greenhouse gas emissions 
TP ICAP, as an office-based business, is not engaged in activities that are generally regarded as having a high environmental impact. 
However, the Board has agreed that it will seek to adopt policies to safeguard the environment to meet statutory requirements or where 
such policies are commercially sensible.
The estimated Group greenhouse gas emissions for 2016 and 2017 are set out below:
Tonnes of CO
2
e
2017 2016
Combustion of fuel, vehicles, fugitive emissions (scope 1) 3,377 629
Purchased electricity (scope 2) 10,722 8,977
Total 14,099 9,606
Total emissions per employee 2.7 3.4
The emission statistics were calculated by Sustain Limited using the ‘Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard (revised edition 2015)’. The analysis included all material sources of emissions for which the Group is directly responsible.
Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions including combustion of fuels and owned vehicles. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions resulting 
from generating electricity purchased for office buildings.
The estimate covers all TP ICAP operations that are consolidated in the financial statements. Data was collected for the Group’s 
representative sites of different sizes in each region (approximately 56% of the total TP ICAP offices) and were used in an extrapolation 
exercise to estimate the consumption across the rest of the Group’s global operations. Data was also collected for the Group’s managed or 
owned transport activity. This activity data was then converted to greenhouse gas estimates using the UK Government’s GHG Conversion 
Factors for Company Reporting 2017 and the International Energy Agency’s Overseas Electricity factors for overseas electricity consumption.

92 Governance report Political donations
It is the Company’s policy not to make cash contributions to any political party. However, within the normal activities of the Group, there may 
be occasions when an activity might fall within the broader definition of ‘political expenditure’ contained within the Companies Act 2006. 
During 2017, no political donations were made by the Group (2016: £nil).
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
The Directors’ Statement regarding their responsibility for preparing the Annual Report is set out on page 94.
Auditor
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office as auditor and a resolution to re-appoint them will be proposed at the 
forthcoming AGM.
Disclosure of information to the auditor
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval of this Annual Report confirms that:
 > so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
 > the Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself/herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Annual General Meeting 
The AGM of the Company will be held at 12.45pm on 10 May 2018. Details of the resolutions to be proposed at the AGM are set out in 
a separate Notice of Meeting together with explanatory notes set out in a separate circular. The Notice of Meeting will be sent to all 
shareholders entitled to receive such notice. Only members on the register of members of the Company as at close of business on 8 May 2018 
(or two days before any adjourned meeting, excluding non-business days) will be entitled to attend and vote at the AGM. Any proxy must 
be lodged with the Company’s registrars or submitted to CREST at least 48 hours, excluding non-business days, before the AGM or any 
adjourned meeting thereof.
Resolutions dealing with the authority to allot shares, disapplication of pre-emption rights, authority to buy back shares and to convene 
general meetings other than annual general meetings on no less than fourteen days’ notice will be put to the AGM as special business.

93 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
In the case of the Parent Company Financial 
Statements, the Directors are required to:
 > select suitable accounting policies 
and apply them consistently;
 > make judgements and estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent;
 > state whether applicable UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the Financial Statements; and
 > prepare the Financial Statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the Financial 
Statements comply with the Companies  
Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company  
and hence for taking reasonable steps  
for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors are responsible for  
preparing the Annual Report and  
the Financial Statements in accordance  
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare Financial Statements for each 
financial year. Under that law, the Directors 
are required to prepare financial statements 
for the Group in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union 
and Article 4 of the International Accounting 
Standard (‘IAS’) Regulation and have chosen 
to prepare the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law), including 
FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’. 
Under company law, the Directors must  
not approve the accounts unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Company and  
of the profit or loss of the Company for  
that period.
In the case of Group Financial Statements, 
IAS 1 requires that directors:
 > select and apply accounting  
policies properly;
 > present information, including accounting 
policies, in a manner that provides 
relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
 > provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific requirements 
in IFRS are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions 
on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
 > make an assessment of the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
Responsibility statement
The Directors confirm that to the best  
of their knowledge:
 > the Financial Statements, prepared in 
accordance with the relevant financial 
reporting framework, give a true and fair

TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
94 Governance report Our opinion on the Financial Statements of TP ICAP plc is unmodified. In our opinion:
 > the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and  
of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 > the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as 
adopted by the European Union;
 > the Parent Company Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice including Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’; and
 > the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the Financial Statements of TP ICAP plc (the ‘Parent Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) which comprise:
 > the Consolidated Income Statement;
 > the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income;
 > the Consolidated Balance Sheet;
 > the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity;
 > the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement;
 > the related Consolidated Financial Statement Notes 1 to 38;
 > the Parent Company Balance Sheet;
 > the Parent Company Statement of Changes in Equity; and
 > the related Parent Company Notes 1 to 9.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the Group Financial Statements is applicable law 
and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the Parent Company Financial Statements is applicable 
law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 
‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘ISAs (UK)’) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
Financial Statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not 
provided to the Group or the Parent Company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
 > Name Passing revenue;
 > impairment of goodwill and other intangibles;
 > finalisation of the provisional accounting for the ICAP acquisition; and
 > presentation and disclosure of Cost Improvement Programme (‘CIP’) and integration  
related items.
Our key audit matters are consistent with the key risks identified in the prior year.
Materiality The materiality that we used for the Group financial statements was £9.6m which was 
determined with reference to underlying profit before tax. 
Scoping Our Group audit scope focused primarily on eight locations with 30 subsidiaries subject to a  
full scope audit.
The subsidiaries selected for a full scope audit or an audit of specified account balances represent 
the principal business units within each of the Group’s operating segments. These subsidiaries 
account for 99% of the Group’s total assets, 98% of the Group’s total liabilities, 88% of the 
Group’s revenue and 85% of the Group’s expenses.
Significant changes in our approach There have been no significant changes to our audit approach compared to prior year.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the  
Members of TP ICAP plc
Report on the audit of the Financial Statements Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement
Going concern
We have reviewed the Directors’ statement in Note 2(d) to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and Company’s 
ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the 
Financial Statements.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to 
that statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is materially inconsistent 
with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing  
material to add or draw attention  
to in respect of these matters.
Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the Directors’ statements and considering whether they were consistent  
with the knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, including the knowledge obtained in  
the evaluation of the Directors’ assessment of the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern, we are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to:
 > the disclosures on pages 38 to 41 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being 
managed or mitigated;
 > the Directors’ confirmation on page 38 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity; or
 > the Directors’ explanation on page 35 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group,  
over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and  
their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We are also required to report whether the Directors’ statement relating to the prospects of the Group 
required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing  
material to add or draw attention  
to in respect of these matters.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial Statements of the 
current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These 
matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts 
of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Name Passing revenue 
Refer to the summary of significant accounting policies on page 110 and the business model on page 5.
Key audit matter description Name Passing revenue is earned for the service of matching buyers and sellers of financial instruments. 
The Group is not a counterparty to the trade and commissions that are invoiced for the service 
provided by the Group. It accounts for a majority of the Group’s broking revenue.
As invoices for services provided are not issued until the end of each month, the cash collection 
period is typically longer than for Matched Principal revenue. The risk of misstatement of revenue 
increases due to potential fraud or error where the invoice becomes past due or where post 
year-end trade adjustments or credit notes arise.
How the scope of our audit responded  
to the key audit matter
We assessed the design and implementation of relevant controls relating to Name Passing 
invoicing and cash collection.
We confirmed a sample of trades to cash received throughout the year. We agreed a further 
sample of Name Passing transactions, which were outstanding at year-end, to cash received  
post year-end. We tested the aged debtor analysis through re-performance and, focusing  
on higher risk aged items, we confirmed that revenue recognised on each transaction was 
supportable by obtaining evidence to corroborate the validity of the underlying trade and 
reviewing communications with counterparties.
We tested a sample of post year-end trade adjustments and credit notes to evaluate whether 
these items were accurate and valid. 
We assessed the recognition of Name Passing revenue to ensure it was in line with the Group’s 
accounting policy.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the  
Members of TP ICAP plc continued
Report on the audit of the Financial Statements  Key observations Our testing of the effectiveness of internal controls over Name Passing invoicing and cash 
collection identified no issues.
During 2017 the Group continued to implement improvements in controls over trade 
amendments. As the improved controls were not in place throughout the year and did not 
operate for all broking desks, we performed additional substantive testing of trade amendments. 
No issues were identified from this testing.
No issues were identified through our detailed testing of cash receipts and aged debtors.
We determined the recognition of Name Passing revenue to be appropriate and in line with the 
Group’s accounting policy on page 110.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 
Refer to the summary of significant accounting policies on page 110, accounting estimates and judgements on page 116, the intangible assets 
arising on consolidation Note on page 124 and the other intangible assets Note on page 125.
Key audit matter description As required by IAS 36, goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at  
least annually. Determining whether the goodwill of £1,052m, other intangible assets arising  
on consolidation of £590m and other intangible assets of £69m are impaired requires an 
estimation of the recoverable amount of the Group’s cash generating units (‘CGUs’), using the 
higher of the value in use or fair value less costs to sell.
The fair value less costs to sell approach was used to assess the recoverable amount of all CGUs.
Both an income and market approach were used to estimate the fair value less costs to sell 
valuation. The income approach discounts expected future cash flows and requires the selection 
of suitable discount rates and forecast future growth rates and is therefore inherently subjective. 
The market approach uses a price-earnings multiple which is judgemental. The fair value less costs 
to sell of each CGU is sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions. 
No impairment was recorded in the year for any of the CGUs.
How the scope of our audit responded  
to the key audit matter
We performed detailed analysis and challenge of the Group’s assumptions used in the annual 
impairment review, in particular forecast future growth rates, the cash flow projections, discount 
rates and price-earnings multiples used by the Group in its impairment tests of the CGUs. We 
challenged cash flow forecasts and growth rates by evaluating recent performance, trend 
analysis and comparing growth rates to those achieved historically and to external market  
data where available. Our internal valuations specialists independently derived discount rates 
which we compared to the rates used by the Group and we benchmarked discount rates and 
price-earnings multiples to available external peer group data.
As the impairment test using the income approach for the Asia Pacific CGU was sensitive to 
changes in the growth rate assumption and the Americas CGUs was sensitive to changes in  
the growth rate and discount rate assumptions, we assessed the point at which an impairment 
would occur and considered whether this was a reasonably possible change which required 
additional disclosure in the Financial Statements.
Key observations We concluded that the Directors’ impairment test was appropriate and that no impairment of 
goodwill and other intangibles has arisen. 
The cash flow forecasts used in the annual impairment review were consistent with the most 
recent financial budgets considered by the Board and were reasonable in the context of recent 
business performance.
The discount rates and price-earnings multiples used by the Group are within a reasonable  
range of rates implied by both our internally derived discount rates and peer benchmarks. 
The growth rates used by management are reasonable.
The Financial Statements disclose that, when using an income approach to estimate fair value 
less costs to sell, a reasonably possible change in the growth rate assumptions for the Asia Pacific 
CGU and the growth rate and discount rate assumption for the Americas CGU would result in  
the carrying value of these CGUs exceeding their recoverable amount. We consider that such 
disclosure is appropriate.

97 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements Finalisation of the provisional accounting for the ICAP acquisition
Refer to the summary of significant accounting policies on page 110, accounting estimates and judgements on page 116 and the acquisitions  
Note on page 142.
Key audit matter description The Group had a period of up to 12 months to finalise the accounting for the acquisition of ICAP 
in accordance with IFRS 3. The accounting has now been finalised and resulted in a restatement 
of the prior year balance sheet to recognise an increase of £19m in the fair value of assets 
acquired, an increase of £18m in the fair value of liabilities acquired and a net reduction in 
intangible assets arising on consolidation of £1m. 
As set out in Note 30, the increase in the fair value of assets acquired includes £3m in respect of the 
valuation of software and £18m for associates and joint ventures. The increase in the fair value of 
liabilities includes £13m for employee related provisions not previously recognised. The amounts 
are subject to estimation risk and there is a risk that the fair value adjustments are not complete.
The Directors engaged external specialists to support their assessment of the valuation of 
software and associates and joint ventures. 
How the scope of our audit responded  
to the key audit matter
We assessed the design and implementation of relevant controls relating to the finalisation of 
the provisional accounting for the ICAP acquisition. We audited the Group’s finalisation of the 
accounting for the ICAP acquisition, specifically focusing on the valuation and completeness of 
fair value adjustments. Our audit procedures included:
 > assessing the objectivity and expertise of the Group’s external specialist, meeting with 
them to discuss their approach and the findings within their final report;
 > engaging our own valuation specialists to challenge the methodology and assumptions 
used in the valuation of software and associates and joint ventures through comparison to 
industry practice;
 > re-performing the calculation of employee related provisions in accordance with the relevant 
recognition criteria and reconciling a sample of underlying inputs to internal records and 
third party evidence; and
 > testing the completeness and accuracy of information used in determining fair value adjustments.
We have challenged whether further fair value adjustments are required to the assets and 
liabilities of ICAP by reference to the requirements of IFRS and our understanding of the ICAP 
balance sheet based on the known facts and circumstances.
Key observations We considered the adjustments to the valuation of the software, associates and joint ventures 
and provisions to be appropriate.
No further material fair value adjustments were identified through our testing.
Presentation and disclosure of CIP and integration related items 
Refer to the basis of preparation Note 2(c) on page 108 and Note 6 on page 119.
Key audit matter description The Group reports ‘exceptional items’ of £34m before taxation and ‘acquisition, disposal and 
integration related items’ of £127m before taxation of which £79m related to integration. 
Substantially all exceptional items are those related to the 2017 CIP.
There is a risk that items that reflect the underlying performance of the Group are incorrectly 
presented as CIP and integration related items. In addition, there is a risk that undue prominence 
is given to underlying results compared to the statutory results of the Group in the Annual Report.
How the scope of our audit responded  
to the key audit matter
We assessed the design and implementation of relevant controls relating to the classification of 
items as CIP and integration related. 
For a sample of items we obtained supporting evidence to confirm whether the items related 
to CIP or integration or should be presented as part of the Group’s underlying results.
We read the Annual Report and challenged the prominence given to underlying results relative to 
the Group’s statutory results and whether the presentation was misleading. We read the description 
of the basis of underlying results and whether it was consistently applied. We also tested the 
completeness and accuracy of the reconciliation between underlying and statutory results.
Key observations We identified no items within CIP and integration related items that should be presented in 
underlying results.
We considered that the presentation of the Group’s underlying results is appropriately explained, 
is understandable and that the reconciliation to the Group’s statutory results is complete and 
accurate. We considered that appropriate prominence has been given to the statutory results.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the  
Members of TP ICAP plc continued
Report on the audit of the Financial Statements Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the Financial Statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the Financial Statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality £9.6m (2016: £8.0m)
Basis for determining materiality and  
rationale for the benchmark applied
Last year, due to the timing of the ICAP acquisition, we determined materiality by considering 
both normalised underlying profit before tax and normalised net assets to reflect the enlarged 
size and scale of the combined balance sheet but there being no impact on profit. 
In 2017 we have reverted to using a purely profit based measure as a basis for determining 
materiality as we considered this to be the most appropriate. Profit is a key performance 
indicator of the Group and a key metric used by investors and analysts.
For the 2017 Group Financial Statements, we have determined our materiality to be £9.6m on the 
basis of 5% of normalised¹ underlying profit before tax which equates to less than 1% of total equity. 
Parent Company materiality £4.8m (2016: £2.8m)
Basis for determining materiality and  
rationale for the benchmark applied
For the 2017 Parent Company Financial Statements, we have determined our materiality to be 
£4.8m on the basis of 50% of Group materiality because the Parent Company is in scope for our 
Group audit. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.5m (2016: £0.4m), as well 
as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on 
disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the Financial Statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit scope focused primarily on eight locations (2016: seven locations) with 30 subsidiaries (2016: 27 subsidiaries) subject to a 
full scope audit. The increase in the number of subsidiaries from the prior year reflects the increased number of entities in the Group and 
their relative contribution to revenue and profit; there are 15 legacy Tullett Prebon entities in scope for the Group audit and 15 ICAP entities.
The subsidiaries selected for a full scope audit or specified audit procedures represent the principal business units within each of the Group’s 
operating segments. These subsidiaries account for 99% (2016: 96%) of the Group’s total assets, 98% (2016: 95%) of the Group’s total liabilities, 
88% (2016: 93%) of the Group’s revenue and 85% (2016: 94%) of the Group’s expenses. The subsidiaries were selected to provide an appropriate 
basis of undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement including those identified above. Our audits of each of the subsidiaries 
were performed using lower levels of materiality based on their size relative to the Group. The materiality for each subsidiary audit ranged from 
£4.8m to £5.3m (2016: £2.8m to £4.4m).

1 We have determined normalised underlying profit before tax of £193m as underlying profit before tax of £233m less amortisation of intangible assets arising on consolidation 
of £40m. Amortisation of intangibles arising on consolidation is a recurring cost and therefore reflects ongoing business performance.

99 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements We tested the Group’s consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm that there were no significant risks of material 
misstatement in the aggregated financial information of the remaining subsidiaries not subject to a full scope audit or specified audit procedures. 
We also performed high level analytical review procedures in respect of those entities not included in the scope of our audit to identify any 
fluctuations or relationships that are inconsistent with other relevant information and obtained adequate explanations.
The Senior Statutory Auditor has responsibility for overseeing all aspects of the audit work of the component auditors. In discharging this responsibility, 
he visited the US and Singapore during the audit to meet local management and to oversee the audits of the subsidiaries based in the Americas 
and Asia. The Group audit team performed a remote file review of the work performed by three other component auditors. The Group audit team 
maintained a dialogue with all component auditors throughout all phases of the audit and received written reports from component auditors setting 
out the results of their audit procedures.
Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the 
Annual Report including the Strategic report and the Governance report, other than the Financial Statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly 
stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained 
in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether 
there is a material misstatement in the Financial Statements or a material misstatement of the other information.  
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information,  
we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material misstatements of the other 
information include where we conclude that:
 > Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the Directors that they consider the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s position, performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit; or
 > Audit Committee reporting – the section describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee; or
 > Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the Directors’ statement 
required under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly 
disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to 
report in respect of 
these matters.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Financial Statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Financial Statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors 
either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
106 Financial statements 1. General information 
TP ICAP plc (formerly T ullett Prebon plc) is a company incorporated in 
England and Wales under the Companies Act. The address of the 
registered office is given on page 158. The nature of the Group’s 
operations and its principal activities are set out in the Directors’ 
Report on pages 90 to 93 and in the Strategic report on pages 1 to 47 .
2. Basis of preparation
(a) Basis of accounting
The Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRSs’) adopted by the European Union and comply with Article 4  
of the EU IAS Regulation.
The Financial Statements are presented in Pounds sterling because 
that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
the Group operates and are rounded to the nearest million pounds 
(expressed as £m), except where otherwise indicated. The significant 
accounting policies are set out in Note 3.
The Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical  
cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments 
held at fair values at the end of each reporting period, as explained in 
the accounting policies. Historical cost is generally based on the fair 
value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid 
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that 
price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation 
technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the 
Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability  
if market participants would take those characteristics into account 
when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. 
Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these 
Consolidated Financial Statements is determined on such a basis, 
except for share-based payment transactions that are within the 
scope of IFRS 2, leasing transactions that are within the scope of 
IAS 17, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value 
but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in IAS 2 or value 
in use in IAS 36.
For financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are 
categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which inputs 
to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance 
of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are 
described as follows:
 > Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets  
for identical assets or liabilities;
 > Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included 
within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
 > Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
(b) Basis of consolidation
The Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the 
Financial Statements of the Company and entities controlled by  
the Company made up to 31 December each year. Under IFRS 10 
‘Consolidated Financial Statements’, control is achieved where the 
Company exercises power over an entity, is exposed to, or has rights 
to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the 
ability to use its power to affect the returns from the entity.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the  
year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from 
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of 
disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made 
to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting 
policies used into line with those used by the Group. All inter-
company transactions, balances, income and expenses are 
eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately 
from the Group’s equity therein. Those interests of non-controlling 
shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their 
holders to a proportionate share of net assets upon liquidation  
may initially be measured at fair value or at the non-controlling 
interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets. Other non-controlling interests are initially 
measured at fair value. The choice of measurement is made on 
an acquisition by acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the 
carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those 
interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ 
share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income 
is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the 
non-controlling interest having a deficit balance. 
Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a 
loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying 
amount of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests  
are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the 
subsidiaries. Any differences between the amount by which the 
non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the 
consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity  
and attributed to the owners of the Company.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on 
disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate 
of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of 
any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the 
assets, including goodwill, less liabilities of the subsidiary and any 
non-controlling interests. Amounts previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are accounted  
for in the same manner as would be required if the relevant assets or 
liabilities are disposed of. The fair value of any investment retained  
in the former subsidiary at the date when control was lost is regarded 
as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting 
under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ 
or, when applicable, the cost on initial recognition of an investment 
in an associate or jointly controlled entity.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 December 2017 2. Basis of preparation continued
(c) Presentation of the Income Statement 
The Group maintains a columnar format for the presentation of its 
Consolidated Income Statement. The columnar format enables the 
Group to continue its practice of aiding the understanding of its 
results by presenting its underlying profit. This is the profit measure 
used to calculate underlying EPS (Note 11) and is considered to be  
the most appropriate as it better reflects the Group’s underlying 
earnings. Underlying profit is reconciled to profit before tax on the 
face of the Consolidated Income Statement, which also includes 
acquisition, disposal and integration costs and exceptional items.
The column ‘acquisition, disposal and integration costs’ includes: any 
gains, losses or other associated costs on the full or partial disposal  
of investments, associates, joint ventures or subsidiaries and costs 
associated with a business combination that do not constitute  
fees relating to the arrangement of financing; amortisation of 
intangible assets arising on consolidation; any remeasurement 
after initial recognition of contingent consideration which has been 
classified as a liability; and any gains or losses on the revaluation of 
previous interests. The column may also include items such as gains or 
losses on the settlement of pre-existing relationships with acquired 
businesses and the remeasurement of liabilities that are above the 
value of indemnification. Acquisition related integration costs include 
costs associated with exit or disposal activities, which do not meet the 
criteria of discontinued operations, including costs for employee and 
lease terminations, or other exit activities. Additionally, these costs 
include expenses directly related to integrating and reorganising 
acquired businesses and include items such as employee retention 
costs, recruiting costs, certain moving costs, certain duplicative costs 
during integration and asset impairments.
Items which are of a non-routine nature and material, when 
considering both size and nature, are disclosed separately to  
give a clearer presentation of the Group’s results. These are  
shown as ‘exceptional items’ on the face of the Consolidated  
Income Statement.
(d) Going concern 
The Directors have, at the time of approving the Financial 
Statements, a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the Financial Statements. Further detail is 
contained in the going concern section and viability statement 
included in the Strategic report on page 35.
(e) Adoption of new and revised Standards
The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations 
have been adopted in the current year although their adoption 
has not had any significant impact on the Financial Statements:
 > Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2014-2016 Cycle, relating to 
improvements effective from 1 January 2017);
 > Amendments to IAS 7 ‘Cash flow statements’ regarding 
disclosures; and
 > Amendments to IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ regarding the recognition 
of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses.
At the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, the 
following EU endorsed Standards and Interpretations were in issue 
but not yet effective. The Group has not applied these Standards  
or Interpretations in the preparation of these Financial Statements:
 > IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’
The Group will apply IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018. The Group has 
elected not to restate comparatives on initial application of IFRS 9. 
The full impact of adopting IFRS 9 on the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements will depend on the financial instruments that 
the Group has during 2018 as well as on economic conditions and 
judgements made as at the year end. The Group has performed a 
preliminary assessment of potential impact of adopting IFRS 9 
based on the financial instruments as at 31 December 2017 . 
The Group had no hedging relationships as at this date.
Classification and measurement
With respect to the classification and measurement of financial 
assets, the number of categories of financial assets under IFRS 9 has 
been reduced compared to lAS 39. Under IFRS 9 the classification of 
financial assets is based both on the business model within which 
the asset is held and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the 
asset. There are three principal classification categories for financial 
assets that are debt instruments: (i) amortised cost, (ii) fair value 
through other comprehensive income (‘FVTOCI’) and (iii) fair value 
through profit or loss (‘FVTPL ’). Equity investments in scope of IFRS 9 
are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognised in profit 
or loss unless an irrevocable election is made to recognise gains or 
losses in other comprehensive income. Under IFRS 9, derivatives 
embedded in financial assets are not bifurcated but instead the 
whole hybrid contract is assessed for classification.
Under IFRS 9, financial assets can be designated as at FVTPL to 
mitigate an accounting mismatch.
In respect to classification and measurement of financial liabilities, 
changes in the fair value of a financial liability designated as at 
FVTPL due to credit risk are presented in other comprehensive 
income unless such presentation would create or enlarge an 
accounting mismatch in profit or loss.

TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
108 Financial statements 2. Basis of preparation continued
(e) Adoption of new and revised Standards continued
Based on the Group’s preliminary assessment there will be no 
impact on the classification and measurement of the Group’s 
financial assets, except for assets that were classified as available-
for-sale under lAS 39 which, at the date of initial application of IFRS 
9, the Group has elected to apply the FVTOCI option. 
There will be no change in the accounting for financial liabilities.
Impairment
The impairment model under IFRS 9 reflects expected credit losses, 
as opposed to only incurred credit losses under IAS 39. Under the 
impairment approach it is not necessary for a credit event to have 
occurred before credit losses are recognised. Instead, an entity 
always accounts for expected credit losses and changes in those 
expected credit losses. The amount of expected credit losses are 
updated at each reporting date.
The new impairment model will apply to the Group’s financial assets 
that are debt instruments measured at amortised costs or FVTOCI.
The Group expects to apply the simplified approach to recognise 
lifetime expected credit losses for its trade receivables and 
settlement balances, as required or permitted by IFRS 9. 
With regards to financial assets, and cash and cash equivalents, 
the Group has determined that they have low credit risk as at 31 
December 2017 . The Group intends to apply the low credit risk 
simplification in IFRS 9 which allows the Group to assume that 
there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial 
recognition of these assets and therefore recognise a loss allowance 
for only 12-month expected credit losses as at 31 December 2017.
The application of the impairment requirements of IFRS 9 will not have 
a material impact on the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
Hedge accounting
Until the Group applies hedge accounting it does not anticipate that 
the application of the IFRS 9 hedge accounting requirements will have 
a material impact on the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
 > IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’
IFRS 15 establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in 
accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. IFRS 15 
will supersede the current revenue recognition guidance including 
lAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and related Interpretations. The Group is required to 
adopt IFRS 15 for the year ending 31 December 2018 and will adopt the 
modified retrospective approach without restatement of comparatives.
The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity should recognise 
revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to 
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the 
entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. 
Specifically, the Standard introduces a five step approach to revenue 
recognition:
 > Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer
 > Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract
 > Step 3: Determine the transaction price
 > Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance 
obligations in the contract
 > Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a 
performance obligation
Under IFRS 15, an entity recognises revenue as and when ‘control’ of 
the goods or services underlying a particular performance obligation 
is transferred to the customer. The Standard introduces prescriptive 
guidance and additional disclosure requirements.
The application of IFRS 15 will not significantly impact the amount 
or timing of the revenue recognised by the Group. Name Passing 
and Executing Brokerage will continue to be recognised at trade 
date. Revenue from the provision of Data & Analytics will continue 
to be recognised over the duration of the contract for the provision 
of those services.
 > IFRS 16 ‘Leases’
IFRS 16 introduces comprehensive changes to the identification 
and accounting for leases. The Group currently expects to adopt 
the Standard for the year ending 31 December 2019. 
IFRS 16 distinguishes leases and service contracts on the basis of 
whether an asset is controlled by the customer. The distinction 
between operating leases and finance leases is removed. Instead, 
all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets, 
are recorded as a right -of-use asset with a corresponding liability.
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently 
adjusted, subject to certain exceptions, for accumulated depreciation, 
impairment losses, and any remeasurement of the associated lease 
liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value 
of future lease payments and subsequently adjusted for interest, 
lease payments, and the impact of any lease modifications. 
Lease cash flows, currently presented as operating cash flows, will be 
split into payments of principal and interest and will be presented as 
financing and operating cash flows respectively.

109 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements 2. Basis of preparation continued
(e) Adoption of new and revised Standards continued
As at 31 December 2017, the Group has non-cancellable operating 
lease commitments of £244m (Note 34). A preliminary assessment of 
these arrangements indicates that they meet the IFRS 16 definition of 
a lease and the Group would be required to apply the requirements 
of the Standard. Recognising right-of-use assets and related lease 
liabilities is expected to have a significant impact on the amounts 
recognised in the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The 
Directors are currently assessing the potential impact together with 
impact of the transitional options in IFRS 16. It is not practicable to 
provide a reasonable estimate of the financial effect until the 
Directors complete the review. 
Other changes in Standards and Interpretations:
 > Amendments to IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payment transactions’ 
regarding the classification and measurement of share-based 
payment transactions; and
 > Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2014-2016 Cycle, relating to 
improvements effective from 1 January 2018).
The following Standards and Interpretations have not been endorsed 
by the EU and have not been applied in the preparation of these 
Financial Statements:
 > Amendments to IAS 19: Plan Amendment, Curtailment 
or Settlement; 
 > Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2015-2017 Cycle);
 > Amendments to IAS 28: Long-term Interests in Associates and 
Joint Ventures;
 > Amendments to IFRS 9: Prepayment Features with Negative 
Compensation;
 > Amendments to IAS 40: Transfers of Investment Property;
 > IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments;
 > IFRIC Interpretation 22 relating to foreign currency 
transactions and advance consideration; and
 > IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts.
Other than where stated, the Directors do not expect the adoption 
of the above Standards and Interpretations will have a material 
impact on the Financial Statements of the Group in future periods.
3. Summary of significant accounting policies
(a) Income recognition
Revenue, which excludes sales taxes, includes brokerage including 
commissions, fees earned and subscriptions for information sales.  
Fee income is recognised when the related services are completed 
and the income is considered receivable. 
Revenue comprises:
(i) Name Passing brokerage, where counterparties to a transaction 
settle directly with each other. Revenue for the service of 
matching buyers and sellers of financial instruments is stated 
net of sales taxes, rebates and discounts and is recognised in 
full on trade date; 
(ii) Matched Principal brokerage revenue, being the net proceeds 
from a commitment to simultaneously buy and sell financial 
instruments with counterparties, is recognised on trade date;
(iii) Executing Broker brokerage, where the Group executes 
transactions on certain regulated exchanges and then ‘gives-up’ 
the trade to the relevant client, or its clearing member. Revenue 
for the service of matching buyers and sellers of financial 
instruments is stated net of sales taxes, rebates and discounts 
and is recognised in full on trade date; and
(iv) Fees earned from the sales of price information from financial 
and commodity markets to third parties is recognised on an 
accruals basis to match the provision of the service.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to 
the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate 
applicable. Dividend income from investments is recognised 
when the Group’s right to receive the payment is established.
(b) Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using 
the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition 
is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of 
exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and 
equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control  
of the acquiree. Acquisition costs are recognised in profit or loss  
as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes  
any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement, measured at its acquisition date fair value. Subsequent 
changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of the 
acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. 
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition  
to the date the Group obtains complete information about the facts 
and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is 
subject to a maximum of one year. All subsequent changes in the fair 
value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or a liability 
are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs. Changes in  
the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are  
not recognised.

TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
110 Financial statements 3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
(b) Business combinations continued
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s 
previously held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to  
fair value at the acquisition date and any resulting gain or loss  
is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in  
the acquiree prior to the acquisition that have previously been 
recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit 
or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest 
was disposed of.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (2008) are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:
 > deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised and measured  
in accordance with IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’;
 > liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements  
are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 19 
‘Employee Benefits’;
 > acquiree share-based payment awards replaced by Group 
awards are measured in accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share-based 
Payments’; and
 > assets or disposal groups that are classified for sale are measured 
in accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations’.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by 
the end of the reporting period in which the business combination 
occurs, provisional amounts are reported. Those provisional amounts 
are adjusted during the measurement period, or additional assets  
or liabilities recognised, to reflect the facts and circumstances that 
existed as at the acquisition date.
Non-controlling interests in the acquired entity are initially 
measured at the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the net fair 
value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
(c) Investment in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to 
exercise significant influence. Significant influence is the power 
to participate in the financial and operating decisions of the 
investee but is not control or joint control over these policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated 
in these Financial Statements based on financial information 
made up to 31 December each year using the equity method of 
accounting, except when classified as held for sale. Investments  
in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted  
by post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets  
of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual 
investments. Losses of the associates in excess of the Group’s 
interest in those associates are recognised only to the extent that 
the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made 
payments on behalf of the associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the  
fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date 
of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. Any discount in the cost  
of acquisition below the Group’s share of the fair value of the 
identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition  
(i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to profit and loss in the  
year of acquisition.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, 
profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s 
interest in the relevant associate. Losses may provide evidence 
of impairment of the asset transferred in which case appropriate 
provision is made for impairment.
(d) Interests in joint arrangements
A joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement whereby the 
Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that  
is subject to joint control.
Joint ventures are joint arrangements which involve the 
establishment of a separate entity in which each party has rights 
to the net assets of the arrangement. The Group reports its 
interests in joint ventures using the equity method of accounting, 
based on financial information made up to 31 December each year. 
Investments in joint ventures are carried in the balance sheet at 
cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share 
of the net assets of the joint venture, less any impairment in the 
value of individual investments. Losses of the joint venture in 
excess of the Group’s interest in those joint ventures are recognised 
only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive 
obligations or made payments under the terms of the joint venture.
(e) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the  
cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of  
the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of  
a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is 
initially recognised at cost and is subsequently measured at cost 
less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill arising on 
acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been  
retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts at that date.
Goodwill recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at  
least annually. Any impairment loss is recognised as an expense 
immediately and is not subsequently reversed. For the purpose of 
impairment testing goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s 
cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of  
the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been 
allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently 
when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than 
the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit, the 
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount  
of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets  
of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each  
asset in the unit.

111 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements 3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
(e) Goodwill continued
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associate or joint venture 
is included within the carrying value of the associate or the joint 
venture. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is 
presented separately in the balance sheet. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture, the 
attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination 
of the profit or loss on disposal. 
(f) Intangible assets
Software and software development costs
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s 
software development is recognised at cost only if all of the following 
conditions are met:
 > an asset is created that can be identified; 
 > it is probable that the asset created will generate future 
economic benefits; and
 > the development costs of the asset can be measured reliably.
Where the above conditions are not met, costs are expensed  
as incurred. 
Acquired separately or from a business combination 
Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and 
intangible assets acquired in a business acquisition are capitalised  
at fair value at the date of acquisition. The useful lives of these 
intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. 
Amortisation charged on assets with a finite useful life is taken  
to the income statement through administrative expenses.
Other than software development costs, intangible assets created 
within the business are not capitalised and expenditure is charged to 
the income statement in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.
Intangible assets are amortised over their finite useful lives generally 
on a straight-line basis, as follows:
Software:
Purchased or developed – up to 5 years
Software licences –  over the period of the licence
Acquisition intangibles:
Brand/Trademarks – up to 5 years
Customer relationships – 2 to 20 years
Other intangibles –  over the period of the contract
Intangible assets are subject to impairment review if there are events 
or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are 
measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the income 
statement when the asset is derecognised.
(g) Property, plant and equipment
Freehold land is stated at cost. Buildings, furniture, fixtures, 
equipment and motor vehicles are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates 
calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value 
based on prices prevailing at the date of acquisition, of each 
asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life as follows:
Furniture, fixtures, equipment 
and motor vehicles – 3 to 10 years
Short and long leasehold  
land and buildings – period of the lease
Freehold land – infinite
Freehold buildings – 50 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected 
useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the 
term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is 
determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
(h) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets  
excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts 
of its tangible and intangible assets with finite lives to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an 
impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount 
of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss. Where the asset does not generate cash flows  
that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset 
belongs. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for 
impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the 
asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less any cost to sell 
and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present values using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value  
of money and the risks specific to the asset.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is 
estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount  
of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable 
amount. Impairment losses are recognised as an expense 
immediately. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased  
to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the 
increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined had no impairment loss been 
recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years.  
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income 
immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued 
amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is 
treated as a revaluation increase.

for the year ended 31 December 2017
TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
112 Financial statements 3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
(i) Broker contract payments
Payments made to brokers under employment contracts which are  
in advance of the expected economic benefit due to the Group are 
accounted for as prepayments and included within trade and other 
receivables. Payments made in advance are subject to repayment 
conditions during the contract period and the prepayment is 
amortised over the shorter of the contract term and the period  
the payment remains recoverable. Amounts that are irrecoverable,  
or become irrecoverable, are written off immediately.
Payments made in arrears are accrued and are included within trade 
and other payables.
(j) Financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the 
Group’s balance sheet when the Group has become a party  
to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Financial instruments are derecognised when all derecognition 
criteria of IAS 39 are met and the Group no longer controls the 
contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument. This is 
normally the case when the instrument is sold, or all of the cash 
flows attributable to the instrument are passed through to an 
independent third party.
Financial assets are classified on initial recognition as ‘available-for-
sale’, ‘loans and receivables’ or ‘at fair value through profit or loss’ 
(‘FVTPL ’). Financial liabilities are classified on initial recognition 
as either ‘at fair value through profit or loss’ (‘FVTPL ’) or as ‘other 
financial liabilities’.
Available-for-sale 
Certain of the Group’s investments are classified as available-for-sale 
financial assets. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured 
at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses and 
foreign exchange gains and losses on available-for-sale monetary 
items, are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.  
For equity financial assets, where the fair value cannot be reliably 
measured, the assets are held at cost less any provision for 
impairment. These assets are generally expected to be held for 
the long term and are included in non-current assets. Assets such 
as holdings in exchanges, cash related instruments and long 
term equity investments that do not qualify as associates or joint 
ventures are classified as available-for-sale. When an investment is 
derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in other comprehensive 
income is transferred to profit or loss.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial instruments that 
have fixed or determinable payments that are not listed in an active 
market. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method, less any impairment. Interest income  
is recognised using the effective interest rate, except for short term 
receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial. 
Settlement balances, trade receivables, loans and other receivables 
are classified as ‘loans and receivables’.
The Group acts as an intermediary between its customers for 
collateralised stock lending transactions. Such trades are complete 
only when both the collateral and stock for each side of the 
transaction are returned. The gross amounts of collateral due to 
and receivable are disclosed in the balance sheet as deposits paid 
for securities borrowed and deposits received for securities loaned.
Fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets and liabilities can be designated at fair value 
through profit or loss where they meet specific criteria set out in 
IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ or 
where assets or liabilities are held for trading. Subsequent changes 
in fair value are recognised directly in the income statement.
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially 
measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
Financial assets, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, 
are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet 
date. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence 
that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial 
recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of 
the investment have been impacted. Impairment is recognised in the 
income statement.
(k) Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency contracts 
and interest rate swaps, are entered into by the Group in order  
to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency 
fluctuations or as simultaneous back-to-back transactions with 
counterparties. The Group does not use derivative financial 
instruments for speculative purposes. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a 
derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured 
to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or 
loss is recognised immediately unless the derivative is designated 
and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing  
of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the  
hedge relationship. 
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current 
liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than  
12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within  
12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or 
current liabilities.
www.tpicap.com
113 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements 3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
(l) Hedge accounting
Derivatives designated as hedges are either ‘fair value hedges’  
or ‘hedges of net investments in foreign operations’.
Fair value hedges 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated  
and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in profit or loss 
immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the 
hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk. The changes  
in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the changes in  
the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised  
in the line of the income statement relating to the hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the 
hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
The adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising 
from the hedged risk is amortised to profit or loss from that date.
Net investment hedges 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that 
are designated and qualify as net investment hedges is recognised in 
the hedging and translation reserve in other comprehensive income. 
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss, and is included in financial income  
or financial expense respectively.
Gains and losses deferred in the hedging and translation reserve  
are recognised in profit or loss on disposal of the foreign operation.
(m) Settlement balances
Certain Group companies engage in Matched Principal brokerage 
whereby securities are bought from one counterparty and 
simultaneously sold to another counterparty. Settlement of such 
transactions are primarily on a delivery vs payment basis (‘DVP’) and 
typically take place within a few business days of the transaction date 
according to the relevant market rules and conventions. The amounts 
due from and payable to counterparties in respect of as yet unsettled 
Matched Principal transactions are shown gross, except where a 
netting agreement, which is legally enforceable at all times, exists 
and the asset and liability are either settled net or simultaneously.
(n) Derivative financial instrument balances arising from 
business activities
The Group undertakes Matched Principal broking involving 
simultaneous back-to-back derivative transactions with 
counterparties. These transactions are classified as financial 
instruments at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL ’) and are 
shown gross, except where a netting agreement, which is legally 
enforceable at all times, exists and the asset and liability are either 
settled net or simultaneously.
(o) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits which may be 
accessed without penalty. Cash equivalents comprise short term 
highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months 
from the date of acquisition. For the purposes of the Consolidated 
Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash  
and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding  
bank overdrafts.
The Group holds money, and occasionally financial instruments,  
on behalf of customers (client monies) in accordance with local 
regulatory rules. Since the Group is not beneficially entitled to these 
amounts, they are excluded from the Consolidated Balance Sheet 
along with the corresponding liabilities to customers.
Restricted funds comprise cash held with a central counterparty 
clearing house (‘CCP’), or a financial institution providing the Group 
with access to a CCP, and funds set aside for regulatory purposes, but 
excluding client money. The funds represent cash for which the Group 
does not have immediate and direct access or for which regulatory 
requirements restrict the use of the cash.
(p) Interest bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value,  
being the consideration received net of issue costs associated  
with the borrowing.
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. 
Amortised cost is calculated taking into account any issue costs 
and any discounts or premium on settlement. Gains and losses 
are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are 
derecognised, as well as through the amortisation process.
(q) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation, 
legal or constructive, as a result of a past event where it is probable 
that this will result in an outflow of economic benefits that can be 
reliably estimated.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has 
a detailed formal plan for the restructuring, which has been notified 
to affected parties.
(r) Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company are 
prepared in the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which it operates, its functional currency. For the purpose of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, the results and financial position 
of each Group company are expressed in Pounds sterling, which is 
the functional currency of the Company and the presentation 
currency for the Consolidated Financial Statements.

TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
114 Financial statements 3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
(r) Foreign currencies continued
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, 
transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are 
recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the 
transactions. Gains and losses arising from the settlement of these 
transactions, and from the retranslation of monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional 
currency at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date, are recognised 
in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
that are measured at historical cost or fair value are translated  
at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction or at the date  
the fair value was determined.
For the purpose of presenting Consolidated Financial Statements, 
the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are 
translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. 
Exchange differences arising are classified as other comprehensive 
income and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such 
translation differences are recognised as income or as expense in  
the year in which the operation is disposed of. Income and expense 
items are translated at average exchange rates for the year, unless 
exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that year, in which case 
the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
(s) Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of current tax payable arising in 
the year, movements in deferred tax and movements in tax provisions. 
The tax expense includes any interest and penalties payable.
The current tax payable arising in the year is based on taxable profit 
for the year using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax 
payable in respect of prior years.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method in respect of temporary differences arising between  
the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the Financial 
Statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the 
computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets 
are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits 
will be available against which deductible temporary differences 
may be utilised. Temporary differences are not recognised if they 
arise from goodwill or from initial recognition of other assets and 
liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the tax profit nor 
the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, 
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the 
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates that are expected to apply 
when the asset or liability is settled or when the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement,  
except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to 
other comprehensive income or equity, in which case the deferred 
tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or equity.
(t) Leases
Assets held under finance leases, which transfer to the Group 
substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of 
the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the 
fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of 
the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned 
between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability  
so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance 
of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income. 
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the 
estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and  
benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. 
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
(u) Retirement benefit costs
Defined contributions made to employees’ personal pension  
plans are charged to the income statement as and when incurred. 
For defined benefit retirement plans, the cost of providing the 
benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the year 
in which they occur. They are recognised outside the income 
statement and are presented in other comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the 
benefits have already vested, and is otherwise amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the average period until the amended 
benefits become vested.
The amount recognised in the balance sheet represents the net of  
the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for 
actuarial gains and losses and past service cost, and the fair value of 
plan assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the 
unrecognised actuarial losses and past service cost, plus the present 
value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to 
the plan.
(v) Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain 
employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured 
at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the 
grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The fair value of share options issued is determined using 
appropriate valuation models. The expected life used in the 
models has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate 
for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations.
The estimated fair value of shares granted is based on the share price 
at grant date, reduced where shares do not qualify for dividends 
during the vesting period. Market-based performance conditions  
for equity-settled payments are reflected in the initial fair value  
of the award.
www.tpicap.com
115 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements 3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
(w) Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the value 
of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. An equity instrument  
is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the 
Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
(x) Treasury shares
Where share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount 
of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, net  
of any tax effects, is recognised as a deduction from equity. When 
treasury shares are sold or re-issued subsequently, the amount 
received is recognised as an increase in equity, and the resulting 
surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred to or from  
retained earnings.
(y) Accounting estimates and judgements
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors 
are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not 
readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors 
that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis 
and revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
an estimate is revised. 
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving 
estimations, that the Directors have made in the process of 
preparing the Financial Statements.
Pension bulk annuity
Judgement has been applied regarding the impact of purchasing 
the bulk annuity policy discussed in Note 35. This ‘buy-in’ has been 
accounted for in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 
‘Employee Benefits’. As the actual purchase price of the policy was 
higher than the accounting value of the policy, a reduction in the 
Scheme’s assets was recorded. It was determined that this reduction 
should be included within the Return on Scheme assets and reported 
as part of the Group’s ‘Remeasurement of defined benefit pension 
schemes’ included within the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income.
The following key assumptions concerning the future, and other 
sources of estimation uncertainty that may have a significant risk of 
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
are discussed below.
Retirement benefit asset 
The Group’s retirement benefit asset is the net of its defined benefit 
scheme’s assets and the related defined benefit obligation. The 
defined benefit obligation represents the scheme’s future liabilities, 
which are valued using actuarial and other financial assumptions, 
discounted to a current value using a discount rate set by reference 
to market yields on high quality corporate bonds. The value of the 
defined benefit obligation is sensitive to changes in the actuarial, 
financial and discount rate assumptions, changes to which would be 
reflected in other comprehensive income in the period the change 
occurs. Note 35 describes the assumptions used together with an 
analysis of the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions.
Identification and measurement of intangible assets arising  
on consolidation
Accounting for business combinations requires the excess of the 
purchase price of acquisitions to be allocated to the identifiable 
assets and liabilities of the acquired entity. The Group makes 
estimates to determine the acquisition date fair values of the 
intangible assets that arise on consolidation and to estimate the 
useful lives of these assets. Note 30 provides details of acquisitions 
and related adjustments made during the year. A 5% increase in 
the value of separately identifiable intangibles arising on the 
acquisition of ICAP would have decreased goodwill by £24m.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired 
requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating  
units to which these assets have been allocated. The value in use 
calculation requires estimation of future cash flows expected to arise 
for the cash-generating unit, the selection of suitable discount rates 
and the estimation of future growth rates. Note 13 describes the 
assumptions used together with an analysis of the sensitivity to 
reasonably possible changes in key assumptions.
Provisions and contingent liabilities
Provisions are established by the Group based on management’s 
assessment of relevant information and advice available at  
the time of preparing the Financial Statements. Judgement is 
required as to when contingent liabilities become disclosable and 
when a provision needs to be recognised. Outcomes are uncertain 
and dependent on future events. Where outcomes differ from 
management’s expectations, differences from the amount initially 
provided will impact profit or loss in the period the outcome is 
determined. Estimating potential legal outcomes is a significant 
area of estimation uncertainty. Note 24 and Note 33 provide details 
of the Group’s provisions and contingent liabilities.

The UK corporation tax rate for 2017 is 19.25% reflecting three months at 20% and nine months at 19% (2016: 20%).
The impact of tax rate change is a £24m reduction in the deferred tax liability that was recognised in relation to the intangible assets of 
£636m that arose on acquisition of ICAP, due to the reduction in the US federal rate of tax (Notes 20 and 30(a)).

1 Restated to reflect the finalisation of the acquisition of ICAP (Note 30(a)).
Other intangible assets at 31 December 2017 represent customer relationships, £561m (2016: £607m), business brands and trade marks, 
£21m (2016: £28m), and other intangibles, £8m (2016: £11m) that arise through business combinations. Customer relationships are being 
amortised over 20 years.
Goodwill arising through business combinations is allocated to groups of individual cash-generating units (‘CGUs’), reflecting the lowest level 
at which the Group monitors and tests goodwill for impairment purposes. The CGU groupings are as follows:
2017
£m
CGU
EMEA 644
Americas 284
Asia Pacific 103
Goodwill allocated to CGUs 1,031
Unallocated goodwill 21
1,052
In 2016, goodwill was allocated to the Group’s three regional operating segments, PVM and Brazil. During 2017, the PVM and Brazilian 
operations were integrated into the regional operating segments and the associated goodwill was reallocated to those segments. 
The allocation of goodwill arising on the acquisition of ICAP (Note 30(a)) has been completed during 2017 . This has been allocated to the 
three regional operating segments that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. 
As at 31 December 2017 the provisional amount of goodwill arising on the acquisition of COEX (Note 30(b)) was not allocated to a group 
of CGUs due to the proximity of the acquisition to the year end. As permitted by IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’, allocation to relevant CGUs 
will be completed before the end of 2018. As the goodwill has not been allocated to relevant CGUs it has not been assessed for impairment 
in the current period.
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the recoverable amount of each CGU. The recoverable amount is the 
higher of its value in use (‘VIU’) or its fair value less cost of disposal (‘FVLCD’).
As at 31 December 2017 none of the Group’s CGUs are impaired with the recoverable amount for each CGU having been based on its FVLCD. 
Two FVLCD valuation methods were used, an Income Approach and a Market Approach. Under both valuation approaches each CGU had a 
FVLCD in excess of its carrying value.

TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
124 Financial statements 13. Intangible assets arising on consolidation continued 
The key assumptions for the Income Approach are those regarding expected cash flows arising in future periods, regional growth rates and 
the discount rates. Future projections are based on the most recent financial budgets considered by the Board which are used to project cash 
flows for the next seven years. After this period a steady state cash flow is used to derive a terminal value for the CGU. Annual growth rates 
of 1.5% have been used for all CGUs with discount rates of 11% for EMEA, 12% for Americas and 13.5% for Asia Pacific. The calculations have 
been subject to stress tests reflecting reasonably possible changes in key assumptions. All CGUs are insensitive to reasonably possible changes 
in these assumptions except for Americas and Asia Pacific. Under this approach the recoverable amount for Americas exceeded its carrying 
value by £73m, which reduces to £nil if annual growth rates fall to negative 0.4% over the projected period, or if the discount rate increases 
to 13.8%. The recoverable amount for Asia Pacific exceeded its carrying value by £98m, which reduces to £nil if annual growth rates fall to 
negative 4.8% over the projected period, or if the discount rate increases to 19.8%. The impact on future cash flows resulting from falling 
growth rates does not reflect any management actions that would be taken under such circumstances.
The Market Approach was based upon a price-earnings methodology using projected earnings for each unit. Approximate price earnings 
multiples, validated against independent analyst information were applied to each CGU. The multiples used for both 2018 and 2019 were 
in the range 11.0–14.2 times earnings. All CGUs are insensitive to reasonably possible changes in the assumptions used.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has gross unrecognised temporary differences of £133m with the unrecognised net tax amount  
being £29m (2016: gross £135m and net tax £33m respectively). This includes gross tax losses of £119m with the net tax amount being £27m  
(2016: gross £101m and net tax £23m respectively), which are potentially available for offset against future profits. Of the unrecognised gross losses 
£83m (2016: £57m) are expected to expire within 20 years and £36m (2016: £44m) have no expiry. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in 
respect of these items since it is not probable that future taxable profits will arise against which the temporary differences may be utilised.
A deferred tax asset of £2m (2016: £nil) in respect of tax losses has been recognised in 2017 as it was considered probable that future tax 
profits should arise.
In 2016 a deferred tax liability of £160m was recognised in relation to the intangible assets of £636m that arose on the acquisition of 
ICAP (Note 30(a)). The tax rate applied reflects the regional allocation of these assets. This deferred tax liability has reduced by £24m 
due to the reduction in the US federal rate of tax, with the rest of the reduction relating to amortisation of the intangible assets.
No deferred tax has been recognised on temporary differences associated with unremitted earnings of subsidiaries as the Group is able  
to control the timing of distributions and overseas dividends are largely exempt from UK tax. As at the balance sheet date, the Group 
had unrecognised deferred tax liabilities of £2m (2016: £2m) in respect of unremitted profits of subsidiaries of £23m (2016: £23m).

Sterling Notes: Due June 2019
In December 2012 £80m Sterling Notes, due June 2019, were issued. The Notes have a coupon of 5.25% paid semi-annually. At 31 December 
2017 their fair value (Level 1) was £84m (2016: £84m).
Sterling Notes: Due January 2024
In January 2017 the Group issued £500m unsecured Sterling Notes due January 2024. The Notes have a fixed coupon of 5.25% paid 
semi-annually, subject to compliance with the terms of the Notes. Proceeds were used to repay the £470m bank loan. At 31 December 2017 
their fair value (Level 1) was £533m. Accrued interest at 31 December 2017 amounted to £12m.
Bank loan: Due December 2017
On the completion of the ICAP acquisition the Group drew on its £470m committed bridge financing facility. The proceeds were used to 
repay £140m outstanding on the Group’s bank credit facility and £330m to repay a loan acquired with the ICAP acquisition. Facility fees of 
£3m were incurred in 2016. The carrying amount of the bank loan approximated to its fair value.
Bank credit facility
The Group has a £250m committed revolving credit facility, the maturity of which has been extended by a year to April 2019. During 2016, 
£140m was drawn to repay the Group’s Sterling Notes that matured in July 2016. The amount drawn was repaid from the proceeds of the 
bank loan. The facility was undrawn at the end of the year. Facility fees of 1% are payable on the undrawn balance. Arrangement fees are 
amortised over the maturity of the facility.

Property provisions outstanding as at 31 December 2017 relate to provisions in respect of onerous leases and building dilapidations. 
The onerous lease provision represents the net present value of the future rental cost net of expected sub-lease income. These leases 
expire in one to nine years (2016: one to ten years). The building dilapidations provision represents the estimated cost of making good 
dilapidations and disrepair on various leasehold buildings. The leases expire in one to five years.
Restructuring provisions outstanding as at 31 December 2017 relate to termination and other employee related costs. The increase during 
the year reflects the actions taken under the Group’s cost improvement programme and from the integration of ICAP. It is expected that 
these obligations will be discharged during 2018.
Legal and other provisions include provisions for legal claims brought against subsidiaries of the Group together with provisions against 
obligations for certain long-term employee benefits and non-property related onerous contracts. At present the timing and amount of any 
payments are uncertain and provisions are subject to regular review. It is expected that the obligations will be discharged over the next 25 years.
In February 2015 the European Commission imposed a fine of £13m (€15m) on ICAP Europe Limited (‘IEL ’) for alleged competition violations 
in relation to the involvement of certain of IEL ’s brokers in the attempted manipulation of Yen LIBOR by bank traders between October 2006 
and January 2011. While this matter relates to alleged conduct violations prior to completion of the Company’s acquisition of ICAP, the 
Company notes that the fine imposed by the European Commission has been appealed, seeking a full annulment of the Commission’s 
decision. This is recognised as a provision of £13m as at 31 December 2017. In the event that the Commission imposes a fine in excess of  
€15m such excess will be borne by NEX Group plc (‘NEX’). In November 2017, the European General Court granted a partial annulment  
of the Commission’s findings. The Commission appealed this decision in February 2018 and IEL will serve its reply during April 2018.

26. Financial instruments
(a) Financial and liquidity risk
The Group does not take trading risk and does not hold proprietary trading positions. Consequently, the Group is exposed to trading book 
market risk only in relation to incidental positions in financial instruments arising as a result of the Group’s failure to match clients’ orders 
precisely. The Group has limited exposure to non-trading book market risk, specifically to interest rate risk and currency risk. Thus the overall 
approach to the planning and management of the Group’s capital and liquidity is to ensure the Group’s solvency, i.e. its continued ability to 
conduct business, deliver returns to shareholders, and support growth and strategic initiatives. This risk profile meets the necessary conditions 
for an investment firm consolidation waiver and the Group benefits from a waiver under the CRD IV provisions, the details of which are set 
out in the Regulatory Capital section of the Strategic report on page 35.
The Group seeks to ensure that it has access to an appropriate level of cash, other forms of marketable securities and liquidity facilities to 
enable it to finance its ongoing operations on cost effective terms. Cash and cash equivalent balances are held with the primary objective  
of capital security and availability, with a secondary objective of generating returns. Funding requirements are monitored by the Group’s 
Finance and Treasury functions.
As a normal part of its operations, the Group faces liquidity risk through the risk of being required to fund transactions that fail to settle on 
the due date. From a risk perspective, the most problematic scenario concerns ‘fail to deliver’ transactions, where the business has received  
a security from the selling counterparty (and has paid cash in settlement of the same) but is unable to effect onward delivery of the security  
to the buying counterparty. Such settlement ‘fails’ give rise to a funding requirement, reflecting the value of the security which the Group  
has ‘failed to deliver’ until such time as the delivery leg is finally settled and the business has received the associated cash.
The Group has addressed this funding risk by arranging overdraft facilities to cover ‘failed to deliver’ trades, either with the relevant 
settlement agent/depository or with a clearing bank. Under such arrangements, the facility provider will fund the value of any ‘failed to 
deliver’ trades until delivery of the security is effected. Certain facility providers require collateral (such as a cash deposit or parent company 
guarantee) to protect them from any adverse mark-to-market movement and some also charge a funding fee for providing the facility.
The Group is also exposed to potential margin calls from clearing houses and correspondent clearers, in both the UK and the United States.
In the event of a liquidity issue arising, the firm has recourse to existing global cash resources, after which it could draw down on its £250m 
committed revolving credit facility as additional contingency funding.
(b) Capital management
The Group’s policy is to maintain a capital base and funding structure that maintains creditor, regulator and market confidence and provides 
flexibility for business development whilst also optimising returns to shareholders. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, as set 
out in Note 23, cash and cash equivalents, other current financial assets and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising 
issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Notes 27 and 28.
The Group has an investment firm consolidation waiver under which it is required to monitor its compliance with a Financial Holding 
Company test which takes into account the Company’s shareholders’ funds and the aggregated credit risk, market risk and fixed 
overhead requirements of the Company’s subsidiaries. A number of the Company’s subsidiaries are individually regulated and are 
required to maintain capital that is appropriate to the risks entailed in their businesses according to definitions that vary according  
to each jurisdiction.

(d) Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss include simultaneous back-to-back derivative transactions with counterparties  
which are reported as separate financial assets and financial liabilities in the statement of financial position. These transactions are subject 
to ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) Master Netting Agreements which provide a legally enforceable right of offset  
on the occurrence of a specified event of default, or other events not expected to happen in the normal course of business, but are not 
otherwise enforceable.

As at 31 December 2016, £1m of financial liabilities held at FVTPL were not subject to offsetting arrangements. Their notional value was £49m. 
(e) Credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties in respect of its Name Passing, Matched Principal, 
Executing Broker and corporate treasury operations. The Group does not bear any significant concentration risk to either counterparts 
or markets.
The credit risk in respect of the Name Passing business and the information sales and risk management services is limited to the collection 
of outstanding commission and transaction fees and this is managed proactively by the Group’s accounts receivable functions. As at the 
year end, a substantial majority of the Group’s counterparty exposure is to investment grade counterparts (rated BBB-/Baa3 or above).
The Matched Principal business involves the Group acting as a counterparty on trades which are undertaken on a delivery versus payment 
basis. The Group manages its credit risk in these transactions through appropriate policies and procedures in order to mitigate this risk 
including stringent on-boarding requirements, setting appropriate credit limits for all counterparts which are closely monitored by the 
regional credit risk teams to restrict any potential loss through counterparty default. Settlement of these transactions takes place according 
to the relevant market rules and conventions and the credit risk is considered to be minimal. Deposits paid for securities borrowed arise on 
collateralised stock lending transactions. Such trades are complete only when both the collateral and stock for each side of the transaction 
are returned. As at the year end, a substantial majority of the Group’s counterparty exposure is to investment grade counterparts.
The credit risk on cash, cash equivalents, financial assets and financial assets at FVTPL are subject to frequent monitoring. All financial 
institutions that are transacted with are approved and internal limits are assigned to each one based on a combination of factors including 
external credit ratings. As at the year end, a significant proportion of cash and cash equivalents is deposited with investment grade rated 
financial institutions.

(g) Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The table below illustrates the sensitivity of the profit for the year with regard to currency movements on financial assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies as at the year end. The sensitivity of the Group’s equity with regard to its net foreign currency investments 
at the year end (excluding ICAP for 2016) is also shown below. 
Based on a 10% weakening in the US dollar and Euro exchange rates against Sterling, the effects would be as follows:
2017 2016
USD £m EUR £m USD £m EUR £m
Change in foreign currency financial assets and liabilities – profit or loss (5) (3) (3) (1)
Change in translation of foreign operations – equity (79) (3) (31) (1)
The Group would experience equal and opposite foreign exchange movements should the US dollar and Euro exchange rates strengthen  
against Sterling.
(h) Interest rate sensitivity analysis
Interest on floating rate financial instruments is reset at intervals of less than one year. The Group’s exposure to interest rates arises on cash 
and cash equivalents and money market instruments. The Sterling Notes are fixed rate financial instruments.
A 100 basis point change in interest rates, applied to average floating rate financial instrument assets and liabilities during the year, would 
result in the following impact on profit or loss:

(i) Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped 
into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
 > Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 > Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable  
for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
 > Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

(b) Other reserves continued 
Reverse acquisition reserve
The acquisition of Collins Stewart Tullett plc by Tullett Prebon plc in 2006 was accounted for as a reverse acquisition. Under IFRS the 
consolidated accounts of Tullett Prebon plc are prepared as if they were a continuation of the consolidated accounts of Collins Stewart 
Tullett plc. The reverse acquisition reserve represents the difference between the initial equity share capital of Tullett Prebon plc and the 
share capital and share premium of Collins Stewart Tullett plc at the time of the acquisition. This resulted in the consolidated net assets 
before and after the acquisition remaining unchanged. 
Revaluation reserve
The revaluation reserve represents the remeasurement of assets in accordance with IFRS that have been recorded in other comprehensive income.
Hedging and translation
The hedging and translation reserve records revaluation gains and losses arising on net investment hedges and the effect of changes in 
exchange rates on translation of foreign operations recorded in other comprehensive income. As at 31 December 2017, £10m relates to 
amounts arising on previous net investment hedges (2016: £10m). 
Own shares
As at 31 December 2017, the Tullett Prebon plc Employee Benefit Trust 2007 held 2,668,144 ordinary shares (2016: 1,927,575 ordinary shares) 
with a fair value of £14m (2016: £8m). During the year the Trust purchased 740,569 ordinary shares in the open market at a cost of £4m.

Share option awards
During 2016, share options over 302,148 shares, awarded under the Group’s equity-based long term incentive plan, the Tullett Prebon 
Long Term Incentive Plan, were exercised. No further awards remain outstanding. 
Senior Manager Deferred Bonus Plan
Annual awards are made under the Group’s Senior Manager Deferred Bonus Plan that commenced in 2015.
Under this Plan, employees identified as Senior Managers have 20% of their annual discretionary bonus awarded in deferred shares. 
These awards will be settled with TP ICAP plc shares and are subject to the completion of service conditions and the fulfilment of other 
conduct requirements. The number of shares in respect of a bonus year is determined after the close period for that year at the then market 
price, and vest over three years from the grant. The fair value of the shares equates to the monetary value of the awards at grant date and 
includes the value of expected dividends that will accrue to the beneficiaries.
As part of the introduction of the Deferred Bonus Plan in 2015, a Special Award was granted to eligible employees. The Special Award will 
vest in May 2018. 
Awards will be settled by the Tullett Prebon plc Employee Benefit Trust 2007 from shares purchased by it in the open market.

Executive Director Deferred Bonus Plan
Annual awards are made under the Group’s Executive Director Deferred Bonus Plan that commenced in 2017.
The Group’s Executive Directors have 50% of their annual discretionary bonus awarded in deferred shares. These awards are subject to the 
completion of service conditions and the fulfilment of other conduct requirements and will be settled with TP ICAP plc shares. The number 
of shares in respect of a bonus year is determined after the close period for that year at the market price, and vest three years from the date 
of the grant. The fair value of the shares equates to the monetary value of the awards at grant date and includes the value of expected 
dividends that will accrue to the beneficiaries.
Awards will be settled by the Tullett Prebon plc Employee Benefit Trust 2007 from shares purchased by it in the open market.
At the year end closing share price of 532p the estimated total number of deferred shares for the 2017 bonus year was 165,414.
Transformational Long Term Incentive Plan
The Transformational Long Term Incentive Plan commenced in 2017 as a one-off long-term plan aligned to the three-year integration period 
for Tullett Prebon and ICAP (January 2017 – December 2019). Awards are allocated between the Executive Directors and members of the 
Group’s Global Executive Committee. At the end of the performance period, the LTIP pool will be determined, based on absolute TSR and 
EPS performance, and converted into awards of shares. Shares will be subject to a holding period and will be released one third in April 2021, 
one third in April 2022 and one third in April 2023. During the holding period, the shares cannot be sold (other than to cover the cost of any 
applicable taxes).
Awards will be settled by the issue of new shares.
Acquisition related share-based payments
As part of the acquisition of PVM, certain former shareholders are eligible to receive additional payments after three years’ service provided 
they remain as employees and PVM achieves revenue performance targets over that period. The Group has the sole right to issue equity 
or cash to satisfy these additional payments, which, although deferred consideration in substance, are conditional on future employment. 
In November 2017 the service term and revenue performance targets were fulfilled. The amount due is US$51m (£38m) which has been 
recognised as a share-based expense, through the income statement and equity, over the three year service term. The obligation will be 
settled in early 2018.

(a) Acquisition of ICAP
On 30 December 2016, the Group issued 310.3m ordinary shares to acquire 100% of the share capital of ICAP Global Broking Holdings 
Limited (‘ICAP’). The fair value of the shares issued was £1,283m, representing their market value at the date of issue. No further consideration 
is payable in respect of the acquisition.

Note:
Due the size and complexity of the acquisition and its proximity to the 2016 year end the initial accounting for the acquisition was provisional at 31 December 2016. The principal 
adjustments on finalising fair values were:
 (a) the identification of developed software and the finalisation the fair value resulted in a £3m increase.
 (b)  the finalisation of the fair values attributable to investments in associates and joint ventures resulted in a £2m reduction in associates and an increase of £20m 
in joint ventures.
 (c) the fair value of trade and other receivables reduced by £2m.
 (d) the finalisation of the review of trade and other payables, and tax obligations resulted in the identification of £3m of additional liabilities.
 (e) the review of long-term employee related obligations resulted in provisions of £13m, together with other provisions of £2m.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
continued
for the year ended 31 December 2017
TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017
142 Financial statements 30. Acquisitions continued
(a) Acquisition of ICAP continued
Intangible assets arising on consolidation, have been allocated to: the ICAP brand, £27m; the value of customer relationships, £598m; 
and other intangibles having finite lives, £11m. An associated deferred tax liability of £160m was recognised on acquisition, based on the 
regional allocation of these assets and applicable tax rates, none of which has been offset against the Group’s deferred tax assets. The 
balance of £689m has been recognised as goodwill, representing the value of the established workforce and the business’s reputation.
The fair value of the brand has been estimated using a relief-from-royalty approach, based on empirical, market derived rates for such assets, 
and is sensitive to changes in the royalty rate applied. The fair value of customer relationships has been estimated using the ‘multi-period 
excess earnings methodology’ which uses the net present value of forecast, post-tax profits generated by that asset. The fair value of customer 
relationships is sensitive to changes in: forecast post-tax profits; the discount rate applied; the assumed useful life of the assets; the expected 
rate of customer attrition; and the level of contributory asset charges for the use of other assets, including a charge for the workforce. 
Indemnification assets of £16m, receivable from NEX, have been recognised on acquisition and are included with trade and other receivables. 
The fair value of these assets reflect the fair value of the provisions against which the indemnification has been received. No contingent 
liabilities have been recognised at fair value as such liabilities cannot be reliably measured. Should such contingent liabilities crystallise, 
a further indemnification asset would be recognised to the extent covered by the relevant indemnity.
Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes and no associated deferred tax asset has been recorded.
ICAP was not reflected in the Group’s results for 2016. Had ICAP been acquired on 1 January 2016 revenue would have been £795m higher, 
underlying operating profit £108m higher and underlying earnings £85m higher. If the 310.3m ordinary shares issued to acquire ICAP had 
been issued on 1 January 2016 the basic weighted average shares (Note 11) would have been 552.6m, resulting in an underlying basic EPS 
8.5p lower at 34.0p.
Acquisition costs, included in administrative expenses, amounted to £17m in 2016 and £12m in 2015. £7m of costs attributable to the issue of 
the ordinary shares have been expensed directly to equity.
(b) Acquisition of Coex Partners Limited
In November 2017, the Group announced the acquisition of Coex Partners Limited and its subsidiaries (‘COEX’). Initial cash consideration was 
£4m and deferred contingent consideration is payable through to the third anniversary of completion. The amount of deferred contingent 
consideration is dependent upon the performance of the business over the three year period and has a fair value estimated to be £16m. 
Determining the fair value of deferred consideration requires an estimation of future profitability over the three year period which has 
been based on historical and forecast outcomes. A 10% increase in revenue would result in a £1m increase in deferred consideration. The 
actual outcome may differ from this estimate. The initial accounting for the acquisition is provisional due to the proximity to the year end. 
Provisional fair values of the net liabilities acquired were £3m. Intangible assets relating to customer relationships have been provisionally 
recognised at £3m together with £1m of associated deferred tax liabilities. Goodwill, representing the value of the established workforce 
and the business’s reputation, amounted to £21m.
Had Coex been acquired on 1 January 2017 underlying operating profit would have been £3m higher and underlying earnings £2m higher. 
Acquisition costs, included in administrative expenses, amounted to less than £1m in 2017.
(c) Acquisition of SCS Commodities Corp
In January 2018, the Group announced the acquisition of SCS Commodities Corp (‘SCS’). Initial cash consideration was US$8m (£6m) and 
deferred contingent consideration is payable through to the third anniversary of completion. The amount of deferred contingent consideration 
is dependent upon the performance of the business over the three year period and has a fair value estimated to be $4m (£3m). The estimated 
fair value of the net assets acquired were US$ 1m (£1m). Intangible assets, relating to customer relationships, are estimated to be $1m (£1m) with 
provisional goodwill, representing the value of the established workforce and the business’s reputation, amounting to US$10m (£7m).
Acquisition costs, included in administrative expenses, amounted to less than £1m in 2017.

at floating rates based on daily bank deposit rates. Short term deposits are made for varying periods of between one day and three months 
depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group, and earn interest at the respective short term deposit rates.
Financial assets comprise short term government securities, term deposits and restricted funds held with banks and clearing organisations.
Non-cash items represent accrued interest and the amortisation of debt issue costs.

FCA investigation
Tullett Prebon Europe Limited (‘TPEL ’) is currently under investigation by the FCA in relation to certain trades undertaken between 2008 and 
2011, including trades which are risk free, which are alleged to have no commercial rationale or economic purpose, on which brokerage is 
paid, and trades on which brokerage may have been improperly charged. As part of its investigation, the FCA is considering the extent to 
which during the relevant period (i) TPEL ’s systems and controls were adequate to manage the risks associated with such trades and (ii) 
whether certain of TPEL ’s managers were aware of, and/or managed appropriately the risks associated with, the trades. The FCA is also 
reviewing the circumstances surrounding a failure in 2011 by TPEL to discover certain audio files and produce them to the FCA in a timely 
manner. As the investigation is ongoing, it is not possible to predict its ultimate outcome and accordingly any potential liability and/or 
financial impact cannot currently be reliably estimated. In connection with the investigation, the Group has commenced its own review of 
the Group’s previous systems and controls around gifts and hospitality.
Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate case
On 16 August 2016, a litigation was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York naming the Company, ICAP 
plc, ICAP Australia Pty LTD and Tullett Prebon (Australia) Pty. Limited as defendants together with various Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate 
(‘BBSW’) setting banks. The complaint alleges collusion by the defendants to fix BBSW-based derivatives prices through manipulative 
trading during the fixing window and false BBSW rate submissions. Each of the defendants named above intend to defend the litigation 
vigorously. It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of the litigation or to provide an estimate of any potential financial impact.
Labour claims – ICAP Brazil
ICAP do Brasil Corretora De Títulos e Varoles Mobiliários Ltda (‘ICAP Brazil’) is a defendant in 19 pending lawsuits filed in the Brazilian 
Labour Court by persons formerly associated with ICAP Brazil seeking damages under various statutory labour rights accorded to employees 
and in relation to various other claims including wrongful termination, breach of contract and harassment (together the ‘Labour claims’). 
The Group estimates the maximum potential aggregate exposure in relation to the Labour claims, including any potential social security tax 
liability, to be BRL 57m (£13m). The Group is covered by an indemnity from NEX in relation to any outflow in respect of materially all of these 
Labour claims in so far as they relate to periods prior to completion of the Group’s acquisition of ICAP .
Flow case – Tullett Prebon Brazil
In December 2012, Flow Participações Ltda. and Brasil Plural Corretora de Câmbio, Títulos e Valores (‘Flow’) initiated a lawsuit against T ullett 
Prebon Brasil S.A. Corretora de Valores e Câmbio and T ullett Prebon Holdings do Brasil Ltda alleging that the defendants have committed a 
series of unfair competition misconducts, such as the recruitment of Flow’s former employees, the illegal obtainment and use of systems and 
software developed by the plaintiffs, as well as the transfer of technology and confidential information from Flow and the collusion to do so in 
order to increase profits from economic activities. The amount currently claimed is BRL 196m (£44m). The Group intends to vigorously defend 
itself but there is no certainty as to the outcome of these claims. The case is currently in an early evidentiary phase and it is stayed pending 
discussion before the Superior Court of Justice regarding the production of evidence. Therefore, the case is not anticipated to be resolved in 2018.
ISDA Fix
The CFTC and other government agencies have requested information from the NEX Group in relation to the setting of the US dollar segment 
of a benchmark known as ISDA Fix. ICAP plc’s successor firm, NEX, continues to co-operate with the agencies’ inquiries into the setting of 
that rate. ICAP Capital Markets LLC (‘ICM’) was the collection agent for ISDA Fix panel bank submissions in US dollars, but was not a panel 
member itself. It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of the CFTC investigation or to provide an estimate of any potential financial 
impact. In September and October 2014, five class actions were filed alleging injury due to purported manipulation of the USD ISDA Fix 
rate. ICM is a defendant in those actions, which have now been consolidated into a single action, along with several ISDA Fix panel banks. 
Pursuant to the terms of the sale and purchase agreement between the Company and NEX it was agreed that ICM would transfer its activities 
and business to the Company but that ICM would not be transferred to the Company’s ownership at completion. It was further agreed that in 
the event of any claims or losses arising in relation to ISDA Fix, these would be for the account of NEX. It is not possible to predict the ultimate 
outcome of the litigation or the CFTC’s enquiries or to provide an estimate of any potential financial impact. The Company and its Group 
may nevertheless suffer financial loss either directly or as a consequence of damage to its reputation as a result of these matters.
Swaps civil litigation
In December 2016, ICAP SEF (US) LLC and ICAP Global Derivatives Limited were named in a class action alleging that they and certain 
dealer banks colluded to prevent buy-side customers from accessing all-to-all anonymous electronic trading platforms and therefore 
prevented buy-side customers from getting access to the best interest rate swap prices. The actions generally asserted claims of violation 
of antitrust laws and unjust enrichment. Each of ICAP SEF (US) LLC and ICAP Global Derivatives Limited intend to defend these litigation 
claims vigorously. It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of the litigation or to provide an estimate of any potential financial 
impact. The Company expects that it will benefit from the warranty provisions of the sale and purchase agreement with NEX such that 
any outflow in respect of the ICAP entities with regard to this litigation will be borne by NEX. In July 2017, the Court dismissed the claims 
against ICAP SEF (US) LLC and ICAP Global Derivatives Limited. No subsidiary of the Group is therefore currently named as a defendant 
in relation to this class action.

LIBOR Class actions
The Group is currently defending two LIBOR related actions.
(i) Stichting LIBOR Class Action
On 15 December 2017, the Stichting Elco Foundation, a Netherlands-based claim foundation, filed a writ initiating litigation in the Dutch 
court in Amsterdam on behalf of institutional investors against ICAP Europe Limited (‘IEL ’) , ICAP plc, Cooperative Rabobank U.A., UBS AG, 
UBS Securities Japan Co. Ltd, Lloyds Banking Group plc, and Lloyds Bank plc. The litigation alleges manipulation by the defendants of 
the JPY LIBOR, GBP LIBOR, CHF LIBOR, USD LIBOR, EURIBOR, TIBOR, SOR, BBSW and HIBOR benchmark rates, and seeks a declaratory 
judgment that the defendants acted unlawfully and conspired to engage in improper manipulation of benchmarks. If the plaintiffs succeed 
in the action, the defendants would be responsible for paying costs of the litigation, but each allegedly impacted investor would need to 
prove its own actual damages. It is not possible at this time to determine the final outcome of this litigation, but IEL has factual and legal 
defences to the claims and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously. The Group is covered by an indemnity from NEX in relation to any outflow 
in respect of the ICAP entities with regard to these matters.
(ii) Swiss LIBOR Class Action
On 4 December 2017, a class of plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Class Action Complaint in the matter of Sonterra Capital Master Fund Ltd. 
et al. v. Credit Suisse Group AG et al. naming as defendants, among others, TP ICAP plc, Tullett Prebon Americas Corp., Tullett Prebon (USA) 
Inc., Tullett Prebon Financial Services LLC, Tullett Prebon (Europe) Limited, Cosmorex AG, ICAP Europe Limited, and ICAP Securities USA LLC 
(together, the ‘Companies’). The Second Amended Complaint generally alleges that the Companies conspired with certain bank customers 
to manipulate Swiss Franc LIBOR and prices of Swiss Franc LIBOR based derivatives by disseminating false pricing information in false 
run-throughs and false prices published on screens viewed by customers in violation of the Sherman Act (anti-trust) and RICO . The Companies 
intend to contest liability in the matter and to vigorously defend themselves. A briefing schedule has been agreed in connection with a 
motion to dismiss that the Companies intend to make on both jurisdictional and substantive grounds. It is not possible to predict the ultimate 
outcome of this action or to provide an estimate of any potential financial impact.
General note
From time to time the Company’s subsidiaries are engaged in litigation in relation to a variety of matters, and it is required to provide 
information to regulators and other government agencies as part of informal and formal enquiries or market reviews. The Company’s 
reputation may also be damaged by any involvement or the involvement of any of its employees or former employees in any regulatory 
investigation and by any allegations or findings, even where the associated fine or penalty is not material.
Save as outlined above in respect of legal matters or disputes for which a provision has not been made, notwithstanding the uncertainties 
that are inherent in the outcome of such matters, there are no individual matters which are considered to pose a significant risk of material 
adverse financial impact on the Group’s results or net assets.
In the normal course of business, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries enter into guarantees and indemnities to cover trading arrangements 
and/or the use of third party services or software. 
The Group operates in a wide variety of jurisdictions around the world and uncertainties therefore exist with respect to the interpretation of 
complex tax laws and practices of those territories. The Group establishes provisions for taxes other than current and deferred income taxes, 
based upon various factors which are continually evaluated, if there is a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the 
obligation can be made.

(a) Defined benefit schemes
The Group has a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK and a small number of schemes operated in other countries. The overseas schemes 
are not significant in the context of the Group.

Defined benefit scheme surplus – UK 57 100

(b) UK defined benefit scheme
The Group’s UK defined benefit pension scheme is the defined benefit section of the Tullett Prebon Pension Scheme (the ‘Scheme’).
The Scheme is a final salary, funded pension scheme that is closed to new members and future accrual. For members still in service there  
is a continuing link between benefits and pensionable pay. The Principal Employer is Tullett Prebon Group Limited.
The assets of the Scheme are held separately from those of the Group, either in separate trustee administered funds or in contract-based 
policies of insurance.
The latest funding actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 30 April 2016 by independent qualified actuaries. The actuarial 
funding surplus of the Scheme at that date was £61m and under the agreed schedule of contributions the Group will continue not to make any 
payments into the Scheme.
The Trustees of the Scheme are currently making arrangements for the transfer of the Scheme’s liabilities to a third party to take on 
responsibility for the provision of benefits, removing the Group’s responsibility for supporting the Scheme financially. During 2017, the 
Trustees of the Scheme purchased a bulk annuity policy with an insurance company that covered all of the Scheme’s liabilities. The policy 
is in the name of the Scheme and is a Scheme asset.
The purchase of the policy represents a bulk annuity ‘buy-in’ and has been accounted for in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 
‘Employee Benefits’. Under IAS 19, the accounting value of the purchased policy is set to be equal to the value of the liabilities covered, 
calculated using the current IAS 19 actuarial assumptions for the defined benefit obligation. As the actual purchase price of the policy was 
higher than the accounting value of the policy, a reduction in the Scheme’s assets was recorded. This reduction is included within the Return 
on Scheme assets (excluding deemed interest) and reported as part of the Group’s ‘Remeasurement of defined benefit pension schemes’ 
included within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In 2016, as part of the preparation for the ‘buy-in’, the Trustees offered all deferred members an option, for a limited time, to benefit from 
a transfer of their benefits to another provider. The offer resulted in approximately 63 members transferring a total of £29m in assets out 
of the Scheme. A net gain of £4m arose as a result of this settlement, representing the difference between the £29m transferred out and the 
corresponding liabilities, measured on an IAS 19 basis, at the date that the settlement became binding.
The amounts included in the balance sheet arising from the Group’s obligations in respect of the Scheme are as follows:

The main financial assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries of the Scheme to calculate the liabilities under IAS 19 were:
2017
 %
2016
 %
Key assumptions
Discount rate 2.40 2.50
Expected rate of salary increases 4.75 4.75
Rate of increase in LPI pensions in payment
1
2.40 2.40
Inflation assumption 2.40 2.40
1 This applies to pensions accrued from 6 April 1997. The majority of current and future pensions receive fixed increases in payment of either 0% or 2.5%.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables and allow for future mortality improvements and are the same as those 
adopted for the 2016 funding valuation. Assumptions for the Scheme are that a member who retires in 15 years’ time at age 60 will live 
on average for a further 31.3 years (2016: 31.5 years) after retirement if they are male and for a further 32.7 years (2016: 32.9 years) after 
retirement if they are female. Current pensioners are assumed to have a generally shorter life expectancy based on their current age.
The valuation of the Scheme liabilities is sensitive to changes in the assumptions used. The effect of changes in the discount rate, inflation and 
mortality assumptions, assuming an independent change in one assumption with all others held constant, on the liabilities is shown below:
Scheme
 assets 
£m
Scheme 
liabilities
£m
Surplus
£m
As at 31 December 2017 260 (203) 57
Following a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate Change 3.5% 4.5%
New value 269 (212) 57
Following a 0.25% increase in the inflation assumption Change 2.0% 2.6%
New value 265 (208) 57
Life expectancy increases by 3 years Change 7.7% 9.9%
New value 280 (223) 57
The above analysis does not reflect any inter-relationship between the assumptions.
Changes to the risks inherent in the Scheme would result in changes to the Scheme’s carrying value. However, as a result of the bulk annuity 
purchase, the value of the Scheme’s insurance asset matches changes in the insured liabilities. The value of Scheme’s surplus assets will change 
as the market value of those investments change.
The amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of the Scheme were as follows:

(b) UK defined benefit scheme continued
The Scheme duration is an indicator of the weighted average time until benefit payments are made. For the Scheme as a whole, the duration 
is around 20 years reflecting the approximate split of the defined benefit liability between current employees (duration of 25 years), deferred 
members (duration of 23 years) and current pensioners (duration of 13 years).
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid into the Scheme during 2018 is £nil.
(c) Defined contribution pensions
The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes for qualifying employees. The assets of these schemes are held separately 
from those of the Group.
The defined contribution pension cost for the Group charged to administrative expenses was £13m (2016: £7m), of which £7m  
(2016: £3m) related to overseas schemes.
As at 31 December 2017, there was £1m outstanding in respect of the current reporting period that had not been paid over to the schemes 
(2016: £nil).

154 Financial statements 1. Basis of preparation
Following the publication of FRS 100 ‘Application of Financial Reporting Requirements’ by the Financial Reporting Council, the Company 
adopted FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ as its accounting framework in 2015. No disclosures previously made in the Company’s 
Financial Statements are omitted on the application of FRS 101.
The separate Financial Statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act. They have been prepared under the 
historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments held at fair values at the end of each reporting period, 
as explained in the accounting policies. and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice. As discussed on page 35 of the Strategic report, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the going concern basis continues to be used 
in preparing these Financial Statements.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to 
share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, 
presentation of a cash flow statement and certain related party transactions.
2. Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted are the same as those set out in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements except  
as noted below.
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.
The Company has share-based payment arrangements involving employees of its subsidiaries. The cost of these arrangements is measured 
by reference to the fair value of equity instruments on the date they are granted. Cost is recognised in ‘investment in subsidiary undertakings’ 
and credited to the ‘profit and loss account’ reserve on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Where the cost is subsequently recharged 
to the subsidiary, it is recognised as a reduction in ‘investment in subsidiary undertakings’.
The Company is the sponsor of the Tullett Prebon plc Employee Benefit Trust 2007 and applies the ’look-through’ approach to the Trust’s 
assets, liabilities and results which are included as part of the Company.
3. Profit for the year
As permitted in section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the year.
The auditor’s remuneration for audit and other services is disclosed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has 
no employees (2016: nil). Information about individual Directors is provided in the audited part of the Report on Directors’ Remuneration on 
pages 69 to 89.

Bank loan: Due December 2017
On the completion of the ICAP acquisition the Group drew on its £470m committed bridge financing facility. The proceeds were used to 
repay £140m outstanding on the Group’s bank credit facility and £330m to repay a loan acquired with the ICAP acquisition. Facility fees 
of £3m were incurred in 2016. The carrying amount of the bank loan approximated to its fair value.
Bank credit facility
The Group has a £250m committed revolving credit facility, the maturity of which has been extended by a year to April 2019. During 2016, 
£140m was drawn to repay the Group’s Sterling Notes that matured in July 2016. The amount drawn was repaid from the proceeds of the 
bank loan. The facility was undrawn at the end of the year. Facility fees of 1% are payable on the undrawn balance. Arrangement fees are 
amortised over the maturity of the facility.
