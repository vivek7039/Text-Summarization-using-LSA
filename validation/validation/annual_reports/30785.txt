Housing Page 29 Care Page 33 Key highlights
 → Group revenue of £900.2m (2016: £940.1m), impacted by both delays to the timing 
of planned workloads and a slow period in securing new contract revenues in Housing, 
combined with the planned rationalisation of Care contracts. 
 → Group profit before tax and before amortisation of acquisition intangibles reduced to 
£37.1m (2016: £40.1m), with the diluted EPS reducing by 8% to 28.05p (2016: 30.36p).
 → Housing revenues of £766.1m (2016: £787.5m), a reduction of 3%, impacted by 
the timing of our planned workloads following the tragic events at Grenfell Tower, 
and combined with a slow period in securing new contract revenues.
 → Housing operating margins reduced to 5.2% (2016: 5.6%), reflecting the revenue 
reduction and a resulting lower overhead recovery.
 → Service quality remains our key differentiator; the proportion of customers rating 
our service as ‘excellent’ showed further improvement at 92% (2016: 91%).
 → Care revenue decreased by 12% to £134.1m (2016: £152.6m), reflecting the 
restructuring of the Care contract portfolio following the closure of branches 
accounting for around 27% of Care revenues. The restructuring is now complete 
and our remaining Care contracts have a much improved mix of longevity, 
certainty of spend and price. 
 → The Care division returned to profit as planned, delivering an operating profit 
for the full year of £0.5m (2016: loss £1.2m), representing an operating margin 
for the second half of 2.3%.
 → Exceptional loss of £16.5m reported in discontinued activities relating to 
the full provision against performance guarantees in the legacy M&E division. 
 → EBITDA to cash conversion of 61% (2016: 70%) is below our historical norm, 
reflecting the changing sales mix.
 → Reported net debt position of £25.8m (2016: £12.4m) at the year end. The average 
net debt over the year was £96.4m (2016: £85.0m), in part reflecting the changing 
sales mix and after funding of both the deferred consideration on earlier acquisitions 
and the cash outflow included within the loss on discontinued activities.
 → New separate debt facility of £30m to fund short-term purchase of properties 
as part of the Group’s development of longer-term homelessness solutions.
 → Total dividend increased by 3% to 12.00p (2016: 11.70p), reflecting the Board’s 
confidence in the underlying performance and the long-term prospects of the Group.
 → New Housing contract awards of circa £150m with a conversion rate of 16%, which 
falls below our historical norm of 33% and is a disappointing output. Mears will 
remain highly selective and we will not change our bidding model which has served 
us well over many years.
 → New Care contract awards of £140m with a conversion rate of 59% (2016: £200m 
and 74%). The quality of the new orders secured continues to improve in terms of both 
charge rates and contract lengths.
 → Order book at £2.6 billion (2016: £3.1 billion). The current bidding pipeline is in excess 
of £2 billion for 2018, which is well in excess of normal bidding levels. The strategic 
evolution of Mears means greater access to opportunities previously out of our reach.

Housing
At a glance
We focus on long-term  
outcomes and positive social,  
economic and environmental  
impact, across our two divisions.
We carry out 6,000 repairs  
a day in Homes across the UK.
The Housing division made excellent progress in 2017
Our broader service offering, incorporating our new homes capability 
alongside housing management and maintenance, supports our involvement 
in new emerging placemaking partnerships, where our involvement extends 
beyond traditional outsourcing and is focused on creating more 
sustainable communities.
We have broadened the services we offer across the sphere of affordable 
housing. In particular , our acquisition of Omega in 2014 has unlocked a 
large number of new housing management opportunities. We will look 
to make further acquisitions to reinforce our market-leading position, 
however our primary focus remains organic growth.
Our clients are increasingly looking for partners who can operate 
strategically as well as operationally across a range of housing 
services. Mears has extended its core reactive and planned 
maintenance offering to include housing management to 
support clients in delivering more integrated solutions, 
aligned to their strategic challenges.

Care
Our key strengths
Differentiated 
service delivery
In order for customers to 
recommend us, we must 
deliver excellent service. 
We randomly conduct over 
80,000 Housing customer 
surveys each year.
Strategic relationships
We listen carefully to the 
needs of our clients and  
their tenants. As our clients’ 
needs have changed, we  
have developed a broader 
service offering which has 
increased the depth of our 
client partnerships.
Strong financial 
management
We operate in a high volume, 
low value and low margin 
environment where we have 
delivered consistent financial 
results over an extended 
period of time. This is 
achieved through works 
management systems, 
conservative accounting 
policies and a culture of 
giving attention to detail.
Social value
We lead the way with social 
value in the markets where 
we operate, delivering 
meaningful outcomes 
through positive community 
engagement projects and 
effective measurement.
We provide personal care to  
over 15,000 elderly and disabled people.
The Care division made good progress in a challenging period
We are continuing to see the emergence of new commissioning models 
that are long-term partnering orientated. We are focused on improving 
quality and cost over time and combining services into an integrated 
approach to achieve better outcomes for users at less overall cost to 
the public purse.
Whilst there has been no shortage of demand for care 
work, our limitation has been recruiting sufficient 
numbers of good quality carers. However, we 
believe the continuing funding pressure will be 
the catalyst for change.
We have a comprehensive range of domiciliary 
care and complex care services enhanced 
by the ability to deliver a range of housing 
adaptations and assistive technology such 
as telecare. We deliver broad solutions to the 
independent living challenges faced 
by so many elderly people, as well 
as younger people with physical 
or mental disabilities.
At the heart of what we do is the provision of 
quality care to those that depend on us.

Annual report and accounts 2017 Chairman’s statement
“ We continue to take a long-term approach 
to how we run the business, reflected by 
the well-established leadership team that 
thoroughly understands the strategy and 
operational workings of the business. 
As leaders in our core markets, we will 
continue to innovate and demonstrate 
our value for money proposition. ”
Bob Holt
Chairman
While it has been a challenging year, I am pleased to 
report a year of operational progress and that the 
Group is very well positioned to benefit as our core 
markets continue to develop. During the year, Housing 
and Care have been at the top of the political agenda 
and we believe our differentiated offering has never 
been more relevant. The events seen in the wider 
outsourcing sector have been frustrating, where 
company-specific issues have been perceived to 
have wider sector implications. We have, over recent 
months, needed to remind stakeholders of how 
Mears is different from the competition. 
Mears is a very simple business. Our focus has always been 
on a single service user, namely the individual in their home. 
Whilst the end service users are at the centre of our business 
model, the services themselves are primarily funded by the 
public sector . The benefit of having this narrow focus is that we 
understand our markets, we understand the challenges faced 
by our clients and we are well placed to provide innovative 
solutions to address those challenges. We have a strict and 
continuing discipline when bidding new contract opportunities: 
we are highly selective and we never change our bidding model 
to meet a short-term growth aspiration. This has been most 
evident recently where we have seen a lower rate than normal in 
the conversion of new contract opportunities. However, I remain 
extremely confident in the quality of our tender submissions. 
We have missed some opportunities on price, having scored 
well on all the quality measures. We are very confident that 
our conversion rate over the medium term will continue to be 
in line with our historical norms. We will continue to take a 
long-term approach to how we run the business, reflected 
in the well-established leadership team that thoroughly 
understands the strategy and operational workings of the 
business. As leaders in our core markets, we will continue to 
innovate and demonstrate our value for money proposition.
Our strategic priorities 
are the building blocks 
of our business
  See them on page 16
Summary
 → We have a strict and continuing discipline when bidding 
new contract opportunities. We remain highly selective, 
and we will never change our bidding model to meet any 
short-term growth aspiration. 
 → We have reassessed how we guide our investors and city 
analysts. We will set our expectations for the next twelve 
months in line with our “firm and probable” order book, 
providing updates to those expectations when new orders 
are secured. 
 → The Board remains confident in the future opportunities 
and consequently it expects to continue following a 
progressive dividend policy. 
 → I was delighted to see exceptional response rates in our 
‘Say what you see’ survey across our 12,000 employees, 
which showed continued improvement from the already 
good levels achieved in 2016. 
 → We are looking to appoint an employee director to the 
Board to ensure that the Board gets full, open and 
honest insight and views from its workforce on how 
strategic initiatives are being implemented.

I am satisfied with the financial performance for the year to 
31 December 2017, but I am also mindful that our financial 
results were short of our aspirations at the start of the year. 
While our focus is on sustainable growth in the medium to 
long term, I understand the importance of delivering against 
our financial targets in the short term too. The tragic events 
of Grenfell Tower, and the resulting impact on our Housing 
revenues, could not have been anticipated. Group revenue was 
£900.2m (2016: £940.1m). Our second half revenues of £429.4m 
(2016: £473.9m) showed a significant reduction versus those 
delivered in the first half of £470.8m (2016: £466.2m) 
reflecting the delays in the timing of our planned workload 
as clients’ attentions was diverted towards ensuring that 
their housing portfolios were safe and fully compliant. 
We supported our clients in postponing this planned work, 
knowing that it will return once they have confirmed their 
housing is fully compliant. The revenue reduction, together 
with the associated impact upon overhead recovery , saw Group 
profit before tax and before acquired intangible amortisation 
reduce by 7% to £37.1m (2016: £40.1m) and a margin of 4.1% 
(2016: 4.3%). Normalised diluted earnings mirrored the profit 
reduction, decreasing by 8% to 28.05p (2016: 30.36p). Our 
performance by operating division is discussed in greater 
detail in the Review of operations.
The Group reacted quickly to the reduction in Housing revenues. 
Whilst the reduction is expected to be temporary given the 
contractual nature of the work, it has prompted the Group 
to carry out a more detailed review of its operational and 
central support structures to ensure that they deliver the best 
value. This is particularly relevant given the evolution towards 
a broader service offering with a changing support requirement. 
The Board expects annual savings in excess of £5m to be 
delivered in the 2018 financial year.
The order book is £2.6 billion (2016: £3.1 billion), reflecting the 
quiet period of new contract awards. Previously , Mears has 
reported secured revenue as a key performance metric. Due 
to the evolving nature of our business, secured revenue over 
recent years has been found to be a less robust metric than it 
was historically. This became increasingly evident following 
the challenges encountered in 2017, where secured revenues 
reduced over the course of the year. The Board has reassessed 
how we guide the market and, going forward, we will set our 
expectations for the next twelve months in line with our 
‘firm and probable order book’ , providing market updates to 
those expectations when new orders are secured whilst also 
giving us an increased ability to absorb unforeseen 
challenges. The ‘firm and probable order book’ for 
2018 currently stands at £900m. 
The Group has positioned itself to provide a broader service 
offering to the increasingly complex challenges faced by our 
clients. The pipeline of traditional contracting opportunities 
continues to flow through at a consistent level and the 
innovative nature of our Housing Management solutions 
means that much of that work can be secured without the 
requirement for an extended, competitive and expensive 
tender process. Moreover, I do wish to highlight that the 
Group is currently working on two opportunities that are very 
significant and, until recently , would have been beyond the 
reach of the Group. While significantly bigger in scale than the 
Group’s previous bids, they remain true to our core approach of 
focusing on services around a tenant, funded by public money .
We continue to have good dialogue with our shareholders and 
one topic which prompts discussion more than any other is in 
respect of our Care activities. We need to communicate more 
clearly the fundamental role played by Care within our 
Housing business, and the extent to which it underpins the 
success of that part of the Group. We do see an increasing 
number of opportunities where clients are seeking a seamless 
service to provide both care and housing to vulnerable people. 
The Group will increasingly focus its Care bidding activity 
towards those clients where there are opportunities to provide 
Housing services. The Board remains aware of its obligations 
to shareholders, and it will continue to target better returns 
from the Care business. A particular highlight for me was 
the significant improvement in the performance of the Care 
division which returned to profitability in the second half of 2017.
Dividend
The Board remains confident in the Group ’ s future opportunities 
and consequently it expects to continue following a progressive 
dividend policy. The Board is therefore recommending a final 
dividend of 8.55p (2016: 8.40p) per share which, when 
combined with the interim dividend, gives a total dividend for 
the year of 12.00p (2016: 11.70p), a 3% increase, reflecting the 
Board’s confidence in the underlying performance of the 
Group. The dividend is payable, subject to shareholder approval, 
on 5 July 2018 to shareholders on the register on 15 June 2018. 
The Board regularly reviews the Group’s dividend policy to 
maximise returns to shareholders whilst maintaining a prudent 
capital structure and retaining the ability to invest for growth.

Mears Group PLC
Annual report and accounts 2017 Our people
During the second half year, the Group carried out its annual 
staff survey, ‘Say What You See’ . I was delighted to see an 
exceptional response rate of 83% across our 12,000 employees 
which is all the more pleasing considering much of the Mears 
workforce is mobile and therefore engagement is naturally 
harder. Staff feedback showed continued improvement 
from the already good levels in 2016. Areas that scored 
particularly highly in the survey were our commitment to 
customer service and to people development, both of which 
are fundamental to delivering our strategic priorities. 
I commend our employees for their commitment and energy 
throughout a challenging period for the Group and I continue 
to be impressed by their quality, professionalism and loyalty. 
Mears has a diverse workforce including several hundred 
apprentices. The vast majority of our employees live in the 
areas in which they work. Diversity and respect for all  
remains core to our induction, recruitment and customer 
care programmes.
Corporate governance and risk management
During the year, a number of our Non-Executive Directors 
reached nine years’ service and did not therefore offer 
themselves for re-election. Accordingly , the Board was delighted 
to welcome Roy Irwin and Jason Burt as Non-Executive 
Directors, whose appointments were confirmed at the 2017 
AGM. Both Roy and Jason have brought skills and experience 
that have added considerably to the Board. I was also 
delighted to welcome Elizabeth Corrado to the Board in 
September 2017 who further enhanced the breadth of 
skills and balance of the Board.
Peter Dicks will not be offering himself for re-election at the 
2018 AGM and will step down from the Board in June 2018. 
I would like to thank Peter for the significant contribution 
that he has made to the Group. 
The Board continues to set itself high standards of corporate 
governance. Our Corporate Governance Report, issued within 
our Annual Report, details how we approach governance and 
the areas of focus for the Board in 2017 and into the future.  
In line with good practice, we have reviewed and updated the 
Group’s risk register. The Senior Management Team plays a 
central role in reviewing and mitigating the Group’s risks. 
The Group risk team presented risk management training 
modules to all levels of management via the Group 
development programme, to reinforce our strong risk 
management ethos.
Board evaluation and effectiveness
Performance evaluation of the Board, its Committees 
and individual Directors takes place on an annual basis. An 
externally facilitated performance evaluation was conducted 
during the year covering a broad range of areas including Group 
strategy, independence, experience and effectiveness and the 
interaction between Board members. It confirmed that the 
Board is functioning well. It is vital that as a Board we have the 
right mix of skills, experience and diversity, whilst ensuring that 
Board members have sufficient knowledge of the Company and 
maintain their independence and objectivity . I am fortunate as 
Chairman to be able to call upon a Board with a broad range of 
expertise and specialist knowledge.
Employee Director
We understand the vital role that our workforce plays in 
the success of the Group. To further increase engagement 
between the Board and our employees, we are looking to 
appoint an Employee Director to the Board. This role will 
ensure that the Board receives full, open and honest insight 
and views from its workforce on how strategic initiatives 
are being implemented and will provide the wider workforce 
with a better understanding of how the Board operates. 
We are currently managing the recruitment process, with 
applications open to all employees. The role will be restricted 
to a two-year term and we hope that the appointment of the 
successful applicant will be confirmed at the 2018 AGM.
Gender pay
Mears will shortly be issuing its first report based on the  
UK’s new gender pay reporting requirements.
Mears’ gender pay gap is strongly influenced by the salaries 
and gender makeup of its Care division, which accounts for 
around two thirds of employees. The Care division is 
predominantly female and within a sector which is poorly 
funded, with many of employees paid at levels tracking the 
National Living Wage. The Housing division comprising the 
remaining one third of employees, is predominantly male. 
The Housing sector is significantly better funded and pay 
rates reflect this. We are determined to continue to lead the 
way in encouraging more women to pursue a career in housing 
and indeed take every opportunity to highlight the need for 
Central Government and Local Authorities to raise the 
funding and status of roles in the Care sector.
Social value
At the heart of Mears lies a strong sense of responsibility 
towards improving peoples' lives. We aim to lead the way 
with social value in the markets where we operate, delivering 
lasting and meaningful outcomes. During the year we conducted a 
review of our social value strategy , identifying our key priorities to 
ensure that we effectively engage with communities and 
deliver social value on the ground throughout the business, 
with an effective measurement of the social impact that 
is created.
We continued to secure Social Mobility Champion status from 
the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. 
Social mobility is about creating opportunities for young 
people from disadvantaged backgrounds. At Mears, we aim 
to make sure jobs and opportunities are open to everyone.
Summary
From a personal perspective, I am incredibly proud of the 
progress the Group has made since its IPO in 1996. Our revenues 
have grown from £10m to £900m, a significant part of which 
has been delivered organically. Profits have grown from a few 
hundred thousand pounds to tens of millions. We employ 
around 12,000 people and support wider stakeholders in the 
communities where we operate. These achievements should 
not be forgotten in what has been a difficult political and 
trading environment. We will continue to play a leading role 
in shaping our core markets. The Executive team has an 
outstanding track record and I am proud to be associated 
with the Group. I look forward to reporting on further 
progress during the coming year.

Mears Group PLC
Annual report and accounts 2017 Summary
 → Our dedication to providing our clients with first class 
service and value remains undiminished and is key to 
how we manage the business. Our unique strategy 
leaves us better placed than ever to achieve long-
term success.
 → Mears has evolved its strategic focus towards housing 
management and Placemaking activities where we are 
using our broader service capability to create stronger, 
more sustainable communities. As a part of this, 
Mears is also building new homes as part of managing 
regeneration and to support our clients’ overall asset 
management plans. 
 → The Government has already announced major 
commitments to housing, meaning investment will grow 
over the coming years, with the removal of the rent cap 
in 2020 giving additional confidence to our clients. 
 → We firmly believe in our long-term Care strategy and that 
Mears is best placed to benefit as the market evolves. 
The Group will increasingly focus its care bidding activity 
towards those clients, where there are likely to be 
opportunities to provide a complete housing service.
Our financial performance in 2017 was disappointing and 
I understand the importance of delivering against our financial 
targets. Whilst some of the short-term challenges in Housing 
could not have been anticipated, it was frustrating that a 
number of other opportunities, which could have helped 
mitigate these challenges, did not develop quickly enough. 
Nonetheless, I am pleased with the progress made over the 
last year across the entire Mears business and on a range 
of important indicators.
I am particularly excited by the prospects for the Mears Housing 
offering over a medium-term time horizon. The Mears 
operations are performing very well and I am encouraged that 
this excellent performance is putting us in a good position to 
secure new opportunities. The pipeline of opportunities 
for Mears has never been greater. Given the nature of the type 
of work for which we are bidding, the contracts we secure are 
increasingly of longer duration, with multiple work tasks. 
Some of the most significant of these current bidding 
opportunities will be awarded in 2018, although 
commencement dates may not be until 2019. 
“  Our highly focused strategy in the 
Housing and Care markets, built on 
service leadership and sustainable 
pricing, continues to give me great 
confidence in the future. ”

Chief Executive’s strategy overview
Strategic report
07
Mears Group PLC
Annual report and accounts 2017 Chief Executive’s strategy overview continued
In 2017, the value of new contracts secured was below our 
expectations. This was due to two particular factors: firstly,  
we did experience a reduced level of some traditional repairs 
and maintenance work coming to market and secondly, we 
have seen some competitors being very aggressive on price. 
Mears will continue to focus on bidding only at sustainable 
pricing levels.
The market has seen some reductions in capital discretionary 
expenditure levels in the last two years. This is due to a number 
of factors and we have in most circumstances been very 
supportive of our clients’ approach to these reduced spending 
levels. In the same period, social housing landlords have been 
focusing more on new-build activity to address the significant 
housing shortage, a clear Government priority.
The Government has already announced major commitments 
to housing, meaning investment will grow over the coming years, 
with the removal of the rent cap in 2020 giving additional 
confidence to our clients. The strategic evolution of our business 
means we can now access opportunities that previously would 
have been out of our reach. Mears has evolved its strategic 
focus towards Housing Management and Placemaking activities. 
In line with this, Mears is also building new homes as part of 
managing the regeneration and delivery of affordable housing 
for clients, to support their overall asset management plans. 
The Group has become a leading housing management 
business in the UK, directly addressing the issues resulting 
from rising levels of homelessness. 
We firmly believe in our long-term Care strategy and that 
Mears is well placed to benefit as the market evolves. We have 
concluded the restructuring of our Care business, exiting 
those contracts where low pricing, lack of longevity and 
uncertainty of spend did not allow us to deliver a high quality 
service at sustainable margins. We will continue to be highly 
selective going forward.
Looking ahead, we need to communicate more clearly the 
fundamental role played by Care within our Housing business. 
To understand the link between Housing and Care, one 
needs to understand the demographics of our social housing 
customers. Almost half of social housing is occupied by 
a single resident, with a very high proportion of people aged 65 
or older. In addition, where single residents are below 65 years 
old, there is a disproportionately high number of people who are 
disabled and/or living with multiple conditions that require 
care support. Almost one quarter of social housing is occupied 
by two people; however, a significant proportion of these are 
single parents. Whilst very few contract opportunities have 
our Housing and Care services being tendered together, it is 
vital in Housing that we can show that we have a deep 
understanding of the needs of our service users. This has 
become even more important as we have developed our 
housing management services, where tenancy management 
and care provision are increasingly directly linked. A 
significant proportion of our Housing customers have 
personal challenges and needs, and it is our capability and 
awareness of this which has underpinned our success. 
I envisage that the Group will increasingly focus its Care 
bidding activity towards those clients where there are likely 
to be opportunities to provide a complete Housing service.
We continue to see interest from Local Authorities to procure 
new care accommodation for supported living and extra 
care services which, in the majority of instances, involves 
a combination of funding, build, property management and 
care provision which is seen as a compelling service offering. 
We are currently on site in respect of three such schemes and 
there is a good pipeline developing. 
Our dedication to providing our clients with first class service 
and value remains undiminished and is key to how we manage 
the business. Our unique strategy leaves us better placed 
than ever to achieve long-term success.
“  We have developed a 
broader service offering to 
meet our clients’ needs. ”
We need to communicate more  
clearly the fundamental role played  
by Care within our Housing business

What’s next?
How have you performed against 
your strategic priorities? 
We have continued to grow our broader housing expertise, 
with Mears playing an ever increasing role in helping clients 
shape their placemaking plans. Our established repairs and 
maintenance capability delivers market-leading service 
levels and has been complemented by our growing range of 
services housing management that help address the rising 
homelessness issues that exist. We have also been asked, by 
a growing number of clients, to build affordable housing, 
given our extensive knowledge as to how to create homes 
that are then efficient to repair and maintain on an ongoing 
basis. Our Care division has, as forecast, improved its 
performance, returning to profitability, and has been put on a 
more sustainable footing. It is also pleasing to see increasing 
joint working across Care and Housing to facilitate the 
provision and management of more specialist housing, 
reflecting the changing demographics in the UK. We would 
have liked to have secured more repairs and maintenance 
work in the year , but we have not compromised our position 
and only bid for work where we are confident that our service 
standards can be achieved, at a sustainable pricing level. We 
will not make the mistakes that some of our competitors 
have made.
Where do you see the opportunities going forward?
We see growth in both the housing and care sectors, as 
both central and local Government funding increases in 
these areas (see Market Report on page 12). Importantly 
our broader range of Housing services will enable us to 
bid for the size of contract that would have previously 
been out of our reach. These are very large opportunities 
that will come to market in 2018 and 2019. Shortages 
of affordable housing will continue to mean significant 
opportunity for our housing management division, in the 
short, medium and long term. Mears has quickly become 
market leader in this field.
 How have you changed the structure of Mears to 
reflect the broader range of solutions for clients?
We continue to invest in a strong Housing and Care leadership 
team. Significant additional resource has been brought 
into housing management, given the growth here. We 
have, however, created simple, relatively flat structures, 
focusing on ensuring good teamwork across the Group. 
It was pleasing to see the results of our employee survey 
at the end of 2017, to which 83% of staff responded and 
which illustrated a growing recognition across the Group 
of the improvements that have been made in communication, 
team working and training and development. This result is 
in no small part down to the structure of the organisation 
and the quality of leadership. This is not an area where we 
can afford to stand still and we expect to make further 
improvements in 2018.
Sustainability and corporate social responsibility 
have always been an important part of the Mears 
ethos; do you see that continuing?
We are very proud of our achievements made in this area 
and our commitment to this will not change. Please read 
how we delivered social value in 2017 on pages 41 to 47. 
We were also pleased to get a very high rating against the 
FTSE4Good Index, which looked across a range of areas, 
benchmarking our approach to corporate responsibility 
versus our peers. As a national Social Mobility Champion 
and leading employer of apprentices along with our 
commitments to supporting women into the trades 
and promotion of better working terms for care workers, 
I am proud to lead such a great organisation. Importantly, 
these commitments are not only ethically right, they are 
fundamental to our business model.
How is new technology being utilised  
to improve service and efficiency?
We have led the way for many years in using technology to 
enhance both the service and cost efficiency of our Housing 
services. The detail behind every job is captured on our 
housing system, with handheld technology fully utilised 
to communicate, schedule, cost and monitor every job that 
we undertake. We are now testing technology in tenants’ 
housing that will give early warning as to potential repair 
needs, for example for boiler systems and we see further 
opportunities in this space. Within Care we have committed 
to a single system, again backed up by handheld technology , 
that has many of the benefits we see on the housing side. 
As with Housing, we are also using technology in people’s 
homes to help deliver positive care outcomes, including 
tackling increasing issues such as social isolation. Mears, 
of course, remains a people business, but technology helps 
people carry out their work more effectively and enables 
customers to communicate more efficiently. We have also 
created a powerful insight tool that, at a very local level, 
provides data on a range of important criteria, such as 
demographics, housing availability, health and crime, 
all of which can help our decision making throughout 
our operations and our social value work.

meet the challenges of affordable housing 
and social care in the 21st century. This 
includes an increasing role in using our 
broad range of services to create stronger,

placemaking as it is known.
In Housing, we repair and maintain around 14% – 
over 650,000 – of the social homes in the UK, from 
remote rural villages to large inner city estates. Our 
rapidly growing housing management service 
addresses the challenge of homelessness and the 
lack of suitable housing and now manages around 
10,000 homes from Cornwall to Inverness. We have 
also been asked by our clients to support their 
local housebuilding plans and now deliver to this 
requirement as part of our overall placemaking 
strategic approach.
In Care, we provide a comprehensive range of 
homecare and complex care services to over 
15,000 people a year , enabling older and disabled 
people to continue living in their own homes. 
We see increasing integration between our 
Housing and Care services and only see that

Annual report and accounts 2017 Growing demand to tackle homelessness
We see significant opportunity for our housing 
management services, given the chronic 
shortage of affordable housing that is forcing 
councils to spend more than £2m a day on 
temporary accommodation for homeless 
families. Almost 75,000 households are 
currently living in temporary accommodation, 
including bed and breakfasts, hostels and 
private rented accommodation.² 
A steady decline in affordable housing and squeezes 
on household incomes have seen the number of 
households that local authorities have been forced  
to place in temporary accommodation rise by  
50% since 2010.
Under the Homeless Reduction Act (coming  
into force in early 2018), councils will have new 
statutory obligations to develop housing plans  
for all those approaching them – this will mean  
an even bigger demand for our services.

Investment
In the Autumn Budget, the Chancellor 
announced a comprehensive package of new 
reforms to increase housing supply , including 
over £15 billion of additional financial support 
for housebuilding over the next five years and 
planning reforms to ensure more land is 
available for housing.
The Chancellor also set out his aim to build 300,000 
homes annually by the mid-2020s, with £44 billion of 
capital funding to help. Specifically , within repairs 
and maintenance, the Homes and Communities 
Agency forecasts suggest that, in aggregate, major 
repairs spend will increase in the three remaining 
years of the rent reductions up to 2020, at which 
point the rent cap will be removed and further 
investment will be possible.

pressing. The number of people eligible for social  
care will increase by 30% by 2022.
Added to this, forecasts predict there will be more than  
a 20% increase in people aged over 85 by 2028; by 2039,  
the average number of households with people aged  
over 75 is predicted to double.
An increasing number of these people will be living

solution for the vast majority of people.

Two thirds of the NHS £120 billion spend is on older 
people, who account for 62% of all hospital bed days 
and 52% of admissions that involve hospital stays of 
more than seven days.³
There has been a rapid rise in waits for care packages 
at home, up 163% over the past five years and up by 40% 
in the past year alone. The NHS has publically stated 
that increased investment in social care is vital to avoid 
a collapse in the NHS and the amount of pooled funding 
injected from the NHS into social care will increase 
substantially through to 2020 using the Better Care Fund.

Care and Housing 
working together
Care already plays a fundamental role in our housing 
business. We are increasingly seeing integration 
between our Housing and Care contracts, at the 
front line of delivery of service but also in the 
creation of new specialist accommodation, such as 
supported living housing and extra care property. 
Mears combines its skills to build, manage, 
maintain and provide care to specially adapted 
homes for elderly and disabled people to help them 
live independently. These schemes are not new, but 
there is renewed interest as Local Authorities look 
for innovative ways to look after vulnerable people 
and increase their health and wellbeing. As one 
example, in 2017, we started two new extra care 
schemes with more in the pipeline.
Currently, specially adapted units account for just 
0.5% of all housing stock, but this is likely to rise 
and get nearer to other countries such as Australia 
and Canada, which have 5% of their stock in 
specialist accommodation. Growth is already 
happening, as illustrated by the fact that ten years 
ago there were 40,000 extra care units in the UK – 
today there are 73,000, with 8–9,000 units being 
built a year.
As industry expert LaingBuisson says in its 
‘Housing with care’ UK market report 
(published December 2017): 
‘The growth in the older population means that a 
solution is needed for unmet care needs, and the 
solution needs to include coordinated support and 
lifetime security. If we get this right, and following 
the example of countries such as Australia and 
New Zealand, housing with care could provide the 
solution not only to the broken housing market, but 
also allow people to live longer and better as they 
benefit from the wellbeing of independent living. 
This, in turn, will create savings in national health 
and social care expenditure. Where investors and 
developers are concerned, this is a predictable 
market, the demographic change being a clear 
indicator of the likely demand. ’

Investment
After decades of underfunding, there are real  
signs now that the political landscape for social  
care is improving. 
Homecare is likely to be one of the fastest growing areas of 
spending for Local Authorities. Based on current 
commitments made by the UK Government up to 2020, we 
should see the market increasing at a rate of 5% per year. 
There has been concern that increased Local Authority spend 
would not translate into a better market for providers – that 
spending would increase the number of care hours available 
rather than improve pricing, but we are not seeing this borne 
out in practice.
In fact, we have seen our charge rates increase in both 2016 
and 2017 and further rate increases are expected. This makes 
it more viable to provide good quality care and enables us to 
pay good wages to staff.
An additional £2 billion has been promised over the next  
three years from central Government pots, and at a local level 
through ring-fenced council tax increases. The Government 
has also announced that council tax can increase by up to  
6% next year, without the need for a referendum, provided  
that at least 50% of this is spent on social care. It is expected 
that the majority of authorities will go for the maximum 
increase possible.
A Government Green Paper on the future of social care 
funding is expected in summer 2018.

business
Mears Group has been recognised for its 
outstanding environmental, social and 
governance practices by gaining a place  
in the FTSE4Good Index, which placed Mears  
in the top 9% of companies in the index.
FTSE4Good is an initiative run by FTSE to provide an 
independent measure of the environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) practices of companies on its global 
index. It was set up to cater for a growing number of 
investors who want access to a list of companies 
recognised for being involved in socially responsible 
investment (SRI). 
Mears Group has also taken the Inclusive Culture 
Pledge as a visible commitment to the work it already 
does to promote an open and inclusive workplace.
Diversity and inclusion in the workplace was a 
standout story in 2017. Companies are putting 
increased focus on the need for staff at all levels to 
live their values and display inclusive behaviours – 
because it is the right thing to do and because it is 
good for business.
Indeed, we have released new research, uncovered by 
our ‘Tradeswomen into Maintenance’ project, which 
suggests that a strategic national approach is needed to 
boost the numbers of women working in trade roles in 
the housing sector.
The research, which was carried out by the 
Construction Youth Trust on Mears’ behalf, was 
launched at a special event hosted by the Rt. Hon. 
Baroness Smith of Basildon at the House of Lords.
Latest figures produced by the CITB in 2016 revealed 
that, while women make up 13% of the construction 
workforce, when it comes to manual roles only 
1% are female.

Our KPIs are our most important measures to 
monitor our business and to ensure that we are 
on target to deliver our strategic priorities.
Great service delivery
‘Excellent’ service rating
(Housing)
In order for customers to recommend 
us, we must deliver excellent service. We 
randomly conduct around 80,000 
customer surveys per year.
Customer complaints 
(Housing)
Incidents resulting from poor service 
result in a complaint. We are committed 
to dealing with all complaints on an 
individual basis.
Carer churn
(Care)
The carer churn figure is calculated as 
the total number of leavers during the 
year as a proportion of the average carer 
headcount. Carer churn data is only 
available from 2014.
We are delighted that our service 
delivery has remained at the high levels. 
Strong performance will ensure 
competitiveness as we continue to 
be ranked above our peers.
We are committed to providing our 
colleagues with the skills and 
equipment to deliver great service. 
We seek to identify trends in order 
to improve our overall service quality.
There has been some improvement 
in carer churn rates but the levels 
remain unsustainable. We have 
increased carer pay rates across the 
business and focused on those Care 
contracts which provide a better mix of 
longevity , spend certainty and price, 
which allows us to offer carers more 
attractive terms and conditions.

New contract success
(Housing)
Contract success is measured by results 
of tender by contract value. We typically 
tender around £1 billion of new 
opportunities each year. The average 
contract length is around six years. 
In order to achieve our organic growth 
forecasts, we monitor the proportion 
of new contracts secured as a 
proportion of total tendered works.
Order book growth
(Group)
Contracts with our clients are long term. 
Housing contracts average six years and 
Care contracts average around three 
years. We only account for contractually 
secured orders. We anticipate 
particularly active contract bidding in 
2018, but would be satisfied to maintain 
the order book at current levels.
We are disappointed with our poor bidding 
success. A higher proportion of bids were 
in respect of capital works, where our 
conversion rate has always been lower . 
Also, this year , the significant majority of 
bids were with new customers (rather 
than existing relationships) where 
our conversion rate is also historically 
lower. Notwithstanding this, we missed 
out on both our top target bids which 
was disappointing.
The order book has reduced from 
£3.1m to £2.6m. This reflects new orders 
secured of just £350m in a year that the 
Group delivered revenue of £900m. 
Whilst the aggregate order book number is 
important, the detail and the phasing is 
equally important. We are happy with the 
quality of our order book.

Financial KPIs are critical to measuring 
and understanding our financial health.
Financial performance
Revenue growth
(Housing)
Revenue represents the amounts due 
for services provided during the year. 
In order to measure organic growth, we 
deduct incremental revenue arising from 
acquisitions. We believe that organic 
growth gives a better indication of business 
performance, as it is a purer aggregation 
of market growth, success in new contract 
bidding and contract retention.
Operating margin 
(Group)
Operating margin is the KPI used to 
measure and understand the profitability 
of our activities. This KPI is used to 
continually monitor our costs to ensure 
services are being delivered efficiently.
Profit to cash conversion
(Group)
This is a working capital management 
KPI, which remains the cornerstone of 
our business. The key measure is cash 
inflow from operating activities as a 
proportion of EBITDA. Whilst we internally 
target 100%, our external target allows 
some leniency reflecting an increased 
working capital requirement to fund 
organic growth.
Mears Housing revenues are 
predominantly non-discretionary which 
provides protection from significant 
fluctuation. Our Review of Operations 
explains the underperformance in 2017. 
There remains some uncertainty as we 
enter 2018. Whilst we expect a high level 
of new bidding in 2018, this is likely to 
impact on 2019 more than 2018.
As detailed within the Review of 
Operations, the shortfall in Housing 
revenues resulted in both a loss of profit 
and, more significantly, lower overhead 
recovery with operating margins reflecting 
this. Positively Care margins reported 
improvement on the prior year , but given 
that Care represents only a small part of 
the Group, the aggregate margin showed 
a reduction.
As detailed in the Finance Review, Mears 
has seen a shift in sales mix towards 
housing management which impacts 
upon the Group’s ability to advance cash 
flows at the year end. The Group will be 
reporting this measure based on 
average debt moving forward which will 
provide a better reflection of our cash 
performance. Notwithstanding this, the 
Group’s performance fell short of our 
expectations in this area.

Normalised diluted EPS
(Group)
Normalised earnings are stated before

amortisation of acquisition intangibles 
together with an adjustment to reflect a 
full tax charge.
Accident frequency rate
(Group)
Providing our employees with a 
safe working environment remains 
paramount. Our accident frequency rate 
(AFR) is calculated as the number 
of reportable incidents (by both 
employees, service users and third 
parties) divided by the number of 
hours worked, multiplied by 100,000.
Our headline EPS reduced by 8%, 
mirroring the reduction in profits. 
The EPS of 28.05p sits at a similar 
level to that delivered in 2013 which 
highlights the lack of progress, from 
a financial perspective, in recent years.
We are proud of our record in this area 
and we continue to invest in our health 
and safety training, which is delivered 
through our in-house registered training 
provider . We place emphasis upon all 
accidents and near misses, however 
trivial, being reported and properly 
captured, which naturally impacts 
negatively on this measure. Much of 
this increase relates to an improved 
reporting regime.

Annual report and accounts 2017 The Senior Management Team
The Senior Management Team reviews and identifies the 
key risks which may impact upon the achievement of the 
Group’s strategic goals and will consider how these risks 
are developing with changes in the operations, markets 
and the regulatory environment. 
The nature of the risk is reviewed, including the possible 
triggering events and the aggregated impacts, before setting 
appropriate mitigation strategies directed at the causes and 
consequences of each risk. The risk is assessed in relation 
to the likelihood of occurrence and the potential impact of the 
risk upon the business, and assessed against a matrix scoring 
system which is then used to escalate risks within the Group 
as appropriate. The Senior Management Team 
has responsibility for managing the Group’s key risks.
The Board
The Board has overall responsibility for determining the  
nature and extent of risk it is willing to accept within the  
agreed strategy, and ensuring that risks are managed 
effectively across the Group.
Risk is a regular agenda item at Board meetings and  
is closely aligned to strategy review.
The Board also reviews reports on the effectiveness of the 
systems and processes of risk management and internal control.
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee monitors the Group’s key risks identified 
by the risk assessment processes and reports findings to the 
Board. It also has delegated responsibility for reviewing in 
detail the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
control policies and procedures for the identification, 
assessment and reporting of risk.
Compliance Committee
Created in 2017 as a sub-committee of the Audit Committee. 
The purpose of this Committee is to continue to increase the 
Board’s focus on health and safety strategy, performance and 
related risk management and provide a closer link between 
the Board and the operations.
Risk management function
The Group risk function, headed by the Group’s Chief Risk Officer , 
supports the risk management process by providing guidance 
and support to management. Group risk also acts as the central 
point for the coordination and initial review of risk assessment 
and risk monitoring procedures. T o ensure our risk management 
process continues to drive improvement, the Group risk function 
monitors the ongoing status and progress of mitigation plans 
on a quarterly basis.
The Group outsources elements of internal audit and  
cyber-security to external advisers.
The control environment is underpinned by a detailed scheme 
of delegated responsibilities that defines processes and 
procedures for the approval process in respect of decision 
making. This ensures that decisions within the organisation 
are made by the appropriate level of management.
Risk management approach
The Group’s approach to risk management is targeted towards 
early identification of risks and mitigation of those risks 
to reduce their likelihood and impact.
The Group is committed to protection of its assets through an 
effective risk management process, supported by insurance 
where appropriate. Examples of assets within scope include 
human, intellectual, physical property and financial resources.
Reporting within the Group is structured so that key issues can 
be escalated rapidly through the management team to the 
Board where appropriate. Risks are continually monitored, 
contingency plans are provided and this information is 
reported through established procedures. There is extensive 
fieldwork undertaken by risk auditors incorporating systems 
review, branch visits and cross-business surveillance.
The internal control approach is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure and thus can only provide 
a reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
Health, safety and 
environmental risks 
are embedded in the 
governance structures 
of the Group

Mears Group PLC
Annual report and accounts 2017 Risk management and principal risks continued
Risk management process
The responsibility for risk identification, analysis,  
evaluation and mitigation rests with the line management  
of the businesses. They are also responsible for reporting  
and monitoring key risks in accordance with established 
processes under the Group operational policies.
Identified risks are documented in risk registers showing: 
the risks that have been identified; characteristics of the  
risks; consequences of the risks; the basis for determining  
the mitigation strategy; and what reviews and monitoring 
are necessary. The person(s) accountable for assessing 
and monitoring each risk is noted.
We continue to drive improvements in our risk management 
process. We also review our business model, core markets and 
business processes to ensure that we have properly identified 
all risks. We continually review our mitigating actions to 
ensure that they are sufficient to minimise our residual risk.
Key financial and non-financial risks identified by the business 
from the risk assessment processes are collated and reviewed 
by the Audit Committee. The financial and non-financial risk 
registers are reviewed to monitor the status and progression 
of mitigation plans; the key risks are reported to the Board 
on a regular basis. 
Principal risks
The Board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group, including those that threaten the business 
model, strategy, future performance, solvency and liquidity. 
Risks have been identified as ‘principal’ based on the likelihood 
of occurrence and the severity of the impact on the Group,  
and have been identified through the application of policies  
and processes previously outlined.
The Board is keen to simplify the reporting of risks, to ensure 
the risks disclosed to shareholders are those that are considered 
as business critical or potentially catastrophic. Therefore no 
additional risks have been disclosed in this Annual Report. These 
business-as-usual risks are monitored by divisional management.
Prioritising our risks
The Group’s risk register rates risks on 
a matrix scoring system based on their 
likelihood and impact, i.e. potential 
severity. This severity can be measured 
using life and limb, financial, customer 
service, growth, regulatory compliance 
and reputational criteria. Therefore, 
Mears measures more than simply  
the financial impact of the risk. These 
scores are used to escalate risks and  
to drive the mitigation plans.

below, together with how we mitigate those risks.
Key risk movements
Each principal risk is considered in the context of how it relates to the achievement of the Group’s strategic objectives. 
The risk discussion includes assessment of gross risk and net risk. Gross risk reflects the exposure and risk landscape before 
considering the mitigations in place, with net risk being the residual risk after mitigations. The gross risk movement from the 
prior year for each principal risk has been assessed and is presented below:
Mitigations in place supporting the management of the risk to a net risk position are also described for each principal risk.
Reputation No change
Definition Mitigation
We recognise that significant commercial 
value is attributable to the Mears brand.
Poor service delivery would damage our 
reputation. Both our Housing and Care 
markets are close-knit communities 
where examples of poor performance 
are quickly communicated widely.
Furthermore, in Care we deliver 
services to people who are elderly and 
vulnerable. A service delivery failure 
within our Care division could result in 
the physical harm or , in the most extreme 
cases, death of a service user.
In the environment of caring for vulnerable 
people, there is a risk of isolated incidents 
of abuse and neglect which rightly 
receive significant press coverage with 
the inevitable reputational damage.

Mears Group PLC
Annual report and accounts 2017 Viability statement
The Group has a broad spread of customers – our 
largest client constitutes 7% of Group revenues 
which, while significant, would, in the event of its 
loss, not impact on the Group’s wider viability.
Business planning and financial viability
In accordance with C.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2014, the Directors have assessed the viability of the 
Group over a five-year period. A period of five years has been 
chosen as it broadly reflects the average contract length. 
Whilst the Group holds contracts which extend beyond this 
time horizon, a period of greater than five years is considered 
too long, given the inherent uncertainties involved.
The Board considered its key risks. The principal risks are set 
out on pages 25 and 26 and the most relevant of these risks 
to viability were considered to be:
 → a service delivery failure, possibly resulting in the death 
or harm of a service user, with significant negative publicity 
and long-term reputational damage;
 → deterioration in carer churn rates and poor recruitment 
practices resulting in a material reduction in carer 
numbers, sales volumes and profitability;
 → a health and safety failure resulting in serious personal injury 
or death of an employee or service user , leading to significant 
financial penalties and significant reputational damage; and
 → a failure in our IT systems, impacting upon our ability 
to deliver our services. We provide services to vulnerable 
people and even a short period of downtime could cause 
severe reputational damage. A serious system failure could 
have significant impact on invoicing our customers and 
collecting cash.
A financial model has been built on a contract-by-contract 
basis for the next twelve months and extended on a business-
by-business basis for the following four years. The five-year 
plan considers cash flows as well as financial covenants. 
Consideration was given to a number of key assumptions, 
namely future revenue growth, operating margins and working 
capital management. The assumptions set were considered 
conservative given the focus of the model is in respect of 
underperformance. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to 
stress test the resilience of the Group and its business model 
to the potential impact of the Group’s principal risks, or a 
combination of those risks. The Board overlaid the potential 
impact of the principal risks which could affect solvency or 
liquidity in ‘severe but plausible’ scenarios.
Two scenarios were modelled. The first scenario assumed 
a significant business failure within the Housing division. 
The model assumed a 6% per annum compound reduction 
in revenues for each year within the five-year plan, a total 
reduction of 23%. This was combined with a 1% deterioration 
in Housing gross margin which, when combined with an 
under-recovery in central support overheads, resulted in 
a reduction in Group net profit margin from 4.1% to 2.9% 
in year five of the model. 
The second scenario assumed a similar failure within the 
Care division. The model assumed a 15% per annum compound 
reduction in revenues for each year within the five-year plan,  
a total reduction of 56%. This was combined with a 2% 
deterioration in Care gross margin which resulted in a Care 
operating loss of £4.2m in year five of the model but no 
reduction in Group net profit margin due to the reducing 
materiality of Care in this scenario.
Both scenarios showed that the Group would remain viable 
even in the event of a severe business failure over an extended 
period. No mitigating actions were included within either scenario, 
which was considered conservative albeit not realistic.
Whilst the Group’s continuing operations are based in the UK, 
the large network of branches does reduce the risk of serious 
business interruption. In addition, the Group has a broad 
spread of customers – our largest client constitutes circa 7% of 
Group revenues which, while significant, would, in the event of 
its loss, not impact on the Group’s wider viability . 
The Board has recently completed an ‘amend and extend’ of the 
Group’s revolving credit facility, which now runs to November 
2022. The Board has considered the Group’s ability to renew 
the existing debt facilities in November 2022 and is confident 
that replacement sources of funding will be available at 
that time.
The Board also considered the impact of Brexit on the business 
and does not envisage any significant negative effect impacting 
on the Group’s viability for the period under review.
The Board is mindful that there has been a significant increase in 
the fines that can be levied upon companies for non-compliance in 
areas such as health and safety and data protection. Fines are 
discretionary based on the nature, gravity and culpability of 
the company but fines are applied based upon a percentage of 
group revenue. In a low margin business such as Mears, any 
single fine could have a significant and disproportionate impact 
upon retained profits. The Board took the view, however , that, 
whilst such an event could be damaging, it would not ultimately 
impact on the long-term viability of the Group. Both health 
and safety and IT and data feature high on the Group’s risk 
register and we continually review our mitigating actions 
to ensure that we minimise our residual risk.
The Board accepts that, particularly in an increasingly volatile 
macro-economic environment, uncertainty of results 
increases as the projections extend out over a five-year period. 
However, the Board concluded that there is a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will continue in operation and will 
be able to continue to meet liabilities as they fall due over 
the five-year period assessed.

Annual report and accounts 2017 Review of operations
The Board is mindful that many of the readers of our 
Annual Report are focused particularly on the financial 
performance of the individual divisions and the wider 
Group. This Review of operations will naturally address 
this. We are aware that a number of the financial 
results delivered in 2017 were below our high standards. 
However, of equal importance to our business is 
the quality of our operations and the progress made 
in positioning the business for future long-term 
opportunities. In this regard, the Board is pleased with 
the progress made last year in both divisions and it is 
this that will, over the longer term, underpin stronger 
financial performance and future success.
Meeting future 
challenges 
Our people remain our greatest asset. Their skills, 
knowledge and dedication continue to drive 
our business forward and place Mears in 
a unique position.
Our apprenticeship scheme, run from our national training 
academy in Rotherham, aims to ensure we continue to 
have the right level of skills for the business to meet 
future challenges. 
Currently, we have 730 apprentices across the Group.  
In 2017, our Care business recruited 385 apprentices, 
with a further 79 apprentices recruited in the rest of  
the business in addition to the 266 apprentices  
already employed.
We also have a further 38 employees pursuing 
apprenticeships; 13 senior managers pursuing Level 5 
Operations Management apprenticeships; and 23 managers 
pursuing Level 3 Team Leader apprenticeships.
Mears through its dedicated training arm, is now 
delivering a wide range of apprenticeships which 
include plumbing, gas, multi-trade, carpentry 
and plastering.
Mears is an accredited training provider , currently 
training five apprentices from other companies in 
the South Yorkshire area, and has a contract with 
Rotherham College to deliver adult programmes, 
including introduction into construction, 
Construction Skills Certification Scheme 
(CSCS) cards, and help with employability 
skills – our success rate for getting our 
attendees into employment is currently 80%.
We are aware that the financial outputs delivered 
in 2017 were below our high standards. However, 
of equal importance, is the quality of our operations 
and the progress made in positioning the business 
for future long-term opportunities. In this regard, 
the Board is pleased with the progress made.

Mears Group PLC
Annual report and accounts 2017 We are increasingly involved in managing 
properties in a more holistic fashion over  
and above simply scheduling and delivering 
maintenance and repairs. We are often being 
asked by clients and other stakeholders to 
have greater involvement in helping them 
deliver appropriate housing outcomes for 
a range of tenants.
Housing revenues have historically been analysed between the reactive 
and planned nature of housing maintenance, whilst separately disclosing 
Housing Management activity. This allocation has become less relevant 
as we have broadened our service offering and we are increasingly providing a 
full asset management service. This evolution in our focus is extending our 
activities to all rented housing, in line with our clients’ and the wider 
community’s needs.

The financial performance of the Housing division has been disappointing but 
there is merit in reviewing the results between the first half and the second 
half year of the year. The first half of 2017 reported both revenues and 
margins increasing from the comparative period in 2016, primarily driven 
by the full-year impact of the previous year’s new contract mobilisations. 
Mears Housing revenues are predominantly non-discretionary, which 
provides the Group with protection from significant workload fluctuation. 
This is underpinned by an individual tenant’s right to repair, which places 
an obligation on our Registered Provider clients and removes their ability 
to defer spend on essential maintenance. Certain planned maintenance 
expenditure, whilst non-discretionary , does provide clients with scope to 
defer spending over the short term. Historically, around 15% of Housing 
revenues are of a discretionary nature, providing clients with an ability to 
extend that spending spends over a longer time horizon.

Mears Group PLC
Annual report and accounts 2017 The tragic event at Grenfell Tower impacted upon 
second half year activity with reported revenues 
9% lower versus the first half. This terrible event 
affected the timing of our planned maintenance 
workloads as clients’ attentions have naturally 
been diverted towards ensuring that their housing 
portfolios are safe and fully compliant. This was 
highlighted in our half-year statement and we saw 
this trend continue throughout the second half 
year. In addition, the Group had a particularly slow 
period in securing new work opportunities which 
one would typically have expected to have gone 
some way to making up the revenue shortfall. 
The division reported full-year revenues 
of £766.1m (2016: £787.5m), a reduction of 3%. 
The shortfall in revenues resulted in both a 
reduction in gross profit and, more significantly, 
lower overhead recovery, with operating margins 
reflecting this dilution at 5.2% (2016: 5.6%).
Case study
High quality, 
affordable and 
efficient new homes
A £7m development of 34 new homes on the outskirts 
of Milton Keynes is one of the latest projects by Mears 
New Homes for client Lea Valley Homes, a subsidiary 
of Aldwyck Housing Group.
Mears, which first developed this capability in 2014, has built a 
strong portfolio of work across the South of England and is now 
expanding across the country .
We blend contemporary design and sustainable materials 
to build unique and attractive homes for rent and sale, 
combined with our extensive experience in the repairs 
and maintenance sector, we have the insight to ensure 
that the homes we build are high quality, affordable 
and energy efficient.
The Gables is an exclusive development of mixed 
tenure, with houses for sale, rent and shared 
ownership, and is due for completion in 2018.
Once appointed to the site in Milton Keynes, we worked 
with the Lea Valley team to ‘value engineer’ the 
scheme design, including the use of an innovative 
foundation system to reduce the cost in the ground, 
as well as a timber frame system to reduce the 
construction period.
Across this design engineering process, 
we were able to make savings of £625,000 for the client.
Our Housing strategy
We have maintained a consistent strategy across Housing over a long period,  
while developing a broader footprint of services to reflect client need:
Focus on delivering a high 
level of customer service 
We have continued to 
maintain high levels of 
customer satisfaction. 
92% of tenants regard our 
services as excellent.
Drive innovation to provide 
better outcomes for tenants
In 2017, we have continued to 
grow our housing management 
services and to support greater 
integration. We have secured 
our first contract to fund, build, 
manage, maintain and provide 
care into an Extra Care scheme. 
We have developed innovative 
technological solutions which 
deliver better service and 
operational outcomes. 
We lead the market on our 
approach to social value.
Evolve the breadth and depth 
of our service offering
We have, over recent years, 
extended our Housing service 
from our original maintenance 
offering to a full maintenance, 
regeneration and housing 
management capability. 
This is enabling us to bid for 
opportunities of a scale and 
breadth that would previously 
have been impossible.
Focus on building sustainable, 
long-term partnerships
Our broader service offering 
is enabling us to generate 
multiple revenue streams 
from single client relationships. 
For example, in the case of our 
Milton Keynes partnership, we 
are providing maintenance 
and care services, as well as 
providing temporary housing 
solutions whilst developing 
new homes. We are now 
supporting the development 
of a £1 billion regeneration 
program across the area.

Mears Group PLC
Annual report and accounts 2017 The Housing division has historically sourced new 
contract opportunities through a competitive 
public procurement tender process. Mears has 
always been highly selective and maintains a 
disciplined approach to bidding new contract 
opportunities. Mears typically tenders for contracts 
with a value of between £1 billion to £1.5 billion 
each year. A bid conversion rate (by value) of around 
33% has been consistently achieved, although 
within that blended measure there are other 
factors such as the proportion of reactive versus 
planned maintenance, and whether the opportunity 
is with an existing or new customer relationship. 
Mears secured new contracts of £150m in the year , 
representing a contract win rate on competitively 
tendered works of 16% (by value) (2016: £250m 
and 39%). This is our lowest bid conversion rate for 
many years and was partly driven by the mix of the 
bidding opportunities being skewed towards works 
of a capital nature and a high number of 
opportunities coming from new client relationships. 
Notwithstanding this, we are disappointed at 
missing out on a number of key bidding targets 
where we scored well in terms of quality but fell 
short in respect of pricing compared with the 
winning tender. We will not change our bidding 
model which has served us well over many years. 
We have always tried to make decisions based on a 
longer time horizon and not short-term opportunism.

One Mears –  
housing with  
care solutions
Construction started in 2017 on two extra 
care housing schemes – in Northampton 
and Bolton – which sees Mears combine its 
services to provide innovative solutions to 
housing and care for Local Authority clients. 
Extra care housing schemes offer positive 
lifestyle choices for older and disabled people 
by providing affordable, specially adapted 
properties with care and amenities on site. 
Invest in the workforce 
to ensure that it is both 
motivated and well trained
The exceptional response to 
our employee survey in 2017, 
illustrates the progress we 
have made, as does the record 
number of apprenticeships and 
growing external recognition for 
our work in championing care 
worker pay and conditions and 
promoting more opportunities 
for women in the trades.
Primarily focus upon  
organic growth
Our priority remains 
organic growth but will 
consider acquisitions 
that reinforce our 
leadership position.
Offering positive lifestyle choices 
for older and disabled people 
In Northampton, Mears will manage and provide 
care to Balmoral Place, a development of 
80 one-bedroom self contained apartments 
to people over the age of 55 who want to live 
independently with personalised care designed 
for their needs, with the added benefits of on-site 
services in a safe, secure and vibrant community.
The scheme will be delivered in partnership 
with developer HB Villages and is set to open 
in October 2018.
In Bolton, Mears is building, managing and 
maintaining a new scheme called The Hollies – 
offering 16 one-bedroom apartments and an 
eight-bed scheme for people with learning 
disabilities, with personalised care provided 
on site 24/7.
Both schemes are great examples of how Mears 
is helping to transform the way housing and care 
is delivered.

Milton Keynes 
£1 billion 
regeneration
YourMK – a partnership set up in 2016 between 
Mears Group and Milton Keynes Council – 
announced its timetable for a £1 billion 
regeneration of Milton Keynes.
The 15-year plan will affect 8,500 homes and 20,000 
residents across seven housing estates – Netherfield, 
Coffee Hall, Tinkers Bridge, North Bradville, 
Fullers Slade, the Lakes and Beanhill.
Already, YourMK is responsible for the repairs and 
maintenance of 11,500 council homes and the next 
stage is set for regeneration.
A stock condition survey – carried out between 
September 2016 and April 2017 – showed that, 
on the whole, the condition of council-owned 
homes in Milton Keynes is poor.
Milton Keynes, like many other towns and cities 
across the UK, has a severe housing shortage, 
and many more homes are needed.
Regeneration is not just about bricks and mortar but 
about making positive and long-lasting changes that 
will improve people’s lives. YourMK is doing this 
not only by improving homes and neighbourhoods, 
but also by providing opportunities for people to 
get jobs and training through our job clubs, and by 
encouraging and supporting the involvement 
of local people and groups in their community .
Regeneration is about people and opportunities 
as well as building and maintaining their homes.

Annual report and accounts 2017 Care
The return to profitability is a clear  
positive for the Care division in the year. 
The Care division secured solid charge rate increases from existing 
contracts through the annual price review, and also enjoyed improved 
pricing when securing new contract opportunities. These increases have 
broadly matched the increases in the cost base, driven by an increase 
in the National Living Wage and introduction of the Apprenticeship Levy. 
The division reported a small loss for the first half year, however, in line 
with our expectations, improved performance in the second half delivered 
a profit for the full year of £0.5m (2016: loss £1.2m), implying an operating 
margin for the second half of 2.3%. 
We are confident that we can deliver further margin improvement in 
2018. We are looking to achieve this through maintaining a high level of 
selectivity on bidding new works, further operational improvements 
and support function efficiencies flowing from improved processes.

Annual report and accounts 2017 Review of operations continued
Care continued
We continue to place significant emphasis on maintaining a 
portfolio of contracts that can provide clear and sustainable 
margins. We completed a significant restructuring in 2016, 
which saw a reduction of around 20% of our branches, 
primarily in the North of England where a number of care 
commissioners were unwilling to recognise the underlying  
cost of delivering care. During the first half of 2017, we revisited 
our previous assessment, exiting additional contracts 
predominantly in the Midlands and London region, covering a 
further 7% of revenues. The restructuring is now complete and 
our remaining Care contracts have a much improved mix of 
longevity , certainty of spend and price, with very few branches that 
are not now delivering a profit contribution. Revenues for the 
Care division were £134.1m (2016: £152.6m), a reduction of 
12% reflecting this planned rebalancing of the Care 
contract portfolio. 
A summary of the changing volumes and charge rates as a result 
of the restructuring of our Care activities is detailed below.  
This reflects excellent progress, with the blended charge 
rate increasing by 8% across the Care portfolio driven by 
contractual uplifts and an improving sales mix.

Net volume decrease (22,200) 
As at 31 December 2017 139,200 117.9 16.29
Whilst we have become increasingly selective in new contract 
bidding, it is pleasing that there continues to be a solid pipeline 
of good quality bidding opportunities. During the year, we 
secured £140m of new contracts at a win rate of 59% by value 
(2016: £200m and 74%). More importantly, the quality of the 
new orders secured continues to improve, together with a 
significantly higher charge rate which enables us to reflect  
this within our carer pay and conditions. The average contract 
lengths of these latest awards is approaching five years and 
the number of providers has reduced significantly; this 
reflects the trends we anticipated and should, in the future, 
result in a better quality of earnings from our Care activities. 
It is envisaged that the Group will increasingly focus its Care 
bidding activity towards those clients where there are likely 
to be opportunities to provide a complete housing service, 
with less focus on those opportunities which provide 
singular care services in isolation.
The main limitation to achieving growth in Care and to 
delivering a consistent, good quality service remains the 
sourcing and retention of sufficient care workers of good 
quality. Whilst we have experienced some improvement in 
carer turnover during the year, with attrition rates reducing 
from 44% to 42%, this still remains at an unsustainable level. 
We remain committed to driving improvement to the terms 
and conditions of care workers, including better financial 
rewards and incentives and a more formalised career pathway .
Our Care strategy
We have refocused our care work on partnerships which complement  
our housing work and are priced at sustainable levels:
Focus on delivering a high 
level of customer service 
We hold the Government 
backed Customer Service 
Excellence accreditation 
for our Care division, which 
adds to our existing 
accreditation for Housing 
services. We have achieved 
the first Outstanding rating 
for one of our care operations.
Drive innovation to provide 
better outcomes for tenants
We have developed and 
tested innovative mobile 
digital technology that enables 
better support planning and 
more reliable information 
capture and audit.
Evolve the breadth and depth 
of our service offering
We are winning more work 
that combines our skills in 
housing with those in care. 
Indeed our care capability 
is a fundamental to some 
of the largest opportunities 
the Group is now bidding for .
Focus on building sustainable, 
long-term partnerships
We are increasingly selective 
in bidding for new contract 
opportunities. We are securing 
better quality orders with 
higher charge rates and 
increased longevity. These 
contracts are secured at rates 
which allow us to recruit a 
workforce delivering high 
quality care.

 → The Group has historically followed a strict and 
disciplined approach to keeping capital expenditure 
low and, linked to this, a conservative debt structure. 
This principle still holds. However, on occasions 
it should be recognised that opportunities 
can often be more easily facilitated through 
utilising a small amount of leverage.
 → The efficiency with which the Group manages

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
(effective in 2018) and IFRS16 Leases (effective in 
2019) are both expected to have a material impact 
on the financial statements of the Group.
 → Mears does not engage in inappropriate 
tax planning arrangements. The Group takes 
advantage of available tax reliefs and any 
tax planning is consistent with the spirit 
as well as the letter of tax law.
This section provides further key information in 
respect of the financial performance and financial 
position of the Group to the extent not already 
covered within the Review of operations.
Acquisitions
Having been relatively acquisitive over a number of years, 
this was the second consecutive year of no acquisitions. 
The primary focus for the business is organic growth however 
we regularly consider potential bolt-on acquisitions to our 
Housing business, where they could enhance our existing 
service capabilities.
Contingent consideration of £5.0m was paid during the 
year relating to the previous acquisition of Omega. A further 
payment of £11.1m has been paid in the early part of 2018 
which has now settled all outstanding deferred and 
contingent consideration.
Property acquisition funding
As Mears has broadened its services, an increasingly 
important component of our offering has been to identify 
funding solutions to sit beside our housing maintenance and 
management solutions. An early example of this was our 
contract with the London Borough of Bromley , with Mears 
engaged to arrange the purchase and refurbishment of 400 
homes from private ownership whilst identifying a long-term 
funding partner . Since then, Mears has developed a pipeline of 
similar opportunities and expects several of these to complete 
in the coming year.
The Group has historically followed a strict and disciplined 
approach to keeping capital expenditure low and, linked to 
this, a conservative debt structure. This principle still holds. 
However , on occasions it should be recognised that opportunities 
can often be more easily facilitated through utilising a small 
amount of leverage to acquire and build portfolios of properties. 
The period for carrying property assets on the balance sheet 
will typically be a few weeks, extending to perhaps six months

Annual report and accounts 2017 on rare occasions, prior to their disposal to a long-term funding 
partner. To support this activity, the Group has put in place 
a £30m revolving credit facility for an initial two-year term. 
At 31 December 2017, £13.9m of this funding line had been 
drawn with the associated asset disclosed within assets 
held for resale.
Discontinued activities
In 2013, the Group completed the disposal of its Mechanical 
and Electrical division, which included an entity operating in 
the United Arab Emirates (UAE). As part of that disposal, the 
Group ultimately retained a beneficial interest of 1% of the 
share capital of this UAE company due to the Group still 
carrying a number of performance guarantees, which unwind 
as the underlying contracts reach the end of their defects 
liability period.
At 31 December 2016, a balance of £3.4m was due from the 
UAE entity to the Group, together with outstanding performance 
guarantees of £13.7m. Disappointingly, a number of those 
performance guarantees have been called and the Group was 
required to settle funds against those contingent liabilities. 
This resulted in a cash outflow during the year of £9.4m. 
Mears has taken legal advice and believes there is a realistic 
expectation that these funds will be recovered in due course. 
However given the inherent uncertainty, a full provision has 
been made in respect of this as an exceptional item within the 
2017 results. The exceptional item of £16.5m includes full 
provision against all outstanding performance guarantees.
Amortisation of acquisition intangibles
A charge for amortisation of acquisition intangibles of £10.6m 
(2016: £10.7m) arose in the year. This charge relates to a 
number of acquisitions in both Housing and Care over recent 
years. The remaining unamortised value of £9.6m (2016: £19.8m), 
relating to order book and customer relationships, will be written 
off over their estimated lives.
Net finance charge
A net finance charge of £2.0m has been recognised in the year 
(2016: £1.8m). The finance cost in respect of bank borrowings 
was £2.7m (2016: £2.8m), reflecting a lower blended interest 
rate on the Group’s interest rate hedging arrangement.
The Group held two interest rate swaps covering 2017. 
The first fixed a rate of 1.85% on £30.0m of borrowings and 
expires in August 2018. The second, which ran throughout the 
year, fixed a rate of 0.83% on £40.0m of borrowings, expires in 
December 2020. The remaining debt bore a variable LIBOR 
rate. The Group pays a margin of 120–220bps over and above 
LIBOR, subject to a ratchet mechanism.
The net finance costs also includes a net credit generated from 
defined benefit pension accounting of £0.3m (2016: £0.9m).

Tax expense continued
The headline UK corporation tax rate for the year was 19.3% 
(2016: 20.0%). The total tax charge for the year relating to 
continuing operations was £4.3m (2016: £3.7m) resulting in 
an effective total tax rate of 16.3% (2016: 12.5%). The key 
reconciling items to the headline rate were the utilisation 
of brought forward losses relating to previous acquisitions, 
an annual corporation tax deduction in respect of share options 
and adjustments in respect of the prior year estimated tax 
charge. The current tax charge for the year on continuing 
operations was £5.3m (2016: £4.7m), which represents an 
effective tax rate of 20.1% (2016: 16.0%). 
Mears does not engage in inappropriate tax planning 
arrangements. Where appropriate, the Group takes advantage 
of available tax reliefs. The tax position in any transaction 
is aligned with the commercial reality and any tax planning 
undertaken is consistent with the spirit as well as the letter of 
tax law. In situations where material uncertainty exists around 
a given tax position, the Group engages with expert advisers 
and, where appropriate, advance clearance is sought from 
HMRC in order to establish the most appropriate treatment.
We value our low risk assessment from HMRC and will continue 
to work to maintain this status through continual review of 
our controls and processes.

The efficiency with which the Group manages working capital 
remains a cornerstone of our business. The Group’s conversion 
of EBITDA to cash over the last two years has been well below 
target, being 61% (2016: 70%). Whilst our conversion record 
over the previous five years of 95% should provide comfort, 
this result warrants further explanation.
Whilst our year end EBITDA to cash conversion measure has 
historically been reported as a key performance indicator for 
the Group, we have always highlighted the Group’s average 
daily net debt as being of greater importance. The year end 
position is significantly lower than the average net debt, given 
the efforts that the Group makes to maximise its cash balances 
at the year end. In addition, Mears has seen a significant shift in 
its sales mix towards housing management. Whilst the working 
capital required to fund housing management activities is 
typically lower than that required for traditional maintenance 
activities, it provides no scope for advancing cash inflows at 
the year end. Hence, part of the explanation for our lowering 
EBITDA to cash conversion metric over the last two years is 
the unwinding of this effect.
The evolution in strategic focus towards Housing Management 
and Placemaking activities has seen Mears starting to build 
new homes as part of managing the regeneration and delivery 
of affordable housing for clients to support their overall asset 
management plans. Whilst this is an area which provides 
significant opportunity for the Group, we have equally looked 
to keep tight control over the working capital requirement. 
Mears is not a property developer but having good capabilities 
in this area is very positive when linked to our homelessness 
solutions for clients. As at 31 December 2017, the working capital 
invested in new development projects amounted to £10.5m 
(2016: £5.7m). This is expected to peak at £15.0m in June 2018. 
We are developing opportunities in this area that look to 
not require any forward funding, which is our natural 
preference and better fits the Mears’ model.
Our reported net debt position at 31 December 2017 was 
£25.8m (2016: £12.4m). The Group seeks to minimise its trade 
receivables at both its June and December period ends, 
resulting in period end net debt balances which don’t reflect 
the underlying balance sheet position. A far more important 
metric is the Group’s average daily net debt balance. The 
average net debt over the year increased to £96.4m 
(2016: £85.0m), reflecting the lower EBITDA to cash 
Strategic report

Mears Group PLC
Annual report and accounts 2017 conversion due in part to the changing sales mix, and the 
funding of both the deferred consideration on earlier 
acquisitions and the cash outflow arising from the loss on 
discontinued activities. 
As detailed above, the Group has arranged a £30m revolving 
credit facility to fund the purchase of properties before being 
sold onto longer-term funding partners. At 31 December 2017, 
£13.9m of this funding line had been drawn, with the associated 
asset disclosed within assets held for resale. Mears will report 
the net debt balances in respect of this property acquisition 
facility separately from the Group’s operating net debt 
to ensure that this new facility does not mask underlying 
working capital performance. 
During the year, the Group completed an extension to its 
revolving capital facility from July 2020 to November 2022. This 
has been well-timed as we have been surprised by the 
nervousness within the banking community following a number 
of recent corporate failures from entities within the outsourcing 
sector . The Group continues to maintain a strong relationship 
with its bankers.

Goodwill and intangible assets 
The carrying value of identifiable acquisition intangibles at 31 
December 2017 was £9.6m (2016: £19.8m), which 
predominantly relates to order book and customer relationships 
valued on acquisition. The carrying value will be amortised 
over its useful economic life, over half of which will be 
expensed over the next two years.
The carrying value of goodwill of £193.6m (2016: £193.7m) 
is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment on an annual 
basis or more frequently where there is an indication of 
impairment. The headroom between the carrying value of the 
Care asset and anticipated future value that will be delivered 
by the Care division has been low over a number of years. The 
Board has carried out a detailed impairment review and, for 
the second year running, this has shown an increase in the 
headroom which reflects the improvements made in the Care 
business. This is a key area of judgement and remains under 
continual review.
In addition, intangible assets includes the capitalisation of 
expenditure incurred in developing our in-house IT platform. 
Additions in the year amounted to £3.7m (2016: £2.9m) with a 
carrying value of £7.7m (2016: £6.1m), which is amortised over 
five years. Having made significant investment in our 
IT systems over a number of years, we would expect to see a 
reduction in our development expenditure moving forward.
Tangible fixed assets
The Group capital expenditure of £8.1m (2016: £7.4m) relates 
to IT hardware, other office equipment and the refurbishment of 
new office premises. The level of capital expenditure in respect of 
property , plant and equipment in any single year has a close 
correlation to the number of new contracts mobilised in that 
period. The majority of plant utilised by our operational teams 
is subject to short-term hire arrangements and motor vehicles 
are subject to operating leases and hence neither are included 
within capital expenditure or recognised as an asset within 
the balance sheet. Similarly , the Housing Management business 
has a large number of short-term property leases which are 
similarly not carried on the balance sheet. The new accounting 
standard IFRS 16 Leases will impact upon this treatment and 
is discussed in greater detail below.
Current assets and current liabilities
Trade receivables and inventories increased to £172.6m 
(2016: £168.4m) and trade payables reported a reduction 
to £178.3m (2016: £186.6m), both reflecting the changing 
sales mix and the associated impact on cash and net debt 
detailed above.
As detailed above, the Group secured a property acquisition 
credit facility of £30m to acquire and build portfolios for 
resale. These assets are separately identified on 
the balance sheet as an asset held for resale. 
Pensions
The Group participates in two principal Group pension schemes 
(2016: two) together with a further 28 (2016: 33) individual 
defined benefit schemes where the Group has received Admitted 
Body status in a Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS).
Given recent well publicised corporate failures, there has been 
increased attention given to pensions by a number of our 
stakeholders. It is unfortunate that the accounting standard 
we are required to follow for defined benefit pension schemes 
does not present the commercial reality for a number of our 
LGPS arrangements, where the Group holds back-to-back 
indemnities from its clients in respect of both its exposure to 
changes in pension contribution rates and to future deficit 
risk. For the remaining LGPS arrangements where the Group 
does not benefit from indemnities, the risks attaching to these 
schemes matches the time horizon of the underlying contract 
which, whilst not removing all risks, does reduce the period 
over which a deficit can arise.

the Group has reported an increase in its pension net asset 
from £8.5m to £22.3m.
Guidance for 2018
We are disappointed that our financial results over 
recent years have not met our expectations. Whilst some 
of these adjustments have been outside of the control of 
management, it is frustrating that it has tarnished Mears’ 
strong track record.
Previously, Mears has reported forward revenue visibility 
as a key performance metric. This has been expressed as the 
percentage of secured revenue as a proportion of consensus 
forecast revenues. Typically, consensus forecasts have been 
driven by an expectation that secured revenues at the turn of 
the year represents at least 95% of forecast revenue for the 
forthcoming year. Due to the evolving nature of our business, 
secured revenue over recent years has been found to be a less 
robust metric than it was historically . This became increasingly 
evident following the challenges encountered in 2017, where 
secured revenues reduced over the course of the year . The Board 
has reassessed how we guide the market and, going forward, 
we will set our expectations for the next twelve months in line 
with our ‘firm and probable order book’ , providing market 
updates to those expectations when new orders are secured 
whilst also giving us an increased ability to absorb unforeseen 
challenges. The ‘firm and probable order book’ for 2018 
currently stands at £900m. This change to a more conservative 
approach is particularly relevant given the shape of the 
Group’s bid pipeline, which includes two opportunities that  
are bigger in scale but harder to forecast given the binary 
nature of the possible outcomes. 
Changes to accounting standards
A new accounting standard, IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers, becomes effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2018. The implementation of IFRS 15 can 
impact on the timing of recognising revenue and costs in 
respect of long-term contracts. The Group has completed its 
review of the impact of this new standard across all contracts. 
In the case of the large majority of our contracts, the 
accounting methodology will be unchanged. 
Mears does not capitalise mobilisation costs and typically looks 
to recognise revenue and cost at the individual works order 
level, whether that be a singular maintenance order or care 
visit. This ensures that the valuation of working capital balances 
is straightforward and contains few areas for judgement.
However, there are a small number of occurrences where the 
Group has accounted for multiple service contracts by treating 
them as a single supply of a service. This has been the case 
where there is a mismatch between the works being delivered 
and the payment mechanism for reimbursement. The new 
accounting standard will require Mears to now identify the 
distinct services provided within a multiple service contract 
and to allocate a stand-alone selling price against each of 
those services. The impact of this change in 2018 will see a 
reduction in opening reserves in the range of £13m to £20m.
The change to IFRS 15 has no impact on the lifetime 
profitability of the contracts and there are no cash flow 
impacts, although the change will drive further alignment 
between the timing of profit recognition and its associated 
cash flow. Moving forward, we would expect the change to 
have a positive impact in respect of operating profit for  
2018 through to 2027 as the reserves adjustment unwinds. 
In respect of more complex contracts, where Mears may be 
required at times to forward fund some initial work streams, 
the underlying contractual arrangements will need to be 
structured to be in line with the new accounting treatment.
A second new accounting standard, IFRS 16 Leases, becomes 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2019. It is not currently Mears’ intention to adopt this standard 
early, however it is likely to be very material to the Group, and 
as such, stakeholders will be kept informed as the impact 
becomes clear. The new standard aligns the treatment of 
operating leases and finance leases and will require Mears  
to recognise all leases on the balance sheet which will reflect 
the right to use an asset for a period of time, together with its 
associated liability. Given that Mears currently has operating 
leases in respect of 3,200 vehicles (with an average lease term 
of 4.5 years) and 5,000 properties (with an average lease term 
of 2.5 years), this is a significant change. The expected 
balance sheet impact will increase assets and liabilities in the 
range of £80m to £140m. In terms of the income statement, 
EBITDA will increase but we anticipate a neutral impact at a 
PBT level given that the reduction in administrative expenses 
is expected to broadly match the increase in depreciation and 
financing costs.
The Group has historically followed a strict and disciplined 
approach to keep capital expenditure low and, linked to this,  
a conservative debt structure. Whilst this core principle is still 
central to the Group’s philosophy, the changes to operating 
lease accounting does potentially reduce the attractiveness  
of leasing. On a positive note, the increased transparency  
over leases may drive more economic lease decisions and 
so deliver cost savings. 
IFRS 16 will affect a large number of commonly used financial 
ratios and performance metrics including gearing, interest 
cover, EBITDA, EBIT, operating profit and ROCE. The Group’s 
banking covenants will not be affected by this accounting 
change as these are ‘frozen’ , and are based on accounting 
standards at the time the facility agreements came into force. 
The Group’s bank facility runs to 2022, which provides ample 
time for the banking community to properly digest the impact 
of IFRS 16 on our performance metrics.

The Independent Social Value Committee Members  
commend Mears on its wide range of Social Value initiatives  
in all regions that demonstrate strong community focus and 
excellent social and environmental behaviours from

The level of local consultation to unearth and identify 
community needs and build them into bids is ahead of  
current mainstream business practices and is strongly 
focused on creating maximum Social Value while  
contributing to winning contracts. 
Investing in the future through training and skills: 
Mears has its own in-house registered training provider 
dedicated to improving the skills of employees and the 
employability of people within the communities we serve. We 
opened the Training Academy as part of our ongoing efforts  
to address skills shortages in the sector. It is estimated that 
230,000 new tradespeople will be needed in the UK by 2020.
The Training Academy will support unemployed young people

Delivering the Solutions to make a difference…  
Innovation in practice
We believe it is essential to target our social value activities 
such as volunteering, donations of staff time and materials 
into the most relevant areas to promote community  
cohesion and capacity.
The right projects in the right locations…
Through our sister company, Terraquest, we have developed a 
market-leading portal that gives us insight into local 
demographics and helps identify areas of deprivation. It 
enables us to drill down into a local area and find out more 
information about the demographics, but also to layer crime 
statistics, depravation information, isolation data, along with 
health and environmental data. This drives our decision making, 
allowing us to target intervention and outreach to the most 
disadvantaged groups and to focus on the right outcomes. 
New for 2018, the tool will provide insight into specific housing 
stock locations aligned to our client business.
Understanding the impact
To understand the difference our work makes, it is essential 
that we have a robust method for capturing and measuring 
the full scope of our community engagement. 
Our approach is based on evaluating wellbeing, using a 
bespoke social value calculator – which we continuously 
update – to measure outcomes and impact, so we can be sure 
of the difference our work is making.

The Mears Foundation
The Foundation was established to promote charitable 
fund raising and giving for projects and initiatives which 
help disadvantaged and hard-to-reach groups across the 
spectrum of young people, vulnerable groups and elderly. 
It aims to provide support through volunteering and hands 
on help for nominated causes, not just financial support. 
This year, teams across the Group have been taking part 
in a variety of events, specifically focusing on social isolation. 
 Who has benefitted?
Men in Sheds: The foundation supported Dartford and 
Eastbourne branches with Age UK’s Men in Sheds project. 
This is an innovative scheme that supports older men who 
want to get together, share and learn new skills - all in the

at increasing the number of women trade operatives in social 
housing maintenance. The suite can be found on the Mears’ 
website and includes; ‘Best Practice Guide making social 
housing landlords and maintenance companies open to 
tradeswomen’ , ‘Resource Directory signposting for girls and 
women wanting to work on the manual trades in the Social 
Housing Maintenance sector’ and ‘Legal Guide guidance and 
templates for the procurement of social housing contracts, 
maximising the recruitment and retention of tradeswomen’ . 
We are extremely proud of what we have achieved with the 
Tradeswomen into Maintenance project. Mears is determined 
to recruit and retain a diverse workforce. We have some 
fantastic tradeswomen who are keen to be mentors for  
the next generation.
Mears joint venture with Bromley to tackle homelessness
This year, we formed a joint venture with Bromley Council 
to help tackle the growing challenge of homelessness in 
the borough. The ‘More Homes Bromley’ venture will see us 
purchase, refurbish and manage 400 properties to ‘Decent 
Homes’ standard on behalf of the Council. Currently, more 
than 1,000 households in Bromley are in temporary 
accommodation – in many cases this means costly B&Bs as 
there is too little suitable accommodation to meet demand. 
Homelessness is a growing problem, especially in London,  
and we have to seek innovative ways to fulfil our duty to 
vulnerable families from the borough when they have now 
here else to go. With such large numbers needing temporary 
accommodation while more permanent solutions are sought, 
this venture offers a real alternative to using expensive B&B 
accommodation. It is important that we look at new and 
cost-effective ways in which to meet our statutory obligations, 
as housing is under such pressure as demand continues to rise.

Mears Group PLC
Annual report and accounts 2017 We directly recruited six out of 
the eight candidates for the  
Mears national apprenticeship 
programme and all of them  
are currently working towards 
NVQ Levels 2 and 3 in a range 
of trade and technical specialisms 
In focus
Addressing training 
needs of hard-to-reach 
groups through 
collaborative working
Working with our partners Yes Manchester and The Skills 
Company, we held a pilot pre-recruitment programme, to 
target candidates out of reach of the employment market. 
They included a diverse mix of individuals representing the 
hard-to-reach and NEET groups, including BMEs, females, 
person with mental health issues and ex-offenders.
The results
The pilot was a great success and we directly recruited six out  
of the eight candidates for the Mears national apprenticeship 
programme and all of them are currently working towards NVQ 
Levels 2 and 3 in a range of trade and technical specialisms. 
Barriers
One of the barriers that we encountered in formulating the 
pre-recruitment programme related to the issue of candidates 
being disqualified from receiving Universal Credit during the 
six weeks of training. To overcome this The Skills Company 
negotiated a special arrangement with the Job Centre Plus 
so that candidates could continue to receive their benefits. 
Critical success factors
One of the critical factors contributing to the success of the 
pre-recruitment programme has been the time taken to 
communicate and explain the training in detail at the outset.  
This has ensured that candidates fully understand the programme 
objectives, what is entailed, what is required from them and the 
possibility of an apprenticeship at the end of the training. 
Our female trainee Maintenance Operative got her opportunity 
through Yes Manchester, which helped her secure an interview 
with us and she successfully secured a six-week traineeship on 
the pre-recruitment programme. 
After completing the traineeship she was offered a place on 
our apprenticeship programme as a maintenance trainee and 
is currently working towards her NVQ.

Mears’ four social value priorities continued
Providing career , skills and employment opportunities
Rotherham Careers Event Brings Employment Opportunities
Mears brought together local businesses and organisations to 
showcase employment and training opportunities at the 
annual Local Employment Advisory Forum (LEAF) event in 
Rotherham. Over 1,200 students and jobseekers attended the 
LEAF event, held at the Magna Science Adventure Centre. 
Working with schools
Our Rotherham branch and faith school St Pius in Wath are 
the first to be officially ‘matched’ in an exciting programme to 
help businesses and schools work together. The national 
‘Enterprise Advisers’ programme, sees volunteers from the 
world of work and business team up with schools to increase 
the quality and quantity of careers and enterprise learning for 
young people. 
Supporting our military veteran colleagues
We have launched a Military Veterans Group to recognise 
our colleagues who have served in the armed forces. 
These valued colleagues are best placed to encourage 
more ex-service personnel to consider Mears, whether 
within housing or care, for future employment opportunities. 
Our Military Veterans Group will also discuss ways in which 
our business can become more inclusive and supportive for 
those making the transition from the armed services.
Eight employers from across the South West have been 
presented with a Silver Defence Employer Recognition 
Scheme Award at a recent ceremony
Mears were amongst the award recipients of the Silver 
Defence Employer Recognition Award. The Defence Employer 
Recognition Scheme (ERS) encourages employers to support 
Defence and inspire others to do the same. 
Creating a peaceful home for former soldiers
Mears have joined forces with building materials provider 
Travis Perkins, to transform Adelaide House, a former nursing 
home, in the Malvern Hills, which had been bought 
by Rooftops Housing Association. Once the Victorian building 
has been renovated it will become a treatment and recovery 
centre for former soldiers living with Post-Traumatic Stress 
Disorder (PTSD).

Delivering Social Value with our Supply Partners
At Mears, we believe we are more effective in delivering social 
value where we can share resources, skills, experience and 
financial support with our supply partners. To ensure a 
consistent approach throughout our supply chain, we expect 
our suppliers to have or adopt similar business principles 
to our own. Our suppliers are required to acknowledge the 
significance of social, environmental and ethical matters 
in their conduct and must have a commitment to working 
towards improving quality standards and performance in 
these areas. Above all, we expect suppliers to be able to 
demonstrate compliance with all the UK, EU and international 
legislation that applies to business operations from Modern 
Slavery, Anti-Bribery and Health, Safety & Wellbeing laws to 
product specific regulations.
We also have a commitment to continuously increase the 
number of local SME subcontractors on our approved list, 
ensuring that a proportion of contract spend remains within 
the local economy by supporting increased revenue 
generation and increasing employment opportunities.
Mears’ commitment to the environment extends beyond 
its own operations, into the supply chain. Over 90% of our 
material spend is purchased from merchants recognised for 
sustainable procurement. Mears continues to reduce carbon 
emissions, as detailed below.

Working with social 
enterprise to reuse materials 
We engage and collaborate with social enterprises to facilitate the reuse of various 
items we come across whilst undertaking our services. We have worked with a number 
of social enterprises such as Electronics Recycling (Relectricals) and Mustard Tree, 
which is a Manchester-based social enterprise working to tackle homelessness and 
provide employment opportunities. This approach, whilst supporting our wider social 
value objectives, ensures that any reusable items are reused/recycled as waste to 
landfill is minimised.

Introduction to corporate governance
An effective culture of governance
Dear shareholder,
I am pleased to confirm that your Company has applied 
the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 
(the ‘Code’) throughout the year.
2017 has been an extremely challenging year for the Group. 
We have been disappointed with the financial performance, 
albeit some of the events could not have been anticipated. 
Our Strategic Report highlights our strategic priorities and 
the actions we are taking in order to position the business 
to deliver long-term value for our shareholders and all 
our stakeholders. 
My fellow Non-Executive Directors and I have continued to add 
challenge and guidance to the Executive Directors to ensure 
we are well placed to maximise the future opportunities. The 
Board appointments made over the last twelve months have 
added quality and diversity to Board discussions.
Activity during 2017
In my last Governance Report, I explained that our Nomination 
Committee had identified two excellent new appointments to 
the Board in Roy Irwin and Jason Burt. They have both been 
fully inducted, settled in well and are making a positive 
contribution. The balance of the Board has continued to be a 
key focus and I am pleased to announce the appointment of 
Elizabeth Corrado as Independent Non-Executive Director 
in September 2017 to further enhance the skills, experience, 
quality and diversity of the Board. I am confident that recent 
Non-Executive Board changes will further enhance the 
independence and objectivity of the Board. Biographies 
of our Board members can be found on pages 50 and 51.
We have continued to challenge our working methods and 
processes in our pursuit of best practice. We will continue to 
monitor and review Group processes and procedures in order 
to identify and further mitigate risk.
We see a strong governance culture being key to the sustained 
success of the Group. We recognise it is the duty of the Board, 
under my leadership, to demonstrate that the behaviours and 
values we set in the boardroom, are embedded throughout our 
organisational structure. I see the appointment of an 
Employee Director as being an exciting step forward. The aim 
of the exercise is to enhance the voice of employees within 
Company governance so that better decisions are made in the 
long-term interests of the Company and all those who depend 
on it. I firmly believe that better employee representation can 
improve the quality of decision making by bringing a different 
perspective and information set to the Board. The benefits of 
listening to employees and engaging them in both consultation 
and decision making are already widely recognised. I look 
forward to nominating this candidate for election at the 2018 
Annual General Meeting. Further information on this position 
can be found in the Report of the Nomination Committee.
Succession planning and skills shortage
The Board continues to support the internal leadership and 
development courses delivered by our insourced training 
provider. We have also placed significant focus on improving 
diversity across the business. For instance the ‘Tradeswomen 
into Maintenance’ project aims to increase the awareness of 
trade employment and training opportunities for female trade 
apprentices and operatives in the social housing maintenance 
sector . In addition we place great emphasis upon social mobility 
and creating opportunities for people from disadvantaged 
backgrounds. At Mears, we aim to make sure jobs and 
opportunities are open to everyone and to reflect the 
communities which we service.
Meeting our major shareholders
We continue to maintain regular engagement with investors 
and analysts to ensure our business model and strategy is well 
communicated and understood. Our Executive Directors meet 
with shareholders on a regular basis, and the entire Board is 
available for shareholders as required, and indeed have met 
shareholders on a number of occasions during the year . In my 
Chairman’s Report on pages 4 to 6, I have highlighted that we 
intend to take a more conservative approach in setting market 
expectations in the future in an increasingly volatile market.

Director information, induction and development
It is a key responsibility of the Chairman to ensure all Non-
Executive Directors receive appropriate training and 
development to ensure they can discharge their duties to 
the Board and the Committees to the best of their ability. 
Non-Executive Directors are fully engaged with their 
ongoing development, which is discussed when each Non-

the Chairman. 
All Directors have access to the Company Secretary, who is 
responsible for all Board compliance requirements, to ensure 
they are updated on all legislative developments. In addition 
to this, the Company Secretary ensures the Board agenda and 
papers are provided at least seven days in advance of the 
meeting. Minutes and actions from previous meetings are 
distributed on a timely basis. As per the Board policies and 
procedures, any Non-Executive Director may, on request 
through the Company Secretary, meet with any member 
of staff in the Group. Non-Executive Directors are able 
to request the support of an independent adviser from 
the Company Secretary.
The quality and timeliness of information provided by the 
Company Secretary was included as part of the Board evaluation. 
The findings were that information was thorough and relevant, 
and in all instances provided suitably in advance. 
During the year, Independent Non-Executive Directors 
Jason Burt, Roy Irwin and Elizabeth Corrado received their 
individual inductions, which were led by our insourced 
leadership and development training academy. 
The induction process covers:
Corporate – this included focused briefings on: the history of 
the Group, strategy, financial budget and capital structure 
overview, strategic planning, leadership and development, 
competition, legal, health and safety, other regulatory and 
Government affairs, information security, enabling technology, 
corporate responsibility, remuneration, internal audit, investor 
relations, the media and corporate governance. Each focused 
session was held by the relevant member of the Senior 
Management Team. 
Operations – this included: a UK branch-by-branch overview, 
a customer service briefing, segmental strategic business 
development meetings, and one significant contract site visit 
for each trading division.
Board appraisal
Performance evaluation of the Board, its Committees and 
individual Directors takes place on an annual basis. The 2017 
Board performance evaluation was externally facilitated.
The external facilitator, Sean O’Connor, met with all Board 
members individually and asked for their views on a broad 
range of areas including Group strategy, independence, 
experience, effectiveness, shareholders and the interaction 
between Board members. Each Board member provided 
feedback and key observations on the Board’s effectiveness 
as well as suggestions for further enhancement. The Chairman 
reviewed the range of feedback provided and identified some 
broad themes. Some recommendations were proposed which 
have been implemented, but the overall conclusion was that 
the Board is working effectively. In addition, the performance 
of the Chairman is evaluated by the Senior Independent 
Director, having collected the views of the other Directors.
Independence of Non-Executive Directors and 
Re-election of Directors
The Boards adopts the principals of the Code regarding tenure 
of the board, and seeks to strike an appropriate balance 
between continuity of experience and refreshment. Rigorous 
review is applied in assessing the continuous independence 
of Directors having served for over 9 years, with attention to 
ensuring that they remain independent in character and 
judgement, and continue to present an objective constructive 
challenge. In respect of Peter Dicks, the Board recognises that 
independence cannot be determined arbitrarily on the basis 
of a set period of time. The Board concluded that Peter Dicks 
remained independent for the report period. 
T o promote best practice governance, and in accordance with the 
requirements of the Code, each of the current Directors will offer 
themselves for re-election annually . Following the evaluation of 
the Board’ s performance during the year , it is confirmed that the 
performance of each of the Non-Executive Directors continues 
to be effective and that they are considered to demonstrate 
appropriate commitment to the role. The AGM papers include 
an accompanying statement as to why the Board believes 
each Non-Executive Director should be re-elected.
Indemnifications of Directors
In accordance with our Articles of Association and to the extent 
permitted by the laws of England and Wales, Directors are 
granted an indemnity from the Company in respect of liabilities 
incurred as a result of their position in office. However, our 
indemnity does not cover Directors or officers in the event 
of being proven of acting dishonestly or fraudulently.

 → Interim statements.
 → Trading updates.
 → Quarterly newsletters.
 → Group website (www.mearsgroup.co.uk).
Investor relations
The Company is committed to maintaining good 
communications with investors. Normal shareholder contact 
is the responsibility of the Executive Directors, who respond 
on a daily basis to queries from institutional and private 
investors. The Chairman, the Senior Independent Director and 
other Non-Executive Directors are available to shareholders 
to discuss any matters they wish to raise. The Directors 
regularly meet shareholders at operational locations, which 
both parties find more rewarding as it provides greater insight 
into the business and its processes. All Directors are available 
at each AGM and shareholder participation is encouraged. 
The Board is committed to maintaining regular contact 
through the provision of the Annual Report, regular Interim 
Reports and regular trading updates. This information can be 
found on the Group’s website (www.mearsgroup.co.uk). 
There is an active programme of communication with existing 
and potential shareholders. There is increased dialogue with 
institutional investors following the publication of final and 
interim results, which is facilitated through a series of formal 
presentations. 
The Group regularly receives and responds to questions raised 
by small private shareholders through the investor enquiry 
portal within the Group’s website. In addition, a number of 
private shareholders attend the Company’s AGM.
Feedback from communications with major shareholders and 
other investors, where necessary, is discussed at each Board 
meeting. In addition, analyst views are shared prior to Board 
meetings enabling an opportunity for discussion and 
challenge. Shareholders are given access to other members of 
the Senior Management Team, giving an insight into the 
strength of the Senior Management Team.
The feedback from this year’s shareholder dialogue 
gave consistent support for the Group’s Housing strategy, 
particularly the recent development in Housing Management. 
The shareholder feedback in respect of Care was less consistent 
and the Board welcomes this challenge. Succession planning 
has been identified as a key area for the Group ensuring that 
there is less reliance on the Group Chief Executive.
The Group has more regular contact with its banking partners, 
Barclays and HSBC, and the Group values this close relationship.

Annual report and accounts 2017 “ I am pleased to present my report

the Nomination Committee for 
2017, my first full year as Chair 
of the Nomination Committee. ”
J Unwin
Nomination Committee Chairman
Corporate governance
Report of the Nomination Committee
This has been a particularly busy year for the 
Nomination Committee, seeing the appointment 
of three new Independent Non-Executives who 
have already made significant contributions to  
the effectiveness of the Board. 
 → Roy Irwin has significant experience in the social housing 
sector , culminating in him being Chief Inspector of Housing 
for the Audit Commission as part of a career of over 30 years 
in housing, which included being a Local Authority Housing 
Director and a Housing Association CEO. Since 2013, Roy 
has held the position of Non-Executive Chairman of Mears’ 
Registered Providers of social housing with the Homes and 
Community Agency . Roy joined the Remuneration Committee 
at the same time as his appointment to the Board.
 → Jason Burt was previously a senior partner at Plexus Law, 
specialising in complex employers’ and public liability 
claims and health and safety related regulatory matters. 
His appointment was sought to further integrate health 
and safety into the Group’s culture and governance 
structures, driving good working and health and safety 
practices. Jason joined the Audit Committee at the same 
time as his appointment to the Board.
 → The latest appointment, in September 2017, was Elizabeth 
Corrado, who was until recently an Executive Director of the 
Power to Change charitable trust, with a focus on creating 
innovative projects in housing and energy, enabling 
investment into UK communities at scale and generating 
both financial and social returns for investors and local 
communities. Elizabeth has joined the Audit Committee.
Each appointment followed a rigorous appointment process 
either utilising the expertise of an external recruitment 
consultant or open advertising. The external recruitment 
consultants used have no connection with the company. This 
commenced with a detailed review of the cumulative skills 
and experience of the Board, the output of which was 
compared to the desired requirements of the Board. The 
appointments made have significantly contributed to the 
balance and diversity of the Board. In terms of induction, all 
new appointments to the Board completed a three-month 
induction period immediately after appointment. Further 
details around selection can be found in the Report of the 
Nomination Committee, and the induction process of our 
recent appointments has been explained in the Chairman’s 
Introduction to Corporate Governance.
I am excited at the forthcoming appointment to the Board of 
an Employee Director. Mears will be one of the first listed 
companies to take this bold step. I firmly believe that better 
employee representation can improve the quality of decision 
making. The benefits of listening to employees and engaging 
them in both consultation and decision making are already 
widely recognised. 
We have considered the culture of the Board and the Group as 
a whole during our discussions this year. The Mears culture is 
articulated in the Social value section of the Strategic Report, 
which can be found on pages 41 to 47. The Nomination 
Committee plays a vital role in embedding a positive culture 
throughout the Group. This is done by ensuring our succession 
planning and appointment processes identify candidates that 
demonstrate our vision, values and desired culture. This will 
continue to be an area of focus for the Nomination Committee 
going forward.

Role of the Committee
The Nomination Committee’s responsibilities include:
 → keeping under review the composition of the Board and 
succession to it and succession planning for senior 
management positions within the Group;
 → making recommendations to the Board concerning 
appointments to the Board, whether of Executive or 
Non-Executive Directors, having regard to the balance of 
skills, knowledge, experience and diversity of the Board;
 → reviewing the length of service of Non-Executive Directors 
to ensure a progressive refreshing of the Board, whilst 
retaining the correct level of experience;
 → making recommendations to the Board concerning the 
re-appointment of any Non-Executive Director at the 
conclusion of his/her specified term and the re-election  
of any Director by shareholders under the retirement 
provisions of the Company’s Articles of Association;
 → managing a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure  
for any appointments of new Directors to the Board;
 → prior to the appointment of a Director, requiring that the 
proposed appointee discloses any other business interests 
that may result in a conflict of interest and reports any 
future business interests that could result in a conflict 
of interest; and
 → ensuring that, on appointment to the Board, Non-Executive 
Directors receive a formal letter of appointment setting  
out clearly what is expected of them in terms of time 
commitment, Committee service and involvement  
outside Board meetings.
Activities during the year
 → reviewed Board effectiveness, Board governance, Executive 
and Non-Executive Director succession and deliberation of 
person requirements for the appointments to the Board; 
 → recommended to the Board the appointment of Roy Irwin, 
Jason Burt and Elizabeth Corrado as Non-Executive Directors;
 → approved the process for the externally facilitated Board 
effectiveness evaluation;
 → recommended to the Board that all Directors stand 
for re-election;
 → reviewed the performance of the Committee against 
its terms of reference;
 → considered the re-appointment of Peter Dicks as 
Non-Executive Director for a further one-year term. 
Peter will not be standing for re-election at the 
2018 AGM; and
 → reviewed and discussed the internal leadership and 
development programme to ensure its appropriateness  
for succession to the Board.
Diversity
We have a number of active diversity initiatives across the 
Group, including the ‘Tradeswomen into Maintenance’ project 
and our social mobility focus, as mentioned in the Chairman’s 
Introduction to Corporate Governance. 
The Committee receives updates on all diversity initiatives, 
and monitors the level of engagement and investment.  
The Executive Directors are challenged by the Nomination 
Committee to ensure that these diversity initiatives remain 
high profile.
The appointments in 2017 have increased the diversity of 
our Board in terms of gender and experience. The Board now 
comprises 20% female Directors. Whilst the Board notes the 
recommendation of the Hampton-Alexander review to target 
33% female Board representation by 2020, the Committee 
follows a rigorous appointment process which the Committee 
feels is free from bias.
Board appointment process
When making Board appointments, the Committee reviews 
and approves an outline brief and role specification. Initially  
a longlist of candidates is prepared. The names of longlisted 
candidates are obliterated in the initial screening performed 
by the Committee in order to safeguard against unconscious 
bias in the selection process. A balanced assessment of 
diversity, skills, knowledge, experience and approach is 
performed. After interviews are held, the Committee will 
ultimately make a recommendation for Board consideration.
Following Board approval, a tailored induction programme 
is developed between the Committee and the Group’s 
insourced leadership and development team.
The terms and conditions of each appointment of 
Non-Executive Directors are made available on request  
of the Company Secretary, and are available for inspection 
at the AGM.

Report of the Audit Committee
Accountability
This report sets out how the Committee has 
fulfilled its responsibilities during the year. 
This report also sets out, in relation to financial 
reporting matters, the significant issues that 
were considered and how they were addressed.
As confirmed at the 2017 AGM Jason Burt has joined the 
Committee and has been joined by Elizabeth Corrado, our 
newest Non-Executive Director. They bring to the Committee 
recent and relevant financial and risk experience and I welcome 
their appointment. At the same time Peter Dicks, a long-time 
member of the Committee, retires from the Board and this 
Committee at the 2018 AGM. I thank him for his considerable 
contribution to the work of the Committee over many years.
I have continued to have a number of detailed review meetings 
with the Chief Risk Officer and also met with a substantial 
shareholder to address some questions from them.
As presaged in the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts a new 
committee dealing with health, safety and environmental 
risks has been formed. This Compliance Committee is a 
sub-committee of the Audit Committee and is chaired by 
Jason Burt. With his detailed knowledge of employers’ and 
public liability claims he is ideal for the role. The extent to 
which the full integration of health, safety and environmental 
risks are now embedded in the governance structures of the 
Group is highlighted by the members of the Compliance 
Committee who include: the Group’s CEO, Chief Risk Officer, 
Health and Safety Director and Health and Safety Solicitor. 
The Compliance Committee has detailed terms of reference 
which include:
 → to review and monitor the Group’s policies in relation 
to safety health and environmental (SHE) matters;
 → to review SHE risks and risk assessments on the Group  
risk register and mitigation actions and controls related 
thereto including subcontractor controls and related 
procurement; and
 → to review Group buildings compliance and safety  
including fire and other risks.
In relation to financial reporting the two primary significant 
judgements remain the carrying value of Care goodwill and 
revenue recognition. Both of these continue to have a high 
level of materiality and carry a significant level of judgement. 
In reaching its conclusions the Committee has had very detailed 
discussion with management and gained assurance from 
the detailed procedures carried out by the external auditor , 
Grant Thornton UK LLP .
A third key judgement is the assumptions surrounding the 
defined benefit pension valuations. Despite the valuations 
being prepared by independent actuaries the Committee is 
very aware that, in a volatile economic environment, assumptions 
around bond rates and discount rates are less predictable 
and small movements in these assumptions can result in a 
material change to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in 
a reporting period. Given the requirement that the Annual Report 
is fair, balanced, concise and understandable, the Committee 
supports the analysis prepared by the Finance Director on 
pages 36 to 40 which enables stakeholders to understand 
the differing risks associated with our LGPS and non-LGPS 
pension schemes.
In relation to risk management and internal control the 
CRO manages an extended internal audit team whose annual 
plan is based on the Group risk register and is approved by 
the Committee. The 2017 Annual Internal Audit Report, 
presented to the Committee for approval in February 2018, 
included more coverage than ever before. I was particularly 
pleased to note the extent to which management has responded 
positively and quickly to the system changes suggested by 
the internal audit work. The CRO also provide detailed updates 
on the work being undertaken on checking Group buildings 
compliance post Grenfell and the preparedness for the 
General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).

Annual report and accounts 2017 Corporate governance
In 2014 KPMG, as outsourced internal audit resource, carried 
out a detailed review of central financial controls and processes. 
This year KPMG was asked to review that work and the extent 
of improvement since 2014. The results show management 
has very largely adopted the recommendations from 2014  
and accepted recommendations arising from the latest 
review. More detail on the principal risks can be found on 
pages 25 and 26.
The Committee continues to review the independence and 
effectiveness of its external audit on an annual basis. The 
review process includes reviewing the external auditor’s plan 
and subsequent reports and discussion by the Committee of 
the appropriateness of audit procedures and processes.  
The Senior Statutory Auditor for 2018 is Rebecca Eagle, who 
replaces Simon Lowe who rotated off the Mears audit at the 
end of last year in accordance with Ethical Standards.
Finally the external audit of the Group for 2018 onwards is 
being tendered currently as determined last year. The result  
of the tender will be known by the AGM in June this year.
Role of the Committee
The Committee has access to the financial expertise of the 
Group and its auditor and, if required, can seek further 
professional advice at the expense of the Group.
The key responsibilities of the Committee are to: 
 → consider the appointment of the external auditor, its 
reports to the Committee and its independence, including 
an assessment of its appropriateness to conduct any 
non-audit work;
 → review the financial statements and announcements 
relating to the financial performance of the Company;
 → review the internal audit programme and ensure that the 
internal audit function is adequately resourced and has 
appropriate standing within the Company;
 → discuss with the external auditor the nature and scope  
of the audit;
 → review, and challenge where necessary, the actions and 
judgements of management, in relation to the interim and 
annual financial statements before submission to the Board;
 → formally review the effectiveness of the external and 
internal audit processes;
 → consider management’s response to any major external  
or internal audit recommendations;
 → review the Company’s plans for business continuity;
 → review the Company’s plans for prevention and detection  
of fraud, bribery and corruption;
 → review the effectiveness of the whistleblowing 
arrangements; and
 → report to the Board on how it has discharged 
its responsibilities.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
Company’ s website and on request from the Company Secretary .
Committee meetings
The Committee met five times during the year with attendance by 
all members. These meetings were also attended by the Group 
Chief Executive Officer , the Group Finance Director and the Chief 
Risk Officer as required by invitation from the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee. The external auditor , Grant Thornton UK LLP ,  
was invited to all meetings. There was also significant dialogue 
outside formal meetings between Committee members, 
Executive Directors and the external auditor particularly 
during the audit process and the preparation of the Annual 
Report. The Audit Committee Chairman meets with the 
external auditor regularly throughout the year.
Main activities of the Committee during the year
Financial and business reporting
The Audit Committee shares the responsibility with the  
Board for reviewing the appropriateness of the Annual Report 
and half-year announcements, to ensure that they properly 
reflect the Group’s business model, strategic priorities, 
key risks and financial and non-financial performance. 
Consideration is given to the reasonableness of the 
accounting policies, adherence to accounting standards 
and sufficiency and clarity of the information disclosed.
The primary areas of judgement considered by the  
Committee in relation to the 2017 accounts, and how  
these were addressed, were:
Carrying value of goodwill 
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are 
grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately 
identifiable cash flows; these are termed as cash-generating 
units (CGUs). Due to the Board successfully integrating the 
newly acquired Care business into the existing Care business, 
there have been two CGUs identified: Social Housing and Care. 
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an 
estimate of the value in use of each of the CGUs to which 
goodwill has been allocated. The value-in-use calculation 
involves an estimate of the future cash flows of the CGU and 
also the selection of an appropriate discount rate to calculate 
present values. Future cash flows are estimated using the 
current one-year budget, extrapolated for five years to 
December 2022 using specific rates with a general terminal 
growth rate being used thereafter. This has been derived from 
the extensive business planning process described in greater 
detail within note 10 on pages 115 to 117 of the Annual 
Report. Estimated growth rates over each period are based  
on past experience and knowledge of the individual sector’s 
markets. The Directors consider that the estimates and 
judgements involved in determining the value in use of the 
Care CGU goodwill are the most significant to the Group and 
they have therefore utilised the services of an external 
consultant to assist with this impairment review. The value in 
use is most sensitive to changes in the terminal growth rate, 
the explicit growth rate during the forecast period and the 
discount rate.

Report of the Audit Committee continued
Accountability continued
Main activities of the Committee during the year

Financial and business reporting continued
Carrying value of goodwill continued
The sensitivity to changes in these estimations is detailed  
in note 10. The Audit Committee takes reassurance from the 
previous year’s impairment review, where the key assumptions 
have subsequently been found to have been reasonably 
conservative and that the actual results in the subsequent year 
have delivered better outcomes than anticipated. The headroom in 
the period, being the excess between value in use compared to 
carrying value, has increased which gives the Audit Committee 
further reassurance although the Committee remains mindful 
that there is still significant uncertainty in the Care sector and 
key assumptions could change and materially impact 
upon the carrying value of the Care business. 
The Audit Committee addressed this area of judgement by 
reviewing the key assumptions proposed by management, 
notably forecast growth rate, discount rate, terminal growth 
rate and carer recruitment and retention rates. Given the 
importance of these assumptions, the Committee also 
reviewed reports prepared by a third party valuation expert, 
PwC, which provided validation to the management proposals:
 → the Committee reviewed the asset valuation report 
prepared by management to discuss the report in detail. 
The Committee gave particular focus to the sensitivity 
analysis which showed the level of changes in key 
value-in-use calculation assumptions that would be 
required before triggering any impairment;
 → the Committee reviewed the disclosure in the notes  
to the financial statements; and
 → this area represented a prime area of audit focus and  
Grant Thornton UK LLP provided detailed feedback 
to the Committee.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when the outcome of a job or contract 
can be estimated reliably; revenue associated with the 
transaction is recognised by reference to the stage of 
completion of work at the balance sheet date. The outcome  
of the transaction is deemed to be able to be estimated 
reliably when all the following conditions are satisfied:
 → the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
 → it is probable that the economic benefits associated  
with the transaction will flow to the entity;
 → the stage of completion of the transaction at the  
balance sheet date can be measured reliably; and
 → the costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to 
complete the transaction can be measured reliably.
Full provision is made for future losses on all contracts  
in the year in which the loss is first foreseen.
The Audit Committee addressed this area of judgement  
in the following ways:
 → the Committee reviewed the key judgements report 
prepared by management which provided a detailed 
explanation in respect of the valuation of unbilled  
works and the recognition of revenues;
 → the Committee took comfort from the contract management 
system which is central in generating the valuation of works 
(both billed and unbilled) and the integrated process that 
follows to ensure an accurate cut-off so that revenue is 
appropriately matched to cost. Grant Thornton tested these 
systems during its audit fieldwork and provided feedback 
to the Committee on this crucial area; and
 → this area represented a prime area of external audit focus. 
Grant Thornton UK LLP carried out both controls-based 
and substantive testing of the amounts recoverable on 
contracts, adopting a blend of risk-based and random 
sampling approaches to testing, and provided detailed 
feedback to the Committee in this area. Grant Thornton’s 
comments can be seen on page 85.
The Audit Committee reviewed the impact of the new 
accounting standard, IFRS 15, which comes into effect in  
2018 and will impact on the timing of recognising revenue  
and costs on a small number of contracts.
Defined benefit pension valuation 
A number of key estimates have been made, which are given 
below and which are largely dependent on factors outside  
the control of the Group:
 → inflation rates;
 → mortality;
 → discount rate; and
 → salary and pension increases.
Details of the particular estimates used are included  
in the pensions note (note 26) on pages 133 to 137.
Where the Group has a contractual right to recover the costs 
of making good any deficit pension scheme, the fair value of that 
asset has been recognised and disclosed. The right to recover 
costs is limited to exclude situations where the Group causes 
the scheme to incur service costs in excess of those which 
would have been incurred were the members employed within 
Local Government. The Directors have made judgements in 
respect of whether any of the deficit is as a result of such situations.
The right to recover costs is also limited to situations where 
the cap on contributions payable by the Group is not set so  
as to contribute to reducing the deficit in the scheme. The 
Directors, in conjunction with the scheme actuaries, have 
made judgements in respect of the predicted future service 
cost and contributions to the scheme to reflect this in the  
fair value of the asset recognised.
The Audit Committee addressed this area of judgement  
in the following ways:
 → the Committee reviewed the key assumptions proposed  
by management, notably assumptions in respect of 
discount rate, RPI, CPI and future salary increases.  
Given the materiality of this area, the Committee reviewed 
a report prepared by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP which 
validated the assumptions set by management and 
provided a comparison with other quoted companies;
62
Mears Group PLC

 → the Committee reviewed the accounting treatment of 
pension related transactions. Full disclosure has been 
provided within the pensions note (note 26) on pages  
133 to 137 and the Committee concurred with the analysis 
provided on pages 39 and 40 of the Financial Review in 
respect of defined benefit scheme pension obligations; and
 → given the technical nature of this area, the Committee 
placed reliance upon the actuarial reports prepared by  
the respective scheme actuaries in respect of each of  
the defined benefit pension schemes.
Discontinued activities 
As disclosed in note 7 the Group has made full provision for 
outstanding performance guarantees relating to the disposal 
of Haydon Mechanical and Electrical Limited in 2013. In 2015 
the Audit Committee reviewed the position on each outstanding 
contract and reviewed the cash flow and cost to complete 
forecasts of Haydon Mechanical and Electrical LLC (Haydon LLC) 
in the UAE to see whether they might impact on the performance 
guarantees. The Committee also saw the contract management 
work undertaken by the auditor who provided detailed feedback to 
the Committee. In 2016, note 7 to the Annual Report and 
Accounts contained a detailed note on the results of Haydon LLC 
and the position of the outstanding performance guarantees 
at 31 December 2016 of £13.7m which were disclosed as 
contingent liabilities in note 27. A number of the performance 
guarantees have been called in this year and as a result a 
provision has been made of £16.5m against all outstanding 
performance guarantees and a provision for future legal costs. 
The Committee addressed this area of judgement in the 
following ways:
 → The Committee discussed with management legal advice 
which suggests a realistic expectation of recovery of the 
cash outflow in the year and concluded that it was 
inappropriate to recognise and potential receipt at this stage.
 → The Committee saw the contract management work by the 
auditor who provided detailed feedback to the Committee 
agreeing with management’s views.
New standards and interpretations not yet applied
The Group is required to disclose information on standards 
that are in issue, not yet effective that have not been early 
adopted in the financial statements. 
The Committee has met with management to 
discuss management’s interpretation and proposed 
implementation of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers and IFRS 16 Leases. Following these discussions, 
the Committee reviewed the disclosures within Principal 
Accounting Policies on pages 100 and 101.
The Committee satisfied itself of the appropriateness of the 
disclosures after the discussions with management and the 
review of the disclosures by the external auditor. 
Internal control and risk management
With respect to its oversight of risk management and internal 
controls, the Board reviewed and discussed a wide range of 
matters with management, internal audit and external audit, 
as appropriate. This extends to cover all material controls, 
including operational, compliance and financial controls and 
risk management systems. The Directors are satisfied that 
procedures are in place to ensure that the Group complies 
with the Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control  
and Related Financial and Business Reporting (the Risk 
Guidance) published by the Financial Reporting Council  
in September 2014.
The Board has delegated some of these responsibilities to  
the Audit Committee which has reviewed the effectiveness  
of the system of internal control and ensured that any 
remedial action has been or is being taken on any identified 
weaknesses. The system of internal controls is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide reasonable, but not 
absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.  
It includes all controls including financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management procedures.
In addition, the Audit Committee has a new sub-committee; 
the Compliance Committee. An overview of the Terms of 
Reference of this committee is included within the Audit 
Committee Chairman’s introduction; the Compliance 
Committee reports to the Audit Committee under these  
Terms of Reference.
The Group has an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the significant risks faced by the Group. The 
Group endeavours to ensure that the appropriate controls, 
systems and training are in place and has established 
procedures for all business units to operate appropriate  
and effective risk management.
The processes used to assess the effectiveness of the  
internal control systems are ongoing, allowing a cumulative 
assessment to be made, and include the following:
 → delegation of day-to-day management to operational 
management within clearly defined systems of 
control, including:
 → the identification of levels of authority within clearly 
identified organisational reporting structures;
 → the identification and appraisal of financial risks  
both formally, within the annual process of preparing 
business plans and budgets, and informally, through 
close monitoring of operations;
 → a comprehensive financial reporting system within 
which actual results are compared with approved 
budgets, quarterly reforecasts and previous years’ 
figures on a monthly basis and reviewed at both  
local and Group level; and
 → an investment evaluation procedure to ensure an 
appropriate level of approval for all capital and  
revenue expenditure;
 → discussion and approval by the Board of the Group’s 
strategic directions, plans and objectives and the risks  
to achieving them, combined with regular reviews by 
management of the risks to achieving objectives and 
actions being taken to mitigate them;
 → review and approval by the Board of annual budgets, 
combined with regular operational and financial reviews  
of performance against budget, prior year results and 
regular forecasts by management and the Board;

 → regular reviews by the Board and the Audit Committee of 
identified fraudulent activity and actions being taken to 
remedy any control weaknesses;
 → regular reviews by management and the Audit Committee 
of the scope and results of internal and external audit work 
across the Group and the implementation of 
recommendations;
 → consideration by the Board and by the Audit Committee of 
the major risks facing the Group and of the procedures in 
place to manage them and to ensure controls react to 
changes in the Group’s overall risk profile. These include 
health and safety, people, legal compliance, quality 
assurance, insurance and security, and reputational, social, 
ethical and environmental risks;
 → discussion relating to a presentation from the IT Director on 
cyber-security, including an assessment of vulnerabilities 
and the programmes being implemented to protect the 
Group against this evolving and potentially catastrophic 
risk;
 → consideration and discussion relating to regular updates 
from the Finance Director regarding developments within 
the finance function; and
 → review of the Group’s treasury policies with the Finance 
Director and Head of Treasury in order to ensure best 
practice is being adhered to.
The Board has reviewed these procedures and considers them 
appropriate given the nature of the Group’s operations. The 
Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and the Finance Director presented a 
report on the robustness of the internal controls for the year 
and an internal audit plan for 2018. The Committee 
has concluded that the system of internal control and risk 
management is embedded into the operations of the Group 
and the actions taken to mitigate any weaknesses are 
carefully monitored.
The key controls in place are:
 → a defined organisational structure and an appropriate level 
of delegated responsibility to operational management;
 → authorisation limits for financial and 
non-financial transactions;
 → written operational procedures;
 → a robust system of financial budgeting and forecasting;
 → a robust system of financial reporting with actual results 
compared to budget and forecast results; and
 → regular reporting of operational performance and risks to 
the Board, including the work of the Compliance Committee.
In 2014 a detailed review of internal controls was performed 
by independent internal audit outsourced partners KPMG. 
This work was commissioned on a risk-based approach and 
was performed to provide the Committee with independent 
assurance over the quality of risk management and strength 
of internal controls. The procedures performed by KPMG were 
undertaken within inherently risky areas that would affect KPI 
performance. This assignment was finalised during 2015 and 
the independent view of internal controls was that controls 
were generally adequate, though improvements were suggested. 
The improvements have been implemented as envisaged in 
the 2016 annual report; KPMG, as outsourced internal audit 
resource, carried out an updated review of centralised 
controls and processes. Management has accepted 
recommendations from the 2017 updated review.
The Company has in place internal control and risk 
management systems in relation to the Company’s 
financial reporting process and the Group’s process for the 
preparation of consolidated accounts. The consolidated 
financial statements are produced by the Group finance 
function, which is responsible for the review and compilation 
of reports and financial results from each of the operating 
subsidiaries in accordance with the Group reporting 
procedures. The consolidated financial statements are 
supported by detailed working papers. The Audit Committee 
is responsible for overseeing and monitoring these processes, 
which are designed to ensure that the Company complies with 
relevant regulatory reporting and filing requirements. As at the 
end of the period covered by this report, the Audit Committee, 
with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the 
Finance Director, evaluated the effectiveness of the design 
and operation of disclosure controls and procedures designed to 
ensure that information required to be disclosed in financial 
reports is recorded, processed, summarised and reported 
within specified time periods.
The Committee carried out a review of its effectiveness with 
input from Committee and Board members, management and 
the external auditor. The review concluded that the 
Audit Committee members had sufficient expertise and 
committed time to discharge their responsibilities.
External audit related services
The Committee is also responsible for monitoring and 
reviewing the performance, independence and objectivity 
of Grant Thornton UK LLP , the external auditor. The external 
auditor has also confirmed that it has complied with relevant 
UK independence standards. The external audit of the Group 
for 2018 forward is being tendered currently as determined 
last year. The result of the tender will be known by the AGM in 
June this year.
The Company has adopted a strict policy of prohibiting 
the external auditor from carrying out non-audit services, 
in order to safeguard audit objectivity and independence. The 
Committee is responsible for approval of all non-audit services 
provided by Grant Thornton; however, this is considered to be 
in exceptional circumstances only . In such an exceptional event, 
the Audit Committee would approve only where the Company 
would be disadvantaged by engaging an alternative provider, 
for instance where Grant Thornton possesses a detailed 
knowledge of the structure of the business or an understanding 
of the markets that the Group operates in. No non-audit 
services were provided by Grant Thornton during 2017.

pleased to introduce the Mears 
2017 Remuneration Report. ”
P F Dicks
Remuneration Committee Chairman
Corporate governance
Report of the Remuneration Committee
Dear shareholder,
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report sets out 
the Company’s remuneration policy for Directors. 
This policy was subject to a binding vote at the 2017 
AGM and will remain unchanged for a period of at 
least three years. For completeness, the policy 
is detailed in full within this Annual Report.
The Annual Report on Remuneration sets out payments and 
awards made to the Directors and details the link between 
Company performance and remuneration for the 2017 financial 
year. This report, together with this letter, is subject to an 
advisory shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM.
You will have read earlier in the Annual Report that 2017 has 
been a challenging year. The financial results fell short of the 
Board’s expectations at the start of the year. Whilst some of 
the short-term challenges in Housing could not have been 
anticipated, the Executive team expressed their frustration 
that a number of other opportunities that could have helped 
mitigate these challenges did not develop quickly enough. 
In a year which saw the Group fall short on a number of key 
performance indicators as detailed on pages 20 and 21, there 
will be no awards made under the EIP in respect of 2017.
The Remuneration Committee is acutely aware of the 
sensitivity around increasing pay levels in excess of the 
general workforce. The Executive team is also mindful of the 
pay structure of the wider workforce, and has emphasised its 
desire to ensure that, where possible, resources are targeted 
to those at the lower end of the pay scale. No pay increases 
are proposed for the Executive team for the coming year.
During 2017, I was delighted to take the opportunity to invite 
all employees to participate in a new Save As You Earn scheme 
(SAYE). The Board applied the maximum discount allowed 
under HMRC rules of 20%, giving employees an opportunity to 
acquire shares at 348p subject to a three-year vesting period. 
Over one thousand employees subscribed for an aggregate of 
1.3m shares. It is very pleasing to see such a wide cross-
section of people wanting to participate in the future success 
of the Group.
I hope you find the information in this report helpful and I look 
forward to your support at the forthcoming AGM. I am always 
happy to hear from the Company’s shareholders and you can 
contact me direct, or via the Company Secretary, Ben Westran, 
if you have any questions on this report or more generally in 
relation to the Company’s remuneration.

Directors’ remuneration policy
Remuneration policy and philosophy
Remuneration policy How is this achieved?
A simple and transparent remuneration structure that 
retains and motivates Executives while being sympathetic 
to Mears’ operating environment from both an external 
and internal perspective.
 → Conservative levels of fixed remuneration balanced with  
one annual incentive strongly linked to performance.
 → The performance element of the annual incentive 
incorporates robust financial, operational and strategic KPIs 
that are aligned with an evolving business strategy in an 
uncertain economic environment.
 → All incentive payments are deferred into equity over a 
five-year period ensuring clear alignment with shareholders’ 
interests and ‘at-risk’ remuneration.
A proportion of each Executive’s total compensation 
should be linked to performance related pay and the 
provision of equity.
 → All incentive payments are delivered in ‘deferred’ shares.  
At stretching performance, around one third of the Executive 
Directors’ total remuneration is based on the achievement of 
key corporate metrics that are aligned to the Company’s 
long-term strategy.
There should be a commitment to fostering a performance 
culture that aligns an individual’s rewards with the key 
corporate metrics that drive shareholder value creation.
 → The performance measures used in the Executive Incentive 
Plan are directly aligned with our corporate goals and as 
such ensure that there is no payment for poor performance.
 → The Committee will ensure that the remuneration package 
does not lead to irresponsible behaviour and that it takes 
appropriate account of risk.
Executive Directors
The table below sets out the key elements of the policy for Executive Directors:
Objective and 
link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Performance measures  
and assessment
Base salary
 → The purpose of the 
base salary is to:
 → help recruit 
and retain 
key individuals;
 → reflect the 
individual’s 
experience, role 
and contribution 
within the 
Group; and
 → ensure fair reward 
for ‘doing the job’.
The Committee reviews base salaries annually in April.
The Committee will retain the discretion to increase 
an individual’s salary where there is a significant 
difference between current levels and a market 
competitive rate. When determining base salaries 
and whether to increase levels the Committee will 
take the following into consideration:
 → the performance of the individual 
Executive Director;
 → the individual Executive Director’s experience 
and responsibilities;
 → the impact on fixed costs of any increase;
 → pay and conditions throughout the Group; and
 → the economic environment.
When setting the salary levels for the 
Executive Directors, in addition to the factors 
summarised above, salary levels paid by 
companies of a similar size and complexity 
to Mears are taken into account.
The annual increase will 
not exceed 10% of annual 
base salary.
The Committee is guided 
by the general increase 
for the broader employee 
population but may 
decide to award a lower 
increase for Executive 
Directors or indeed 
exceed this to recognise, 
for example, an increase 
in the scale, scope or 
responsibility of the 
role and/or to take 
into account relevant 
market movements.
The Company will set out 
in the section headed 
Implementation of 
remuneration policy, 
in the following financial 
year, the salaries for 
that year for each of 
the Executive Directors.

Other benefits
To provide benefits 
that are valued by the 
recipient and are 
appropriately 
competitive. 
The Executive Directors receive additional benefits 
including a company-provided car or an allowance in 
lieu, life assurance and private medical insurance. 
Other benefits may be provided where appropriate. 
Benefits in kind are not pensionable.
Benefit values vary year 
on year depending on 
premiums and the 
maximum potential 
value is the cost of 
these provisions.
Not applicable.
Pension
To provide a 
framework to save  
for retirement that  
is appropriately 
competitive.
All Executive Directors receive a contribution into 
their respective defined contribution plans, which 
are subject to periodic review to ensure that they 
remain in line with rates applicable in the market. 
Only the base salary is pensionable.
The Executive Directors 
receive a contribution of 
15% of salary.
Not applicable.
Executive Incentive Plan (EIP)
To provide a link 
between reward 
and corporate 
performance in 
order to appropriately 
retain and motivate 
the Executive 
Directors and senior 
management who are 
critical to executing 
the business strategy.
To align the 
interests of Executive 
Directors and senior 
management more 
closely with 
shareholders over 
the longer term and 
provide a greater 
exposure to share 
price movements 
over this period.
Annual awards of nil-cost options will be 
made based on the achievement of annual 
performance measures.
Awards will be made in two parts:
 → 50% of the maximum award will be granted 
in deferred shares (‘Part A’); and
 → 50% of the maximum award will be granted based 
on the achievement of a range of annual 
performance measures (‘Part B’).
Both awards will vest 60% after three years, with 
a further 20% after four years and the remaining 
20% after five years.
The Committee may award dividends/dividend 
equivalents on shares to the extent that the 
shares vest. 
In exceptional circumstances (such as recruitment) 
the Committee retains the discretion to provide an 
element of the award in cash.
Further details of the operation of the EIP, including 
the performance measures for 2018, are set out on 
page 74.
Annual awards made to 
Executive Directors will 
be capped at a maximum 
of 200% of salary. For 
Part A of the award, 100% 
will vest if the EPS metric 
is met in full. For Part B 
of the award:
 → 20% of the award will 
vest for threshold 
performance; and
 → 100% of the award will 
vest for maximum 
performance. There is 
straight-line vesting 
between these points.
The performance 
measure for Part A will 
be earnings per share.
The performance 
measures for Part B of 
the 2018 awards are as 
follows: earnings per 
share (EPS), return 
on capital employed 
(ROCE), cash conversion, 
customer satisfaction 
and health and safety. 
The Remuneration 
Committee has 
discretion to set 
performance measures 
and weightings on an 
annual basis, with 
performance measures 
for the next financial 
year set out in the 
Statement of 
Implementation 
on pages 77 to 79.
The EIP contains malus 
(up to date of vesting) 
and clawback (two years 
post vesting) provisions.

All-employee share plans
Encourages 
employees to own 
shares in order to 
increase alignment 
over the longer term.
All employees are eligible to participate in the 
Company’s Share Incentive Plan (SIP) and Sharesave 
Plan (Save As You Earn).
Under the terms of the Sharesave Plan all employees 
can apply for three or five-year options to acquire the 
Company’s shares priced at a discount of up to 20%. 
Under the terms of the SIP the Company can choose 
to offer free shares, partnership shares, matching 
shares (up to two for one on any partnership shares 
purchased) and/or dividend shares. 
In addition the Company operates a discretionary 
unapproved share plan and a Company Share Option 
Plan (CSOP). No awards to Executive Directors are 
proposed under these plans.
Under the SIP, Sharesave 
and CSOP, the maximum 
amount is equal to the 
regulatory limits set from 
time to time.
Not applicable.
Shareholding requirement
Secures a long-term 
locked-in alignment 
between the 
Executive Directors 
and shareholders, 
ensuring that they 
build up and maintain 
a minimum level of 
shareholding 
throughout their 
employment with 
the Company.
The shareholding requirement will operate in the 
following manner: 
 → only shares unconditionally owned by the 
Executive Director will count against the 
requirement; and 
 → shares can be built up over a five-year period 
from implementation of the policy through the 
vesting and retention of share awards and/or 
MIP/EIP payments.
Minimum shareholding 
requirement is 400% 
of salary.
Not applicable.
Notes to the future policy table
Reasons for selecting performance measures
The Committee wanted to ensure that the performance 
measures selected provide a holistic assessment of overall 
corporate performance and tie in to the non-financial objectives 
that the Company embraces throughout the organisation.
EPS growth has been selected as it provides direct alignment 
to the Company’s strategic objectives over the long term and 
is also transparent, fully understood by participants and an 
externally audited metric over which they have line of sight. 
The use of ROCE and cash conversion (previously incorporated 
as underpins) ensures that quality of earning is protected and 
the Company maintains strong working capital management.
Customer satisfaction and health and safety performance 
conditions are included as these are key KPIs that the Company 
focuses on and by performing strongly in these areas, it will 
help win new contracts with end users and support new 
innovative operating models.
Targets are calibrated to reflect the Committee’s assessment 
of good to exceptional performance and taking into account 
internal budgets and the current economic environment.
Differences in remuneration policy for all employees
The Company sets terms and conditions for employees which 
reflect the different legislative and labour market conditions 
that operate in each of our jurisdictions. We will always meet 
or exceed national minimum standards for terms and 
conditions of employment in each of our business areas. Pay 
arrangements in our businesses also reflect local 
performance with personal increases based on achievement, 
individually assessed. Mears believes in the value of continuous 
improvement, both for the individual and for the Company.
In general, all employees receive base salary, benefits 
and pension, and are eligible to participate in the Company’s 
share plans. Share awards and bonus plans are cascaded 
down below Executive level to senior management, aligning 
the Senior Management Team to deliver value for the Group.
The remuneration of the Executive Directors and 
Senior Executives is more heavily weighted towards 
variable pay than for other employees with a large 
proportion of their overall package dependent on 
successful and sustained execution of the business 
strategy over the longer term.

Committee discretions
The Committee will operate the EIP according to the plan 
rules. The Committee retains discretion, consistent with 
market practice, in a number of regards to the operation and 
administration of these plans. These include, but are not 
limited to, the following:
 → the participants;
 → the timing of grant of an award;
 → the size of an award;
 → the determination of vesting;
 → discretion required when dealing with a change of control 
or restructuring of the Group;
 → determination of the treatment of leavers based on the 
rules of the plan and the appropriate treatment chosen;
 → adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights 
issues, corporate restructuring events and special dividends);
 → the annual review of performance measures and weighting 
for the EIP and exercise conditions; and
 → in exceptional circumstances, the payment of a proportion 
of the EIP in cash. 
These discretions, which in certain circumstances can be 
operated in both an upward and downward manner, are 
consistent with market practice and are deemed necessary 
for the proper and fair operation of the schemes in order to 
achieve their original purpose. It is the Committee’s policy, 
however, that there should be no element of reward for poor 
performance and any upward discretion will only be applied 
in exceptional circumstances.
Illustrations of application of remuneration policy
We estimate that the level of remuneration received by 
each Executive Director for the first full year in which the 
policy applies will be, indicatively, at three different levels 
of performance:
 → minimum performance includes where only fixed pay 
(salary, benefits and pension);
 → on-target performance includes Part A of the EIP and 60% 
of Part B of the EIP; and
 → maximum performance includes the maximum opportunity 
under the EIP .
 → Fixed pay is base salary for 2017 plus the value of pension 
and other benefits.
The charts demonstrate the balance between fixed and 
variable pay for minimum, threshold and maximum 
performance for Executive Directors’ remuneration in 2017 in 
line with the relevant policy.

Approach to recruitment remuneration
In the event that the Company recruits a new 
Executive Director (either from within the organisation 
or externally), when determining appropriate remuneration 
arrangements, the Committee will take into consideration all 
relevant factors (including, but not limited to, quantum, the 
type of remuneration being offered and the jurisdiction the 
candidate was recruited from) to ensure that arrangements 
are in the best interests of both the Company and its 
shareholders, without paying more than is necessary 
to recruit an Executive of the required calibre.
The Committee would generally seek to align the remuneration 
of any new Executive Director following the same principles 
as for the current Executive Directors (set out in the table 
on page 73).
The elements that would be considered by the Company for 
inclusion in the remuneration package for a new Director are 
in line with those offered to existing Directors (see policy table 
on pages 66 to 68 for more details):
 → salary and benefits including defined contribution 
pensionparticipation or a salary supplement in lieu 
of pension provision;
 → participation in the EIP of up to 200% of salary;
 → participation in all-employee share plans operating at 
that time; and
 → costs relating to, but not limited to, relocation, legal, financial, 
tax and visa advice and pre-employment medical checks.
The maximum variable remuneration will be 200% of salary. 
The Committee may make awards on appointing an 
Executive Director to ‘buy out’ remuneration arrangements 
forfeited on leaving a previous employer . Awards made by way 
of compensation for forfeited awards would be made on a 
comparable basis, taking account of performance achieved 
(or likely to be achieved), the proportion of the performance 
period remaining and the form of the award. Compensation 
could be in cash or shares.

will, however, be no automatic entitlement to bonus payments 
or share incentive grants during the period of notice.
The rules of the EIP set out what happens to awards if a 
participant ceases to be an employee or Director of Mears 
before the end of the vesting period. Generally , any outstanding 
share awards will lapse on such cessation, except in 
certain circumstances.
If the Executive Director ceases to be an employee or Director 
as a result of death, injury, ill health, redundancy, retirement, 
the sale of the business or company that employs the individual 
or any other reason at the discretion of the Committee, then 
they will be treated as a ‘good leaver’ under the plan rules.
Under the EIP , a proportion of a good leaver’s award will vest 
on cessation of employment by reference to the time elapsed 
from grant to cessation. The Committee has discretion to 
determine the period during which the good leaver may 
exercise their award after cessation.
On a change of control, all awards under the EIP will 
vest immediately.

Directors’ remuneration policy continued
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The Board as a whole is responsible for setting the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors, other than the Chairman, 
whose remuneration is determined by the Committee and recommended to the Board.
The table below sets out the key elements of the policy for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors.
Objective and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures and assessments
To provide 
compensation that 
attracts individuals 
with appropriate 
knowledge 
and experience.
Fee levels are reviewed 
periodically taking into account 
independent advice and the 
time commitment required 
of Non-Executive Directors.
The fees paid to the 
Chairman and the fees of the 
other Non-Executive Directors 
aim to be competitive with 
other listed companies which 
the Committee (in the case of the 
Chairman) and the Board (in 
respect of the Non-Executive 
Directors) consider to be of 
equivalent size and complexity.
Non-Executive Directors 
receive a base fee and 
additional fees for the 
role of Senior Independent 
Director or membership  
and/or chairmanship 
of certain Committees.
The Chairman receives 
a single fee and does 
not receive any additional 
fees for membership and/or 
chairmanship of Committees.
Non-Executive Directors 
also receive reimbursement of 
reasonable expenses (and any 
tax thereon) incurred through 
undertaking their duties and/or 
Company business.
Any increase in 
Non-Executive Director 
base fees or additional 
Committee/membership 
fees (if introduced) may 
be above the level awarded 
to other employees, given 
that they may only be 
reviewed periodically 
and may need to reflect any 
changes to time commitments 
or responsibilities.
The maximum potential value of 
any benefits provided is the cost 
of these provisions.
The Company will pay 
reasonable expenses incurred 
by Non-Executive Directors.
Current fee levels are set 
out in the Statement of 
Implementation on page 78.
Non-Executive Director fees 
are not performance related.
Non-Executive Directors 
do not receive any variable 
remuneration element.

Annual report and accounts 2017 Corporate governance
Directors’ remuneration policy continued
Other Non-Executive appointments
Executive Directors have an obligation to inform the Board, 
specifically the Remuneration Committee, of any Non-Executive 
positions held or being contemplated and of the associated 
remuneration package. The Remuneration Committee will 
consider the merits of each case and carefully consider the work 
and time commitment required to fulfil the Non-Executive duties 
and the potential benefit to the Group and then determine 
whether the remuneration should be retained by the Executive 
or passed over to the Group.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere 
in the Group in developing policy
In setting the remuneration policy for Executive Directors, 
the Remuneration Committee takes into account Group 
and business unit performance including both financial 
performance and safety improvements in the year. Due to 
the wide variety of labour market conditions and the markets 
in which we operate, pay rates are not normally considered 
when considering Executive Director base pay reviews. 
The Remuneration Committee reviews and notes the 
salaries of Senior Executives within the Group.
The Committee has not expressly sought the views of employees 
and no remuneration comparison measurements were used 
when drawing up the Directors’ remuneration policy . Through the 
Board, however, the Committee is updated as to employee 
views on remuneration generally.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee is committed to an ongoing dialogue with 
shareholders and seeks shareholder views when any significant 
changes are being made to remuneration arrangements. 
We remain sensitive to the views of shareholders and sought 
to consult many of our largest shareholders regarding the 
changes we made to the remuneration policy in 2017.
The Company will continue to monitor shareholder comments 
and retain an open dialogue as necessary.

Additional details in respect of single total figure table (audited)
The performance measures and targets for the EIP for the year ended 31 December 2017 are detailed below. Despite the fact 
that a number of performance targets were met, the Executive team requested that no awards are made under the EIP in 
respect of the 2017 financial year.

 → Base figure of 30.36p to be used. 
Threshold: 
 → 8% EPS growth leads to 20% 
maximum contribution. 
Maximum: 
 → 13% EPS growth leads to 100% 
maximum contribution. 
 → Straight-line contribution between 8% 
and 13%. 
Return on capital employed 
(ROCE) 
20%  → Operating profit divided by 
capital employed.
 → Operating profit is stated before 
acquisition intangible amortisation 
and exceptional costs.
 → Capital employed is defined as 
total assets less current liabilities 
less all balances relating to bank 
borrowings and overdrafts classified 
within non-current liabilities at 
31 December 2017. 
Threshold:

during 2017. 
 → A level of customer ‘excellent’ service 
rating of 90% must be achieved in 
order to deliver a maximum contribution.
Health and safety 10%  → The measure is accident frequency 
rate (AFR). It is calculated as the 
number of reportable incidents 
divided by the number of hours 
worked, multiplied by 100,000.

Role of the Committee and activities 
The Committee determines the total individual remuneration packages of each Executive Director of the Group and certain 
other senior employees (and any exit terms) and recommends to the Board the framework and broad policies of the Group in 
relation to Senior Executive remuneration. The Committee determines the targets for all of the Group’s performance related 
remuneration and exercises the Board’s powers in relation to all of the Group’s share and incentive plans.
There is a formal and transparent procedure for developing policy on Executive remuneration and for determining the 
remuneration of individual Directors.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for:
 → determining and agreeing with the Board the broad remuneration policy for: 
 → the Chairman, the Executive Directors and senior management; and
 → the Executive Directors’ remuneration and other benefits and terms of employment, including performance related 
bonuses and share options; and
 → approving the service agreements of each Executive Director, including termination arrangements.
No Director is involved in determining his/her own remuneration.

Annual overview
The Committee has continued to work to build investor confidence with regard to its Executive remuneration policies and 
remains committed to the following actions:
 → improving the level of openness and transparency in remuneration reporting through a detailed Annual Remuneration Report;
 → operating a structured incentive arrangement with clear financial performance targets for each year; 
 → undertaking a regular review of the remuneration policies for Executive Directors and other Senior Executives within the 
Group to ensure that they remain appropriate to retain and motivate such individuals;
 → considering pay policies within the Group as a whole when determining Executive Directors’ remuneration packages;
 → encouraging Executive Directors and Senior Executives to build up a meaningful shareholding in the Company to more closely 
align the interests of shareholders and Executives; and
 → being kept fully aware and informed on developments and best practice in the field of remuneration and corporate 
governance from external advisers, institutional shareholders and their representative bodies.
Notwithstanding the above, the Committee recognises that the success of the Group is dependent upon the efforts of key 
individuals and that they should be fairly rewarded for their efforts and contributions in making Mears the success it is.
Advisers to the Committee
In 2017, the Committee continued to engage PwC and received wholly independent advice on Executive compensation. PwC is a 
member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and complies with its code of conduct that sets out guidelines to ensure that 
its advice is independent and free of undue influence. Fees paid to PwC in respect of these services in the year ended 31 
December 2017 were £37,000.

of outsourced services to the public and private sectors. The 
principal activity of the Company is to act as a holding company .
Business review

Corporate governance
Details of the Group’s corporate governance are set out on 
pages 52 to 57.
Key performance indicators (KPIs)
We focus on a range of key indicators to assess our performance.

the next AGM but will be eligible for re-election at that meeting.
The beneficial interests of the Directors in the shares of the 
Company at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 are 
detailed within the Remuneration Report on page 75.

Amendment to Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association can be amended only by a 
special resolution of the members, requiring a majority of not 
less than 75% of such members voting in person or by proxy.
Share capital authorisations
The 2017 AGM held in June 2017 authorised:
 → the Directors to allot shares within defined limits. 
The Companies Act 2006 requires directors to seek 
this authority and, following changes to FSA rules and 
institutional guidelines, the authority was limited to one 
third of the issued share capital, a total of £343,071 plus an 
additional one third of issued share capital of £343,071 that 
can only be used for a rights issue or similar fund raising;
 → the Directors to issue shares for cash on a non pre-emptive 
basis. This authority was limited to 10% of the issued share 
capital of £102,920 and is required to facilitate technical 
matters such as dealing with fractional entitlements or 
possibly a small placing; and
 → the convening of general meetings (other than an AGM) on 14 
days ’ notice. This results from a European Union directive that 
became effective on 3 August 2010 and will override Section 
307 of the Companies Act 2006 where the requirement to give 
21 days ’ notice for certain meetings has been amended.
Further details of these authorisations are available in the 
notes to the 2017 Notice of AGM. Shareholders are also 
referred to the 2018 Notice of AGM, which contains similar 
provisions in respect of the Company’s equity share capital as 
detailed below.
AGM
The 2018 AGM will be held on 7 June 2018 at 9.30am and 
a formal Notice of Meeting and Form of Proxy will be issued 
in advance. The ordinary business to be conducted will include 
the re-appointment of all Directors. The special business will 
comprise the following resolutions:
 → to authorise the Directors to allot shares within defined 
limits. The Companies Act 2006 requires Directors to seek 
this authority and, following changes to FSA rules and 
institutional guidelines, the authority, as in previous years, 
will be limited to one third of the issued share capital, plus 
an additional one third of issued share capital that can only 
be used for a rights issue or similar fund raising; 
 → to authorise the Directors to issue shares for cash on a non 
preemptive basis. This authority is limited to 10% of the 
issued share capital and is required to facilitate technical 
matters such as dealing with fractional entitlements or 
possibly a small placing; 
 → to authorise the convening of general meetings (other than 
an AGM) on 14 days’ notice. This results from a European 
Union directive that became effective on 3 August 2010 
and will override Section 307 of the Companies Act 2006 
where the requirement to give 21 days’ notice for certain 
meetings has been amended.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Risk is an accepted part of doing business. The Group’s financial 
risk management is based upon sound economic objectives and 
good corporate practice. The Board has overall responsibility 
for risk management and internal control within the context 
of achieving the Group’s objectives. Our process for identifying 
and managing risks is set out in more detail within the Corporate 
Governance Statement. The key risks and mitigating factors are 
set out on pages 25 and 26. Details of financial risk management 
and exposure to price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk are given in 
note 21 on pages 125 to 129.
Report of the Directors

Mears Group PLC
Annual report and accounts 2017 Corporate governance
Contracts of significance
The Group is party to significant contracts within each 
segment of its business. The Directors do not consider that 
any one of those contracts is essential in its own right to the 
continuation of the Group’s activities.
Payment policy
The Company acts purely as a holding company and as such is 
non-trading. Accordingly , no payment policy has been defined. 
However , the policy for Group trading companies is to set the 
terms of payment with suppliers when entering into a 
transaction and to ensure suppliers are aware of these terms. 
Group trade creditors during the year amounted to 60 days 
(2016: 63 days) of average supplies for the year.
Capital structure
The Group is financed through both equity share capital and 
debt. Details of changes to the Company’s share capital are 
given in note 23 to the financial statements. The Company has 
a single class of shares – ordinary 1p shares – with no right to 
any fixed income and with each share carrying the right to one 
vote at the general meetings of the Company. Under the 
Company’s Articles of Association, holders of ordinary shares 
are entitled to participate in any dividends pro-rata to their 
holding. The Board may propose and pay interim dividends and 
recommend a final dividend for approval by the shareholders at 
the AGM. A final dividend may be declared by the shareholders 
in a general meeting by ordinary resolution but such dividend 
cannot exceed the amount recommended by the Board.
Substantial shareholdings
As at 28 February 2018 the Company has been notified of, or is 
aware of, the shareholders holding 1.5% or more of the issued 
share capital of the Company, as detailed in the table adjacent.

Disabled employees
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always 
fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the applicant 
concerned. In the event of members of staff becoming disabled, 
every effort is made to ensure that their employment with the 
Group continues and that appropriate training is arranged. It is 
the policy of the Group that the training, career development and 
promotion of disabled persons should, as far as possible, be 
identical to that of other employees.
Employee information and consultation
The Group has received recognition under the ‘Investors in 
People’ award. The Group continues to involve its staff in the 
future development of the business. Information is provided to 
employees through a daily news email, a quarterly newsletter 
posted out to all staff, the Group website and the intranet to 
ensure that employees are kept well informed of the 
performance and objectives of the Group.
CREST
CREST is the computerised system for the settlement of share 
dealings on the London Stock Exchange. CREST reduces the 
amount of documentation required and also makes the trading 
of shares faster and more secure. CREST enables shares to 
be held in an electronic form instead of the traditional share 
certificates. CREST is voluntary and shareholders can keep 
their share certificates if they wish. This may be preferable for 
shareholders who do not trade in shares on a frequent basis.
Auditor
Grant Thornton UK LLP offers itself for re-appointment as 
auditor in accordance with Section 489 of the Companies Act 2006. 
The external audit of the Group for 2018 is being tendered and 
the result of that process will be included in the Notice of the 
Annual General Meeting, due to be issued in May 2018.

Mears Group PLC
Annual report and accounts 2017 Corporate governance
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report, the Remuneration Report 
and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
Directors are required to prepare Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and 
have elected to prepare the Company financial statements 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice including FRS 102 The Financial 
Reporting Standard Applicable in the UK and the Republic 
of Ireland (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and 
Applicable Law). Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs and 
profit or loss of the Group and the Company for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
 → select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
 → make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 → state whether applicable accounting standards have 
been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
 → prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and 
the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and Remuneration Report comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors confirm that:
 → so far as each Director is aware there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s auditor 
is unaware; and
 → the Directors have taken all the steps that they ought 
to have taken as Directors in order to make themselves 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the auditor is aware of that information.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
To the best of my knowledge:
 → the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
 → the Annual Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face.
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations. The Board 
considers the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, 
as fair, balanced and understandable and that it provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Going concern
We principally operate in robust defensive markets, social 
housing and care, where spend is largely non-discretionary 
and our contracts tend to be long-term partnerships.
The Group had net debt of £41.3m at 31 December 2017. 
The core debt required to satisfy the day-to-day requirements 
of the business is in the region of £120m. This represents 
significant headroom against the £140m unsecured revolving 
credit facility , with an additional accordion mechanism allowing 
the facility to be increased to a maximum of £60m, maturing 
in November 2022. 
After reviewing the Group’s and Company’s budget for the next 
financial year and longer-term plans, the Directors consider 
that, as at the date of approving the financial statements, it is 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
In respect of the Directors’ Report and financial statements

Mears Group PLC
Annual report and accounts 2017 Corporate governance
Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Mears Group PLC 
(the ‘Parent Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) for 
the year ended 31 December 2017 which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, 
the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated 
Statements of Changes in Equity, the Parent Company 
Balance Sheet, the Parent Company Statement of Changes 
in Equity and notes to the financial statements, including 
a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation 
of the Group financial statements is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in the preparation of the 
Parent Company financial statements is applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial 
Reporting Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard 
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’ (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In our opinion:
 → the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended;
 → the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union;
 → the Parent Company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 → the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described 
in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report. We are independent of the 
Group and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as 
applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion.
Who we are reporting to
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an Auditor’s Report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do 
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Conclusions relating to principal risks, 
going concern and viability statement
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information 
in the Annual Report, in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require 
us to report to you whether we have anything material to 
add or draw attention to:
 → the disclosures in the Annual Report set out on pages 22 
to 26 that describe the principal risks and explain how 
they are being managed or mitigated;
 → the Directors’ confirmation, set out on page 24 of the 
Annual Report that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity;
 → the Directors’ statement, set out on page 82 of the financial 
statements about whether the Directors considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparing the financial statements and the Directors’ 
identification of any material uncertainties to the Group 
and the Parent Company’s ability to continue to do so over 
a period of at least twelve months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements;
 → whether the Directors’ statement relating to going concern 
required under the Listing Rules in accordance with 
Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with 
our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
 → the Directors’ explanation, set out on page 27 of the Annual 
Report, as to how they have assessed the prospects of the 
Group, over what period they have done so and why they 
consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement 
as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

Overview of our audit approach
 → Overall materiality: £1.62m which represents 4.5% of the Group’s preliminary earnings before interest, 
tax and amortisation.
 → Key audit matters were identified as revenue recognition, contract accounting and onerous contract 
provisions, goodwill impairment and defined benefit pension schemes.
 → We performed full scope audits at six companies and specific audit procedures over certain balances 
and transactions at four further companies to gain sufficient, appropriate audit evidence over all material 
balances at both divisional and Group levels. We performed analytical procedures over 41 companies.
Key audit matters
The graph below depicts the audit risks identified and their relative significance based on the extent of the financial statement 
impact and the extent of management judgement. 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due 
to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those that had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy; the allocation 
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of 
our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters.

Key Audit Matter – Group How the matter was addressed in the audit – Group 
Risk 1 – Revenue recognition, 
contract accounting and onerous 
contract provisions Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
Revenue is recognised throughout the 
Group as the fair value of consideration 
receivable in respect of the performance 
of contracts and the provision of services. 
Provision is made for expected contract 
losses as soon as they are foreseen. 
Determining the amount of revenue to 
be recognised requires management 
to make significant judgements and 
estimates as to the stage of completion, 
the costs to complete, the impact of 
any changes in scope of work and the 
recoverability of work in progress and 
receivables balances.
The Directors are also required to make 
an assessment to determine whether 
onerous contract provisions are required 
for loss making contracts. There are 
a number of contracts which have 
historically not met expectations and 
there is a risk that the provisions 
recognised may not be sufficient. 
We therefore identified revenue 
recognition, contract accounting and 
the completeness of onerous contract 
provisions as a significant risk, which was 
one of the most significant assessed risks 
of material misstatement.
 → Assessing whether the accounting policies adopted by the Directors are in 
accordance with the requirements of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 11 
‘Construction contracts’ , IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IFRIC 12 ‘Service concession 
arrangements’ , and whether management accounted for revenue in accordance 
with the accounting policies;
 → testing key controls, where applicable, over the recognition of revenue and the 
allocation of costs to the contracts, including invoicing, cost approval and cost 
allocation;
 → judgementally selecting contracts by reference to materiality and other risk 
factors including loss making contracts, contracts with significant aged work in 
progress and receivables balances and contracts that fall outside the Group’s 
usual ratio of operating profit to work in progress; 
 → selecting a sample of contract balances, accrued income and revenue 
transactions, including contract invoicing, care invoicing and rental and 
rebates income, to ensure coverage across the Group;
 → assessing, for the selected items and samples, whether the revenue and profit 
recognised are in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies by agreeing 
inputs to contract terms, re-performing management’s calculations and 
assessing management’s assumptions and assertions underpinning their 
forecasts for contracts’ future performance by reference to supporting 
documentation, such as contract KPIs, historical performance against 
forecasts and discussions with key contract accounting personnel;
 → investigating the recoverability of receivables, accrued income and work 
in progress balances by reference to post balance sheet cash collection, 
certifications performed by the Group or external Quantity Surveyors, 
reviewing the quality of supporting evidence, including internal and external 
legal opinions, expert value reports, correspondence with customers, and 
examining the Group’s historical experience of recovery;
 → identifying contracts that were at risk of incurring future losses during the 
remaining life of the contract. This included assessing all potentially onerous 
contracts in the prior year, but also any that had incurred significant losses 
during 2017; and
 → examining such contracts and challenging management’s assumptions and 
assertions relating to the future results of those contracts by reference to 
supporting evidence, such as management’s plans to return the contract 
to profit, forecast models, previous history of turning around loss making 
contracts and correspondence with clients where appropriate.
The Group’s accounting policy on revenue recognition is shown in the ‘Principal 
accounting policies – Group’ section of the financial statements and related 
disclosures are included in notes 1, 15 and 16. The Audit Committee identified 
revenue recognition as a primary area of judgement in its report on page 62 
where the Audit Committee also described the action that it has taken to 
address this issue. 
Key observations
Based on our audit work, we did not identify any material misstatement in the 
revenue recognised in the year to 31 December 2017 or in the onerous contract 
provision as at that date.

Key Audit Matter – Group How the matter was addressed in the audit – Group 
Risk 2 – Goodwill impairment Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
The Directors are required to make an 
annual assessment to determine whether 
the carrying value of goodwill of £193.6m 
is impaired. Past experience has 
indicated that there is significant 
headroom in the goodwill balance relating 
to the Social Housing division cash 
generating unit (‘CGU’) but limited 
headroom in the goodwill balance relating 
to the Care division CGU, which accounts 
for £112.3m of the carried goodwill. 
The process for assessing whether 
an impairment exists under IAS 36 
‘Impairment of Assets’ is complex. 
Calculating the value in use, through 
forecasting cash flows related to CGUs 
and the determination of the appropriate 
discount rate and other assumptions to 
be applied can be highly judgemental and 
can significantly impact the results of the 
impairment review.
We therefore identified the impairment 
review of goodwill undertaken by 
management in relation to the Care 
division as a significant risk, which was 
one of the most significant assessed risks 
of material misstatement.
 → obtaining management’s discounted cash flow forecast for the Care division 
used in the impairment review and comparing it to our understanding of the 
division and recalculating the arithmetical accuracy of those calculations;
 → testing and challenging the assumptions utilised in the impairment models, 
including the ability for the Group to recruit and retain the appropriate levels of 
carers, the rate at which the Group can pass National Living Wage increases on 
to customers, the rate at which the Group can increase its contracted hours and 
the discount rates and terminal values used;
 → considering whether the market level assumptions used were appropriate and 
where possible, benchmarking these assumptions against available industry 
data; and
 → testing the accuracy of management’s forecasting through a comparison of 
budget to actual data and historical variance trends and investigating the cash 
flows for exceptional or unusual items or assumptions.
The Group’s accounting policy on impairment is shown in the ‘Principal accounting 
policies – Group’ section of the financial statements and related disclosures are 
included in note 10. The Audit Committee identified carrying value of goodwill as a 
primary area of judgement in its report on page 61, where the Audit Committee 
also described the action that it has taken to address this issue. 
Key observations
Based on our audit work, we found the valuation methodologies and assumptions 
made in management’s assessment of goodwill impairment were appropriate. We 
consider that the Group’s disclosure is sufficient and have found no material 
errors in calculations.
Risk 3 – Defined benefit 
pension schemes Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
The Group operates two defined benefit 
pension schemes and is an admitted body 
of a number of other defined benefit 
pension schemes. At 31 December 2017 
the defined benefit pension schemes 
had a combined net surplus of £52m, of 
which £22m is recognised in the financial 
statements as recoverable. The gross 
value of the pension assets and 
obligations which form the net surplus 
amounted to £510m and £458m 
respectively.
The measurement of the obligations 
in%accordance with IAS 19 (revised) 
‘Employee Benefits’ involves significant 
judgement and their valuation is subject 
to complex actuarial assumptions. Small 
variations in those actuarial assumptions 
can lead to a materially different value of 
pension liabilities being recognised within 
the Group financial statements.
We therefore identified the valuation of 
the defined benefit pension schemes 
obligations as a significant risk, which 
was one of the most significant assessed 
risks of material misstatement.
 → utilising the expertise of our actuarial specialists in order to review the 
appropriateness of the assumptions used in the calculation of the obligations 
and testing the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and their 
inherent actuarial assumptions by benchmarking key assumptions such as 
discount rates, wages and salary growth rates and mortality rates to available 
market data; 
 → testing the accuracy of underlying membership data utilised by the Group’s 
actuaries for the purpose of calculating the scheme liabilities by selecting a 
sample of employees and agreeing membership to underlying records; and
 → directly confirming the existence and valuation of pension scheme assets with 
asset managers for Group schemes and analysing the movements on assets 
for admitted body schemes.
The Group’s accounting policy on defined benefit pensions is shown in the 
‘Principal accounting policies – Group’ section of the financial statements and 
related disclosures are included in note 26. The Audit Committee identified 
defined benefit pension valuation as a primary area of judgement in its report on 
page 62, where the Audit Committee also described the action that it has taken 
to address this issue. 
Key observations
Based on our audit work, we found the actuarial assumptions to be within an 
acceptable spectrum. We consider that the Group’s disclosure appropriately 
describes the significant degree of inherent uncertainty in the assumptions 
and estimates and the potential impact on future periods of revisions to these 
estimates. We found no material errors in calculations.
We have no key audit matters to report in relation to the Parent Company.

Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality in determining the nature, 
timing and extent of our audit work and in evaluating the results of that work. 
Materiality was determined as follows:
Materiality measure Group Parent
Financial 
statements 
as a whole
£1.62m which is 4.5% of the Group’s preliminary 
earnings before interest, tax and amortisation.
This benchmark is considered the most appropriate 
because it is the key financial measure by which 
management assess the performance of the Group 
and is used to report to investors on the financial 
performance of the Group.
Materiality for the current year is lower than 
the level that we determined for the year ended 
31 December 2016 as a result of the decreased 
earnings before interest, tax and amortisation 
in the current year.
£0.6m which is 1% of the Company’s total assets 
excluding amounts owed by Group undertakings.
This benchmark is considered the most appropriate 
because the principal activity is that of an investment 
holding company .
Materiality for the current year is higher than 
the level that we determined for the year ended 
31 December 2016 as a result of the increase 
in total assets of the Company. 
Performance 
materiality used 
to drive the extent 
of our testing
Based on our risk assessment, including the 
Group ’ s overall control environment, we determined 
a performance materiality of 65% of the financial 
statement materiality .
We used a threshold of 75% in the prior year 
and the decrease is based on an assessment 
of current year risks.
Based on our risk assessment, including 
the Company’s overall control environment, 
we determined a performance materiality of 
75% of the financial statement materiality. 
This is consistent with performance materiality 
in the prior year.
Specific materiality We determined a lower level of specific materiality 
for certain areas such as Directors’ remuneration 
and related party transactions.
We determined a lower level of specific materiality 
for certain areas such as directors’ remuneration

Communication 
of misstatements 
to the audit 
committee
We communicate misstatements exceeding £81,000 
and misstatements below that threshold that, in our 
view, warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.
We communicate misstatements exceeding £30,000

An overview of the scope of our audit 
Our audit approach was a risk-based approach founded on a 
thorough understanding of the Group’s business, its environment 
and risk profile. In order to address the risks described above as 
identified during our planning procedures, we performed a full 
scope audit of the financial statements of the Parent Company , 
Mears Group PLC and of the Group’s operations throughout 
the UK.
The companies of the Group were evaluated by the Group 
audit team based on a measure of materiality considered 
as a percentage of total Group assets, revenues and earnings 
before taxes, to assess the significance of the component and 
to determine the planned audit response. For those components 
that we determined to be significant components, either a full 
scope approach or specific procedures in relation to specific 
balances and transactions were carried out. This approach was 
determined based on their relative materiality to the Group and 
our assessment of audit risk; this approach is in line with our 
approach used in the prior year .
The Group’s companies vary significantly in size. We performed 
full scope audits at six companies. Specific audit procedures 
over certain balances and transactions were performed on 
a further four companies, to give appropriate coverage of all 
material balances at both divisional and Group levels. T ogether , 
the reporting units subject to audit procedures, being full scope 
and specific procedures, were responsible for 89% of the Group’s 
revenues, 59% of the Group’s earnings before, interest, tax and 
amortisation and 60% of Group’s total assets. We performed 
analytical procedures over 41 companies.
For significant components requiring a full scope approach 
an interim visit was conducted before the year end to undertake 
substantive procedures in advance of the final visit and to 
evaluate the Group’s internal control environment. We sought 
wherever possible, to rely on the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal controls which allows us to reduce substantive testing. 
We then undertook substantive testing on significant 
transactions and material account balances, including the 
procedures outlined above in relation to the key risks. For 
the components where specific procedures were carried 
out a similar testing strategy was applied, focused on the 
significant transactions and material account balances.
The remaining non-significant components of the Group 
were subject to analytical procedures over their financial 
performance and position after taking into account the risks 
identified above and the significance of the component to 
the Group. The charts below summarise the extent of our 
audit approach in relation to key audit matters:

misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or 
apparent material misstatements, we are required to 
determine whether there is a material misstatement in the 
financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. 
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our

of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course 
of the audit:
 → the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements; and
 → the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been 
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report under the 
Companies Act 2006
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group 
and the Parent Company and its environment obtained in 
the course of the audit, we have not identified material 
misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report. 
Matters on which we are required to report by 
exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to 
report to you if, in our opinion:
 → adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
 → the Parent Company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 → certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or
 → we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit. 
Responsibilities of Directors for the 
financial statements
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities 
statement set out on page 82 the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such 
internal control as the directors determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are 
responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to 
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and 
to issue an Auditor’s Report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not 
a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs 
(UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions 
of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
We are responsible for obtaining reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements taken as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an 
unavoidable risk that material misstatements of the financial 
statements may not be detected, even though the audit is 
properly planned and performed in accordance with the ISAs 
(UK). Our audit approach is a risk-based approach and is 
explained more fully in the ‘An overview of the scope of our 
audit’ section of our Audit Report.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
This description forms part of our Auditor’s Report.
Other matters which we are required to address
We were first appointed by Mears Group PLC to audit the 
financial statements for the year ending 31 December 1996 
and subsequent financial periods. The period of total 
uninterrupted engagement is 22 years, covering the years 
ending 31 December 1996 to 31 December 2017.
The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent 
Company and we remain independent of the Group and 
the Parent Company in conducting our audit.
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report 
to the Audit Committee.

Financial statements Principal accounting policies – Group
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and therefore 
the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU International Accounting Standards Regulations. The financial 
statements are prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial instruments 
and share-based payments.
The accounting policies remain unchanged from the previous year except for the modification of a number of standards 
with effect from 1 January 2017. Changes include Disclosure Initiative (Amendments to IAS 7), Recognition of Deferred Tax 
Assets for Unrecognised Losses (Amendments to IAS 12) and Annual Improvements 2014–2016 (which made amendments 
to IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’). The adoption of these amendments had no material effect on the Group’s 
financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of 
estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and 
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the year. Although these estimates are based on the Directors’ best 
knowledge of the amounts, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. The most significant estimates made by 
the Directors in these financial statements are set out in ‘Use of judgements and estimates’ on pages 100 to 102.
Mears Group PLC is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales (registration number 3232863). Its registered office and 
principal place of business is 1390 Montpellier Court, Gloucester Business Park, Brockworth, Gloucester GL3 4AH. Mears Group 
PLC’s shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Directors consider that, as at the date of approving the financial statements, there is a reasonable expectation that the 
Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. The Directors have 
discussed the principal risks and uncertainties of the business in the Risk Management section on pages 22 to 26.
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated Balance Sheet includes the assets and liabilities of the Company and its subsidiaries and is made up to 
31 December 2017. Entities over which the Group has the ability to exercise control over financial and operating policies are 
accounted for as subsidiaries. Control is achieved where the Company has existing rights that give it the current ability to direct 
the activities that affect the Company’s returns and exposure or rights to variable returns from the entity. Interests acquired in 
entities are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition and interests sold are consolidated up to the date of disposal.
All significant intercompany transactions and balances between Group enterprises, including unrealised profits arising 
from intra-group transactions, are eliminated on consolidation; no profit is taken on sales between Group companies.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity 
therein. Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and 
the non-controlling shareholders’ share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Total comprehensive income is 
attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interest having a deficit balance.
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have the rights to the net assets of the 
arrangement. Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, 
the Group’s share of post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement; the cost of the 
investment in a given joint venture, together with the Group’s share of that entity’s post-acquisition changes to shareholders’ 
funds, is included in investments within the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The acquisition method involves the recognition at fair 
value of all identifiable assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities of the subsidiary at the acquisition date, regardless 
of whether or not they were recorded in the financial statements of the subsidiary prior to acquisition. On initial recognition, the 
assets and liabilities of the subsidiary are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their fair values, which are also used 
as the bases for subsequent measurement in accordance with the Group accounting policies. Goodwill is stated after 
separating out identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the 
Group’s share of the identifiable net assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Where applicable, the consideration for an acquisition includes any assets or liabilities arising from a contingent consideration 
arrangement, measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost 
of acquisition where they result from additional information obtained up to one year from the acquisition date about facts and 
circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration 
classified as an asset or liability are recognised in accordance with IAS 39 in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Mears Group PLC
Annual report and accounts 2017
Financial statements Principal accounting policies – Group continued
Business combinations continued
Costs relating to acquisitions in the year have been expensed.
For transactions with non-controlling parties that do not result in a change of control, the difference between the fair value of 
the consideration paid and the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted is recognised in equity.
Any business combinations prior to 1 January 2010 were accounted for in accordance with the standards in place at the time, 
which differ in the following respects: transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition formed part of the acquisition 
costs; contingent consideration was recognised if, and only if, the Group had a present obligation, the economic outflow was 
more likely than not and a reliable estimate was determinable; and subsequent adjustments to the contingent consideration 
were recognised as part of goodwill.
Property, plant and equipment 
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost, net of depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure 
that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or 
recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item 
will flow into the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the 
Consolidated Income Statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated to write down the cost less estimated residual value 
over their estimated useful economic lives. The rates generally applicable are:
Freehold buildings   – 2% p.a., straight line
Leasehold improvements  – over the period of the lease, straight line
Plant and machinery  – 25% p.a., reducing balance
Fixtures, fittings and equipment – 25% p.a., reducing balance
Motor vehicles   – 25% p.a., reducing balance
Residual values are reviewed annually and updated if appropriate. The carrying value is reviewed for impairment in the period if 
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. An asset’s carrying value is written 
down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within 
administrative expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Intangible assets
In accordance with IFRS 3 (Revised) ‘Business Combinations’ , an intangible asset acquired in a business combination is deemed to 
have a cost to the Group of its fair value at the acquisition date. The fair value of the intangible asset reflects market expectations about 
the probability that the future economic benefits embodied in the asset will flow to the Group. Where an intangible asset might 
be separable, but only together with a related tangible or intangible asset, the group of assets is recognised as a single asset 
separately from goodwill where the individual fair values of the assets in the Group are not reliably measurable. Where the 
individual fair values of the complementary assets are reliably measurable, the Group recognises them as a single asset 
provided the individual assets have similar useful lives. Intangible assets are amortised over the useful economic life of those 
assets.
Development costs incurred on software development are capitalised when all the following conditions are satisfied:
 → completion of the software module is technically feasible so that it will be available for use;
 → the Group intends to complete the development of the module and use it;
 → the software will be used in generating probable future economic benefits; 
 → there are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use the software; and
 → the expenditure attributable to the software during its development can be measured reliably.
92
Mears Group PLC
Annual report and accounts 2017
Financial statements Intangible assets continued
Costs incurred making intellectual property available for use (including any associated borrowing costs) are capitalised when all 
of the following conditions are satisfied:
 → completion of the data set is technically feasible so that it will be available for use;
 → the Group intends to complete the preparation of the data and use it;
 → the data will be used in generating probable future economic benefits; 
 → there are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the data set and to use it; and
 → the expenditure attributable to the intellectual property during its development can be measured reliably.
Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred. Careful judgement by management is 
applied when deciding whether the recognition requirements for development costs have been met. This is necessary as the 
economic success of any development is uncertain and may be subject to future technical problems at the time of recognition. 
Judgements are based on the information available at each balance sheet date. In addition, all internal activities related to the 
research and development of new software are continually monitored by management.
The cost of an internally generated intangible asset comprises all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce and 
prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Directly attributable costs include 
employee costs incurred on software development.
Amortisation commences upon completion of the asset and is shown within other administrative expenses. Until the asset is 
available for use on completion of the project, the assets are subject to impairment testing only. Development expenditure is 
amortised over the period expected to benefit.
The identifiable intangible assets and associated periods of amortisation are as follows:
Order book   – over the period of the order book, typically three years
Client relationships  – over the period expected to benefit, typically five years
Development expenditure  – over four to five years, straight line
Intellectual property  – over the period of usefulness of the intellectual property, typically five years
Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents any excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the Group’s 
interest in the fair value of the entity’s identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and is capitalised as a separate item. Goodwill 
is recognised as an intangible asset.
Under the business combinations exemption of IFRS 1, goodwill previously written off directly to reserves under UK GAAP is not 
recycled to the Consolidated Income Statement on calculating a gain or loss on disposal.
Impairment
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable 
cash flows: cash-generating units (CGUs). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at 
CGU level. Goodwill is allocated to those CGUs that are expected to benefit from synergies of the related business combination and 
represent the lowest level within the Group at which management monitors the related cash flows.
Goodwill or CGUs that include goodwill and those intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least 
annually. All other individual assets or CGUs are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the amount by which the asset or CGU’s carrying 
amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less 
costs to sell, and value in use based on an internal discounted cash flow evaluation. Impairment losses recognised for CGUs, to 
which goodwill has been allocated, are credited initially to the carrying amount of goodwill. Any remaining impairment loss is 
charged pro-rata to the other assets in the CGU. With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for 
indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist.

Assets held for sale
Assets held for sale are recognised at the lower of their carrying amount and their fair value less costs to sell and separately 
presented on the face of the balance sheet. These assets are expected to be held for a limited duration prior to being sold. 
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is the actual purchase price of materials.
Work in progress
Work in progress is included in inventories after deducting any foreseeable losses and payments on account not matched with 
revenue. Work in progress represents costs incurred on contracts that cannot be matched with contract work accounted for as 
revenue. Work in progress is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises materials, direct labour and any 
subcontracted work that has been incurred in bringing the inventories and work in progress to their present location and condition.
Amounts recoverable on contracts
Amounts recoverable on contracts are included in trade and other receivables and represent revenue recognised in excess 
of payments on account.
Accounting for taxes
Income tax comprises current and deferred taxation.
Current tax assets and/or liabilities comprise those obligations to, or claims from, fiscal authorities that are unpaid at the 
balance sheet date. They are calculated according to the tax rates and tax laws applicable to the accounting periods to which 
they relate, based on the taxable profit for the year.
Where an item of income or expense is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, any related tax generated is recognised as 
a component of tax expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. Where an item is recognised directly to equity or presented 
within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, any related tax generated is treated similarly.
Deferred taxation is the tax expected to be repayable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted 
for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred taxation liabilities are generally recognised on all taxable temporary differences in full with no discounting. Deferred 
taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. However , deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability, unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting profit.
Deferred taxation is calculated using the tax rates and laws that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or 
the asset is realised, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. The carrying value of deferred 
taxation assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable 
profits will be available against which taxable temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is charged or credited to either the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or equity to the extent that it relates to items 
charged or credited. Deferred tax relating to items charged or credited directly to equity is also credited or charged to equity .
Revenue
Revenue is measured in accordance with IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’ at the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable, for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of rebates and 
discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Housing
Revenue is recognised when the outcome of a job or contract can be estimated reliably; revenue associated with the transaction is 
recognised by reference to the stage of completion of work at the balance sheet date. The outcome of the transaction is deemed 
to be able to be estimated reliably when all the following conditions are satisfied:
 → the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
 → it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity;
 → the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date can be measured reliably; and
 → the costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction can be measured reliably.
Whilst all Housing contracts can fit within the guidelines laid down for revenue recognition as detailed above, the alternative 
contractual pricing mechanisms do result in different methods of assessing the stage of completion. The Group has therefore 
recognised revenue dependent on the nature of transactions in line with IAS 18.
94
Mears Group PLC
Annual report and accounts 2017
Financial statements Revenue continued
Housing continued
There are some contracts where we are entitled to a fee to reimburse the costs relating to a new contract start-up. This fee is 
sometimes paid on commencement or paid in instalments over an extended period. Where the contractual entitlement to this 
income crystallises upon commencement, the revenue is recognised. All costs relating to pre-commencement and mobilisation 
are written off as they are incurred.
There are numerous contractual pricing mechanisms but one can broadly divide these into five types.
Schedule of rates (SOR) contracts
There is an element of SOR in the majority of contracts. At tender stage we enter a price for each of the numerous tasks carried 
out in respect of property maintenance. Typically, we price for uplift or a discount against a pre-priced schedule. This price will, 
in some cases, be an all-encompassing price for the cost of direct works, the local site overhead, central overhead and profit 
contribution. In other instances, the SOR tendered may only recover direct works with an alternative mechanism to recover the 
other elements. Wherever possible, we seek to identify all works tickets received individually and capture costs and billing at the 
individual work ticket level. In so doing, this allows revenue to be recognised with a high degree of accuracy. Typically, reactive 
maintenance works are invoiced within a month of completion; hence, the majority of revenue recognised has already been 
valued at the individual work ticket level and the significant majority has been subsequently settled. The only element of 
revenue or profit recognition that requires judgement is against those jobs that are part complete or those completed works 
that have not been subject to a final valuation.
For part completed works, consideration needs to be given as to whether the Group will recover the transaction costs incurred. 
Whether the outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably needs to be considered contract by contract based on historic 
outcomes and knowledge of any events that may affect future job profitability. Where the outcome of the transaction cannot be 
estimated reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent that the costs incurred are anticipated to be recovered. Where the 
outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably, an element of anticipated profit is recognised within revenue to the extent 
that historic outcomes adjusted for knowledge of any events that may affect future job profitability support such recognition.
For completed but not yet priced works, the outcome of the individual valued work tickets is not reviewed individually for the 
purposes of profit and revenue recognition. However, given the high volume of historical data to provide an accurate indication of 
underlying contract margin at a particular site, the Group considers that the application of an anticipated profit margin on cost 
to all completed and unbilled works produces a reliable measure.
For completed and priced works, the likely outcome for the individual work ticket can be determined individually for the purposes of 
profit and revenue recognition. The Group considers that the recognition of the anticipated profit for the individual job within 
revenue is appropriate.
Full provision is made in respect of any job if a future loss is foreseen.
Open book contracts
Typically, the open book element of contracts relates to the local site overhead. A priced overhead model is usually provided to a 
client at tender stage and the client pays the Group a fixed sum for maintaining this local site. This is typically an agreed fixed 
price. Revenue is recognised in line with cost incurred and similarly the attributable profit recognised against that cost.
Any over or underspends are typically at the risk of the Group. The actual overhead spend is often subject to an open book 
review which is then used as the basis for agreeing future pricing.
On the rare occasions that a contract does recover costs under a pure ‘cost plus’ arrangement, revenue is recognised in line with 
cost incurred and similarly the attributable profit recognised against that cost.
Full provision is made in respect of any contract if a future loss is foreseen.
Lump sum contracts
This type of contract is becoming more commonplace. To avoid the onerous burden of administering a high volume, low value 
activity, the pricing mechanism is reduced to either a price per ticket or a price per property. Historically, many gas servicing and 
breakdown contracts have been procured on a lump sum basis. However, it is now becoming increasingly common within the 
reactive maintenance environment. There is typically an exclusions list for works that are not considered repairs and not 
deemed to fall within the lump sum price. It is normal for this excluded element of the works to be billed under an SOR 
arrangement.
For practical purposes, in the majority of lump sum contracts, revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the 
contract term. There is not a material impact of seasonality in a client’s reactive maintenance spend (in terms of either volume 
or value of orders received). In terms of the lump sum element of the contract, the revenue is split evenly across 
the twelve-monthly reporting periods. No element of revenue is either advanced or deferred.

Mears Group PLC
Annual report and accounts 2017
Financial statements Revenue continued
Housing continued
Lump sum contracts continued
There are a small number of lump sum contracts where recognising revenue on a straight-line basis would be inappropriate. 
These are contracts where the phasing of the works over the contract term varies materially over the period of the contract and 
there is a mismatch between the delivery of works and the timing of invoicing against those works. For these contracts, the 
Group has historically reverted to recognising revenue based on the proportion of costs incurred to date compared with the 
estimated total costs of the contract.
Full provision is made in respect of any contract if a future loss is foreseen.
Rental income
Rental income relating to Housing Management activities is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the lease.
Where initial costs are required to make good the housing to perform Housing Management activities, a straight-line basis of 
revenue recognition would not be appropriate. Where there are initial costs, revenue is recognised based on the proportion of 
costs incurred to date compared with the estimated total costs of the contract. Full provision is made in respect of any contract 
if a future loss is foreseen.
Construction income
Revenue reflects the contract activity during the year and is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable. 
When the outcome can be assessed reliably, contract revenue and associated costs are recognised as revenue and expenses 
respectively by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date. The stage of completion of 
the contract at the balance sheet date is usually assessed by comparing the proportion of costs incurred to estimated total 
contract costs. Where this is not representative, contract milestones are used as a basis of assessing the stage of completion. 
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that contract costs incurred will be recoverable. In the absence of a contract for sale, construction revenue is 
recognised at legal completion of the sale. Contract costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
In the case of a fixed price contract, the outcome of a construction contract is deemed to be estimated reliably when all the 
following conditions are satisfied:
 → it is probable that economic benefits associated with the contract will flow to the Group;
 → both the contract costs to complete the contract and the stage of completion at the balance sheet date can be measured 
reliably; and
 → the contract costs attributable to the contract can be clearly identified and measured reliably so that actual contract costs 
incurred can be compared with prior estimates.
The gross amount due from customers for contract work is presented as an asset for all contracts in progress for which costs 
incurred, plus recognised profits (less recognised losses), exceed progress billings. The gross amount due to customers for 
contract work is presented as a liability for all contracts in progress for which progress billings exceed costs incurred plus 
recognised profits (less losses).
Full provision is made for losses on all contracts in the year in which the future loss is first foreseen.
Care
Revenue is recognised when the actual care has been delivered and is generally based on a price per time period of care 
delivered. Revenue relating to care delivered and not invoiced is accrued and disclosed under trade and other receivables as 
amounts recoverable on contracts. Certain ‘block’ contracts guarantee a certain level of revenue. Revenue attributable to any 
unused capacity under block contracts, where the Group is able to invoice for contracted services not provided, is recognised 
when the recovery of income is considered virtually certain. There is a minimal requirement for judgement in recognising 
Care revenue.
The Group utilises rostering systems to manage care. These systems allow for planning a rota for each staff member, together 
with the corresponding pay and bill rates for the particular service type, length of service and time of delivery. The results are 
very accurate in the calculation of billable time, income and corresponding employee pay for a particular contract, branch 
or region.
Accrued income is determined by applying an average historical billing rate to the number of unbilled hours delivered at the 
balance sheet date. Variances are reviewed in the following month once actual billing is known. The rostering systems allow 
unbilled hours to be calculated based on planned, rostered and actual visits along with the corresponding pay and bill rates for 
the particular service type, length of service and time of delivery.

Financial statements Segment reporting
Segment information is presented in respect of the Group’s operating segments based upon the format that the Group reports 
to its chief operating decision makers.
The Group considers that the chief operating decision makers are the Executive Directors and Senior Executives of the business.
Exceptional costs
Exceptional costs are disclosed on the face of the Consolidated Income Statement where these are material and considered 
necessary to explain the underlying financial performance of the Group. They are either one off in nature or necessary elements of 
expenditure to derive future benefits for the Group which have not been capitalised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Costs of restructure are only considered to be exceptional where the restructure is transformational and the resultant cost 
is significant.
Acquisition costs are only considered to be exceptional where the acquisition and the resultant cost are significant.
Employee benefits
Retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes as follows:
i) Defined contribution pensions
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions to an independent entity. 
The Group has no legal obligations to pay further contributions after payment of the fixed contribution.
The contributions recognised in respect of defined contribution plans are expensed as they fall due. Liabilities and assets may 
be recognised if underpayment or prepayment has occurred and are included in current liabilities or current assets as they are 
normally of a short-term nature.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund.
ii) Defined benefit pensions
The Group contributes to defined benefit schemes which require contributions to be made to separately administered funds.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, 
usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and salary. The legal obligations for any benefits from 
this kind of pension plan remain with the Group, even if plan assets for funding the defined benefit plan have been set aside.
Scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit funding method, applying the principal actuarial assumptions at the 
balance sheet date. Assets are measured at market value. In accordance with IFRIC 14, the asset that is recognised is restricted 
to the amount by which the IAS 19 (Revised) service cost is expected, over the lifetime of the scheme, to exceed funding 
contributions payable in respect of accruing benefits.
Where the Group has a contractual obligation to make good any deficit in its share of a Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) 
but also has the right to recover the costs of making good any deficit from the Group’s client, the fair value of that guarantee 
asset has been recognised and disclosed. The right to recover costs is limited to exclude situations where the Group causes the 
scheme to incur service costs in excess of those which would have been incurred were the members employed within Local 
Government. The right to recover costs is also limited to situations where the cap on employer contributions payable by the 
Group is not set so as to contribute to reducing the deficit in the scheme. Movements in the guarantee asset are taken to the 
Consolidated Income Statement and to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income to match the movement in 
pension assets and liabilities.
Actuarial gains and losses are taken to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as incurred. For this purpose, 
actuarial gains and losses comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising 
because of differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred.
Other movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, including the current 
service cost, any past service cost and the effect of curtailments or settlements. The net interest cost is also charged to the 
Consolidated Income Statement. The amount charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of these plans in 
included within operating costs.
The Group’s contributions to the scheme are paid in accordance with the rules of the schemes and the recommendations of the 
scheme actuary.

Financial statements Employee benefits continued
Share-based employee remuneration
All share-based payment arrangements that were granted after 7 November 2002 and had not vested before 1 January 2005 are 
recognised in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS 2.
The Group operates equity-settled and cash-settled share-based remuneration plans for its employees. All employee services 
received in exchange for the grant of any share-based remuneration are measured at their fair values. These are indirectly 
determined by reference to the fair value (excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) of the share options 
awarded. Their value is determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently remeasured unless the conditions on which the 
award was granted are modified. The fair value at the date of the grant is calculated using the Black Scholes option pricing 
model and the cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are made to reflect expected and 
actual forfeitures during the vesting period. For SAYE plans, employees are required to contribute towards the plan. This 
non-vesting condition is taken into account in calculating the fair value of the option at the grant date.
All share-based remuneration is ultimately recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. For equity-settled 
share-based payments there is a corresponding credit to the share-based payment reserve; for cash-settled share-based 
payments the Group recognises a liability at the balance sheet date.
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs up to the nominal value 
of the shares issued are allocated to share capital, with any excess being recorded as share premium.
Leases
In accordance with IAS 17 ‘Leases’ , the economic ownership of a leased asset is transferred to the lessee if they bear 
substantially all the risks and rewards related to the ownership of the leased asset. The related asset is recognised at the time 
of inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the lease payments plus incidental 
payments, if any, to be borne by the lessee. A corresponding amount is recognised as a finance leasing liability, irrespective of 
whether some of these lease payments are payable upfront at the date of inception of the lease.
Subsequent accounting for assets held under finance lease agreements, i.e. depreciation methods and useful lives, correspond 
to those applied to comparable acquired assets. The corresponding finance leasing liability is reduced by lease payments less 
finance charges, which are expensed to finance costs. Finance charges represent a constant periodic rate of interest on the 
outstanding balance of the finance lease liability.
All other leases are treated as operating leases. Payment on operating lease agreements is recognised as an expense on 
a straight-line basis over the lease term. Associated costs, such as maintenance and insurance, are expensed as incurred. 
The Group does not act as a lessor.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Group becomes party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. The principal financial assets and liabilities of the Group are as follows:
Financial assets
When financial assets are recognised initially under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ , they 
are measured at fair value, net of transaction costs other than for financial assets carried at fair value through the Consolidated 
Income Statement.
The Group’s financial assets are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as current assets, except for those maturing more 
than twelve months after the balance sheet date, whereupon they are classified as non-current assets. The Group’s financial 
assets comprise ‘Trade and other receivables’ , ‘Amounts recoverable on contracts’ and ‘Cash at bank and in hand’ in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, amounts recoverable on contracts and cash at bank and in hand are non-derivative financial assets 
with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Trade receivables and amounts recoverable on 
contracts are initially recorded at fair value net of transaction costs, being invoiced value less any provisional estimate for 
impairment should this be necessary due to a loss event. Trade receivables are subsequently remeasured at invoiced value, less 
an updated provision for impairment. Any change in their value through impairment or reversal of impairment is recognised in 
the Consolidated Income Statement.
Provisions against trade receivables and amounts recoverable on contracts are made when objective evidence is received that 
the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount 
of the writedown is determined as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated 
future cash flows. Individually significant balances are reviewed separately for impairment based on the credit terms agreed 
with the customer. Other balances are grouped into credit risk categories and reviewed in aggregate.

Financial statements Financial instruments continued
Loans and receivables continued
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand and bank deposits available with no notice or less than three 
months’ notice from inception that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts are presented 
as current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances. 
Following initial recognition, financial assets are subsequently remeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method.
Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities are overdrafts, trade and other payables including contingent consideration, and interest rate 
swaps. They are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet line items ‘Short-term borrowings and overdrafts’ , ‘Trade and other 
payables’ , ‘Financial liabilities’ and ‘Other liabilities’ .
All interest related charges are recognised as an expense in ‘Finance cost’ in the Consolidated Income Statement with the 
exception of those that are directly attributable to the construction of a qualifying asset, which are capitalised as part of 
that asset.
Bank and other borrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of transaction costs. Gains and losses arising on the 
repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance revenue and finance costs. Borrowing 
costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred with the exception of those which are directly 
attributable to the construction of a qualifying asset, which are capitalised as part of that asset.
Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their fair value on initial recognition and subsequently at 
amortised cost.
Contingent consideration is initially recognised at fair value and is subsequently measured at fair value through the Consolidated 
Income Statement.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate risks arising from operational and 
financing activities.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value, with mark-to-market movements 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement except where cash flow hedge accounting is applied.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the 
balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Hedge accounting for interest rate swaps
Where an interest rate swap is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of an existing or highly probable 
forecast loan interest payment, the effective part of any valuation gain or loss on the swap instrument is recognised in 
‘Other comprehensive income’ in the hedging reserve. The cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement at the same time as the hedged transaction. The ineffective part of any gain or loss is 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement immediately.
When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the 
cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction 
occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer probable, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in 
the Consolidated Income Statement immediately.
Nature and purpose of each reserve in equity
Share capital is determined using the nominal value of shares that have been issued.
Share premium represents the difference between the nominal value of shares issued and the total consideration received.
Equity-settled shared-based employee remuneration is credited to the share-based payment reserve until the related share 
options are exercised. Upon exercise the share-based payment reserve is transferred to retained earnings.
The hedging reserve represents the effective part of any gain or loss on a cash flow hedge which has not been removed from 
equity and recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.

The merger reserve relates to the difference between the nominal value and total consideration in respect of the acquisition of 
Careforce Group plc, Supporta plc and Morrison Facilities Services Limited where the Company was entitled to the merger relief 
offered by the Companies Act.
Dividends
Dividend distributions payable to equity shareholders are included in ‘Current financial liabilities’ when the dividends are 
approved in a general meeting prior to the balance sheet date.
Use of judgements and estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and 
the reported amounts of income and expenditure during the reported period. The estimates and associated judgements are 
based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the 
results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources.
The estimates and underlying judgements are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in 
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future 
periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, estimates and judgements have been made by management 
concerning the selection of useful lives of property, plant and equipment, provisions necessary for certain liabilities, when to 
recognise revenue on long-term contracts, actuarial judgements, discount rates used within impairment reviews, the underlying 
share price volatility for valuing equity-based payments and other similar evaluations. Actual amounts could differ from those 
estimates.
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised based on the stage of completion of job or contract activity. As described in the Revenue section on pages 
94 to 96, certain types of Housing pricing mechanisms and Care revenue require minimal judgement; however, Housing lump sum 
contracts and construction contracts do require judgements and estimates to be made to determine the stage of completion 
and the expected outcome for the individual contract.
Joint arrangements
The Group participates in a number of joint arrangements where control of the arrangement is shared with another party. A joint 
arrangement is classified as a joint operation or as a joint venture, depending on management’s assessment of the legal form 
and substance of the arrangement.
The classification can have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Group’s share of assets, liabilities, 
revenue, expenses and cash flows of joint operations would be included in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-
line basis, whereas the Group’s investment and share of results of joint ventures are shown within single line items in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Income Statement respectively.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Contract recoverability
Determining future contract profitability requires estimates of future revenues and costs to complete. In making these 
assessments there is a degree of inherent uncertainty. The Group utilises the appropriate expertise in determining these 
estimates and has well-established internal controls to assess and review the expected outcome.
Impairment of goodwill 
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimate of the value in use of the CGUs to which goodwill has been 
allocated. The value-in-use calculation involves an estimate of the future cash flows of the CGUs and also the selection of 
appropriate discount rates to calculate present values. Future cash flows are estimated using the current one-year budget 
forecast, extrapolated for a future growth rate. The estimated growth rates are based on past experience and knowledge of the 
individual sector’s markets. Changes in the estimated growth rate could result in variations to the carrying value of goodwill. The 
Directors consider that the estimates and judgements involved in determining the value in use of the Care CGU goodwill are the 
most significant and have therefore utilised the services of an external consultant to undertake this impairment review. The 
estimated cash flows and future growth rates are based on past experience and knowledge of the sector. The value in use is 
most sensitive to changes in the terminal growth rate, the explicit growth rate and the discount rate. The sensitivity to changes 
in these estimations is detailed in note 10.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Defined benefit liabilities 
A number of key estimates have been made, which are given below, which are largely dependent on factors outside the control 
of the Group:
 → inflation rates;
 → mortality;
 → discount rate; and
 → salary and pension increases.
Details of the particular estimates used are included in the pensions note. Sensitivity analysis for these key estimates 
is included in note 26.
Where the Group has a contractual obligation to make good any deficit in its share of an LGPS but also has the right to recover 
the costs of making good any deficit from the Group’s client, the fair value of that asset has been recognised and disclosed. The 
right to recover costs is limited to exclude situations where the Group causes the scheme to incur service costs in excess of 
those which would have been incurred were the members employed within Local Government. The Directors have made 
judgements in respect of whether any of the deficit is as a result of such situations.
The right to recover costs is also limited to situations where the cap on employer contributions to be suffered by the Group is not 
set so as to contribute to reducing the deficit in the scheme. The Directors, in conjunction with the scheme actuaries, have made 
judgements in respect of the predicted future service cost and contributions to the scheme to reflect this in the fair value of the 
asset recognised.
New standards and interpretations not yet applied
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’
On 1 January 2018, IFRS 15 replaces the existing revenue recognition accounting standards – IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 
‘Construction Contracts’ . This standard introduces a new revenue recognition model that recognises revenue either at a point in 
time or over time. The model features a contract-based five-step analysis of transactions to determine whether, how much and 
when revenue is recognised; this includes the matching of stand-alone selling prices to the satisfaction of performance 
obligations. The model is not expected to change the timing of revenue recognition for the Care revenue stream.
For Housing revenues, a small portion of the contract portfolio includes non-coterminous contracts which have been combined for 
the purposes of assessing the stage of completion for that operation as a whole. Under IFRS 15, revenue must be accounted for at 
the individual contract level. Therefore the contracts will be disaggregated and the assessment of revenue will depend on the 
performance obligations within the contract. The performance obligations of Housing revenues are categorised as: 
(a)  a series of distinct services, at the individual works order level, which are satisfied as each job becomes operationally completed; 
and
(b)  a single performance obligation, being the requirement to be available to provide the goods and services stipulated 
in the contract – this performance obligation is satisfied over time.
For revenue arising from rental income, the accounting methodology for lessor operating lease income will continue to be 
accounted for in accordance with IAS 17 ‘Leases’ . This accounting standard is superseded by IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ on 1 January 2019. 
Further information on implementation of IFRS 16 is below. Lessor operating lease rental income will continue to be recognised on 
a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Under IAS 18 and IAS 11, revenue was recognised in respect of contracts where 
initial property upgrade costs are incurred to make good the property to a standard appropriate for let to a tenant. Under IFRS 
15, no revenue will be recognised in respect of these initial costs. Under IFRS 15, the performance obligation in this type of 
contract is the let of each unit of property to a social housing tenant.
IFRS 15 includes a choice on the transitional adjustments on initial application. Management have chosen ‘modified 
retrospective adoption’ , which is to retrospectively apply the standard with the cumulative effect of applying IFRS 15 to the 
opening balance of retained earnings on 1 January 2018. Implementation will therefore not result in restatement of comparative 
period results. The transitional adjustment is a downward adjustment to opening retained earnings and opening trade and 
other receivables as at 1 January 2018. Management have concluded that the downward adjustment will be in the range of 
£13m to £20m.

Financial statements New standards and interpretations not yet applied continued
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’
IFRS 16 replaces the existing leasing accounting guidance, which includes IAS 17 ‘Leases’ and IFRIC 4 ‘Determining Whether 
an Arrangement Contains a Lease’ . The standard is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
The standard requires lessees to account for most contracts using an on-balance sheet model, with the distinction 
between operating and finance leases being removed. There is no change to the revenue recognition methodology for 
lessor operating leases.
The standard provides certain exemptions from recognising leases on the balance sheet, including where the asset is of low 
value or the lease term is twelve months or less. In addition, the standard makes changes to the definition of a lease to focus on, 
amongst other things, which party has the right to direct the use of the asset.
Under the new standard, the Group will be required to recognise right of use lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance 
sheet. The right of use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost (subject to certain exceptions) less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. Liabilities are 
measured based on the present value of future lease payments over the lease term. Subsequently, the lease liability is adjusted 
for interest and lease payments, as well as the impact of lease modifications, amongst others.
The recognition of the depreciation of right of use lease assets and interest on lease liabilities over the lease term will have no 
overall impact on profit before tax over the life of the lease; however, the result in any individual year will be impacted and the 
change in presentation of costs will likely be material to the Group’s key financial metrics. Under IAS 17, the charge is booked in 
full to operating profit. Metrics which will therefore be affected will include operating profit and operating margin, interest and 
interest cover, EBITDA and operating cash flow.
Furthermore, the principal amount of cash paid and interest in the cash flow statement will be presented separately as a 
financing activity. Operating lease payments under IAS 17 would have been presented as operating cash flows. There will be no 
overall net cash flow impact.
The Group has commenced work to understand the impact of the new standard and the project will complete during 2018. Work 
will include a detailed review of all lease contracts to establish lease classification, assessment of transition options, 
the quantification of financial impacts, design of future processes and the related systems changes, the assessment of the 
related impacts on the Group’s regulatory and commercial reporting requirements, and the impact on the Group’s long-term 
incentive schemes. The review is currently ongoing. Using information obtained in preparation of the annual financial statements, the 
Directors estimate that a right of use asset and the associated lease liability is likely to fall in the range of £80m to £140m at 31 
December 2017. This range is wide given uncertainty around primarily the variable lease payments, leases of less than twelve 
months in length and the application of low asset value exemption.
Information on the undiscounted amount of the Group’s operating lease commitments under IAS 17 ‘Leases’ , the current leasing 
standard, is disclosed in the Group’s annual financial statements. The leases substantially relate to property leases used to 
perform Housing activities as an operating lease lessor, and vehicle leases used in performing Housing activities.
Other new standards and amendments
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ specifies how an entity should classify and measure financial assets, including some hybrid 
contracts. The Group is expected to apply this standard for the Group’s 31 December 2018 financial statements but it is not 
expected to have a material effect on the Group’s financial statements.
A number of other standards have been modified. These include Disclosure Initiative (Amendments to IAS 7), Recognition of 
Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses (Amendments to IAS 12) and Classification and Measurement of Share-based 
Payment Transactions (Amendments to IFRS 2). None of these amendments are expected to have a material effect on the 
Group’s financial statements.

Financial statements 1. Segment reporting
Segment information is presented in respect of the Group’s operating segments. Segments are determined by reference to the 
internal reports reviewed by the Board.
The Group had two operating segments during the year:
 → Housing – services within this sector comprise a full housing management service predominantly to Local Authorities and 
other Registered Social Landlords; and
 → Care – services within this sector comprise personal care services to people in their own homes.
All of the Group’s activities are carried out within the United Kingdom and the Group’s principal reporting to its chief operating 
decision maker is not segmented by geography.
The principal financial measures used by the chief operating decision maker and the Board to review the performance of the 
operating segments are that of revenue growth and operating margins in both the core divisions of Housing and Care. The 
operating result utilised within the key performance measures is stated before amortisation of acquisition intangibles and 
costs relating to the long-term incentive plans.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was 481p. 
At 31 December 2017, 0.1m options had vested and were still exercisable at prices between 1p and 266p. These options had a 
weighted average exercise price of 79p and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.7 years.
The fair values of options granted were determined using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Significant inputs into the 
calculation include the market price at the date of grant and exercise prices. Furthermore, the calculation takes into account 
the future dividend yield, the share price volatility rate and the risk-free interest rate.

Mears Group PLC
Annual report and accounts 2017
Financial statements 5. Share-based employee remuneration continued
The underlying expected share price volatility was determined by reference to historical data. The Company expects the volatility of 
its share price to reduce as it matures. The risk-free interest rate was determined by the implied yield available on a zero-coupon 
Government bond at the date of grant. Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period 
due to failure to satisfy service conditions. In the case of the SAYE scheme, the expected forfeitures take account of the 
requirement to save throughout the life of the scheme. There were 1.6m options granted during the year and 0.2m options that 
lapsed during the year . The market price at 31 December 2017 was 410p and the range during 2017 was 377p to 530p.
All share-based employee remuneration will be settled in equity. The Group has no legal obligation to repurchase or settle 
the options.
The Group recognised the following expenses related to share-based payments:

All-employee share incentive plan
Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average quoted market price of the Company’s shares on the three dealing days 
prior to the date of grant. The vesting period is three years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the 
date of grant, the options expire. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves Mears before the options vest. All options issued 
under this plan have vested or were forfeited.
Unapproved Company Share Option Plan (CSOP)
Options are exercisable at nominal value. The vesting period is three years. If the options remain unexercised after a period 
of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves Mears before the options 
vest. With the introduction of the LTIP in 2008, the Remuneration Committee has decided that no further awards will be made 
under the unapproved share option plan. All options issued under this plan have vested or were forfeited.
Save As You Earn (SAYE) scheme
Options are available to all employees. Options are granted for a period of three years. Options are exercisable at a price based 
on the quoted market price of the Company’s shares at the time of invitation, discounted by up to 20%. Options are forfeited if 
the employee leaves Mears Group before the options vest, which impacts on the number of options expected to vest. If an 
employee stops saving but continues in employment, this is treated as a cancellation, which results in an acceleration of the 
share-based payment charge.
Special Incentive Plan 2007 (SIP)
The SIP was introduced in 2007 to reward the then Chief Executive Officer, Bob Holt, with premium priced options linked 
to long-term performance. The terms and conditions were subsequently amended on 3 July 2009. If the options remain 
unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire. There was a single award and no further 
awards will be made under this plan. All remaining options issued under this plan were exercised during 2017.
The Mears Group PLC Long-term Incentive Plan (L TIP)
The LTIP was introduced in October 2008 following shareholder approval. The award of options is offered to a small number 
of key senior management, subject to achieving performance conditions. No options have been issued under this plan since 
2010 and all options have vested.
Management Incentive Plan (MIP)
The MIP was introduced in 2013 following shareholder approval. The award of options is offered to a small number of key senior 
management. The MIP is a share-based payment plan which is settled through a combination of cash and shares. No further 
issues will be made under this plan and the remaining options vest in 2019.
Executive Incentive Plan (EIP)
The EIP was introduced in June 2017 following shareholder approval. The award of options is offered to key senior management 
subject to performance conditions as detailed on page 67 of the Remuneration Report. No options have been awarded under 
the EIP .

– temporary timing differences not previously recognised in deferred tax (33) (15)
– tax losses not previously recognised in deferred tax (26) (299)
– adjustment in respect of prior periods (420) (1,080)
Actual tax expense 1,139 3,676
Deferred tax is recognised on both temporary and permanent differences between the treatment of items for tax and 
accounting purposes. Deferred tax on the amortisation of acquisition intangibles is a permanent difference and arises because 
no tax relief is due on this kind of amortisation.
Tax losses generated in previous years which are expected to be utilised against future profits are recognised as a deferred tax 
asset and a subsequent charge arises as those losses are utilised. The majority of the charge of £1.1m (2016: charge of £0.6m) 
represents losses associated with previous acquisitions which were utilised in the year.
No deferred tax asset is recognised in respect of losses of £34.2m (2016: £31.3m) across several entities in the Group as it is not 
expected that they will be eligible to be utilised against profits in the future.
Deferred tax is also recognised on short-term temporary timing differences, primarily relating to provisions. These differences are 
expected to reverse in the following year and arise because tax relief is only available when the costs are incurred.

Capital allowances represent tax relief on the acquisition of property, plant and equipment and are spread over several years at 
rates set by legislation. These differ from depreciation, which is an estimate of the use of an item of property, plant and 
equipment over its useful life. Deferred tax is recognised, on the difference between the remaining value of such an asset for tax 
purposes and its carrying value in the accounts.

7. Discontinued activities
The Group previously completed the disposal of its Mechanical & Electrical division, which included an entity operating in 
the United Arab Emirates (‘Haydon LLC’). As part of that disposal, the Group ultimately retained the beneficial interest in 1% of 
the share capital of this UAE company due to the Group still carrying a number of performance guarantees in place at the time 
of the disposal which unravel as the underlying contracts reach the end of their defects liability period. 
At 31 December 2016, a balance of £3.4m was due from Haydon LLC and £13.7m of performance guarantees were outstanding. 
During the year, further loans of £3.8m were provided to Haydon LLC, to provide working capital funding to the company so as to 
mitigate the Group’s risk in respect of the performance guarantees. In November 2017, a number of performance guarantees to 
an aggregate value of £5.5m were called, resulting in a total balance of £12.7m due from Haydon LLC to the Group. After 
assessing the ability of Haydon LLC to settle this debt, the Group provided against the balance in full, as well as providing in full 
against the £3.8m of performance guarantees still outstanding at the year end.
The total amount provided of £16.5m (2016: £nil) is reported as a loss arising from discontinued operations in the 
Consolidated Income Statement and the £9.4m of related cash outflows have been reported as arising from discontinued 
operations in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

Goodwill on consolidation arises on the excess of cost of acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired on purchase 
of a company.
Purchased goodwill arises on the excess of cost of acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired on the purchase of 
the trade and assets of a business by the Group.
Revisions to goodwill additions in prior years relate to liabilities not accrued at the time of the acquisition. These revisions are 
not considered sufficiently material to warrant restatement of the prior year balances.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are any indications that 
goodwill may be impaired. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of cash-generating units (CGUs) 
according to the level at which management monitors that goodwill. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment 
losses.
The carrying value of goodwill is allocated to the following CGUs:

Care 99,651 — 99,651
193,236 406 193,642
An asset is impaired if its carrying value exceeds the unit’s recoverable amount, which is based upon value in use. 
At 31 December 2017 impairment reviews were performed by comparing the carrying value with the value in use for the CGUs to 
which goodwill has been allocated. 
The Housing CGU’s value in use is calculated from the Board-approved one-year budgeted cash flows and extrapolated cash 
flows for the next four years discounted at a post-tax discount rate of 8.0% over a five-year period with a terminal value. 
The impairment reviews incorporated a terminal growth assumption of 1.7%, in line with the UK long-term growth rate.

The Care CGU’s value in use is calculated from a detailed business plan deriving cash flows over a five-year review period, 
discounted at a post-tax discount rate of 8.3% over a five-year period with a terminal value. The impairment review incorporated a 
terminal growth assumption of 2.5%, which, whilst marginally higher than the UK long-term growth rate of 1.7%, is supported by 
the underlying demographics underpinning strong organic growth in adult social care.
The estimated growth rates are based on knowledge of the individual CGU’s sector and market and represent management’s 
base level expectations for future growth. Changes to revenue and direct costs are based on past experience and expectation of 
future changes within the markets of the CGUs. All CGUs have the same access to the Group’s Treasury function and borrowing 
arrangements to finance their operations.
The rates used were as follows:
Post-tax Pre-tax
Volume
growth Terminal
discount discount rate growth
rate rate (years 1–5) rate
Housing 8.00% 9.10% 5.00% 1.70%
Care 8.30% 9.47% 2.91% 2.50%
Housing
The contracts awarded within the Housing sector are significant in size and the contract terms typically average six years in duration. 
In addition, Mears has a good track record in retaining contracts on expiry and typically retains over 80% of expiring contracts.
Budgeted operating profits during the budget period are estimated by reference to the operating margin achieved in the period 
leading up to the start of the budget period, flexed for known changes in either the pricing mechanism or the cost base at a 
contract level. There is no inclusion of any anticipated efficiency improvements which have not been formally committed to 
before the year end.
The Directors consider that reasonably possible changes in these key assumptions would not cause a CGU’s carrying amount to 
exceed its recoverable amount.
Care
Management recognises that there remain significant difficulties within the homecare market, although the sector has seen 
improvements over the last 24 months. The introduction of the National Living Wage in April 2016 proved a significant boost for 
providers, with a large number of Local Authorities materially increasing their charge rates, recognising that too much of the 
cost increase in recent years had been absorbed by care providers. This trend continued following the subsequent rise in the 
National Living Wage in April 2017. Providers have typically passed these rate increases on to their carers in full, adding some 
stability in a sector where recruitment and retention represent a significant constraint. Management is particularly pleased that 
all Local Authorities in Scotland, which covers around one third of the care activities, who have adopted the Scottish Living Wage, 
which as at 1 April 2018 increases to £8.75 per hour. This compares to the statutory National Living Wage of £7.83 per hour. 
Notwithstanding these improvements, market conditions remain challenging. The Directors note that, given these pressures, 
a number of competitors are withdrawing from the homecare market, which reflects the difficult conditions but could in part also 
provide some opportunity. The Group remains highly selective in bidding new contract opportunities but the pipeline for new 
contract bidding remains healthy. Management will only bid where the contract pricing provides good visibility of profitability, 
including a clear mechanism for future price increases and where there lies a strategic opportunity to provide Housing services 
to the Local Authority client. Whilst there are still examples of poor commissioning practices, the Directors are confident there 
are sufficient new bidding opportunities to deliver against the Group’s growth forecast. 
As part of the annual impairment testing, management performed an extensive business planning process which involved 
a detailed review, on a contract-by-contract basis, of charge rates and carer pay rates. The process allowed management 
to appraise the performance of branches against objectives set, and further increased understanding of the main drivers 
behind financial performance at a contract level. A key driver around the operational and financial success of each contract 
continues to be the recruitment and retention of care workers. Carer pay rates continue to be the principal barrier to successful 
recruitment and retention, but in addition there are a number of factors around culture, working practices and recognition which 
impact upon maintaining a stable workforce.

Mears Group PLC
Annual report and accounts 2017
Financial statements 10. Goodwill continued
Care continued
The business plan identified a number of key factors, which are built in to the value-in-use calculation:
 → Mears has continued to be highly selective, targeting those contracts where the pricing, longevity and spend certainty allow 
Mears to deliver a high quality service at sustainable margins. During the year, Mears was successful in maintaining its 
historical contract win rates, whilst securing an average charge rate which matched increases on the underlying cost base. 
As a result, management has made what is considered to be a conservative assumption, modelling an annual increase of 
5,600 hours per week, which will be achieved through new contract bidding. This is well below the actual outcome achieved 
in recent years.
 → Recruitment and retention of quality care workers continue to be challenging. The churn rate of care workers varies at 
a branch level, depending on non-financial factors such as culture, working practices and recognition. Management has 
identified best practices and will focus efforts in this area during 2018. However, recruitment remains challenging and this 
is expected to continue during the short term. Mears recognises that traditional localised recruitment plays a vital role, 
aiding recruitment from the existing carer workforce pool. In an attempt to encourage new talent to the care at home 
market, Mears is utilising innovative recruitment tools to ensure breadth of coverage in attracting new care workers to the 
sector. Mears’ internal recruitment plan anticipates modest growth during the medium and long term which, on average, 
equates to three additional carers per year per branch; this represents an increase of 300 carers per year on an existing 
workforce of 6,000 carers, which is considered realistic. However, conservatively, the business plan underpinning the 
impairment review has stripped out this expected increase and assumes no growth as a result of improved recruitment and 
retention practices.
 → Mears is committed to leading the way with carer pay rates; the increase in the National Living Wage in April will further 
increase direct costs from 1 April 2018. Management will look to maintain a significant differential between Mears pay rates 
and the National Living Wage to ensure it remains the employer of choice in the homecare sector. The process of branch 
closures which ensued following the introduction of the National Living Wage in April 2016 has resulted in a live contract 
portfolio that allows Mears to comfortably meet National Living Wage requirements, whilst having clear margin visibility. 
Given that the Government has provided a clear indication of its intention to increase the National Living Wage to £9.00 per 
hour in 2020, management has assumed an increase in carer pay rates of 4.0% per annum, despite the recent rise of 4.4% in 
the National Living Wage from 1 April 2018. Management is confident that charge rate increases will be received from clients to 
match the increase in the cost base. The percentage increase assumed for charge rates matches that of carer pay rates in 
each year throughout the business plan. 
Management considers that the Care value-in-use calculation is most sensitive to changes in the terminal growth rate, discount 
rate and EBITA margin. The table below shows the sensitivity of the headroom (£m) to simultaneous changes in the discount 
rate and the long-term growth rate.

Revisions to acquisition intangibles additions in prior years relate to liabilities not accrued at the time of the acquisition. These 
revisions are not considered sufficiently material to warrant restatement of the prior year balances.
Development expenditure is an internally developed intangible asset and relates largely to the development of the Group’s 
Housing job management system, the Group’s Care management system and the UK Planning Portal website. Development 
expenditure is amortised over its useful economic life of 5.0 years. The weighted average remaining economic life of the asset is 
3.7 years (2016: 3.0 years).
Intellectual property is amortised over its useful economic life, typically 5.0 years.
Amortisation of development expenditure is included within other administrative expenses. Amortisation of acquisition 
intangibles is presented separately.
The value placed on the order book is based upon the cash flow projections over the contracts in place when a business is acquired. 
Due to uncertainties in trying to forecast revenues beyond the contract term, the Directors have taken a measure of conservatism 
and value contracts over the contractual term only. The value of the order book is amortised over its remaining life.
The value placed on the customer relationships is based upon the non-contractual expected cash inflows. These cash flow 
projections assume a customer attrition rate of 5% based upon three-year historical trends.

The amount of contingent consideration payable is generally determined by future expected profits of the acquired businesses. 
The fair values of contingent consideration have been calculated by the Directors by reference to expected future income and 
expenditure in respect of the acquired businesses. The contingent consideration payable was settled shortly after the year end at 
the carrying value and therefore the Directors have not disclosed a sensitivity analysis.
There have been no transfers between levels during the year.
Fair value information
The fair value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities is as disclosed above and approximates to the book value.
Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including interest rate risk and price risk); credit risk; 
and liquidity risk. The main risks faced by the Group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs and the risk of 
credit default by customers. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial 
markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.
Risk management is carried out under policies and guidelines approved by the Board of Directors.
Borrowing facilities
The Group’s borrowing facilities are drawn on as required to manage its cash needs. Banking facilities are reviewed regularly and 
extended and replaced in advance of their expiry.
The Group had total borrowing facilities of £170m with Barclays Bank PLC and HSBC Bank plc, of which £64.5m was utilised at 
31 December 2017. 
The facilities comprise a committed four-year £130.0m revolving credit facility and an unsecured overdraft facility of £10.0m. 
The undrawn amounts at 31 December 2017 were an £80.0m revolving credit facility and an overdraft facility of £10.0m. In addition, 
the Group benefits from a £30.0m revolving credit facility to fund the acquisition and build of property portfolios prior to their 
disposal to long-term funding partners. The undrawn amount at 31 December 2017 was £15.5m.
During the year, the Group completed an ‘amend and extend’ to its revolving capital facility, which extended the expiry date from 
July 2020 to November 2022.
Interest rate risk management
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings from major banking institutions at 
floating rates of interest based on LIBOR. The Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations on borrowings is managed through the 
use of interest rate swaps; hence the fixed rate borrowings relate to floating rate loans where the interest rate has been fixed by a 
hedging arrangement. The fair value of interest rate exposure on financial liabilities of the Group as at 31 December 2017 was:
Interest rate
Fixed Floating Zero Total
£’000 £’000 £’000 £’000
Financial liabilities – 2017 64,500 — 11,163 75,663
Financial liabilities – 2016 30,000 35,278 16,457 81,735
The Group’s policy is to accept a degree of interest rate risk, provided the effects of the various potential changes in rates remain 
within certain prescribed parameters.
Accordingly, at 31 December 2017 the Group had hedged the first £70.0m of the £140.0m total borrowing facilities by entering 
into interest rate swap arrangements with Barclays Bank PLC and HSBC Bank PLC. The arrangement with Barclays Bank PLC 
consists of one £30.0m swap contract expiring in August 2018, with quarterly maturity, matching the underlying facility. 
The arrangement with HSBC Bank PLC consists of three swap contracts totalling £40.0m expiring in December 2020, 
with quarterly maturity, matching the underlying facility.

The Group has also entered into a further two interest rate swap arrangements with Barclays Bank PLC, comprising two £15.0m 
swap contracts with a deferred start date of August 2018 expiring August 2021 at an applicable interest rate of 0.96%.
Effective interest rates
Interest rate swaps with fair value liabilities of £0.3m (2016: £1.1m) and average remaining lives of two years and five months 
have been accounted for in financial liabilities.
The Group’s overall average cost of debt, including effective interest rate swaps, is 2.3% as at 31 December 2017 (2016: 2.6%). 
Excluding these swaps the average is 1.6% (2016: 1.9%).
Cash flow hedging reserve
The cash flow hedging reserve comprises all gains and losses arising from the valuation of interest swap contracts which 
are effective hedges and mature after the year end. These are valued on a mark-to-market basis, accounted for through the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and recycled through the Consolidated Income Statement when the hedged 
item affects the Consolidated Income Statement.

Amounts transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement 645
Revaluations during the year (54)

At 31 December 2017 the Group had minimal exposure to movements in interest rates as the remaining interest rate risk was 
offset by the Group’s cash and short-term deposits.
If the interest rates had been 0.5% higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit before taxation 
for the year ended 31 December 2017 and reserves would decrease or increase, respectively, by £0.3m (2016: £0.2m).

Liquidity risk management
The Group seeks to manage liquidity risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest 
cash assets safely and profitably.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity reserve (comprising undrawn borrowing facilities and cash and 
cash equivalents) on the basis of expected cash flows. This is generally carried out at a local level in the operating companies of 
the Group in accordance with the practice and limits set by the Group. These limits vary by location and take into account the 
liquidity and nature of the market in which the entity operates.
The quantum of committed borrowing facilities of the Group is regularly reviewed and is designed to exceed forecasted peak 
gross debt levels. For short-term working capital purposes, the Group utilises bank overdrafts as required. These facilities are 
regularly reviewed and are renegotiated ahead of their expiry date.
The table below shows the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities:

The Group has disclosed core bank borrowings of £50.0m as due in two to five years. Whilst the amounts borrowed could be 
repaid each quarter, the Group’s intention is to align core bank borrowings with its interest rate swaps.
Credit risk management
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables, amounts recoverable on contracts and work in progress.
Trade receivables are normally due within 30 to 60 days. Trade and other receivables included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet 
are stated net of a bad debt provision which has been estimated by management following a review of individual receivable 
accounts. There is no Group-wide rate of provision and provision made for debts that are overdue is based on prior default 
experience and known factors at the balance sheet date. Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when 
management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
Housing customers are typically Local Authorities and Housing Associations. Care customers are typically Local Authorities and 
the NHS. The nature of both of these customers means that credit risk is minimal. Other trade receivables contain no specific 
concentration of credit risk as the amounts recognised represent a large number of receivables from various customers.
The Group continually monitors the position of major customers and incorporates this information into its credit risk controls. 
External credit ratings are obtained where appropriate.
Details of the ageing of trade receivables are shown in note 17.

Contingent consideration represents an estimate of future consideration likely to be payable in respect of acquisitions. 
Contingent consideration is discounted for the likelihood of payment and for the time value of money. Contingent consideration 
becomes payable based upon the profitability of acquired businesses or, in the case of one specific acquisition, the utilisation of 
certain timing differences in respect of corporation tax. The fair value of contingent consideration is estimated by forecasting 
future profits and utilising the forecast to determine the likely contingent consideration payable. 
Information as to the likely timing of payments in respect of these provisions’ financial liabilities is provided earlier within this note.
Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
 → to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders 
and benefits for other stakeholders; 
 → to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk; and 
 → to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to 
it in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust 
the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue 
new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt as disclosed below and equity as disclosed in the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity.

In accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’ , the Group has recognised an expense for the consumption of employee 
services received as consideration for share options granted. A tax deduction will not arise until the options are exercised. The 
tax deduction in future periods is dependent upon the Company’s share price at the date of exercise. The estimated future tax 
deduction is based on the options’ intrinsic value at the balance sheet date.
The cumulative amount credited to the Consolidated Income Statement is limited to the tax effect of the associated cumulative 
share-based payment expense. The excess has been credited directly to equity. This is presented in the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income.
In addition to those recognised, unused tax losses totalling £34.2m (2016: £31.3m) have not been recognised as the Directors do 
not consider that it is probable that they will be recovered.

Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of the acquisition and 
amortised over their useful economic lives. The UK tax regime calculates tax using the individual financial statements of the 
members of the Group and not the consolidated accounts. Hence, the tax base of acquisition intangible assets is £nil. The 
estimated tax effect of this £nil tax base is accounted for as a deferred tax liability which is released over the period of 
amortisation of the associated acquisition intangible asset.

Classes of reserves
Share capital represents the nominal value of shares that have been issued.
Share premium represents the difference between the nominal value of shares issued and the total consideration received.
Share-based payment reserve represents employee remuneration which is credited to the share-based payment reserve until 
the related share options are exercised. Upon exercise the share-based payment reserve is transferred to retained earnings.
The cash flow hedging reserve comprises all gains and losses arising from the valuation of interest swap contracts which 
are effective hedges and mature after the year end. These are valued on a mark-to-market basis, accounted for through the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and recycled through the Consolidated Income Statement when the hedged 
item affects the Consolidated Income Statement.
The merger reserve relates to the difference between the nominal value and total consideration in respect of acquisitions, where 
the Company was entitled to the merger relief offered by the Companies Act.

Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates a defined contribution Group personal pension scheme for the benefit of certain employees. The Group 
contributes to personal pension schemes of certain Directors and senior employees. The Group operates a stakeholder pension 
plan available to all employees. During the year, the Group contributed £3.0m (2016: £2.3m) to these schemes.
IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ 
The Group contributes to 30 (2016: 35) principal defined benefit schemes on behalf of a number of employees which require 
contributions to be made to separately administered funds.
These pension schemes are operated on behalf of Mears Limited, Mears Care Limited, Morrison Facilities Services Limited and 
their subsidiary undertakings. The assets of the schemes are administered by trustees in funds independent from the assets of 
the Group.
In certain cases, the Group will participate under Admitted Body status in the Local Government Pension Scheme. The Group 
will contribute for a finite period up until the end of the particular contract. The Group is required to pay regular contributions 
as detailed in the scheme’s schedule of contributions. In some cases these contributions are capped and any excess can be 
recovered from the body from which the employees originally transferred. Where the Group has a contractual right to recover the 
costs of making good any deficit in the scheme from the Group’s client, the fair value of that asset has been recognised within 
the Group’s share of the scheme assets and disclosed on page 134. Certain judgements around the value of this asset have been 
made and are discussed in the judgements and estimates disclosure within the accounting policies. 
The disclosures in respect of the two (2016: two) Group defined benefit schemes and the 28 (2016: 33) other defined benefit 
schemes in this note have been aggregated.
Costs and liabilities of the schemes are based on actuarial valuations. The latest full actuarial valuations for the schemes were 
updated to 31 December 2017 by qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions at the balance sheet date are as follows:
2017 2016
Rate of increase of salaries – first year 2.00% 1.00%
Rate of increase of salaries – second year 2.00% 1.00%

Funding arrangements are agreed for each of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes with their respective trustees. The 
employer’s contributions expected to be paid during the financial year ending 31 December 2018 amount to £5.4m.
Each of the schemes manages risks through a variety of methods and strategies to limit downside in falls in equity markets, 
movement in inflation and movement in interest rates.
The Group’s defined benefit obligation is sensitive to changes in certain key assumptions. The sensitivity analysis below shows 
how a reasonably possible increase or decrease in a particular assumption, in isolation, results in an increase or decrease in the 
present value of the defined benefit obligation as at 31 December 2017.

Financial statements Statement of compliance
Mears Group PLC is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales. Its registered office is 1390 Montpellier Court, 
Gloucester Business Park, Brockworth, Gloucester GL3 4AH.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards, including 
FRS 102 and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the 
modification to a fair value basis for certain financial instruments specified in the accounting policies below. The financial 
statements are presented in Sterling.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in Section 408 of the Companies Act from disclosing its individual profit 
and loss account.
The Company has taken advantage of the reduced disclosures for subsidiaries and the ultimate parent provided for in FRS 102 
and has therefore not provided a cash flow statement or certain disclosures in respect of share-based payments.
The principal accounting policies of the Company are set out below. These policies have been applied consistently to all the 
years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Goodwill
Goodwill representing the reallocation of amounts previously classed as investments upon the hive-across of trade and assets 
is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful economic life.
Share-based employee remuneration
All share-based payment arrangements that were granted after 7 November 2002 are recognised in the financial statements. 
The Group operates equity-settled and cash-settled share-based remuneration plans for its employees. All employee services 
received in exchange for the grant of any share-based remuneration are measured at their fair values. These are indirectly 
determined by reference to the fair value of the share options awarded. Their value is determined at the date of grant and is not 
subsequently remeasured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modified. The fair value at the date of the 
grant is calculated using the Black Scholes option pricing model and the cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period. Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period. 
Share-based remuneration in respect of employees of the Company is ultimately recognised as an expense in the profit and loss 
account. For equity-settled share-based payments there is a corresponding credit to the share-based payment reserve; for 
cash-settled share-based payments the Company recognises a liability at the balance sheet date. The Company operates 
share-based remuneration plans for employees of subsidiaries using the Company’s equity instruments. The fair value of the 
compensation given in respect of these share-based compensation plans less payments received from subsidiaries in respect 
of those share-based payments is recognised as a capital contribution.
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs up to the nominal value 
of the shares issued, are allocated to share capital with any excess being recorded as share premium.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or events that give the Company an obligation to pay 
more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are 
recognised where it is more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax is measured using rates of tax and laws that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Principal accounting policies – Company
139
Mears Group PLC
Annual report and accounts 2017
Financial statements Retirement benefits
i) Defined contribution pension scheme
The pension costs charged against profits are the contributions payable to individual policies in respect of the accounting period.
ii) Defined benefit pensions
The Company contributes to defined benefit schemes which require contributions to be made to separately administered funds.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, 
usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and salary. The legal obligations for any benefits from 
this kind of pension plan remain with the Group, even if plan assets for funding the defined benefit plan have been set aside.
Scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit funding method, applying the principal actuarial assumptions at the 
balance sheet date. Assets are measured at market value. The asset that is recognised is restricted to the amount by which the 
service cost is expected, over the lifetime of the scheme, to exceed funding contributions payable in respect of accruing benefits.
Actuarial gains and losses are taken to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as incurred. For this purpose, 
actuarial gains and losses comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising 
because of differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred.
Other movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the profit and loss account, including the current service cost, 
any past service cost and the effect of curtailments or settlements. The interest costs less the expected return on assets are also 
charged to the Consolidated Income Statement. The amount charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of these 
plans is included within operating costs.
The Company’s contributions to the schemes are paid in accordance with the rules of the schemes and the recommendations of 
the actuary.
Investments
Investments in equity shares which are not publicly traded and where fair value cannot be measured reliably are measured at 
cost less impairment. Dividends on equity securities are recognised in income when receivable.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Company becomes party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. The principal financial assets and liabilities of the Company are as follows:
Financial assets
Basic financial assets, including trade and other receivables, amounts due to Group companies and cash and cash equivalents, 
are initially recognised at transaction price, unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction 
is measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest.
Such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
At the end of each reporting period financial assets measured at amortised cost are assessed for objective evidence of impairment. 
If an asset is impaired the impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated 
cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. The impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Financial assets are derecognised when (a) the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or are settled; 
(b) substantially all the risks and rewards of the ownership of the asset are transferred to another party; or (c) despite having 
retained some significant risks and rewards of ownership, control of the asset has been transferred to another party which has 
the practical ability to unilaterally sell the asset to an unrelated third party without imposing additional restrictions.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand and bank deposits available with no notice or less than three 
months’ notice from inception that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts are presented as 
current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances.

Mears Group PLC
Annual report and accounts 2017
Financial statements Financial instruments continued
Financial liabilities
Basic financial liabilities, including trade and other payables, and amounts payable to Group companies that are classified as 
debt, are initially recognised at transaction price, unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt 
instrument is measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest.
Bank borrowings are non-basic financial liabilities and are initially recognised at fair value, being the present value of future 
payments discounted at a market rate of interest. Bank borrowings are remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives, including interest rate swaps, are not basic financial instruments.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in profit or loss in finance costs or finance 
income as appropriate, unless they are included in a hedging arrangement.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the liability is extinguished, that is when the contractual obligation is discharged or 
cancelled or expires.
Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amounts presented in the financial statements when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and 
settle the liability simultaneously.
Hedge accounting for interest rate swaps
The Company applies hedge accounting for transactions entered into to manage the cash flow exposures of borrowings. Interest 
rate swaps are held to manage the interest rate exposures and are designated as cash flow hedges of floating rate borrowings.
Changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, and which are effective, are recognised directly in 
equity. Any ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship (being the excess of the cumulative change in fair value of the hedging 
instrument since inception of the hedge over the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item since inception of the 
hedge) is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to the Consolidated Income Statement when 
the hedge relationship ends. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or no longer meets the 
hedging criteria, the forecast transaction is no longer highly probable, the hedged debt instrument is derecognised or the 
hedging instrument is terminated.
Critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Critical judgements in applying the Company’s accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty are disclosed 
in the Group’s accounting policies on page 100 and 101.

There have been no changes during the period or cumulatively in the fair value of bank borrowings attributable to changes in the 
credit risk of the instrument. The change attributable to changes in own credit risk is not material due to the short life of 
individual drawdowns within bank borrowings. The difference between the carrying amount and the amount expected to be paid 
at maturity is not material due to the short life of individual drawdowns within bank borrowings.

Financial statements 10. Financial instruments continued
The Company pays a margin over and above LIBOR on bank borrowings. The margin is based on the ratio of Group consolidated 
net borrowings to Group consolidated adjusted EBITDA and could have varied between 1.2% and 2.2% during the year.
The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to receive interest at LIBOR and pay interest at fixed rates. At 31 December 2017, 
these consist of one £30.0m swap contract expiring in August 2018 with a fixed interest rate of 1.85%, one £20.0m swap contract 
expiring in December 2020 with a fixed interest rate of 0.84% and two £10.0m swap contracts expiring in December 2020 with 
fixed interest rates of 0.84%. The swaps have quarterly maturity matching the underlying debt.
These instruments are used to mitigate the Company’s exposure to any interest rate movements. The fair value of the interest 
rate swaps is a liability of £0.3m (2016: £1.1m).
During 2017, a hedging loss of £0.1m (2016: £0.9m) was recognised in other comprehensive income for changes in the fair value 
of the interest rate swap and £0.6m (2016: £0.6m) was reclassified from the hedge reserve to profit and loss.
The Company has also entered into a further two interest rate swap arrangements with Barclays Bank PLC, comprising two 
£15.0m swap contracts with a deferred start date of August 2018 expiring August 2021 at an applicable interest rate of 0.96%.
The Company seeks to manage liquidity risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest 
cash assets safely and profitably. 
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group and Company’s liquidity reserve (comprising undrawn borrowing facilities 
and cash and cash equivalents) on the basis of expected cash flows. The quantum of committed borrowing facilities of the 
Group and Company is regularly reviewed and is designed to exceed forecasted peak gross debt levels. For short-term working 
capital purposes, the Group and Company utilise bank overdrafts as required. These facilities are regularly reviewed and are 
renegotiated ahead of their expiry date.

the related share options are exercised. Upon exercise the share-based payment reserve is transferred to retained earnings.
The cash flow hedging reserve comprises all gains and losses arising from the valuation of interest swap contracts which 
are effective hedges and mature after the year end. These are valued on a mark-to-market basis, accounted for through the
