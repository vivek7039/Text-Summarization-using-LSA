Strategy
To realise our vision, we continually respond to trends and changes in our 
marketplace to help our clients and candidates fulfil their potential. Our 
strategy is to develop leading brands and to be diversified and balanced 
across geographies and sectors. Our spread of operations minimises the 
dependence on any single market, so reducing the impact from market 
fluctuations and other external factors. Each brand is a specialist in their 
niche market, enabling them to understand the needs of clients and 
candidates alike, allowing them to attack the market vertically rather than 
horizontally. We differentiate ourselves in the marketplace by our four core 
business model pillars:

Cautionary statement
The Chairman’s statement and Strategic report (‘the reviews’) have been prepared solely to provide additional information to shareholders to assess the Company’s strategies and the 
potential for those strategies to succeed. The reviews should not be relied on by any party or for any other purpose. 
The reviews contain certain forward-looking statements. These statements are made by the Directors in good faith based on the information available to them up to the time of their 
approval of this report and such statements should be treated with caution due to the inherent uncertainties, including both economic and business risk factors, underlying any such 
forward looking information.  2

Multi-branded 
model
We target different segments of the 
market with different brands. Each 
brand has in-depth knowledge and 
expertise in their specific market, 
enabling them to help their clients 
and candidates to make the best 
matches. We think candidates and 
clients want to deal with experts 
who understand their industry and 
can advise both on the best match 
of experience, skills and job 
requirements.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATOR
NET FEE INCOME FROM 
PROFESSIONAL AND SPECIALIST 
ROLES
This demonstrates the proportion of our 
business generated from professional and 
specialist positions.
Target: We want to maximise our exposure 
to professional and specialist job levels as 
these are generally higher margin sectors 
where specialist brands can offer added 
value services.
Progress: The ratio has increased to 87%.

Why this is important
Our brands are experts in their niche 
markets, so able to understand the 
requirements of both clients and 
candidates to help deliver the best 
staffing solution or candidate match. 
We have a global reach but operate 
with local knowledge, helping our 
brands to spot and react to 
opportunities quickly. 
Their expertise means they know how and 
where to find the best candidates, providing 
clients with the best fit and helping 
candidates with their career development. 
Our primary focus is on professional and 
specialist job roles where we believe the 
biggest talent shortages exist and where 
recruitment agencies are needed to help 
identify hard-to-find candidates. 
With different markets exhibiting different 
growth rates we have brands operating 
across multiple sectors and geographies, 
so we are not dependent on any single 
market. Our central team provides 
management experience, expertise and 
support, as well as resources to help 
each brand deliver to their goals.
 
We have a clear focus to deliver organic 
growth, by continually investing in and 
developing our brands. 
This can be through adding new staff, 
opening new offices or expanding 
operations into new areas, be that sector 
niches or geographies. We also identify 
examples of best practice across the 
Group to help brands find opportunities 
to improve productivity or collaborate. 
Our brands operate from 20 countries 
and seven core sectors, so we have 
expertise in operating in multiple locations 
and industries. Brands are able to make 
use of other Group offices and know-how 
when looking to enter new geographies, 
so reducing their risk and costs.
We look at bolt-on opportunities where 
this can help accelerate entry into a new 
sector niche or geography. We use external 
investments to enter new markets, filling 
in gaps in our existing sector or geographic 
coverage.

Management 
equity philosophy
The Group applies a philosophy of 
management equity to align the 
interests of shareholders and key 
management through the sharing 
of risk and reward, with operating 
company management teams 
owning shares directly in their own 
businesses. This helps attract and 
then retain ambitious and talented 
managers. Our decentralised 
structure and entrepreneurial 
culture enables managers to run 
their businesses effectively, reacting 
to local opportunities but also 
benefitting from being part of a 
global organisation and the support 
and advice this provides.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATOR
NUMBER OF MANAGERS HOLDING 
EQUITY
This demonstrates how many senior 
managers around the Group are incentivised 
through equity ownership in their companies, 
a key element of our business model.
Target: All brands have management holding 
equity.
Progress: The total number of managers 
holding equity in their company is 51, down 
6 on the prior year due to the mergers and 
divestment in the year. Currently one brand has 
no management holding equity (2016: one).
2017:
51
2016:

Why this is important
The staffing industry is a people business, 
run by people, for people. The success of 
our business is dependent on having the 
best staff available and giving them the 
operational freedom to run their business. 
It is important to develop staff who are 
passionate about what they do, who want 
to help their clients and candidates to 
realise their potential. 
We use management equity to first 
attract, and then retain key management 
across our Group. This ensures they 
take a longer term view and aligns the 
interests of all shareholders, to build 
businesses that can deliver sustainable 
returns. 
How it works
Senior management have the 
opportunity to retain or acquire shares 
in the operating company they are 
responsible for.
Management can create a meaningful 
capital value over time if they grow the profit 
in their business. This works well with 
our decentralised structure, as the local 
management team run their business with 
a high level of operational autonomy.
This aligns the interests of management 
with Empresaria as a majority shareholder, 
encouraging a long-term view for the 
business. 
Acquisition of shares  Holding period Valuation  
 • At least 51% of the shares are 
owned by Empresaria.
 • A minority share position is 
retained by management or 
acquired by them at fair value.
 • Shares can be offered for sale after 
a specified holding period, typically 
between 4 and 5 years.
 • Shares can be offered for sale over 
a minimum 2 to 3 year period. 
 • The decision to purchase the 
shares is at Empresaria’s sole 
discretion. There are no put options 
in place.
 • The decision to buy shares is based 
on each specific situation, with 
consideration given to management 
succession plans, recent trading 
performance and potential of the 
business in the next few years.
 • Valuation basis is agreed  
up-front and documented in 
a shareholders’ agreement.
 • The valuation is typically based 
on the average profit after tax 
for the previous three full years 
before the shares are sold, 
using Empresaria’s trading 
multiple (share price divided 
by last EPS) less 0.5, to 
ensure it is earnings-accretive 
to Empresaria’s shareholders. 
The multiple is capped at 
a maximum of 10.  6

Focus on growth 
markets
We target businesses that operate 
in growth regions and sectors. We 
have a good spread across both 
established and emerging staffing 
markets and across different 
industry sectors. By having a 
balanced and diversified spread of 
operations across different markets 
we are not reliant on any single 
market and can mitigate the 
impacts of a slow-down in any 
particular market.

Why this is important
We want to operate in markets where there 
are good growth prospects, to help us 
deliver a sustainable growth in profit. We 
know that markets operate at different 
speeds and economies go through cycles, 
so our spread of operations across sectors 
and geographies reduces the risk from a 
downturn in any single market. 
Market size
We have a good spread of operations 
across both established and emerging 
staffing markets, with 71% of our 
net fee income derived from the UK, 
Germany, Japan and USA, which 
are the four largest staffing markets 
in the world. 
These markets provide a significant 
market opportunity for our brands to 
operate as niche market experts as well 
as making it easier to find experienced 
managers who have the passion, skills 
and expertise to develop international 
brands. 
The World Employment Confederation 
estimates in their 2017 Economic report 
that the global staffing market generates 
€417 billion in sales revenue, which 
includes €279 billion from agency sales 
(temporary and contract), €36.8 billion 
from direct recruitment (permanent) 
and €3.3 billion from RPO (Offshore 
recruitment services).

Asia and Latin America
With the exception of Japan and Australia, 
the Asian and Latin American staffing 
markets are relatively immature. There 
are low levels of temporary recruitment in 
South East Asia, but as this staffing market 
develops we expect temporary staffing to 
grow and we are well positioned to benefit 
from this. There is a significant long-term 
growth potential in these emerging staffing 
markets due to the size of their populations, 
concentration of work in large cities and 
increasing levels of middle class with better 
education levels than previous generations. 
We have a good presence across the 
emerging staffing markets with a particular 
focus on Asia Pacific, India and 
Latin America.
In these markets we focus on the key 
economic centres, where we will see the 
best return on our investment. We do not 
have large networks of branch offices, 
but focus on where the workers and clients 
are concentrated, so having access to the 
greatest pool of vacancies and candidates.

Operational focus on 
temporary and 
contract recruitment
Providing ongoing temporary and 
contract recruitment services 
develops long-term client 
relationships and helps financial 
planning through more predictable 
earnings. Temporary staffing is 
generally more stable throughout 
the economic cycle and provides 
clients and candidates with the 
flexibility to organise their business 
and careers.

The Group has three main service lines, 
temporary and contract recruitment, 
permanent recruitment and Offshore 
Recruitment Services. Overall we aim 
for a bias in temporary and contract 
recruitment, which is generally more stable 
throughout the economic cycle, although 
this also depends on the maturity of the 
staffing sector in each country, with 
some low maturity markets focused 
purely on permanent sales. With 
temporary and contract recruitment, 
we typically have a long-term 
relationship with our clients and a more 
predictable income stream, which helps 
with resourcing and planning.
Why this is important
Temporary staffing in key 
markets 
As a Group we have an overall bias 
towards contract and temporary 
recruitment, providing workers with 
the flexibility to work when they want 
and also helping people to enter the 
working environment.
In the established staffing markets we have 
a high proportion of temporary and contract 
recruitment. The established markets are 
typically larger and more regulated. We 
monitor changes in regulations across our 
territories and we participate in consultation 
exercises with the regulators, to help them 
understand the benefits to their economies 
and businesses from temporary labour 
solutions. In those markets where there 
is no or little regulation of labour markets 
we focus more on permanent 
recruitment, but with the expertise 
around the Group we are well placed to 
develop temporary recruitment solutions 
as these markets develop.
Temporary penetration 
rates in key markets
The most regulated markets typically 
have the highest temporary penetration 
rate, which represents the number 
of agency workers in a country as 
a percentage of the total working 
population. The rates for selected 
key staffing markets are shown below. 
In established staffing markets there is 
an ongoing trend towards flexible working 
practices. This is being driven by both 
clients wanting solutions for specific 
projects, to manage their costs or deal 
with seasonal demand, and by candidates 
wanting flexibility on when, where and 
how they work. This could be through  
self-employment, part-time work or remote 
working, with project work enabling them 
to build up a wide portfolio of relevant 
experience. With the rise of the digital world, 
it is increasingly easy for candidates 
to work from anywhere in the world, 
reducing geographic boundaries and 
time zone issues.

Empresaria Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Chairman’s statement
The Group has delivered 
another record year of profit. 
Our business model and 
strategy is delivering 
consistently, with 18 quarters 
of year-on-year net fee 
income growth for the period 
to December 2017 . 
As well as the growth in profit, our 
diversification across sectors and geographies 
helps to reduce risk and insulate the Group 
from difficulties in individual markets.
Empresaria is a global business, operating 
from locations in 20 countries. Whilst global 
reach is clearly important, local focus is key 
with our management teams running their 
businesses in alignment with local market 
conditions and opportunities.
As part of our strategy to develop leading 
brands, we invest to help them develop and 
take a leading position within their niche 
sector area of expertise. It is important that 
each brand has the potential to develop 
within the Group and where changes are 
needed, we identify and implement them. 
In line with this ethos, we ended 2017 with 
18 brands, having merged two brands and 
exited from another. The Board sees good 
opportunities for growth across the Group 
and we will continue to invest in our brands 
to build capacity and coverage.
The market
As we enter 2018 the worldwide economic 
conditions are largely positive, with 
synchronised growth forecast for the 
first time since the global financial crisis. 
The main markets that we operate in are 
expected to grow, and this includes the 
UK where we continue to operate under 
a cloud of Brexit uncertainty. We are seeing 
candidate shortages across our markets 
and regions. We play a vital role in helping 
client companies find the right resources 
they need to grow.
The positive economic outlook suggests 
a good year ahead for the staffing sector, 
with “Staffing Industry Analysts” forecasting 
6% growth in the global staffing sector in 
2018. Against this is ongoing geo-political 
uncertainty, which could derail growth in 
any territory, as well as the impact of new 
legislation in our markets, with particular 
changes in Germany and Japan impacting 
the temporary staffing markets in 2018. 
Our diversity puts us in a good position 
to both manage the impact of localised 
issues and make the most of positive 
market conditions.
People, values & culture
The Board has over 100 years of combined 
experience in the staffing industry and 
during the year we took steps to strengthen 
the board with Spencer Wreford taking 
on the role of Chief Operating Officer. 
We look forward to welcoming Tim Anderson 
to the board as Group Finance Director 
by the end of March 2018.
As we have continued to invest in our 
brands, the average number of staff across 
the Group in the year has increased to 
1,367 (2016: 1,282). The success of the 
Group is down to the hard work of every 
one of them and the Board would like to 
thank each individual for their contribution 
to our success.
A key part of our business model, and 
one that aligns key operating company 
management and Empresaria shareholder 
interests, is subsidiary management equity, 
where management hold shares in their 
operating companies. This approach helps 
Empresaria to attract and retain the best 
people. At the end of the year we had 
51 management shareholders owning 
shares in the operating companies they 
are responsible for.
It is important for businesses to have a clear 
vision to help frame all decision making and 
identify priorities for investment. We operate 
in a people business and our purpose is 
to help people to achieve their potential, 
whether this is our internal staff who can 
develop meaningful careers within the 
Group, our candidates who we help to find 
work, or our clients who we help to identify 
the best candidates.
We operate with a decentralised structure, 
with local management responsible 
for running their businesses but clear 
governance and control oversight from 
the centre. We believe in a strong and clear 
governance approach and expect high 
standards and compliance across the 
Group. Our culture is based on shared 
ownership and reward. We are a Group 
of like-minded people with a passion for 
helping people realise their potential.
We take stakeholder engagement seriously. 
We have regular communication with 
Group companies and staff through our 
newsletters, we present to investors to 
explain our strategy and results, both 
to institutional investors and private 
shareholders and we engage with 
regulators and Government agencies 
both directly in response to consultations 
or proposals and through our membership 
of worldwide trade associations.
Shareholder returns
The Group has delivered six consecutive 
years of double-digit growth in adjusted 
diluted earnings per share as we look 
to build a sustainable business for the  
long-term benefit of shareholders and other 
key stakeholders. The adjusted measures 
exclude amortisation, exceptional items, 
profit or loss on business disposals and 
fair value charges on equity instruments. 
We use the adjusted measures as we 
believe they reflect the underlying trading 
results and are measures typically used 
by investors and the analyst community. 
The Board has reviewed the dividend and 
in line with our progressive dividend policy, 
for the year ended 31 December 2017, 
we propose an increase of 15% to 1.32p 
per share (2016: 1.15p per share) to be 
approved by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting. The dividend will be paid 
on 31 May 2018 to shareholders on the 
register on 4 May 2018. 4

At the end of the year we initiated a small 
share buy-back programme, which 
concluded in January 2018 with the total 
purchase of 260,384 shares at a cost 
of £249,445. These shares are held in an 
Employee Benefit Trust to cover potential 
exercises of vested share options thus 
reducing the dilutive effect of issuing new 
shares. Based on the number of vested 
options and the share price at the time, this 
was a sensible use of capital for the benefit 
of all shareholders. 
Outlook
The Group has a strong platform from 
which to deliver the next phase of growth. 
The economic conditions are positive and 
whilst we maintain a cautious view on 
political risk, we see good opportunities 
to develop our Group further during the 
year ahead. We have a proven strategy 
and brands that have the potential to grow 
their profit.

Market drivers in our industry
Economic conditions
Confidence drives client’s hiring activity and 
investment in staff, and confidence makes 
candidates more comfortable to move job. 
Confidence builds with good economic 
conditions, with growing economies 
creating new roles and candidates moving 
between existing roles. This dual impact 
means staffing markets are generally 
expected to grow at higher rates than 
country GDP, but different geographies and 
sectors exhibit different economic conditions 
and so demand is not spread evenly.
Market opportunity is also based on the size 
of the market and the level of specialism, 
with larger markets having a greater 
degree of specialism. The world economy 
is increasingly inter-connected with 
businesses operating in global markets 
across international boundaries. The labour 
markets are reacting to this with people 
becoming more mobile and working outside 
their country of birth.
Talent shortages
Talent shortages exist in many sectors, 
making it difficult for clients to find suitable 
staff, as there are insufficient workers with 
the necessary skills to meet demand. 
Clients have a number of routes to find 
candidates but where there is a scarcity of 
talent a staffing agency is invaluable to help 
with difficult to find candidates. There is an 
ageing population in developed economies 
which further exacerbates this skills shortage 
and in emerging economies where there 
are growing populations they often lack 
the skills and experience needed by clients.
Advances in technology and automation 
are reducing the requirement for a number 
of low skilled jobs, making them obsolete. 
However, these advances also lead to the 
creation of new roles that did not exist a few 
years ago, although there are shortages of 
people with experience in these new areas. 
There is an increasing divide between the 
qualifications and skills of workers and the 
evolving demands of the labour market.
There is an ongoing trend for urbanisation, 
leading to a concentration of workers in 
the key economic centres, especially in 
emerging markets. The concentration of 
workers to the largest cities means these 
cities are the main drivers of economic 
growth and business opportunities.
Changes in market 
regulations and new 
technologies
Market regulations can be a driver of 
growth, with well-regulated markets 
encouraging temporary employment by 
protecting the rights of temporary workers, 
for example by providing the right to equal 
pay and conditions. New business models 
can create opportunities for workers, as 
seen with the growth of workers in the gig 
economy. They also create uncertainties 
as authorities review how to deal with the 
taxation of income and profits, which could 
lead to changes in regulations around how 
workers can be engaged.
New technologies and tools in staffing are 
changing how we interact with candidates 
and clients, with some models helping the 
staffing industry to be more productive 
and some looking to bypass the agency. 
In established staffing markets we see an 
increasing use of Vendor Management 
Systems (‘VMS’) and Managed Service 
Providers (‘MSP’) where software solutions 
or external advisers act as the mechanism 
for providing staffing services to clients, 
reducing or removing the interaction 
between the end client and staffing agency. 
With the supply and demand for job 
markets becoming increasingly digitalised 
it can be difficult to sift through the sheer 
volume of data online to find the best 
match. This is where the experience of a 
staffing agency can be vital to find the right 
candidate.

Source: CIA World Factbook (July 2017 estimates). How we meet 
our objectives
We follow an Invest and Develop 
approach to deliver on our strategy. 
We are a strategic investor, looking to 
invest in like-minded people who share 
our values and are passionate about 
their business.
It is important for our existing 
brands to develop and grow their 
profits over the long-term. Organic 
investment helps them to develop 
their services and grow scale and 
coverage. This is done by the 
following:
 • Increase the headcount in an 
existing brand
 • Add a new vertical specialism to 
an existing brand
 • Enter a new or existing geography 
with an existing brand
 • Start up in a niche sector
DEVELOP
To accelerate our growth we also 
look at external investments, to fill 
gaps in our sector or geographic 
coverage or to bring in specific 
market knowledge into the Group.
External investment will occur where 
we don’t currently have a presence in 
a region or sector or to help develop 
an existing brand by filling in gaps in 
their service offering:
 • Enter a new geography or sector 
with a new brand
 • Grow an existing brand with  
a bolt-on acquisition
It is important to have the right culture 
fit with any external investment, 
typically finding businesses that 
have potential but have reached 
a point where they need help to move 
forward to the next level. We want to 
work with them to develop a leading 
staffing brand.
INVEST
Our investment activity is dependent 
on the resources we have available. 
We are in an overall debt position 
and we target a ‘debt to debtors’ 
ratio of 25%. 
Our preference is for investments 
to be funded through equity or from 
operating cash flows and debt to 
be used for working capital funding. 
We review investment opportunities 
and funding options based on our 
expectations for the business and  
the costs of raising new funds to 
deliver the best overall result for 
shareholders.

Our growth strategy
The Group’s strategy is 
focused on growth, facilitating 
our vision to be a leading 
international, specialist 
staffing group.
1. Develop leading specialist 
brands with sector expertise 
We invest in our brands to ensure they have sufficient 
scale and strength to deliver sustainable profits. Leading 
brands should be more financially stable during the 
economic cycle and will benefit from synergies in 
operational processes, training, systems and marketing.
2.  Maintain diversification and 
balance by geography and sector
Having a spread of operations across geographies  
and sectors reduces the reliance on any single market  
and minimises the impact on the Group from market 
fluctuations and external shocks.
3. Develop a solid 
financial foundation
Having a strong financial foundation is key to delivering 
long-term sustainable results for the Group.
Our strategic 
objectives
 • Focus on professional and specialist job levels where 
there are the greatest talent shortages.
 • Sectors with good long-term growth prospects where 
our niche sector expertise helps us to deliver to the needs 
of both clients and candidates.
 • Footprint in key economic centres where there is 
the highest concentration of workers and business so 
delivering the best return on investment.
 • Established and emerging staffing markets allows 
access to both stable mature markets and high growth 
emerging markets.
 • Funding being available to allow the Group to pursue 
internal and external investment opportunities.
Our progress in 2017
We successfully integrated two new brands into the Group 
from external investments made in 2016.
Rishworth Aviation provides us with a leading position 
in Aviation, a new high growth global sector.
ConSol Partners increases our presence in high growth 
IT sectors, operating across the UK, Continental Europe 
and US markets.
In 2017, we merged a number of brands in the UK, to bring 
operational synergies and cost savings to the businesses. 
In Professional services the Mansion House insurance 
brand was merged into LMA, adding a further specialism 
to their offering. In the Technical & Industrial sector, Reflex 
HR merged into FastTrack, strengthening their combined 
position in the market and giving clients a better national 
coverage. 
We exited a training business in Indonesia as we focus 
on our core staffing business.
With the investments in Rishworth Aviation and ConSol 
Partners in 2016, we now have a better diversification 
across our sectors, including a new sector in Aviation.
Our Monroe Consulting brand opened a new office in 
Vietnam, our first venture in this country. This builds their 
South East Asia coverage, now operating in six countries 
in Asia Pacific and two in Latin America.
The investment in ConSol Partners has increased our 
presence in the USA through their office in Los Angeles. 
From the London office they service clients in the UK and 
Continental Europe. With our existing IT, digital & design 
brand in Japan, Skillhouse, this sector now operates across 
all of our regions.
With our record profit in 2017 we have generated positive 
cashflows. With the deferred consideration payment related 
to ConSol Partners paid in the year, we have seen an 
increase in our debt to debtors ratio to 45%, up on 38% 
in 2016. Whilst this remains higher than our target of 25%, 
it only represents 1.5 times adjusted net debt to EBITDA.
We have not made any external investments in 2017, with 
a focus to reduce the Group debt level. 
With our diversified Group we have delivered a record profit 
in the year. Our business is highly cash generative and with 
our committed bank facilities we end the year in a strong 
financial position.
Our opportunities
With economic forecasts generally positive in the regions 
we are operating in, we see potential to continue to grow 
our Group profit into 2018.
With the restructuring undertaken in 2017 we have a 
stronger platform across the Group and the focus in 2018 is 
on investing in new staff and improving productivity. We see 
good opportunities to use technology tools to help our staff 
operate more effectively and efficiently and to invest more 
in staff training.
We also look for cost efficiencies within our operating 
structures and are working on a number of projects to 
improve reporting and streamline back office functions. 
10 of our 18 brands operate in more than one geographic 
region. We think this is important for leading brands to help 
spread their exposure and to deliver to the needs of clients 
across different geographies. We see ongoing opportunities 
to increase our brands’ geographic coverage across 
the Group.
Although we do not currently expect to make any significant 
external investments in 2018, we continue to look at 
opportunities to further diversify our geographic or sector 
coverage either through new brands or bolt-on acquisitions. 
In 2018 we do not currently anticipate making any 
significant external investments, as we continue to target 
a reduction in our net debt and our debt to debtors ratio.
However, we continue to look at opportunities, both organic 
and external, to grow the Group where there is a strong 
strategic fit. Strategic report Governance Financials 17

Chief Executive’s review
We are pleased to have 
delivered another record year 
of profit, further demonstrating 
that our strategy of being 
diversified by sector and 
geography is working, with 
adjusted profit before tax 
growing 20% to £11.0m 
(2016: £9.2m).
Group performance in the year
We are pleased to have delivered another 
record year of profit, further demonstrating 
that our strategy of being diversified by 
sector and geography is working, with 
adjusted profit before tax growing 20% 
to £11.0m (2016: £9.2m). The 2017 results 
include a full year of contribution from 
the investments made in 2016 in Rishworth 
Aviation and ConSol Partners.
Group revenue increased by 32% to 
£357.1m (2016: £270.4m), with net fee 
income up 18% to £69.4m (2016: £59.0m). 
Our strongest results were in Japan (IT & 
design sector), Chile (retail sector) and in 
the professional services and other 
specialist sectors of the UK. Permanent 
revenue was up 14% and temporary and 
contract revenue was up 34%.
The two investments made in 2016 have 
integrated well into the Group. Rishworth 
Aviation has performed in line with our 
expectations. The decision was taken 
to incur professional fees to support the 
set-up of new bases of operations for 
key clients, which are already generating 
profitable returns and further consolidate 
their position as a key business partner. 
Our investment in ConSol has also been 
positive, with the UK office trading well and 
expanding their operations in Continental 
Europe. We have invested in the US office, 
bringing in more experienced staff and 
increasing their focus on temporary sales. 
There has been a positive contribution 
in the second half of the year from these 
changes and we see a good momentum 
moving into 2018.
We have continued to invest in our Group, 
with Monroe Consulting launching in 
Vietnam, a new country for the Group. This 
operation has started well and complements 
their existing footprint across South East 
Asia. The Group has also seen average 
staff numbers increase by 7% as we 
continue to invest in line with our leading 
brands strategy. In the UK, two brands 
were merged into FastTrack (technical & 
industrial) and LMA (professional services), 
which are expected to provide both 
operational and cost synergies in the 
coming years.

With a Group operating in 20 countries 
and across various sectors, it is unrealistic 
to expect all brands to be performing at 
their peak at the same time. Our organic 
performance in the year has been impacted 
by weaker performances, primarily within 
the technical & industrial sector, and actions 
have been taken to make changes where 
required. At the net fee income level, the 
growth was driven by the investments 
made in 2016, with organic growth of 1%, 
although once currency benefits are 
removed, the constant currency organic 
net fees decreased by 3%. Germany and 
the Middle East were our weaker markets 
in the period. We saw a reduction in net 
fee income in Germany following the 
introduction of new legislation to limit the 
amount of time a worker can be treated as 
a temporary worker at the same client to 
18 months as well as new minimum wage 
rules. We have been proactive in managing 
this position with worker rotations but this 
has resulted in lower temporary margins 
and a subsequent decline in profit. In the 
Middle East we have incurred restructuring 
costs in the year, bringing the cost base 
in line with current trading and whilst loss 
making, it was an improvement on the prior 
year and we saw a positive trend across the 
second half. In the UK a mixture of changes 
within the sales team and merger costs 
have put pressure on the results. As part of 
a mid-term growth plan, we will be investing 
further. The fact that we were able to deliver 
a record result in 2017, despite difficulties in 
certain markets, underlines the benefit of 
our strategy to be diversified across sectors 
and geographies and so not being reliant 
on any single market.
The Group temporary margin was 12.7% 
(2016: 14.5%) with the reduction mainly due 
to the full year impact of Rishworth Aviation, 
which has a high revenue and relatively low 
gross margin percentage, and the lower 
margins in Germany. The mix of net fee 
income was consistent with the prior year, 
with 60% from temporary and contract 
sales and 40% from permanent sales. The 
share of net fees from professional and 
specialist levels increased to 87% (2016: 
86%). The Group generated 66% of net fee 
income from outside the UK (2016: 68%).
We have seen another improvement in our 
conversion ratio, albeit a small increase to 
16.7% (2016: 16.6%). This represents six 
years of consecutive improvement, although 
the rate of growth was held back by costs 
incurred on exiting property leases in the 
UK, non-exceptional restructuring costs 
and investing in new staff. We have a clear 
focus to manage our costs, allowing 
investment in building the teams, but always 
looking for ways to operate more efficiently, 
with a particular focus on staff productivity.
STAFF PRODUCTIVITY
This is the key productivity ratio we monitor, 
demonstrating staff efficiency, calculated 
as the ratio of net fee income generated per 
£1 of staff cost. The staff cost includes all 
sales and administrative staff, reflecting the 
true cost of operating the Group.
Progress: At 1.75 in 2017 we have seen 
a small decline on 1.79 in 2016, but this 
remains above all other years since 2013.

Chief Executive’s review
continued
Within our English speaking brands we have 
started to use our offshore recruitment 
outsourcing business in India to take over 
certain internal accounting processes, to 
deliver consistency, build scale and manage 
costs. Operating profit grew by 2% to 
£8.9m (2016: £8.7m), with higher 
amortisation costs of £1.7m (2016: £1.1m) 
reflecting the recent investments made by 
the Group, as well as a £0.9m loss on 
disposal for exiting the training business in 
Indonesia. The adjusted operating profit, 
stated before amortisation, exceptional 
items, profit or loss on business disposals 
and fair value charges on equity instruments 
grew by 18% to £11.6m (2016: £9.8m).  
The disposal was of a non-core business, 
which joined the Group in 2007. There was 
a need for a significant cash investment  
to restructure it for growth and we did not 
believe it was an ongoing fit with the Group. 
This was an accounting loss only and 
meant we did not need to make any further 
cash injections. 
Profit before tax was up 3% to £8.1m (2016: 
£7.9m), with the underlying adjusted profit 
before tax up 20% to £11.0m (2016: £9.2m). 
Interest costs were level year on year, 
despite the increase in net debt. We also 
had a benefit from the weakness in Sterling 
on the translation of our overseas results. 
On a constant currency basis adjusted 
profit before tax was up 14% but reported 
profit before tax was down 2%. Currency 
has been beneficial for the last two years, 
following the Brexit vote, but based on the 
exchange rates at year end we would not 
expect to see the same benefit during 2018.
Diluted earnings per share was down 15% 
to 7.9p (2016: 9.3p), also impacted by the 
higher amortisation charges and loss on 
disposal. On an adjusted basis there was  
an 11% growth to 12.5p (2016: 11.3p), 
representing the sixth year of double digit 
percentage growth.

NET FEE INCOME GROWTH
Sustainable growth in net fee income is needed 
to deliver long-term growth in net profit and 
earnings per share. 
Target: Average annual growth of 10%.
Progress: 18% (13% in constant currency). 
The  last three years have been at or above our 
target level.

This demonstrates how efficiently the business

Progress: 16.7%, being the sixth consecutive 
year of improvement. After the small growth 
in 2017 we do not expect to reach 20% in 2018 
but continue to focus on balancing costs, 
productivity improvements and investments 
to grow net fee income to reach our target.

Focus into 2018
Organic growth has always been a core 
part of our business model and despite 
the low overall organic growth in the year, 
this remains a key focus of management. 
We agree specific plans with each brand 
to help them develop into leading brands in 
their sectors and we will continue to invest 
in new staff, locations and markets where 
we see opportunities to grow. We are 
confident that the plans we are following 
will help the Group deliver profitable organic 
growth in 2018.
We have not made any external investments 
during 2017, concentrating on integrating 
the three investments we made over 
a 12 month period from October 2015 to 
October 2016. It was important to settle 
them into the Group before looking for new 
investment opportunities. With the main 
focus on organic growth in 2018, we do 
not currently expect to make any significant 
external investments, but we will continue 
to work on identifying suitable opportunities 
to further develop the Group in line with 
our strategy. As part of balancing our sector 
and geographic coverage, we have 
a particular interest in increasing our 
presence in the Latin American region and 
the healthcare and professional services 
sectors. We also work with our brands to 
identify and execute sector specific bolt-on 
acquisition opportunities, to help accelerate 
their growth plans.

DEBT AS A % OF DEBTORS
This demonstrates how leveraged the Group is. 
The Group needs a sound financial foundation 
for long-term sustainability and to be able to 
react to opportunities in the market. 
Target: To reduce this to 25% by 2018.
Progress: This increased to 45% from 38% 
in the prior year due to the acquisition based 
payments made in the year. Having reached 
the target in 2015 we took the decision to make 
two strategic investments using cash and 
debt in 2016, knowing this would significantly 
increase this ratio in the short-term. We expect 
to see this rate reduce in 2018 but not to reach 
the target level.

Operating review
United Kingdom
Revenue increased by 24% and net fee 
income was up 23%, helped by having a full 
year of contribution from ConSol Partners. 
However, excluding this the underlying 
movement in net fee income was a 
reduction of 2%, due to lower sales within 
our insurance and technical & industrial 
brands. Our UK based brands in technical  
& industrial merged at the beginning of 2017 
and overall the integration has run smoothly. 
The sector has been challenging, with 
candidate shortages and delays to key 
projects and at the same time the credit 
community has also been very cautious 
in this sector and this is unlikely to improve 
following recent well publicised company 
collapses. We are working closely with the 
business to help them make improvements 
in structure and process to recover their 
profit levels including the introduction of an 
improved training programme during the 
year. We plan to invest in adding more staff 
in 2018.
In professional services we have seen 
positive conditions, with activity levels high 
throughout the year. We have merged the 
insurance brand into LMA, our leading 
professional services brand, with effect 
from January 2018, with resulting cost and 
operational synergies. We have not seen 
any impact on client demand due to Brexit 
and staff numbers have increased 10% year 
on year. The LMA business has a good 
track record of adding new service lines 
and we are confident they will be able 
to maximise the opportunities with 
a dedicated insurance division.
We were also pleased with the contributions 
in domestic services and retail (new house 
sales), with both growing year on year 
and looking to strengthen their regional 
presence in 2018.
In IT & digital we have strengthened our 
presence with ConSol Partners. From their 
office in London they cover the UK and 
Continental Europe markets and they have 
seen the mix shift more towards Europe 
over the course of the year. In the digital & 
design sector our two brands have invested 
in staff and systems, such that their net 
contribution has been steady with the prior 
year, but we have seen an improving trend 
over the second half of the year, in particular 
with stronger temporary sales, and see 
good opportunities to grow into 2018.

Continental Europe
Revenue grew by 7% but net fee income 
was down by 2%, with the temporary 
margin down 2% in Germany. The adjusted 
operating profit of £5.1m was up £0.2m on 
2016, helped by a lower allocation of central 
charges due to the lower share of Group 
net fee income.
The Headway business in Germany and 
Austria continues to dominate the region. 
The Austrian business was positive, with 
investments made in staff. The German 
temporary staffing division has integrated 
new sales staff and invested in training and 
marketing and is well positioned to benefit 
from these investments in 2018. The 
Logistics division in Germany delivered 
strong profits but was negatively impacted 
by new legislation that was implemented 
in April 2017 and the set up costs related 
to taking on new clients. 
The new regulations limit the time a worker 
can be on a temporary contract with 
a client to 18 months, with new equal pay 
regulations also introduced. With this 
division operating at lower pay brackets, 
these changes have increased pressure 
on margins and projects are being 
managed to meet client service period 
restrictions. We expect there will be a 
continuing impact into 2018 as clients get 
used to the new rules. We are confident that 
the high quality service we provide in the 
market will see us well placed to respond 
to ongoing client needs into the long-term.
Our Finnish healthcare business has had 
a solid year. We oversaw a change in the 
senior management team during the year 
and are investing in marketing initiatives 
in 2018 to improve candidate attraction.

Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Asia Pacific
Revenue grew by 72% and net fee income 
grew 19%. This was largely due to the full 
year contribution from Rishworth Aviation, 
which has a low temporary margin of 6%, 
so there is a larger impact on revenue. 
Excluding this, net fee income was up 3%.
The Rishworth business has performed in 
line with expectations and has settled well 
into the Group, providing a new sector 
specialism. A key focus in the year has 
been on setting up new pilot bases for their 
largest client. Whilst this has required them 
to incur additional professional fees, we 
expect the costs to reduce for 2018 and 
the new bases are already making profitable 
contributions.
There were particularly strong 
performances from Skillhouse in Japan 
(IT, digital & design sector) where the 
positive economic conditions, combined 
with an ageing population, has created 
strong client demand. Candidates are in 
short supply and new legislation takes 
effect in 2018 which limits the time workers 
can be on temporary or outsourced 
contracts with clients. We have yet to see 
how clients will react to these changes. 
In South East Asia our executive search 
brand, Monroe Consulting, launched in 
Vietnam and now operate in six countries 
across the region. There were good results 
in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia and 
investments in staff across all offices. 
In India there was good growth in the 
outsourcing services to the UK, in particular 
in the healthcare sector, although their 
profit growth was dampened by currency 
impacts. They invested in additional sales 
resources for the key UK and US markets 
and we see good opportunities for 2018. 
We exited our non-core training business 
in Indonesia, with a sale to the management 
team as it would have required significant 
cash and time investments to turn it around 
and we felt it would be more successful 
as an independent company. 
In professional services the LMA business 
in Singapore grew net fee income and 
profit. They continue to invest in new staff 
to capitalise on their market position.
Following a difficult period, our business 
in the technical & industrial sector in the 
Middle East has been fully restructured, 
with a new manager in place, and a cost 
base in line with current trading levels. 
There were additional bad debt write offs for 
historic issues and the UK base has been 
closed down. There has been an increase in 
oil price in the second half of the year, which 
should help local economic confidence and 
we expect a positive contribution in 2018.

Revenue grew by 25% with net fee income 
up 59%, helped by the first full year

this, the net fee income was up 17%.
In Chile, we were pleased with another 
year of growth, with record profits. There 
was growth in all key divisions, with the 
strongest growth in the newer permanent 
and temporary staffing areas but also 12% 
growth in net fees from the outsourcing 
business.
In the IT digital & design sector, we had 
the first full year of ConSol Partners. 
We invested in staff to build the temporary 
sales service, increased the management 
resource and changed the mix in favour of 
more experienced consultants. The growth 
in temporary sales is slow and we expect 
this will take time to see any meaningful 
change in the sales mix. However, the other 
staff changes have had a more immediate 
impact, with a much improved second half 
result to offset the first half year and this 
positive momentum gives us confidence 
moving into 2018.
In healthcare, we have seen an improving 
performance from Pharmaceutical 
Strategies in the second half of the year. 
Following a change in client mix during 2016 
they have made progress in broadening 
their client base and penetration in key 
clients with a wider service offering. There 
have been positive changes in the sales 
and recruitment teams and we are confident 
that this will deliver improved returns.

Tax
The total tax charge in the year is £3.6m 
(2016: £3.5m), representing an effective 
tax  rate of 44% (2016: 44%). The effective 
rate based on the adjusted profit before tax, 
so excluding the effect of amortisation, 
exceptional items, profit or loss on business 
disposals and fair value charges on equity 
instruments is 37% (2016: 40%). This rate 
is higher than the UK rate due to a number 
of factors:
 • The mix of profits is weighted towards 
higher tax jurisdictions, including 
Germany, Japan, India, Australia and 
New Zealand (£1.1m).
 • The level of non-deductible expenses 
in the year (£0.5m).
 • A deferred tax asset has not been 
recognised for certain of the tax losses 
around the Group (£0.4m).
Treasury
The Group’s treasury function is managed 
centrally. Under the Group’s treasury policy 
speculative transactions are not permitted 
and where possible liabilities, typically debt, 
match the location and currency of the 
related assets. The following matters are 
reserved for Board approval:
– Changes to the Group’s capital structure.
 –  Approval of Group financing arrangements 
or significant changes to existing 
arrangements.
 –  Approval of treasury policies and any 
activity involving forward contracts, 
derivatives, hedging activity and 
significant foreign currency exposures.
 –  Approving the appointment of any of the 
Group’s principal bankers.
Capital management and allocation
The Board monitors the overall level of debt 
across the Group, to ensure we operate in 
line with our facilities and investment plans. 
There is a constant need to balance the 
conflicting priorities of reducing the debt 
level, investing in the business and returning 
funds to shareholders through dividend 
payments. Any increase in bank facilities 
needs Board approval and treasury 
management is part of the monthly Board 
reporting. The Board has set a target debt 
to debtors ratio of 25% and we also monitor 
other key debt ratios as follows:
2017 2016 2015 2014 2013
Adjusted 
net debt to 
EBITDA 1.5 1.5 0.8 1.3 2.2
Adjusted 
net debt to 
equity 46% 39% 24% 41% 70%
The principle followed by the Board is that 
debt should be available to fund working 
capital and that equity should be used for 
significant external investments. During 
2016, the decision was taken to use debt 
to fund the external investments, taking into 
account shareholder dilution, the available 
funding options and the relative costs of 
raising new funds at the time. This was 
believed to be the best overall result for 
shareholders, based on our expectations of 
the business after making the investments. 
The Group reported net debt increased 
to £12.0m at 31 December 2017 (2016: 
£10.5m), as expected with the £5.6m 
deferred consideration payable on ConSol 
Partners in 2017. We expect to see a 
reduction in debt by the end of 2018 as we 
do not currently plan to make any significant 
external investments in the year.

increased by 15%, in line 
with our progressive 
dividend policy. Strategic report Governance Financials 27

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATOR
CASH GENERATED FROM 
OPERATIONS 
This demonstrates how much cash is 
available for the Group to cover tax, 
financing and investments. It is measured 
as the operating profit of the Group, 
excluding non-cash items and including 
working capital movements.
Progress: £12.6m (2016: £11.1m).  
The cash generated from operations has 
been utilised in 2017 as follows:
Net interest (£0.6) 
Taxation (£5.5m)
Net deferred consideration (£5.5m)
Capital expenditure on tangible 
fixed assets and software (£0.9m) 
Dividends to shareholders (£0.6m)
Dividends to non-controlling 
interests in subsidiaries (£0.1m) 
Cash generated from operations (£m)
The deferred consideration includes £5.6m 
paid in relation to the investment in ConSol 
Partners. There are no further payments 
remaining on any existing investments. The 
taxation payment of £5.5m includes £0.8m 
of advance withholding tax on dividends, 
which is expected to be recovered in 2018. 
Dividend
During the year, the Group paid a dividend 
of £0.6m in respect of the year ended 
31 December 2016, amounting to 1.15p per 
share. For the year ended 31 December 
2017, the Board is proposing a dividend 
of 1.32p per share, which if approved by 
shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting, will be paid on 31 May 2018 to 
shareholders on the register on 4 May 2018.
Liquidity and funding risk
The Group maintains a range of appropriate 
facilities to manage its working capital 
and medium-term financing requirements. 
At the year end, the Group had banking 
facilities totalling £50.5m (2016: £52.0m). 
This included a reduction in the UK invoice 
financing facility as ConSol Partners joined 
the Group arrangement and so closed their 
previous facility. We also increased the 
overall level of overdrafts across the Group, 
with the UK term loan reducing in line with 
the agreed repayment terms. The amount 
of facility undrawn of £19.3m (2016: £15.4m) 
excludes the headroom on the invoice 
financing facility, which is available to the 
UK companies only. The £10.0m revolving 
credit facility is with HSBC Bank plc, 
entered into for investment funding in 2016. 
Connected to this facility is a £5.0m 
accordion arrangement which has been 
agreed in principle by the bank, but would 
need new credit approval for any draw 
down from this amount. As part of the bank 
facilities with HSBC Bank plc, security is 
provided by companies in the UK, Germany 
and New Zealand.

Finance review
continued
As part of the revolving credit facility we 
need to meet bank covenant tests on a 
quarterly basis. All tests have been met 
during the year. The covenants and our 
performance against them at year end are 
as follows:
Covenant Target Actual
Net debt: EBITDA* < 2.5 times 0.6
Interest cover > 5.0 times 17.6
Debt service cover > 1.25 times 5.8
*  Target started at 3.0, reducing to 2.75 from the quarter 
ended 31 December 2016 and to 2.5 from the quarter 
ended 31 December 2017
Interest rate risk
The Group’s bank facilities are subject to 
floating interest rates. This is expected to 
match the interest costs with the economic 
cycle (eg when interest rates are higher 
there is typically better economic growth 
and so for a cyclical industry such as 
recruitment, profits should be greater when 
the economy is performing positively). The 
overdraft and invoice financing facilities are 
used to fund working capital requirements 
for temporary and contract recruitment 
businesses. During a downturn there is 
typically an unwinding of working capital as 
trade receivables are collected, so reducing 
the financing requirement and subsequent 
interest cost.
The majority of UK bank accounts are 
included in a cash pooling arrangement. 
An interest optimisation model allows 
currency balances (including overdrafts) 
to be included within the cash pooling 
arrangement. With interest income not 
generally paid on current accounts, the 
Group aims to minimise the external interest 
cost by pooling surplus funds from around 
the Group to minimise the use of the 
overdraft facilities.
Finance income was £0.1m (2016: £0.1m), 
all being bank interest income. Finance 
costs were £0.7m (2016: £0.7m), which 
related to interest payable on invoice 
discounting, bank loans and overdrafts. 
The effective interest rate for bank facilities 
for the year was 2.6% (2016: 2.6%).
Foreign exchange risk
There was no foreign exchange from trading 
in the year (2016: Nil).
The Group remains open to translation risk 
from reporting overseas results in Sterling. 
We do not actively hedge this exposure, 
with the diversity of operations across 
different countries providing an element 
of natural hedge. During the year we were 
positively impacted overall by movements in 
exchange rates on the translation of Group 
results, the largest are detailed below:
Currency
Decline/(increase) 
in Sterling in the year 
using average rates (P&L)
Japanese Yen 2%
Indonesian Rupiah 4%
US Dollar 5%
Australian Dollar 8%
Euro 7%
Chilean Peso 9%
Thai Bhat 9%
New Zealand Dollar (2%)
There are a small number of forward 
currency contracts in place at IMS (to sell 
US dollars and Pounds sterling) and ConSol 
Partners (to sell Euros). The amount 
covered by these at year end was £0.8m 
(2016: £0.6m).
Credit risk
The main credit risks arise through the use 
of different banks across the Group and on 
the Group’s trade receivables. The credit 
ratings of the banks used within the Group 
are monitored with a target that no more 
than 10% of Group cash is held in banks 
with a rating below BBB (Fitch rating) or 
equivalent. This target was fully met 
throughout the year.
Debtor days are reviewed monthly with 
high balances followed up with local 
management. Average debtor days for the 
Group in 2017 were 41 (2016: 47), with 
a year-end balance of 40 (2016: 41 days). 
This has reduced with Rishworth Aviation 
joining the Group as they have low debtor 
days, with airlines typically paying either in 
advance or within a short period of pilots 
being paid. 
The debtor days in UAE remain higher than 
the Group average, although good progress 
has been made in managing this position. 
The outstanding debtor balance has 
reduced at the end of December 2017, 
although there have been further bad debt 
write downs on historic debts during the 
year. The Group’s bad debt expense was 
£0.8m in the year (2016: £0.6m).

Investments and non-controlling 
interests
Goodwill and intangibles
Goodwill and intangibles represent the 
largest assets on the balance sheet and 
arise due to the acquisitive strategy followed 
by the Group. As at 31 December 2017 
the balance was £54.1m (2016: £56.8m). 
The movements in the year were £1.7m 
of amortisation (2016: £1.1m) and foreign 
exchange loss of £1.0m (2016: gain of 
£4.7m).
There was no impairment in the year 
(2016: £0.6m). The details of the impairment 
review can be found in note 14 to the 
accounts.
Investments and disposals
A deferred consideration payment of £5.6m 
was paid in cash in relation to the 
investment in ConSol Partners in October 
2016, being the final payment due for the 
purchase of the 65% interest.
The Group received £0.1m in deferred 
consideration from disposals made in 2013 
of the Bar 2 payroll business and in March 
2015 of the GiT business.  Strategic report Governance Financials 29
In September 2017 the Group disposed 
of its 51% investment in PT Learning 
Resources, a non-core training business 
in Indonesia. This resulted in a loss on 
disposal of £0.9m, after consideration 
received of £0.1m. The loss represents the 
write off of historic funding balances with 
no cash paid to the purchaser. Further cash 
consideration of £0.2m could be receivable, 
but is contingent on the outcome of a local 
tax investigation. No asset has been 
recognised at this stage.
Management equity philosophy  
and non-controlling interests
A key component of our business model 
is management equity, where senior 
management own shares directly in the 
operating companies they are responsible 
for. Details of how this operates can be 
found in the Strategic review on page 4.
When we acquire a majority stake in a 
business, the shares remaining with the 
founder are called ‘first generation shares’. 
There are no material changes to the rights 
belonging to these first generation shares 
retained by founder management. We also 
enable senior management to acquire 
‘second generation shares’. This will often 
be when the first generation shares have 
been acquired by Empresaria and we want 
to incentivise the next tier of management 
in the operating company to grow the 
business to the next level. Management 
need to buy the second generation shares 
at market value, investing their own cash, 
which is at risk if the business does not 
perform. To help lower the market value 
of the second generation shares (to make 
it affordable for management to acquire 
a meaningful stake in the business they 
are responsible for) and to protect the profit 
that we have already acquired, we set 
a ‘threshold profit’ level. These second 
generation shares only start creating value 
for management if the profit grows above 
the ‘threshold profit’ level. The second 
generation shares typically have restrictions, 
such as limited or no entitlement to 
dividends and the price paid by the 
management shareholder reflects these 
restricted rights.
Based on the results for the year ended 
31 December 2017, the total value of all 
non-controlling interests (shares held by 
management in the operating companies 
they are responsible for), if purchased in 
full in 2018 using the valuation mechanisms 
in existing shareholders agreements, 
would total £9.4m (2016: £9.0m), ignoring 
any potential discounts under the 
shareholders agreements for shares being 
acquired before the end of the holding 
period. There is no legal obligation on 
the Group to acquire the shares held by 
management at any time.
In some situations the consideration 
payable under the shareholders’ agreement 
for second generation equity may be 
greater than the fair value of the shares 
under IFRS 13, where there are restrictions 
over the rights of the shares, typically over 
dividends. The valuation mechanism in the 
majority of shareholders’ agreements uses 
an earnings multiple, which does not 
differentiate between shares with restricted 
rights and those without restrictions. If the 
price paid for the shares is in excess of this 
fair value, this additional amount paid is 
recognised as a charge in the income 
statement. These charges are treated as 
adjusting items when presenting the 
adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit 
before tax and adjusted earnings per share. 
In April 2017, we increased our interest 
in Monroe Consulting (executive search 
in the Philippines) from 70% to 90%. The 
consideration was £0.1m, all paid in cash. 
This purchase is treated as a fair value 
charge in the income statement.
In May 2017, we increased our shareholding 
in Monroe Consulting (executive search 
in Thailand) by 10%, taking our interest up 
to 80%. The consideration of £0.2m was 
paid in cash. This purchase is treated as a 
fair value charge in the income statement. 
At the same time we have sold 10% second 
generation equity (taking our interest back 
to 70%) to local managers who became 
first time shareholders in the company. 
In line with our equity model, the second 
generation shares only create value if the 
profits exceed historic levels.

Going concern
The Board has undertaken a recent and 
thorough review of the Group’s budget, 
forecasts and associated risks and 
sensitivities. The Group’s UK and German 
overdraft facilities were renewed in March 
2018 for a further 12 months. Given the 
business forecasts and early trading 
performance, the Group is expected to 
be able to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future, being a period 
of at least 12 months from the date of 
approval of the accounts. As a result, 
the going concern basis continues to be 
appropriate in preparing the financial 
statements. Further details on going 
concern are found in note 1.

Risks and uncertainties – Managing our risk
The Board has ultimate responsibility 
for effective risk management across the 
Group. The risk management process 
followed by the Board is designed to 
improve the likelihood of delivering against 
strategy, to protect the interests of 
shareholders, to improve the quality of 
decision-making and to help safeguard 
our assets. We have an established 
process for identifying and monitoring the 
key operational and strategic risks in the 
Group. The risk management process 
consists of a Group risk register and 
a Risk appetite policy. 
Risk register
This is reviewed by the Board at each 
meeting with risks added, amended or 
removed as appropriate and actions 
updated. The Group register is prepared 
based on individual brand registers which 
are updated during the annual budget cycle 
and reviewed regularly during the year with 
senior management at brand-level Board 
meetings. The Audit Committee oversees 
the internal control and financial control 
frameworks to help mitigate risk.
Risk appetite policy
The Board wishes to minimise the exposure 
to risks but accepts and recognises a trade-
off exists between risk and reward in 
delivering to a growth strategy. The risk 
appetite has been reviewed and approved 
by the Board and is presented as part of the 
annual budgeting process. The Board has 
set a number of internal targets that frame 
its appetite for risk, with boundaries defining 
the limits the Group should operate within 
and trigger points to help monitor and 
identify where there is an increased risk of 
reaching the boundaries.
Group control environment
Group companies operate under a system 
of internal controls which includes, but 
is not limited to, a clear delegated authority 
to operational management, formal risk 
appraisals through the annual budget 
process, a comprehensive financial 
reporting system, investment evaluation 
and significant capital expenditure approval 
process and the self-certification by 
operating company management of 
compliance with controls and Group 
policies and procedures. The day to day 
risk management is the responsibility of 
the brand Managing Directors and this 
is regularly reviewed during meetings with 
the Executive Directors.
The risk management process identified 
a number of risks across the Group, as 
detailed in the chart below. The principal 
risks, that are most likely to affect business 
operations and hence the financial results 
and delivery of strategy, are explained 
in more detail in the following pages.

1. Political and social change
IMPACT ON THE BUSINESS CHANGE IN RISK PROFILE ACTIONS TAKEN TO MITIGATE RISK
The Group’s businesses are subject to legislation, 
regulations and changes in political sentiment in 
each of their locations. In particular, this impacts 
temporary recruitment which is regulated to protect 
the rights and treatment of temporary workers and 
in developing staffing markets where new 
regulations are introduced as the market develops. 
Any changes to labour regulations, tax laws or 
political views on the staffing industry could impact 
on the manner in which any business, or the Group 
as a whole, conducts its business and could 
therefore affect the financial performance of the 
Group. In some territories a recruitment licence 
is required. If local laws and regulations are not 
followed it could lead to sanctions being taken 
against the Company, including penalties, fines 
and licences being revoked.
Social changes impact how people search for jobs 
and where they are likely to live. Our businesses 
need to target the locations where people want 
to work. They need to be able to identify and 
communicate with candidates to ensure job 
vacancies are filled.
In the UK new legislation was introduced for 
public sector staffing (IR35) and there is an 
ongoing consultation about whether to apply this 
to the private sector from 2019.
In the USA President Trump continues to look to 
reduce the cost related to the Affordable Care Act. 
At this stage there have not been any changes 
that have made a significant impact on our 
business.
In Germany new legislation started in April 2017 
to limit the length of time a worker can be a 
temporary worker to 18 months. There are also 
new minimum wage regulations that apply after 
9 months. This has negatively impacted our 
temporary staffing business in Germany and we 
expect this will continue into 2018 through 
continuing pressure on margins.
The Brexit negotiations create uncertainty for 
businesses operating in the UK and Continental 
Europe. At this stage there is no clarity about the 
UK’s future trading relationship with the EU or 
what the UK’s immigration policy will be after 
March 2019. There has been a benefit on 
translating Group results into Sterling from the 
devaluation of the currency, but rates remain 
volatile.
In Japan two pieces of new legislation take effect 
in 2018. The first limits the time a worker can work 
on a temporary contract with a client to 3 years. 
The second limits the time a position can be 
outsourced to 5 years before the worker can insist 
on being taken on for an “indefinite term”.
The Group closely monitors the legal and 
regulatory environment in our markets, in 
particular where we operate temporary 
recruitment as this is an area with greater 
levels of regulations. The Group has 
membership of many local industry 
associations and we use professional advisers 
with good local knowledge and understanding 
of the relevant laws and labour regulations to 
ensure we are compliant in the territories in 
which we operate. 
Our strategy is designed to minimise the 
negative impact from any political and social 
changes:
 • Diversification and balance across sectors 
and regions helps to reduce the potential 
impact in any one area
 • Focus on professional and specialist job 
levels reduces the exposure to changes in 
legislation, which are typically introduced 
to protect the most vulnerable and lowest 
paid workers
 • Focus on key economic centres means 
we are targeting the main centres where 
candidates want to work
By developing leading brands in our sectors 
we are experts in our markets, helping us to 
react to changes in legislation, as well as 
making it easier to attract candidates because 
of our reputation and knowledge.
2. Economic environment
IMPACT ON THE BUSINESS CHANGE IN RISK PROFILE ACTIONS TAKEN TO MITIGATE RISK
The performance of staffing businesses has 
historically shown a strong correlation with the 
performance of the economies in which they 
operate. An economic slowdown will impact on 
the demand for recruitment services and could 
reduce the Group’s profits.
The global economy overall is expected to grow 
in 2018, with all key economies forecasting growth 
for the first time since the financial crisis. However, 
these economies are increasingly inter-linked and 
there are many areas of uncertainty, so we take 
a cautious view on these forecasts. 
The full impact on the UK economy from the 
decision to leave the EU remains unclear and 
such uncertainty can negatively impact on 
investment in staff.
Governments around the world are increasingly 
adopting protectionist trade policies which could 
impact on economic growth and the ability to 
bring overseas workers into a market. 
The oil price has recovered from recent lows, but 
remains significantly below historic highs. The 
economies of the Middle East are particularly 
reliant on the oil price and our business in UAE 
has suffered from a slow-down in the local 
economy in the last few years.
 The Group’s strategy is designed to minimise 
the negative impact from an economic 
downturn in any one market, whilst 
acknowledging that a significant economic 
downturn will impact all businesses:
 • Sector and geographic diversification
This has improved with the full year impact 
from the investments made in 2016 in 
Rishworth Aviation and ConSol Partners
 • Develop core brands
By creating more robust businesses they 
should be able to better withstand any 
economic downturn 
We focus on temporary recruitment as this 
is typically less volatile than permanent 
recruitment during the economic cycles. 
Overall we continue to have a bias towards 
temporary and contract staffing.  32

Risks and uncertainties – Managing our risk
continued
3. Loss of key staff
IMPACT ON THE BUSINESS CHANGE IN RISK PROFILE ACTIONS TAKEN TO MITIGATE RISK
The Group’s success relies on recruiting and 
retaining key staff. 
The loss of a key staff member without a suitable 
successor in place could lead to a reduction in 
trading and profitability. The choice of the wrong 
manager for a business could lead to sub-optimal 
decision-making and losing ground to competitors 
or failing to operate procedures properly and 
so being liable to reputational damage, fines or 
penalties.
There have been a number of changes in senior 
management during 2017 as part of business 
restructuring which we believe will help the 
business to develop positively in 2018.
A key part of the Group’s business model 
is management equity, incentivising key 
management through equity ownership and 
tying them to the business for the long term. 
We monitor the number of managers with 
equity in their own businesses and work with 
existing shareholders to identify key staff to 
purchase equity in the future.
Currently there is one brand in the Group 
with no management shareholder  
(2016: one brand).
4. Investments poorly executed
IMPACT ON THE BUSINESS CHANGE IN RISK PROFILE ACTIONS TAKEN TO MITIGATE RISK
There is a risk of losing value from poorly executed 
investments. If an investment is overvalued the 
Group will pay too much for it and risks a lower 
return on investment in the future from profits being 
generated. A poorly executed integration into the 
Group could lead to lost value or lost opportunities. 
Organic investments in new offices will generally  
be loss making in the first 1-2 years so this needs  
to be carefully managed to minimise the costs to  
the business. New office openings increase the  
risk of lower returns than planned if costs are not 
managed well.
We have opened a new office in Vietnam with 
the Monroe Consulting brand.
The external investments made in 2016 have been 
integrated into the Group and we continue to work 
with them to identify opportunities to develop their 
businesses.
We continue to look for new investment 
opportunities for the Group.
 All material investments, whether organic 
or external, must have Board approval. 
Investments must have a clearly defined 
integration plan, with the Executive Directors 
having responsibility for implementation of the 
plan. Due diligence findings need to be acted 
upon to minimise any risks identified pre-
acquisition. Any funding requirements must 
be taken into account for Group cash flow 
forecasts to ensure sufficient and appropriate 
funding is in place.
When investing in organic growth or bolt-on 
acquisitions for existing brands it is key that 
local management are fully involved and 
driving the process to ensure the best chance 
of success. 
With any investment activity the fit of the 
people is the most important factor. This is 
especially important in our Group where there 
is a highly decentralised structure. This is 
the first criteria that must be met before any 
investment activity is pursued. Strategic report Governance Financials 33
5. Financial
IMPACT ON THE BUSINESS CHANGE IN RISK PROFILE ACTIONS TAKEN TO MITIGATE RISK
The Group is reliant on debt financing to fund the 
working capital of the business.
By operating from 20 countries the Group is 
exposed to movements in foreign currency rates. 
The Group reports in Sterling but has operations in 
countries with different currencies. Negative 
movements in exchange rates would impact the 
reporting of Group profitability and may devalue the 
cash and assets around the Group.
If the Group was unable to secure funding at current 
levels it could be forced to dispose of parts of the 
business to repay the existing debt. An increase in 
interest rates will increase costs and so reduce the 
profit in the business.
If debt levels are too high there is an opportunity 
cost from not being able to pursue investment 
opportunities to further develop the Group.
In 2017 we have continued to benefit from 
movements in currency rates to translate results 
into our reporting currency, however, the Sterling 
exchange rates remain volatile.
The Group’s total debt has increased during 2017 
as a result of the investments made in 2016.
There have been increases in interest rates in 
the UK and USA (two regions that are important 
to us for our debt exposure). It is expected there 
will be further increases in interest rates during 
2018, but this should also be in response to 
positive economic conditions.
The Group finances its operations by a 
combination of cash reserves from retained 
profit, bank borrowings and issuing new 
equity. Treasury management is led by the 
Group finance team, which manages and 
monitors external and internal funding 
requirements and maintains the key Group 
banking relationships. 
The Group is exposed to movements in 
interest rates for its primary facilities. The 
Group does not currently hedge this exposure 
but monitors movements in the relevant 
interest rates to be able to react if the rates 
move adversely.
Approximately two thirds of the Group’s 
business is transacted outside of the UK so 
we are exposed to movements in exchange 
rates. The Group does not currently hedge 
translation risk as there is to some degree 
a natural hedge from our strategy of being 
diversified by region. Intra-Group balances 
are hedged, where possible, using cash or 
overdraft balances to act as a natural currency 
hedge, for US Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, 
Singapore Dollar, Australian Dollar, Mexican 
Peso and UAE Dirham. 
A limited number of forward contracts have 
been used to hedge trading currency risks for 
IMS in India and ConSol Partners in 
Continental Europe.
6. IT & Cyber related
IMPACT ON THE BUSINESS CHANGE IN RISK PROFILE ACTIONS TAKEN TO MITIGATE RISK
The risk of cyber-attacks has increased in the wider 
business environment, with threats from hackers, 
viruses or sensitive information being accessed 
without authorisation. 
A successful breach could lead to the loss of 
sensitive data on clients or candidates, damage 
to our brand reputation, business disruption or the 
loss of commercially sensitive information.
With increasingly stringent regulatory environments 
around data protection there is an ongoing risk of 
failing to comply with regulations, leading to fines 
and damage to brand reputation.
There have been a number of high profile cyber-
attacks around the world in 2017. The threat from 
this is always changing and as we grow our 
brands in size, they are more likely to be a target 
for hackers and criminals.
New legislation is being introduced in the EU in 
May 2018 (General Data Protection Regulation), 
which introduces new rights for individuals  
and promotes good data governance and 
accountability amongst organisations. This will 
lead to changes in how the Group companies 
operate and deal with data. There are significant 
fines for non-compliance.
We have policies in place to safeguard assets 
and data within the Group. We also use 
external advisers to monitor the security of 
our Group websites and systems to meet 
a minimum standard of security and we 
continue to monitor ongoing cyber-security 
threats.
We are working through the GDPR legislation 
to ensure that all Group companies are 
compliant by May 2018.  34

Corporate social responsibility
Empresaria believes that corporate and social 
responsibility is an important part of the 
Group’s culture and looks to adopt good 
practice in these areas. The Board gives due 
consideration to risks arising from social, 
environmental and ethical issues as part of 
its ongoing risk review process. We have 
a responsibility towards all stakeholders and 
believe this is an important consideration 
for the long-term growth of the business.
1. Local communities 2.  Candidates, clients,

3. Our staff 4. Society at large
A positive contributor to the community
The Group and senior management are fully supportive and 
encourage staff to work with their local communities and 
charitable concerns. The decision on what contribution to make 
is down to the local staff in each country.
Group companies are involved in a range of activities to provide 
help, support or money to local communities in their country 
of operation. Some examples of the work being done are 
detailed below.
 • In Indonesia, staff at Monroe Consulting continued their 
annual tradition of helping run a health clinic for 
disadvantaged children and their families at the Bantar 
Gebang rubbish dump in Jakarta.
 • The Thailand team increased their sponsorship to The Gift Of 
Happiness Foundation, a respected charity for poverty-
stricken children and their families. This enabled the 
Foundation to expand and extend its reach.
 • In the UK, LMA team members paid a weekly visit to an inner 
city school in London to read with children. They also raised 
over £6,000 for the NSPCC through a variety  
of different fundraising initiatives including a London to 
Brighton bike ride, sky diving and a sponsored hair shave. 
 • Teamsales supported a fundraising event in aid of the 
children’s charity, Variety. Greycoat Lumleys donated items 
to the Grenfell Tower clothing appeal and Christmas Shoe 
Box appeal for South Africa as well as donating prizes in 
support of the RHC Inaugural Family Gala and NSPCC, 
Sparkles in aid of Downs Syndrome. Staff also took part in 
a Richmond Park run to raise money for The Royal Marsden 
Cancer Charity.
 • Become Manchester successfully appointed three 
apprentices through local government funded apprenticeship

Environmental impact
Whilst it is recognised that the Group operates 
in a business sector that has a low environmental 
impact, the Group remains committed to 
minimising its impact on the environment. The 
Group is aware that this is an area of increasing 
importance to employees, shareholders and 
customers alike. The Group is not involved in the 
manufacture of any tangible products and has 
identified the principal areas of environmental 
impact as energy use, waste recycling, paper 
and printing and travel.

waste and waste paper and has seen a continued 
reduction in the use of printed materials around the 
Group by increasingly relying on electronic media 
for its primary marketing activity. The full Annual 
Report is also provided to the majority of 
shareholders in an electronic format to further 
reduce our printing costs and environmental 
impact, with a much smaller summary report sent 
to all shareholders.
As an internationally diverse group we recognise 
that some travel is inevitable and necessary for 
the effective management of the business, 
however, full use is made of remote conferencing 
facilities and working from home to minimise this 
as far as is practical.

Corporate governance statement
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Board’s annual report on corporate governance.
The Board continues to recognise that good corporate governance encourages effective and entrepreneurial management. It is a vital 
component to support management in their delivery of the Group’s strategic objectives and to operate a sustainable business for the 
benefit of all stakeholders. 
The Board seeks to follow best practice in corporate governance appropriate with the size of the Company and the regulatory framework 
that applies to AIM companies and to align these practices with the expectations of the Company’s stakeholders. We recognise the 
importance of adopting effective corporate governance practices in the best interests of all shareholders. 
We continue to review updates to the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) and consider and 
implement any changes to the Company’s corporate governance practices as appropriate. Although the Company is not required to report 
on compliance with the Code, since its shares are traded on the AIM market, the Company applies the Main Principles of the Code as 
outlined in the overview provided below and provides further explanation for areas of deviation.
Our corporate governance framework is described in more detail on the following pages.

Leadership
The role of the Board
The Company is controlled through the Board, which has established Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees (the 
‘Committees’), to which it delegates clearly defined powers. The Board is collectively responsible for the long-term success of 
the Company. 
There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for consideration by the Board (‘Schedule of Matters Reserved’) which includes 
responsibility for the following: 
 • approval of overall Group strategy and objectives
 • approval of the Group annual budget and monitoring progress towards its achievement
 • changes to the Group’s capital structure
 • changes to the Group’s principal activities
 • review and approval of the annual financial statements
 • changes to the senior management structure
 • approval of Group financing arrangements and treasury policy
 • approval of major investments, disposals and additional investments in existing operations
 • approval of major unbudgeted expenditure
The Schedule of Matters Reserved is reviewed by the Board, at least annually, to ensure it remains appropriate and complete. In tandem, 
the Board also reviews an approved schedule of operational matters, which are delegated to management of the operating subsidiaries.
The Terms of Reference for each of the Committees are available to view on the Company’s website (empresaria.com). Details of 
Committee membership and the work carried out by the Committees can be found in the Audit Committee report on pages 48 to 49. 
Directors’ remuneration report on pages 51 to 54 and Nomination Committee report on page 50.
During the year, the number of formal scheduled meetings of the Board and Committees and individual attendance by the members were 
as follows:
Main 
Board*
Audit 
Committee
Remuneration
 Committee
Nomination
 Committee
Tony Martin (Chairman) 9/9 – – –

Penny Freer (Joint Senior Independent Director) 9/9 5/5 3/3 1/1
Zach Miles (Joint Senior Independent Director) 9/9 5/5 3/3 1/1
*  The Board held nine scheduled meetings in the year, which were each attended by all Directors. There was also one meeting outside the normal course of events, which was also attended 
by all Directors.
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, with no one individual having unfettered 
powers of decision. The statement of division of responsibilities can be found on the Company’s website (empresaria.com).
The Chairman is primarily responsible for the running of the Board, promoting high standards of corporate governance and ensuring the 
effectiveness of the Board. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the executive leadership and management of the Group, to ensure 
implementation and delivery of Group strategy.
All Board meetings have a pre-agreed formal agenda setting out those matters for discussion, together with supporting papers. Time is 
allocated at all meetings to discuss any other business, which all Directors are invited by the Chairman to raise. 
All Non-Executive Directors participate in strategy development and decisions required to implement actions to progress towards meeting 
the objectives of the Company.  Strategic report Governance Financials 39
Effectiveness
Composition of the Board
The Board has a balance and depth of skills and experience, together with suitable knowledge of the Group, to enable them to discharge 
their respective duties and responsibilities effectively. 
Conflicts of interest of all Directors are reviewed on an annual basis and Directors have continuing obligations to update the Board on 
any changes to these conflicts. Situations which may create a conflict of interest are presented to the Board for review and approval as 
appropriate.
Independence
The independence of all Non-Executive Directors is reviewed on an annual basis, with reference to their independence of character and 
judgement and whether any circumstances or relationships exist that could affect their judgement. The review of independence is also 
considered in relation to Committee memberships in line with recommendations of the Code. The Chairman, Tony Martin, is considered 
to be non-independent due to his significant shareholding in the Company. The Board considers Penny Freer and Zach Miles to be 
independent, notwithstanding their periods of tenure. The Board notes in particular their skills and external experience, their involvement 
and insight in Board meetings and their ability to objectively challenge management. Penny Freer holds a shareholding in the Company 
but the Board considers this to be highly immaterial and does not affect her independence. 
Appointments to the Board
A Nomination Committee is in place to review the appointment of new Directors. Details of the work of the Nomination Committee 
and the process used for Board appointments can be found in the Nomination Committee report on page 50.
Commitment
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors serve under letters of appointment, which are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office and at the Annual General Meeting.
The annual time commitments are as follows:
 • Chairman – not less than 25 days
 • Non-Executive Directors – not less than 20 days
During 2017 Penny Freer served three additional days and Tony Martin served three and a half additional days. The time commitments 
were reviewed by the Nomination Committee, which was satisfied with the current letters of appointment. 
Neither Executive Director holds any external Non-Executive Director role.
Development
On appointment, the Directors receive a tailored introduction to the Group. Throughout their period of office, Directors are provided 
with regular business updates. Developments in corporate governance are reported to the Board by the Company Secretary. 
All Directors determine the training requirements appropriate to their role and the needs of the Company’s business. Examples of events 
include the attendance by the Chairman at two annual Staffing Industry Analysts Executive Conferences and workshops, in San Diego 
California, USA, and in London. The Chief Executive Officer joined the Chairman for the San Diego California event. The Chairman of the 
Audit Committee regularly refreshes his skills and knowledge by attending seminars and reviewing publications including those published 
by the FRC on the New Code principles and accounting standards. The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee regularly attends 
seminars delivered by Deloitte LLP on audit, corporate governance, remuneration and succession planning, as well as attending one-on-
one sessions with industry experts at a specialist remuneration consultancy. It has not been deemed appropriate to formalise a training and 
development programme for each Director.  40

Information and support
Prior to the beginning of each year, Board meetings are scheduled in line with the key financial reporting dates. A more detailed agenda, 
together with the Board papers, is distributed in a timely manner before each Board meeting. All Directors receive sufficient relevant 
information on financial, business and corporate issues to enable informed decisions to be taken by them at the Board meetings. Any 
specific actions arising during meetings are agreed by the Board and a follow-up procedure monitors their completion. Monthly financial 
and operational reviews are distributed to the Board, irrespective of whether a scheduled meeting is to take place. This assists the Board 
to keep informed of developments on a regular basis.
The Directors are advised by the Company Secretary, a solicitor since 2001, and are able to take independent professional advice in the 
furtherance of their duties as necessary. 
Evaluation
The Board has considered the benefits from undertaking formal evaluations of its performance and those of its Committees and individual 
Directors. Formal Executive Director performance evaluations are conducted annually in preparation for the review and approval of the 
annual remuneration packages. Each Non-Executive Director’s performance is evaluated as an outcome of the formal performance 
evaluations of the Committee(s) of which they are a member.
The Audit and Remuneration Committees oversee an annual self-evaluation process, which is used by the Board and by each Committee 
to determine their effectiveness and opportunities for improvement. Further details of the Committee performance reviews can be found 
in the Audit Committee report as set out on page 49 and the Directors’ remuneration report as set out on page 51.
The Board considers that the evaluation of the Executive Directors and the Committees provides an appropriate review of each Director’s 
performance in relation to their specific roles. A formal evaluation of Board performance has not been deemed necessary due to the size 
and composition of the Board.
Details on the Director appointments by shareholders can be found in the Directors’ Report on page 45.
Accountability
Financial and business reporting
The Board reviews and approves all reports on the Company’s position and prospects to present a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy. This includes reports of a statutory and regulatory 
nature, as required by the AIM rules, which are of a price-sensitive nature.
Risk management and internal control 
Risk management remains the responsibility of the Board. The Audit Committee has delegated responsibility to keep under review 
the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company’s internal financial controls and internal control and risk management system. Risk 
management is reviewed at every Board meeting as part of the formal Board process.
The Board has identified and evaluated the significant risks faced by the Group for the delivery of the Group strategy. The Board has 
agreed how each risk is to be addressed and the necessary actions to be taken. Details of the principle risks identified are set out in 
the Strategic report on pages 1 to 35. 
The Audit Committee meets specifically to review the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems and 
to review the Group and subsidiary risks identified and progress of actions taken to manage the risks. Following the review, progress 
and actions are reported to the Board. A separate Audit Committee report is set out on pages 48 to 49 and provides details of the 
role and activities of the Audit Committee and its relationship with the external auditor.
Remuneration
A separate Directors’ remuneration report is set out on pages 51 to 54 and provides details of the remuneration policy, level and 
components of remuneration and procedure for fixing the individual remuneration packages of individual Directors. Strategic report Governance Financials 41
Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with shareholders
The Directors seek to maintain a mutual understanding of objectives between the Company and its shareholders by:
 • making annual and interim presentations to institutional investors;
 • meeting shareholders to discuss long-term issues and obtain their views;
 • presenting to shareholders at externally run events; and
 • communicating regularly during the year.
Relations with shareholders are managed principally by the Executive Directors. The views of shareholders are communicated to the 
Board as a whole through regular Board meetings and communication between meetings. Although primary responsibility for effective 
communication with shareholders lies with the Chairman, the Executive Directors prepare presentations for institutional and private 
investors following the interim and preliminary announcements. The annual and interim presentations made to investors are made available 
to all shareholders on the Company’s website, as well as any recorded interviews with the Executive Directors. 
Constructive use of the Annual General Meeting
The Board seeks to use the Annual General Meeting to communicate with shareholders. Shareholders are encouraged to participate 
in the Annual General Meetings, at which the Chairman presents updates on the Group’s performance. The Board, together with the 
Chairmen of the Committees, will be available at the 2018 Annual General Meeting to answer questions from shareholders.

Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the 
European Union and the AIM rules and have chosen to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with Financial 
Reporting Standard 102 (‘FRS 102’). Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 • select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 • make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 • state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained  
in the financial statements; and
 • prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in 
business.
In preparing the Group’s financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
 • properly select and apply accounting policies;
 • present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
 • provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand  
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
 • make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website (empresaria.com). Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
1.  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; 
2.  the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face; and
3.  the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy.
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board on 13 March 2018 and is signed on its behalf by:

Chairman of the Audit Committee
Monitoring and reviewing 
the integrity of financial 
statements with an oversight 
for internal control and risk.
Role and composition  
of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee has responsibility, on 
behalf of the Board, to monitor the integrity 
of the financial statements of the Company, 
review the adequacy of internal control and 
risk management systems and oversee the 
relationship with the external auditor. The 
Terms of Reference for the Audit Committee 
can be found on the Company’s website 
(empresaria.com). 
The Audit Committee makes whatever 
recommendations to the Board it deems 
appropriate, on any area within its remit, 
where action or improvement is needed.
The Audit Committee is appointed by the 
Board from the independent Non-Executive 
Directors of the Company, with a minimum 
requirement of two such Directors, one 
of whom should be a financially qualified 
member. Appointments are for a period of 
up to three years, which may be extended 
for further periods of up to three years, 
provided the Director still meets the criteria 
for membership of the Committee. The 
independent Non-Executive Directors 
who served on the Committee during the 
year are:

Meetings
The Audit Committee is required to meet 
formally twice per year. During 2017, the 
Committee held five formal meetings, which 
were scheduled around the financial 
reporting timetable. The Audit Committee 
invites the Group Finance Director and 
senior representatives of the external 
auditor to attend all of its meetings, although 
it reserves the right to request any of these 
individuals to withdraw from the meeting.
Audit Committee activity
Financial and business reporting
Since the beginning of 2017 to the date 
of this report, the Audit Committee has 
reviewed the 2016 and 2017 financial 
statements, the 2017 interim statement 
(unaudited) and carried out a going concern 
review. Reviews of the financial statements 
included the accounting policies, significant 
financial reporting issues and key 
judgements and estimates underpinning 
the financial statements, including:
 • going concern;
 • carrying value of goodwill, intangible 
assets and investments; 
 • appropriateness of provision balances; 
and
 • tax accounting, including deferred tax 
assets value. Strategic report Governance Financials 49
For the going concern and the carrying 
value of goodwill and investments, the 
Committee examined the assumptions 
supporting the Group’s profit and cash 
flow forecasts and the sensitivities applied 
to those forecasts, the banking facilities 
available and the assessment of the 
Group’s covenant compliance based 
on the forecasts. Details of the matters 
reviewed are included in notes 1 to 3 
and 14.
For the other key judgements and estimates, 
the Committee was satisfied with the 
assumptions made and the accounting 
treatments adopted.
Risk management and internal control
Risk management is the responsibility 
of the Board. Further details about the 
process followed and principal risks and 
uncertainties that could affect business 
operations can be found in the Strategic 
report on pages 30 to 33. The Audit 
Committee keep under review the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal controls and risk 
management systems.
Due to the size of the Group, and the costs 
involved, the Audit Committee continues to 
recommend to the Board that there is no 
requirement for a separate internal audit 
function. A summary of the internal controls 
for Group companies is presented to the 
Audit Committee, including updates on 
the resolution of any control weaknesses 
identified. The internal controls are reviewed 
by the Group finance function. During the 
year the Audit Committee reviewed and 
approved a change in approach for the 
internal control reviews in the year.
Every year the Audit Committee review the 
Group’s treasury policy, for approval by the 
Board. The Audit Committee also review 
the Group’s risk framework reports, to be 
presented to and discussed by the Board. 
 
The Group’s whistleblowing policy contains 
arrangements for the Company Secretary 
to receive, in confidence, complaints on 
accounting, risk issues, internal controls, 
auditing issues and related matters. 
The Group has a mandatory Code of 
Conduct, which sets out the minimum 
expected behaviours for all employees. 
A copy of this can be found on the 
Company’s website (empresaria.com).
External audit
The Audit Committee is responsible for 
the development, implementation and 
monitoring of the Group’s policy on external 
audit. The Terms of Reference assign 
responsibility to the Audit Committee for 
overseeing the relationship with the external 
auditor. During 2017, the Audit Committee 
has continued to manage the relationship 
with the external auditor, including in 
relation to the 2016 and 2017 Audit 
Committee reports.
The Group’s policy on non-audit related 
services prescribes the types of engagements 
for which the external auditor can be used 
and those engagements which are 
prohibited. For engagement for services 
which are non-recurring in nature, prior 
approval must be sought from the Audit 
Committee. The auditor has not performed 
any non-audit services during the year.
Note 7 includes disclosure of the auditor’s 
remuneration for the year, including an 
analysis of audit services, audit related 
services and other non-audit services 
under those headings prescribed by law. 
Deloitte LLP was first appointed as the 
Company’s auditor in October 2002. 
Following an external tender process during 
2013 Deloitte LLP was reappointed for 
the 2014 and subsequent audits, resulting 
in a current tenure of 15 years. 
Following completion of the 2017 audit 
process, the Audit Committee is satisfied 
with the performance of Deloitte LLP and 
has recommended to the Board that 
Deloitte LLP is reappointed.
Assessment of the Audit Committee
Following completion of the 2017 audit 
process, the Audit Committee conducted 
a self-assessment of its performance during 
the year. The evaluation process measured 
performance against its Terms of Reference 
including:
 • presentation of compliance reports by the 
Compliance Officer
 • review and implementation of risk 
management processes by subsidiaries
 • ongoing, regular reviews of internal 
controls
 • monitoring developments in corporate 
governance and compliance.
The Board concluded that the Audit 
Committee has acted in accordance with 
its Terms of Reference and had ensured 
the independence and objectivity of the 
external auditor.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee will 
be available at the 2018 Annual General 
Meeting to answer any questions about the 
work of the Committee.

Remuneration policy for the Executive Directors
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, retain, motivate and reward Executive Directors, whilst aligning rewards with the 
business objectives and performance and the interests of shareholders. 
Link between business objectives and remuneration policy
It is the Company’s policy for performance-related pay of Executive Directors to be linked to key performance indicators of the Company. 
The Company’s key objectives include developing sustainable growth in earnings, through a combination of organic growth and 
investments, alongside a gradual reduction in debt levels. The performance measures chosen to link executive remuneration to the 
achievement of these objectives are growth in earnings per share, conversion ratio and debtor days.
Director’s contracts and letters of appointment
It is the Company’s policy that Executive Directors should have contracts with indefinite terms providing for a maximum of 12 months’ 
notice by the Company or the individual. In the event of early termination, the Executive Directors’ contracts provide for compensation up 
to a maximum of the basic salary for the notice period. 
The details of the Executive Directors’ contracts are summarised as follows:
Director Effective date of contract Notice period
Chief Executive Officer (Joost Kreulen) 1 January 2012 12 months
Group Finance Director and Chief Operating Officer (Spencer Wreford) 4 May 2010 6 months
Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, serve under letters of appointment, which either party can terminate on three months’ 
written notice.
Annual fees of Directors
The basic annual salary of each Executive Director is reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee with changes taking effect on 
1 January. The remuneration for the Non-Executive Directors (including the Chairman) is determined by the Board within the limits set by 
the Articles and is based on information on fees paid in similar companies and the skills and expected time commitment of the individual 
concerned. The fees are reviewed each year as part of the annual budgeting process. The Non-Executive Directors do not receive any 
additional remuneration for chairing Committees.

Directors’ remuneration report
continued Strategic report Governance Financials 53
The following information is not subject to audit.
Pension and other benefits-in-kind
In addition to the basic remuneration payable under the service agreements, each of the Executive Directors is entitled to a pension 
provision and a range of other benefits, including private medical insurance and car allowance. The Company has agreed to make 
contributions into the Executive Directors’ private pension schemes as follows:
 • Chief Executive Officer – 15% of basic salary
 • Group Finance Director and Chief Operating Officer – 10% of basic salary 
The Non-Executive Directors (including the Chairman) have no right to compensation on the early termination of their appointments and 
do not participate in the LTIP or receive any other benefits.
Annual bonus
The Remuneration Committee establishes the objectives that must be met for each financial year if a cash bonus is to be paid to the 
Executive Directors. The annual bonus for the 2017 financial year was based on three specific strategic Key Performance Indicators: 
adjusted earnings per share, conversion ratio and debtor days. Based on the Remuneration Committee’s assessment of the financial 
performance against those KPIs, it has determined that bonus payments amounting to 12% of the maximum bonus (100% of basic salary) 
should be made to the Executive Directors.
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for supervising the Company’s LTIP and making Awards under its terms. The maximum 
value of ordinary shares that could be Awarded in a year is 175% of basic salary. The current policy is to review the final audited results 
of the Company prior to agreeing if Awards are to be made.
Five Awards have been made up to the date of this report. For each Award the performance targets are 70% earnings per share (‘EPS’) 
growth and 30% share price growth. The percentage of Awards vesting would be in accordance with performance at the following levels 
(subject to the terms of the LTIP): 
Performance below the threshold No Award
Performance at the threshold level 20% of the relevant part of the Award vests 
Performance at the maximum level 100% of the relevant part of the Award vests
Between these points there is a straight-line release of the Award.
A summary of the qualifying conditions with respect to performance for the three Awards yet to vest as at 31 December 2017 is as follows:

Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion:
 • the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 • the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union;
 • the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice including Financial Reporting Standard 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic 
of Ireland”; and
 • the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements of Empresaria Group plc (the ‘Parent Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) which comprise:
 • the Consolidated income statement;
 • the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
 • the Consolidated and Parent Company balance sheets;
 • the Consolidated and Parent Company statements of changes in equity;
 • the Consolidated cash flow statement;
 • the Statement of accounting policies; and
 • the related notes 1 to 28 for the Group and notes 1 to 10 for the Parent Company. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Parent Company 
financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard 
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matter The key audit matter that we identified in the current year was the carrying value of goodwill and other 
intangible assets. 
Materiality The materiality that we used for the Group financial statements was £675,000 which was determined on 
the basis of 7.5% of reported profit before tax after adding back the loss on disposal.
Scoping Our global testing approach was focused primarily on UK, Germany, New Zealand, Chile, Japan, India and 
Indonesia and were subject to a combination of full scope audits and audit of specified account balances. 
These locations account for 85% of the Group’s net assets, 91% of the Group’s revenue and 82% of the 
Group’s profit before tax.

to the members of Empresaria Group plc  56
Empresaria Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Conclusions relating to going concern
We are required by ISAs (UK) to report in respect of the following matters where:
 • the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of the financial 
statements is not appropriate; or 
 • the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that 
may cast significant doubt about the Group’s or the Parent Company’s ability to continue to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the 
financial statements are authorised for issue.
We have nothing to report 
in respect of these matters. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of 
the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. 
These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and 
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
Key audit matter description Empresaria plc has achieved growth through a mix of organic growth and acquisition of recruitment 
businesses. As at 31 December 2017 it holds goodwill of £35.9m and associated intangible assets of 
£18.2m on its consolidated balance sheet. IAS 36 requires that management perform an impairment 
review annually using projected cash flows discounted at a rate which takes into account the risks within 
those cash flows.
Management must apply their judgement in preparing the discounted cash flow which forms the basis of 
the impairment review. In particular management must consider the supportability of the bridge between 
results achieved for the year ended 31 December 2017 and the forecast results for 2018 and beyond with 
a focus on those CGUs that have under-performed. Pharmaceutical Strategies was identified as the CGU 
sensitive to movements to the inputs in the model. Management has included a disclosure in note 14 
explaining the impact of reasonably possible changes in assumptions.
The Group’s accounting policy in relation to impairment of intangible assets including goodwill is included 
in note 2 and is further described in note 14. This is discussed by the Audit Committee on pages 48 to 49.
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the key audit 
matter
In order to address this key audit matter we have:
 • Evaluated the design and implementation of management’s controls over the preparation and review 
of impairment assessments
 • Challenged the supportability of the bridge between actual results as at 31 December 2017 and forecast 
results for 2018 and beyond. For territories that had under-performed we discussed business 
performance with both local and Group management and obtained corroborative evidence to validate 
explanations received. Key procedures included reviewing newly signed contracts for both clients and 
consultants, reviewed external market research to understand pipeline and reviewed post year end 
performance against budget to assess accuracy of initial forecast 
 • Recalculated the country specific discount factors using our internal specialists to assess whether those 
employed in management’s model were within the predicted range 
 • Assessed historical forecasting accuracy through comparing 2017 actuals to 2017 budgets
 • Challenged growth rates through a combination of using internal specialists to review industry and 
country specific data provided by management
 • Assessed management’s sensitivities as well as applying an additional set of our own sensitivities
 • Checked the mathematical accuracy of the schedules supporting the cash flow model
 • Reviewed the disclosures explaining the impact of reasonably possible changes in assumptions.
Key observations From the work performed above, we concluded that the inputs and assumptions applied in the valuation 
model, and the disclosures made, were appropriate.

Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of 
a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and 
in evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Materiality Group financial statements
£675,000 
Parent Company financial statements
£472,500
Basis for determining materiality 7.5% of reported profit before tax after 
adding back the loss on disposal of £0.9m 
associated with PT Learning Resources.
Group materiality equates to approximately 
0.2% of revenue and 1.4% of net assets. 
1.2% of net assets as capped by the upper 
limit of the component materiality range
Rationale for the benchmark applied In determining our materiality benchmark 
we considered a number of benchmarks 
and the performance indicators most 
applicable to the users of the financial 
statements, the nature of the business and 
comparative audit reports for listed entities. 
We determined that profit before tax is a 
key measure used by analysts in presenting 
business performance to users of the 
financial statements. 
Net assets is the key measure used by  
users of the financial information of a parent 
company being that of a holding company 
for the investments.

reporting threshold

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £33,750, as well as 
differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee 
on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.  58

An overview of the scope of our audit
Our audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including internal control, how the Group is 
organised, the consolidation process, the performance and financial position of each component as a proportion of the total for the Group 
and assessing the risks of material misstatement throughout the Group. Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope 
primarily on the Group operations in the UK, Germany, New Zealand, Chile, Japan, India and Indonesia.
UK, Germany, New Zealand, Chile and Indonesia were subject to a full audit, whilst Japan and India were subject to audit procedures on 
specified account balances. Our testing in these locations was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the 
materiality of the Group’s operations at those locations. These locations account for 85% of the Group’s net assets, 91% of the Group’s 
revenue and 82% of the Group’s profit before tax. The materiality used in each location where we performed an audit or audit of specified 
account balances procedures ranged from £337,500 to £472,500.

The group audit engagement team visited the German component audit team as part of our oversight of their work. For the other locations 
set out above a senior member of the group audit engagement team held detailed discussions with the component teams in order to 
update our understanding of the operations, risks and control environments of each component as well as a review of the component 
auditors’ working papers. The group audit engagement team performed the audit of the UK businesses without the involvement of 
a component team. 
For all other locations the group audit engagement team performed analytical review procedures at Group level to confirm our conclusion 
that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not 
subject to audit or audit of specified account balances. At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process. 
Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information 
included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent 
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to 
determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement 
of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report 
in respect of these matters.

continued  59 Strategic report Governance Financials
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 • the information given in the strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements; and
 • the Strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and or the Parent Company and their environment obtained in the course 
of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the Strategic report or the Directors’ report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 • we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 • adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our 
audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
 • the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report 
in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of 
Directors’ remuneration have not been made.
We have nothing to report 
in respect of this matter.

Notes to the Consolidated financial statements
1 Basis of preparation and general information 
Empresaria Group plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered 
office is Old Church House, Sandy Lane, Crawley Down, Crawley, West Sussex, RH10 4HS. Its company registration number is 3743194. 
The consolidated financial statements are for the twelve months ended 31 December 2017. The financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union (EU) and therefore the Group financial statements comply with AIM rules. 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except that they have been modified to include the 
revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The measurement bases and principal accounting policies of the Group 
are set out below. 
These consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling (£) because that is the presentational currency of the Group. 
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2. 
Changes in accounting policies 
Adoption of new and revised standards 
In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted.
 Amendments to IAS 7:    Disclosure Initiative
 Amendments to IAS 12:   Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses
 Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2014-2016: Amendments to: IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
No amendments to these financial statements have been made as a result of adopting new and revised standards and interpretations.
Standards and Interpretations in issue but not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these 
financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
 IFRS 9    Financial Instruments
 IFRS 15   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (and the related Clarifications)
 IFRS 16  Leases
 IFRS 17   Insurance Contracts
 IFRS 2 (amendments) Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions
 IFRS 4 (amendments) Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts
 IAS 40 (amendments) Transfers of Investment Property
 IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (amendments): Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture
  Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle: Amendments to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting 
Standards and IFRS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
 IFRIC 22  Foreign Currency Transactions and Advanced Consideration
 IFRIC 23  Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2018)
IFRS 9 introduces a new classification approach for financial assets and liabilities. The categories of financial assets will be reduced from 
four to three and financial liabilities will be measured at amortised cost or fair value through profit and loss. The standard also prescribes an 
‘expected credit loss’ model for determining the basis of providing for bad debts. The Directors do not expect this to have a material impact 
on the financial statements.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective 1 January 2018)
An assessment of the impact of IFRS 15 has been completed following review of the contracts that exist across the Group’s revenue 
streams. The review has concluded that revenue recognition under IFRS 15 is expected to be consistent with current practice for the 
Group’s revenue and had IFRS 15 been applied in the current reporting period, it would not have had a material impact on the financial 
statements.
IFRS 16 Leases (effective 1 January 2019)
IFRS 16 is expected to have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. On adoption 
of IFRS 16 the Group will recognise within the balance sheet a right of use asset and lease liability for all applicable leases. Within the 
income statement, operating lease rentals payable will be replaced by depreciation and interest expense. This will result in an increase 
in operating profit and an increase in finance costs.  66

Notes to the Consolidated financial statements
continued
1 Basis of preparation and general information continued
The standard will also impact a number of statutory measures such as operating profit, and cash generated from operations, and 
alternative performance measures used by the Group. The full impact of IFRS 16 is currently under review, including understanding the 
practical application of the principles of the standard. A reasonable estimate of the financial effect of the standard is not available until 
this review is complete. IFRS 16 will become effective in the Group’s financial year 2019.
Going concern 
The Group’s activities are funded by a combination of long-term equity capital and bank facilities, primarily term loans, a revolving credit 
facility, invoice discounting and overdrafts. The day-to-day operations are funded by cash generated from trading and the use of invoice 
discounting and overdraft facilities. The board has reviewed the Group’s profit and cash flow projections, and applied sensitivities to the 
underlying assumptions. 
These projections demonstrate that the Group will meet its obligations as they fall due with the use of existing facilities. The revolving 
credit facility has a term until 2021, the UK term loan will be fully repaid during 2018 and the Group’s primary overdraft facilities are due 
for renewal in January and February 2019. Based on informal discussions the Board has had with its lenders, we have no reason to believe 
that these facilities will not continue to be available to the Group for the foreseeable future. The financial statements do not reflect the 
adjustments that would be necessary were the trading performance of the Group to deteriorate significantly or if the funding available from 
invoice discounting or overdrafts were to become unavailable. Thus the Group continues to prepare the financial statements on a going 
concern basis. 
Revised presentation of cash pooling arrangements
Following an agenda decision by the IFRS Interpretation Committee regarding offsetting and cash pooling arrangements, the Group 
has revised its disclosure of its cash pooling arrangements. This requires grossing up cash and overdraft balances associated with cash 
pooling arrangements. As a result we revised the comparative balance sheet and cash flow presentation at 31 December 2016. The impact 
is to increase cash and cash equivalents and short term borrowings by £2.3m at 31 December 2016 (2015: £Nil). There was no impact 
on net debts.
The impact of this change as at 31 December 2015 was £Nil and therefore a ‘Consolidated balance sheet’ for 2015 has not been 
presented.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies 
Basis of consolidation 
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and all of its subsidiaries including the Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) 
from the date on which the Group obtains control and cease to be consolidated from the date on which the Group ceases its control. 
Control is achieved when the Group:
 • has the power over the investee;
 • is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its involvement with the investee; and
 • has the ability to use its power to affects its returns.
Intra-group transactions and profits are eliminated fully on consolidation. Amounts reported in the financial statements of subsidiaries 
have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Non-
controlling interest consists of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling 
interest’s share of changes in equity since the date of the combination taking into accounting any restrictions on non-controlling interests. 
Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interest having a deficit 
balance. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective 
date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. 
Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying 
amount of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the 
subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration 
paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company.   67 Strategic report Governance Financials
Business combinations 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate 
of the fair value, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group 
in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Where applicable, the 
consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its 
acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as 
measurement period adjustments. The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains 
complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as at the acquisition date and is a maximum of one year. All other 
subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are recognised in the income statement. 
Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity is accounted for within equity. Consideration linked to post-
combination employee services are identified separately from the business combination. Payment for these services is accounted for 
as post-acquisition remuneration separately from the acquisition accounting.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (2008) are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for deferred tax assets and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit 
arrangements which are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively. 
Non-controlling interest
In applying the Group’s management equity philosophy, subsidiary management may be offered the opportunity to acquire shares in the 
subsidiary that they are responsible for, at market value. There are no services supplied by any employee in relation to this purchase of the 
shares in the subsidiary. After an agreed period, management may offer to sell the shares back to the Company. The Company does not 
have any obligation to acquire these shares.
If amounts are paid for non-controlling interests in a subsidiary that exceed the fair value of the equity acquired this excess amount 
is charged to the income statement. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired and is stated after separating 
out identifiable intangible assets. 
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets of the acquired 
subsidiary at the date of acquisition. If, after measurement, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain 
purchase gain. 
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested at least annually for impairment. Goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units. 
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is first allocated 
against goodwill and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro-rata basis. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed 
in a subsequent period. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable goodwill is included in the calculation of profit or loss on disposal. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS (1 January 2006) has been retained at the previous UK GAAP 
carrying amount. 
Intangible assets 
An intangible asset, which is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance, is recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that the expected future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and that its cost can be measured reliably. 
Intangible assets acquired separately – intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful life. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with any changes being 
accounted for on a prospective basis.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination – Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately 
from goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date (regarded as their cost). They are subsequently reported 
at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment on the same basis as intangible assets acquired separately.  68

continued
2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Amortisation of intangible assets 
Amortisation is charged to the income statement and calculated using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life as follows: 
Customer relations    up to fifteen years 
Trademarks    up to fifteen years 
Software     up to three years
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
The carrying amounts of the Group’s tangible and intangible assets are reviewed against their recoverable amount for any indication of 
impairment at each balance sheet date or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognised 
in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, such that it does not exceed the carrying amount that would have existed had no impairment loss been recognised. The reversal 
of the impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. 
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to write off the cost or valuation of the assets less their residual values over 
their useful lives as follows: 
Leasehold property    over the term of the lease up to a maximum of 10 years 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment  up to three years 
Motor vehicles    up to five years 
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with any changes 
accounted for on a prospective basis.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amounts. These are included in the income 
statement.
Borrowing costs
Interest costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Facility arrangement fees incurred in respect 
of borrowings are amortised over the term of the agreement.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash-in-hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments 
with original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are included within the balance sheet in current liabilities – short-term 
borrowings. 
Invoice financing
The Group’s operating activities in the UK are part funded by an invoice discounting facility. The debt provider has full recourse to the 
Group for any irrecoverable debt; these debts are presented within current borrowings and the asset due from the customer in current 
assets in the Group’s balance sheet.
Movements in the invoice discounting balance are treated as ‘Cash flow from financing activities’ in the Group’s Cash flow statement.
Interest charges on invoice discounting are included in finance costs and service charges are included in administrative costs in the 
Group’s income statement.
Financial assets 
Financial assets are assigned to the different categories on initial recognition, depending on the characteristics of the instrument and 
its purpose. A financial instrument’s category is relevant for the way it is measured and whether resulting income and expenses are 
recognised in profit or loss or charged directly against equity. 
 
Generally, the Group recognises all financial assets using transfer value basis. An assessment of whether a financial asset is impaired is 
made at least at each reporting date. For receivables, this is based on the latest credit information available, (i.e. recent third-party defaults 
and external credit ratings). Financial assets that are substantially past due are also considered for impairment. All income and expense 
relating to financial assets are recognised in the income statement line item Finance costs or Finance income, respectively.
   69 Strategic report Governance Financials
Financial assets are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet and, other than hedging instruments, can be divided into the following 
categories: 
 • financial assets at fair value through profit and loss (FVPL)
 • loans and receivables 
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss (FVPL)
Financial assets are classified as at FVPL when the financial assets is (i) contingent consideration that may be paid by an acquiree as 
part of the business combination; (ii) held for trading; or (iii) it is designated as at FVPL. 
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
The Group’s trade and other receivables are considered for impairment when they are past due at the balance sheet date or when 
objective evidence is received that a specific third party will default. Any change in their value is recognised in profit or loss.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements. 
Financial liabilities 
The Group’s financial liabilities include borrowings and trade and other payables (including finance lease liabilities). They are recognised 
initially at fair value, net of transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual agreements of the instrument. All interest-related 
charges and, if applicable, changes in the instrument’s fair value that are reported in the profit or loss are included in the income statement 
line items Finance costs or Finance income. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
12 months after the balance sheet date. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required 
to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured at the directors’ best 
estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect 
is material. 
Revenue and revenue recognition 
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of services provided in the ordinary course 
of the Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value added tax, trade discounts, rebates and other sales-related taxes. 
Permanent placement revenue is recognised at the point when the candidate commences employment. Contract placement revenue 
(including outsourced services) is recognised on the basis of actual work performed in the relevant period based on timesheets submitted. 
Training revenue is recognised at the point when the training is provided to clients.
An assessment of the impact of IFRS 15 has been completed following review of the contracts that exist across the Group’s revenue 
streams. The review has concluded that revenue recognition under IFRS 15 is expected to be consistent with current practice for the 
Group’s revenue and had IFRS 15 been applied in the current reporting period, it would not have had a material impact on the financial 
statements.
Net fee income
Net fee income represents revenue less the remuneration cost of temporary workers. For permanent placements net fees are equal to 
revenue. For Training and Offshore recruitment services net fee income represents revenue less costs of staff directly providing those services.  70

Employee benefits 
Retirement benefit costs 
Payments made to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged to the income statement as they fall due. 
Severance payment provision
As per local legislation in certain territories severance payment provisions have been provided. These are charged to the income statement. 
Share based payments 
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to senior management, which are measured at fair value (excluding the effect 
of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant and expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on 
the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. 
The fair value of the options granted is measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model and Black-Scholes model, taking into account 
the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. 
The Group provides finance to an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) to purchase company shares to partly meet the obligation to provide 
shares when employees exercise their options or awards. Costs of running the EBT are charged to the income statement. Shares held 
by the EBT are deducted from other reserves. A transfer is made between other reserves and retained earnings over the vesting periods 
of the related share options or awards. 
Leases 
Leases that result in the Group receiving substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are treated as finance leases. 
An asset held under a finance lease is recorded in the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the 
lease term. Future instalments net of finance charges are included within borrowings. Minimum lease payments are apportioned between 
the finance charge element, which is allocated to each period to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining liability and 
charged to the income statement and the principal element which reduces the outstanding liability. 
Rental costs arising from operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Where an incentive is received 
to enter into an operating lease, such incentive is treated as a liability and recognised as a reduction to the rental expense on a straight-line 
basis over the period of the lease. 
Forward contract for foreign currency
Forward currency contracts are stated at fair value, with any gain or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in profit or loss.
Taxes
Current tax
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior years are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the 
taxation authorities. The tax rates and the tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
 
Deferred tax
Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases 
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
 
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:
 • where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is 
not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
 • in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.  71 Strategic report Governance Financials
Deferred income tax assets are recognised on an undiscounted basis for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax 
credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary 
differences and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except:
 • where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or 
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor 
taxable profit or loss; and
 • in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are recognised only 
to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available 
against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised 
deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable 
that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement, except where they 
relate to items that are charged or credited directly to equity in which case the related deferred tax is also charged or credited directly 
to equity. 
Foreign currencies 
(i) Functional and presentational currency 
Items included in the individual financial statements of each Group company are measured using the individual currency of the primary 
economic environment in which that subsidiary operates (its ‘functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented 
in Pounds Sterling which is the Company’s functional and presentational currency.
(ii) Transactions and balances 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at period-end 
exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement. Exchange 
differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to 
occur (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation) are recognised initially in other comprehensive income. 
These exchange differences are reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal or partial disposal of the net investment. 
(iii) Group companies 
The results and financial position of Group companies (none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that have 
a functional currency different from the Company’s presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: 
 • assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet; 
 • income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable 
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated 
at the dates of the transactions); and 
 • all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity within the retranslation reserve. 
(iv) Hedges of net investments in foreign operations 
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of net investment hedge is recognised in equity in the foreign 
currency translation reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Gains and losses 
accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve are reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the foreign operation. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity 
and translated at closing rate.   72

3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
In applying the Group’s accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying 
values of assets and liabilities that are not clear from other sources. These estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are 
based on historical experience and other relevant factors. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s policies
The following are the critical judgements, that the directors have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and 
that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in financial statements:
Business combinations, contingent consideration , intangible assets (including goodwill)
In prior periods the directors have been required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions related to business combinations, 
including determining contingent consideration and the value of intangible assets. No such judgements or estimations were made in 
relation to the 2017 financial statements.
Key source of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting period that may have 
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities with the next financial year, are 
discussed below: 
Impairment of goodwill 
The Group is required to test whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. The recoverable amount is determined based on the  
value-in-use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the choice of a suitable discount rate in 
order to calculate the present value of these cash flows. Details of the impairment review calculation and sensitivities are set out in note 14. 
The same estimations are required if intangibles are tested for impairment. 
4 Segment analysis
Information reported to the Group’s Chief Executive, who is considered to be chief operating decision maker of the Group for the purpose 
of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance, is based on geographic region. The Group’s business is segmented into 
four regions, UK, Continental Europe, Asia Pacific and the Americas.
The Group has one principal activity, the provision of staffing and recruitment services. Each unit is managed separately with local 
management responsible for implementing local strategy.

Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares 
in issue during the period after deducting shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust, although the impact of this in 2017 was minimal since 
the shares were purchased in December 2017. The Trustees have waived their rights to dividends on the shares held by the Employee 
Benefit Trust.         
The dilution on the number of shares is from share options. Further details of these share options can be found in note 28 and the Directors 
remuneration report on pages 51 to 54.

Impairment (note 5) – (0.5)
Foreign exchange (0.1) 3.2 
At 31 December 35.9 36.0 
Goodwill arising on business combinations is reviewed and tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there is 
an indication that goodwill might be impaired. Goodwill has been tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each  
cash-generating unit (CGU) at lowest level of cash flow, including goodwill, with the recoverable amount of that income-generating unit. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are as follows:
Operating profit and pre-tax cash flows        
The operating profit and pre-tax cash flow is based on approved annual budget for the CGUs approved by the Group’s Management Board 
which are compiled using expectations of fee growth, consultant productivity and operating costs. The Group prepares cash flow 
forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by Management and extrapolates cash flows in perpetuity based 
on the long-term growth rates using margins that are consistent with the business plan approved by the Group’s Management Board.
 
Discount rates
The pre-tax, country specific rate used to discount the forecast cash flows ranges from 8% to 15% (2016: 10% to 20%) reflecting current 
local market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the relevant CGUs. These discount rates reflect estimated 
industry weighted average cost of capital in each market.
Pre-tax discount rates used for various cash generating units in operating segments are as follows:
UK:    9%          
Continental Europe:  8%          
Asia Pacific:   10% to 15%          
Americas:   10% to 13%         
          
Growth rates          
Growth rates used to extrapolate beyond the most recent forecasts and to determine terminal values are based upon the long term 
average GDP growth forecast, which are consistent with external sources, for the relevant country. Growth rates range from 1.8% to 7.9%. 
Any growth rate in excess of 6.0% was capped for the purpose of this calculation. GDP growth is a key driver of our business, and is 
therefore a key consideration in developing long-term forecasts.        
Growth rates used for various cash generating units in operating segments are as follows:      
UK:    1.5%          
Continental Europe:  1.4% to 1.6%         
Asia Pacific:   0.6% to 6.0% (capped)        
Americas:   3.0%          
            81 Strategic report Governance Financials
Impairment reviews were performed at the year-end by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the recoverable amount of the CGUs 
to which goodwill has been allocated.           
          
As part of the impairment review, management has considered the sensitivity of the recoverable amount for each unit to changes in the 
growth rates and discount rate. This sensitivity analysis showed that the long-term growth rate could reduce to nil without giving rise to 
any additional impairment of goodwill. The discount rates were also increased by adding an additional 3% to the country specific pre-tax 
discount rates. None of these changes in the key assumptions are expected to reasonably occur.     
          
As at 31 December 2017 the Group holds goodwill of £2.5m and intangible assets of £4.8m related to Pharmaceutical Strategies. This 
has been tested for impairment and there is no indication that there has been any impairment. Given the reduction in profit contribution 
since the business was acquired, the assumptions in the value in use calculation are based on a return to the pre-acquisition profit level 
within 3 years, following an improving trading performance through 2017 and management projections of growth, with industry growth 
rates thereafter. The market remains positive and the business is geared to deliver an increased trading level, in line with the pre-acquisition 
performance. We have set our targets and growth model to get back to this position. As part of the impairment review we have calculated 
separate sensitivity analysis based on a 5 year period to get back to pre-acquisition profit levels, an increase of 2% in the weighted 
average cost of capital and a lower long-term growth rate. In all cases no impairment is indicated. However, a change in these assumptions 
increases the risk of an impairment in future periods. As an indication of the possible range of outcomes, if the growth rate is reduced 
after 2018 to industry rates, there is an impairment risk of £1.3m, whilst an additional 1% increase in the weighted average cost of capital 
(on top of the 2% increase in the sensitivity) would lead to an impairment risk of £0.6m.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from that 
business combination.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £2.1m (2016: £2.4m) available for offset against future taxable profits. 
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £0.5m (2016: £0.6m) of such losses. No deferred tax asset has been recognised 
in respect of the remaining £1.6m (2016: £1.8m) as it is not considered probable that the losses will be fully utilised before they expire.  
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £5.5m (2016: £5.7m) relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas 
subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future. The tax impact of these temporary differences is £0.6m (2016: £0.9m) assuming all unremitted earnings 
were remitted in full in the year.   86

The principal financial assets of the Group are cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. The main purpose of these 
financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The principal financial liabilities are trade and other creditors that arise 
directly from operations, amounts owed to invoice discounters and bank loans. Further information on the Group’s treasury policy and 
activities during the year can be found in the Finance review on pages 26 to 29.
Credit risk analysis
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting 
date was: 
Classes of financial assets – carrying amounts
2017

2016
£m
Cash and cash equivalents 25.9 20.3
Trade and other receivables * 49.8 47.6
* Trade and other receivables exclude prepayments, tax and social security total amounting £3.3m (2016: £2.6m). 
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the third parties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating 
agencies. 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances 
for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, 
is evidence of a likely reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. The Group has no significant concentration of risk, with exposure 
spread over a large number of third parties and customers.  87 Strategic report Governance Financials

Total trade receivables (note 17) 43.2 41.1 
Average trade receivables days during the year was 41 days (2016: 47 days).
All of the Group’s trade receivables have been reviewed for indicators of impairment and a provision of £0.8m (2016: £1.0m) has been 
recorded accordingly. 
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £34.0m (2016: £30.1m) which are not past due 
and a carrying amount of £9.2m (2016: £11.0m) which are past due at the reporting date. For these balances the Group has not provided 
as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable. The Group does not hold any 
collateral over these balances.

Liquidity risk analysis 
The Group’s funding strategy is to ensure a mix of financing methods offering flexibility and cost effectiveness to match the requirements 
of the Group. The Group monitors its liquidity risk on an ongoing basis with regular cash flow forecasts. In order to ensure continuity 
of funding, the Group seeks to arrange funding ahead of business requirements and maintain sufficient undrawn committed borrowing 
facilities.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group’s liabilities have contractual maturities which are summarised below:

The above contractual maturities reflect the gross cash flows, which may differ to the carrying values of the liabilities at the balance 
sheet date.
All bank loans are on floating interest rates.
At the year end the Group had £19.3m (2016: £15.4m) of undrawn bank facilities (excluding invoice financing).
There was no loan repayment default during the year (2016: Nil). At the year end past due loans were nil (2016: Nil).
Market risk analysis
The Group is exposed to market risk through its use of financial instruments and specifically to currency risk, interest rate risk and certain 
other price risks.
Capital risk
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns whilst maximising the return 
to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which 
includes the borrowings and cash and cash equivalents disclosed in note 19 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, 
comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 21 and in the Consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The board reviews the capital structure of the Group on an ongoing basis, considering the cost of capital and the risks associated with 
each class of capital. The Board closely monitors the level of borrowings.

Foreign currency risk
The majority of the Group’s transactions are carried out in the local currency of the respective country the business is operating in. 
However, the Group does undertake transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently exposures to exchange rate fluctuation 
arise. The majority of exposures to currency exchange rates arising from overseas sales are mitigated by incurring purchases and cost 
of sales in the same currency.
To mitigate the Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk, non-local currency cash flows are monitored and if applicable, forward exchange 
contracts are entered into in accordance with the Group’s risk management policies. Generally, the Group’s risk management procedures 
distinguish short-term foreign currency cash flows (due within six months) from longer-term cash flows. Where the amounts to be paid and 
received in a specific currency are expected to largely offset one another, no further hedging activity is undertaken. 
As at 31 December 2017 there were a small number of forward currency contracts in place. The amount covered by these at year end was 
£0.9m (2016: 0.6m). The fair value of these as at 31 December 2017 were £Nil (2016: £0.1m).
The Group’s currency exposures are on the translation of subsidiaries results into Pounds Sterling, sales and purchase transactions in 
foreign currency and on foreign currency monetary items. There is an element of natural hedge by having operations in different countries. 
The amount of currency retranslation loss recognised in equity was £1.2m (2016: gain £5.1m).  90

Foreign currency monetary items and it’s sensitivity analysis 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s significant foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting 
date are set out below:
A 10% weakening of the following currencies against relevant functional currency at 31 December would have (decreased) / increased 
equity and the income statement by the amounts shown below. Calculations are performed based on net monetary items balances at 
31 December for the same currency. The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. Actual 
results in the future may differ materially from those projected, due to the development in the global financial market.

A 10% strengthening of the above currencies against relevant functional currency at 31 December would have had the equal but opposite 
effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
In Management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis does not completely represent the inherent foreign exchange risk as the year end 
exposure does not reflect the exposure during the year.
Interest rate risk
The Group manages its interest rate risk through a combination of cash pooling, shareholder funding and borrowing. Management 
monitors movements in interest rates to determine the most advantageous debt profile for the Group. At 31 December 2017, the Group 
is exposed to changes in market interest rates through its bank borrowings, which are subject to variable interest rates. For further 
information see note 19.

Balances and transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation

Remuneration of key management personnel
The Group delegates operational decision making and day to day running of the operating companies to the subsidiary management, 
however, key strategic decisions must be approved by the Parent Company. Therefore overall authority and responsibility for planning, 
directing and controlling the entities of the Group sits with the Parent Company Board of Directors, who are considered the key 
management personnel.
The remuneration of directors, who are the key Management personnel of the Group, is set out below in aggregate for each of the

All the options have a zero cost exercise price. In 2017 a credit of £160,000 (2016: £226,000 expense) was recognised in the income 
statement due to lower number of options expected to vest. The fair value was estimated using a Black-Scholes model for the EPS element 
and a Monte Carlo model for the total shareholder return element. Details of the performance conditions can be found in the Directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 51 to 54.
The inputs into these models are as follows:

Expected dividend yields 0.83% 1.03% 0.65%
Vesting dates March 2020 March 2019 March 2018
The expected volatility is determined from the daily log normal distributions of the Company share price over a period equal to the expected 
holding period calculated back from the date of grant. The risk free rate was the zero coupon bond yield derived from UK government 
bonds at the date of grant, with a life equal to the expected holding period.
Included in the total number of share options above are 1,897,000 share options already vested. As of the date of this report none of those 
options have been exercised. Further details can be found in the Directors’ remuneration report on page 54.  94
