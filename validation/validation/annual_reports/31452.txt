Chairman’s statement
Spirent thrives on the challenges of 
helping our customers to manage 
the complexity of their networks 
and services while they seek to 
dramatically reduce costs. 
I took on the role of Chairman after the 
AGM in May 2017. In my time on the Board 
I have been impressed by our industry 
leading technology and believe that we 
have a compelling value proposition for 
our customers. I have been even more 
impressed by the calibre and commitment 
of our people who are truly passionate 
about delivering value for our customers 
and shareholders. It is thanks to them 
that Spirent is so well respected in the 
industries it serves.
The Board believes that the opportunity to 
bridge across from the laboratory to live 
operations represents a major opportunity 
for Spirent. In order to realise our full 
potential we require a relentless focus 
on our go to market strategy, excellent 
customer service and our market leading 
products and solutions.
In the last few years, Spirent has seen a 
huge amount of change in its markets, with 
the polarisation of the smartphone industry, 
the consolidation of major network 
equipment manufacturers and the sudden 
growth by Asian equipment suppliers. At 
the same time, it was necessary to sustain 
high investment levels in order to realign 
the business for these market changes.

12 Special dividend  
per share
5.00c
In 2016, the Group’s strategy was amended 
to focus on a few key strategic growth 
areas – cyber security, network assurance 
and new wireless services. This strategy 
has driven success in our Networks & 
Security business and has moved Lifecycle 
Service Assurance into a growth market 
for active test in network operations.
Throughout 2017, we saw the benefits of 
this tighter focus coming more fully to the 
fore with Spirent winning new business 
with major accounts in these key areas, 
despite a background of tighter cost 
management across the Group.
Performance in 2017
This new strategic focus led to a material 
improvement in our financial performance 
in 2017. Adjusted operating profit¹ grew by 
27 per cent to $58.9 million, an adjusted 
operating margin² on revenue of 13.0 per 
cent (2016 10.2 per cent). Revenue was 
slightly down by $3.1 million to $454.8 
million as we transition to these new 
focus areas.
Dividend
Following strong earnings growth and cash 
flow generation the Board is recommending 
a final dividend of 2.40 cents, resulting in a 
total dividend for 2017 of 4.08 cents, a 5 per 
cent increase on 2016.
In addition, the Board is recommending a 
special dividend of 5.00 cents per share 
payable at the same time as the final 
dividend for 2017.

Board composition
The composition of the Board has changed 
significantly during 2017. Alex Walker, Tom 
Maxwell, Sue Swenson and Tom Lantzsch 
all stepped down in 2017 and I would like to 
thank them for their contributions. In early 
2018 we announced the appointment of 
Edgar Masri and Wendy Koh who will both 
bring deep technical knowledge in our 
served markets and extensive knowledge 
of dealing with our customer base. I am 
delighted they have agreed to join Spirent 
and I look forward to their contribution as 
the refreshed Board seek to help Spirent 
fully leverage its strengths.
Employees
I would like to thank our employees for 
helping to deliver increased profitability 
during the year and for their continued 
commitment to Spirent’s success. I am 
confident that with good execution against 
our priorities we will be able to realise 
Spirent’s potential for the benefit of all 
our stakeholders.
Outlook
The strong growth in our Application 
Security and Lifecycle Service Assurance 
businesses indicates that Spirent is headed 
in the right direction. The demand for 
high-speed Ethernet, particularly in 400G 
is expected to increase in the second half 
of 2018 and the market demand for security 
testing continues to be strong. I believe we 
have the strategy, technology, market 
opportunity and people to build on 2017’s 
successes in the years ahead.

Chief Executive Officer’s strategic review
Spirent has adapted to the changes 
in the test and measurement 
industry and is aligned with the new 
opportunities that have been created.
Overview – realising our potential
In 2017, we have established a firm basis 
to realise Spirent’s potential. 
We focused on our core expertise to 
enable our customers to develop high-
performance, high-security systems in a 
shorter time. We have taken our expertise 
in service assurance to deploy innovative 
new systems, winning new business with 
well-established and new customers. 
In doing so, we gained market share 
with the early adopters in the industry, 
which should serve Spirent well in 2018 
and the long-term.
An essential part of realising our potential 
has been to focus on our core strategies 
and take these into the growth opportunities 
offered by the global trend to move rapidly 
from development into operations. A natural 
consequence is a reduction in expenditure 
as we cease or scale back activities outside 
this focus area. This, in turn, has helped to 
increase profitability of Spirent’s operations 
and to increase cash generation.
Eric Hutchinson
Chief Executive Officer
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
14 Strategy – enabling the data revolution
Spirent enables its customers to deliver 
data connectivity which is faster, has 
greater capacity and has resilient security. 
This is essential to the development 
and deployment of new technologies 
worldwide: from smart industrial processes, 
smart home management, autonomous 
vehicles, smart enterprise business 
processes to smart city construction. 
Add in the digitisation of healthcare, 
and it is clear that ultra-reliable, fail safe 
connectivity at hyper-scale is necessary 
to deliver this vision. Spirent has an 
important role in enabling its customers to 
deliver these new smart technologies in 
an economic, secure and timely manner.
Spirent’s core expertise in data 
technologies – founded on high-speed 
Ethernet, Wi-Fi, cellular wireless, satellite 
constellations – combined with automated 
service assurance and analytics, offers a 
differentiated and powerful set of solutions 
to our customers. Vital to our customers’ 
success is our ability to deliver our 
expertise in test, measurement, validation, 
assurance and security in automated, 
scalable systems that are easy to use. This 
will enable our customers to realise their 
vision of supplying data connectivity with 
lower cost, higher reliability and security. 
The dominant market trends are 
underpinned by relentless traffic growth. 
The business imperative is to enable the 
industry to reduce operating cost and 
capital expenditure. Operators cannot afford 
to match traffic growth with higher and 
higher levels of investment in new data 
transport equipment. They also have to 
reduce their cost of operations by 
implementing new network architecture 
and operating practices. These imperatives 
drive the move to software defined 
networks, network virtualisation and 
automation. This is why Spirent’s strategic 
focus is to offer enabling technologies, 
systems and active service assurance so 
that our customers, existing and new, can 
meet the challenges in building out virtual 
networks. Within this broad landscape there 
are market disrupters: virtualisation, the 
Internet of Things (IoT), 5G wireless and 
cyber security.
Network virtualisation is the only way to 
support the exponential growth in data 
consumption. Virtualisation allows radical 
reduction in the capital cost of networks; 
it also allows rapid deployment for new 
services. Spirent provides active test 
systems to assure performance before 
deployment, and during operation to allow 
real-time response to changing conditions 
in the network. The existing hybrid 
networks, with their inherent complexity, 
will exist for decades to come. 
Connected things range from personal 
devices, such as a smart stylus, through 
large autonomous vehicles and 
industrial infrastructure.
With regard to hyper-connectivity, there are 
multifarious challenges for developer and 
network operators. Spirent offers solutions 
to avoid network bottlenecks, degradation 
in performance and security breaches.
The continuous evolution in wireless 
technologies is now moving to the 
development and deployment of 5G. 
5G will allow new applications to access 
extreme bandwidth and will offer ultra-low 
latency. This will support new applications 
such as virtual and augmented reality. 
New test and assurance capabilities will 
be required to support 5G both for 
networks and for devices.
Cyber security is at the forefront of 
concerns around any data application and 
network. High profile security incidents 
make headlines across all aspects of life, 
from individuals to business to government. 
The overall prevalence and sophistication 
of cyber threats continue to rise. There is a 
necessary increase in spending on cyber 
security to detect and protect against 
threats. Spirent offers highly reliable and 
up to date test and verification solutions 
to give greater assurance that protections 
are working.
Spirent’s strategic direction is to take our 
deep expertise in test and assurance in 
data networking to provide leading-edge 
solutions and services that enable the 
realisation of smart connectivity at an 
economic cost, achieved through 
automation and lower cost operation. 
We will consolidate on our leadership 
positions in high-speed Ethernet and in 
satellite navigation. We will deliver 
solutions to meet the challenges of 
virtualisation and cyber security. We will 
deploy systems in production networks for 
active test and management to lower the 
cost of operations. We will develop new 
solutions for the growth in 5G wireless 
technology and to meet the requirements 
for autonomous vehicles.

What do you envision the future 
to be for data technologies and 
Spirent’s role in this area?
The future will see the provision and 
delivery of products, services and 
environmental management by 
automated, robotic, intelligent systems. 
This is where smart technologies 
are leading the world. This digital 
revolution is underpinned by data 
technologies in the broadest sense. 
Spirent’s role will be to facilitate 
and enable the development of the 
digital technologies, infrastructure, 
operations and the security necessary 
for their implementation and operation.
What are the exciting areas to 
address in 2018 that give you 
confidence in the outlook for Spirent?
The near-term will be the provision 
of autonomous service assurance for 
operations. This is critical to realising 
the benefits of the innovations that 
allow network virtualisation. Without 
these, the world will not feel the 
economic benefits from the digital 
revolution. There will be significant 
investment in digital technologies; 
some of this will involve demand for 
our core technologies, some will 
demand new solutions, such as 5G 
wireless, all will offer an exciting role 
for Spirent.
2017 operating performance
Spirent’s adjusted operating profit¹ 
increased by 27 per cent through focus 
and judicious cost management. Group 
revenue was broadly flat, down by 
$3.1 million to $454.8 million due to the 
cyclical downturn in Ethernet and wireless 
technologies. Strong revenue growth was 
achieved in Lifecycle Service Assurance, 
up 10 per cent to $109.2 million. Networks 
& Security revenue decreased by 
$1.2 million to $261.0 million, reflecting the 
shift from 40G and 100G to 400G, which 
saw a delay in the investments by major 
customers during the year. Connected 
Devices revenue decreased as expected, 
by $11.9 million to $84.6 million. This was 
due to two factors: the continued decrease 
in device carrier acceptance testing with 
an new impact of $4.9 million, and our 
discontinuance of the Device Intelligence 
and Developer Tools product lines, a 
reduction of $7.0 million, with a further 
impact in comparative numbers for 2018 
of $5.9 million. Adjusting for the latter 
total underlying Group revenue was 
slightly up by $3.9 million.

Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Other Information Increased focus on matching our 
products and services to customer 
demands amid diverse global trends.
Innovation and changes in Ethernet/
IP, mobile networking and data 
center interfaces and protocols 
continue as throughput demands 
increase and response time 
requirements shorten. 
With every change in networking 
and data center interfaces and 
protocols, developers and 
operators require test tools 
to measure and validate their 
performance and security. 
We provide test systems for 
high-speed Ethernet and mobile 
networking. Spirent’s high-speed 
Ethernet test solutions (Spirent 
TestCenter) ensure 50G, 100G, 
200G and 400G networks perform 
to users’ expectations. 
We have products (Spirent 
Landslide) that emulate network 
functions and control and data plane 
traffic for millions of subscribers 
consuming internet protocol 
multimedia subsystem (IMS) 
and over-the-top services.
As cyber security threats grow globally, 
the requirement to verify the effectiveness 
and performance of security products 
becomes paramount. 
The security testing market is forecast to 
grow from $3.3 billion in 2016 to $7.6 billion 
in 2021, a compound annual growth rate 
(CAGR) of 18 per cent
1
.
Solutions are required to verify the 
effectiveness and performance of  
security products as they are 
developed and deployed. 
We provide a comprehensive security 
testing product (Spirent CyberFlood) 
and services (Spirent SecurityLabs). 
We stay current with emerging threats 
and provide test solutions quickly when 
new threats are discovered.
We are a founding member of the industry 
group NetSecOPEN, focused on defining 
new open standards for testing enterprise 
network security performance.
We earned global CREST (Council of 
Registered Ethical Security Testers) 
accreditation for penetration testing. 
UK-based CREST is an accreditation 
and certification body that supports 
the information security market.

Market trends As network operators develop, trial and implement 
virtualised network functions, developers and 
operators are faced with challenges to test and 
deploy their virtualised implementations.
The service provider network functions virtualisation 
market for purchase of hardware, software and 
services will grow from $10 billion in 2016 to almost 
$37 billion in 2021, a CAGR of 30 per cent³.
Solutions are required to benchmark virtualised 
network functions under various conditions in the 
lab and then, as they are deployed in the network, 
operators are challenged to understand their 
performance on an ongoing basis and to isolate and 
diagnose problems as network conditions change. 
We have test systems to benchmark virtualised 
network functions in the lab and to verify their 
performance in networks using our active 
service assurance and analytics solutions 
(Spirent VisionWorks). 
The development and deployment of mobile 
5G networks and applications is fuelling new 
investment in the telecom infrastructure and 
innovative applications, such as autonomous 
vehicles and augmented reality. 
The global 5G equipment market was estimated 
at $2.4 billion in 2015 and is forecast to reach 
$9.6 billion by 2020, a CAGR of 32 per cent⁴.
New test systems are required for the 
development and management of 5G devices, 
networks and applications.
We have products already available for 5G 
development. We have a new channel emulator 
for 5G base stations and fronthaul testing 
(Spirent Vertex). We have products that automate 
performance and security testing of Cloud RAN 
virtual environments (Spirent TestCenter and 
CyberFlood). We have performance test systems 
for 5G backhaul and testing and benchmarking 
virtualised network functions (Spirent TestCenter). 
We have products (Spirent Landslide) to emulate 
the 5G core network to test 5G New Radio and 
to test the evolution of the core network. We 
have products that will be ready to actively 
test and assure 5G production networks 
(Spirent VisionWorks).
The new relationships that will emerge 
between the United Kingdom, Europe and 
other major countries through the Brexit 
negotiations creates some uncertainty. 
We anticipate Brexit will not have an adverse 
impact on our business. During the current 
period of uncertainty, we have encountered 
some difficulties in recruiting people from 
other parts of Europe to our development 
site in the United Kingdom. 
We anticipate the Brexit agreements will 
provide a stable environment for attracting 
and recruiting talent from Europe.
We are working to ensure we can continue 
to supply our global navigation satellite 
test systems from the United Kingdom 
to European organisations without restrictions 
after Brexit.

Key performance indicators
The Board has identified the key 
performance indicators below to 
measure the Group’s strategic progress.
Relevance to strategy
The book to bill ratio is an 
indicator of whether future 
activity levels are rising or slowing, 
and therefore how effective we 
have been in the execution of 
our strategy.
Relevance to strategy
Revenue demonstrates the 
effectiveness of our strategy: our 
success in expanding our markets 
both organically and through 
acquisition; maintaining technology 
leadership; and our strong 
relationships with our customers, 
all of which ensure that we continue 
to win and maintain business.
Relevance to strategy
Adjusted operating profit indicates 
our financial strength and our 
ability to invest in the business 
for future growth.
Relevance to strategy
Adjusted operating margin is a 
measure of how successful we 
are in our overall strategy and 
demonstrates our ability to 
improve margin through efficient 
operations whilst being mindful of 
the need to invest for the future.
Performance
The reduction in book to bill 
ratio to 98, from 103 in 2016, 
reflects decline in orders in 
the Americas, and continued 
headwinds in the wireless 
device test market.
Performance
Flat revenue performance, 
following a 4 per cent decline in 
2016, reflecting strong Application 
Security and Positioning product 
line performance, offset by 
declines in core high-speed 
Ethernet performance test 
products in the Americas, 
and continuing headwinds in  
the wireless device test market.
Performance
Adjusted operating profit 
increased by 27 per cent to 
$58.9 million from $46.5 million 
in 2016 as a result of focused cost 
management across the business.
Performance
Adjusted operating margin 
increased to 13.0 per cent from 
10.2 per cent in 2016, driven in the 
main by a reduced cost structure.
Reason for measurement
The ratio of orders booked to 
revenue billed is a measure of the 
visibility of future revenues at 
current levels of activity and 
provides an indication of the 
underlying trend in Spirent’s 
future revenue stream.
Reason for measurement
Spirent monitors growth in 
revenue as this shows how 
successful Spirent has been 
in expanding its markets and 
growing its customer base.
Reason for measurement
Adjusted operating profit is the 
measure used to evaluate the 
overall performance of the 
Group as well as each of the 
operating segments.
Reason for measurement
Adjusted operating margin is a 
measure of the Group’s overall 
profitability. Spirent operates in 
markets which have high 
operating returns and strives to 
achieve best in class operating 
returns compared with its peers.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
24 Spirent’s strategy focuses on medium to long-term 
growth and therefore its achievement cannot just 
be measured by looking at performance in 2017 
compared to the prior year; trends over a number 
of years must also be considered. Key performance 
indicators relate to continuing operations
6
 only.
Notes
1. Ratio of orders booked to revenue in the period.
2. Before exceptional items, acquired intangible asset amortisation, goodwill 
and acquired intangible asset impairment and share-based payment.
3. Adjusted operating margin represents adjusted operating profit as a 
percentage of revenue in the period.
4. Adjusted basic earnings per share is based on adjusted earnings as set 
out in note 12 of Notes to the full year consolidated financial statements.
5. Operating cash flow after tax, net interest and net capital expenditure.
6. Continuing operations for 2017 includes divestments made in the year  
(see note 33 of Notes to the full year consolidated financial statements).
Relevance to strategy
Adjusted basic earnings per share 
is a measure of how successful we 
are in our strategy and ultimately 
how Spirent increases value 
for its shareholders.
Relevance to strategy
It is critical that Spirent’s product 
development investment keeps 
pace with the speed of change in 
technology, and that it is directed 
at the right key technology areas; 
it enables us to expand our 
markets and to maintain our 
technology leadership position.
Relevance to strategy
We cannot avoid the fact that 
some of our employees will move 
on but we can avoid a skills 
shortage by appropriately 
managing, recognising and 
rewarding our people. Voluntary 
employee turnover is a measure 
of how successful Spirent is in its 
strategy of retaining and investing 
in its people.
Relevance to strategy
Having strong free cash flow 
reflects Spirent’s ability to 
generate funds for future 
investment. It gives us financial 
strength and flexibility and the 
ability to pay sustainable 
dividends to our shareholders.
Performance
Spirent’s aim is to achieve growth 
in adjusted basic EPS. Part of the 
Executive Directors’ remuneration 
is dependent on achieving EPS 
targets. In 2017, adjusted basic 
EPS grew by 43 per cent as a 
result of the increase in 
adjusted earnings.
Performance
In 2017, product development 
spend reduced to 22.6 per cent of 
revenue from 24.4 per cent in 2016 
as a result of efficiency savings.
Performance
Staff turnover has returned to 2015 
levels and continues to remain 
below the industry average. 
For 2017, the global industry 
average was 13.3 per cent.
Performance
Free cash flow in 2017 benefited 
from the operating profit result 
and a strong working capital 
performance. Free cash flow 
conversion for 2017 was 122 per 
cent of adjusted earnings (2016 
80 per cent). 
Reason for measurement
Long-term growth in adjusted 
basic EPS is a fundamental driver 
to increasing shareholder value.
Reason for measurement
To maintain its competitive 
position, Spirent must invest at 
suitable levels to support future 
organic growth initiatives in line 
with the strategic objectives, 
whilst driving improved 
productivity and effectiveness.
Reason for measurement
Spirent’s success is dependent 
on its talented employees and 
retaining them is extremely 
important. Voluntary employee 
turnover compared to the industry 
average is the measure used  
to assess how well the Group  
has performed.
Reason for measurement
Free cash flow is a measure of 
the quality of Spirent’s earnings. 
The aim is to achieve a high 
conversion of earnings into cash.

Risk management
Like all businesses, Spirent is exposed to a 
number of risks and uncertainties. These 
risks may arise from internal factors, but 
some will be a result of external factors 
over which the Group has little or no direct 
control. It is the effective management 
of these risks that supports Spirent in 
delivering on its strategic objectives, 
safeguards the Group’s assets and, over 
time, will enhance shareholder value. 
The process to identify and manage the 
principal risks and uncertainties of the 
Group is an integral component of the 
internal control system.
The risk assessment process starts in the 
businesses, where up-to-date risk registers 
are maintained and updated as part of the 
normal operating and control procedures 
and is facilitated by the Head of Risk & 
Internal Audit. Each business identifies 
its key risks and mitigating factors and 
nominates a risk owner. The impact and the 
likelihood of occurrence of each risk is 
ranked, which assists the Group Executive 
Committee in assessing the likely impact 
in aggregate of each risk to the Group as 
a whole. The individual businesses are 
required to update their risk registers 
periodically to reflect new or emerging 
risks as they are identified.
It is not possible to identify every risk that 
could affect the business and the actions 
described below to mitigate those risks 
cannot provide absolute assurance that 
the risk will not occur or adversely affect 
the operating or financial performance of 
the Group.
The Board has classified the principal risks 
by the impact the risk would be expected 
to have on the Group should it occur, and 
the anticipated likelihood that that risk may 
occur using the following classifications:
Risk Impact
Impact High
Medium
Low
Likelihood of occurrence Likely
Possible
Unlikely
The Board takes the view that a High 
impact risk could lead to a ten per cent 
or more reduction in revenue, a Medium 
impact risk a five to ten per cent reduction 
in revenue and a Low impact risk a 
reduction of up to five per cent in revenue.
Strong risk management 
underpins everything we do.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
26 The Audit Committee reviews and monitors 
the Group’s risk processes and reports to 
the Board on their effectiveness. Risk is 
considered by the Audit Committee at least 
twice each year, at which time risk registers 
for both the Group and the material 
business units within the Group are 
reviewed. The Audit Committee challenges 
and debates the risks with reference to 
risk tolerance and appetite, as set by the 
Board. Progress made and any further 
actions to be taken regarding mitigation 
plans, as well as any changes to the 
risk profile, are discussed in detail.

Risk appetite and developing the Viability Statement
Provision C.2.2 of the 2016 UK Corporate Governance Code requires the Board to 
assess the viability of the Group over a suitable period. The Board has determined 
that a three-year period should be used when assessing viability, as explained on 
page 97 of this Annual Report.
The Board has sought to frame its risk appetite in terms of the markets and 
technologies in which it is prepared to make significant investments, and those in 
which it would expect its scale of investment to be more modest. Except where 
very attractive opportunities were to present themselves to achieve greater scale in 
well-known markets, the Board would expect to maintain a healthy net cash position.
Management, together with members of the Board, considered which of the principal 
risks, either alone or in combination, might threaten the Group’s viability. The expected 
aggregate impact of Macro-economic change, Technology change, Customer 
dependence and Competition were modelled based on historical trends experienced 
across the Group. A severe but plausible combination of those risks was considered 
for the purposes of deciding what turnover and free cash flow scenarios should be 
stress-tested. The impacts were modelled over the three-year period, with emphasis 
on a stressed scenario in years two and three, given management’s view that such risks 
were unlikely to materialise in year one, as the Group had just completed a detailed full 
year budget for 2018. Assumptions were made about the ability of the Group to take 
successful mitigating actions, including the ability to make significant reductions in its 
non-fixed operating costs. The Board took into account the Company’s healthy cash 
balance of $128.4 million at 31 December 2017 and the ability of the Company to 
continue to generate positive free cash flow even in stressed scenarios.
The Board reviewed and discussed with management:
• the process undertaken by management to decide which scenarios to stress test;
• the results of the stress testing performed, including an illustration on the 
reduction in turnover and availability of cash; and
• the ability of management to successfully take the mitigating actions identified.
The resulting Viability Statement is set out in the Directors’ report on page 97.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Risk Potential impact Mitigating actions
Macro-economic change
Spirent is a global business exposed to current 
world economic conditions and political 
uncertainties over which it has no control. 
The business is also exposed to government 
spending priorities, principally in the United States.
Deterioration in economic conditions and 
a change to the terms of conventional 
international trade may lead to a reduction 
in the level of demand for Spirent’s products 
and services and cause customers to delay 
their purchasing decisions.
The Group closely monitors both 
market and geographic trends in order 
to respond to changes in demand and 
be in a position to take timely actions 
to protect profitability where possible.
In addition, Spirent has a large number 
of geographically diverse customers, 
which may mitigate the impact of 
issues in any one area.
Technology change
Spirent sells complex solutions in industries 
that can be subject to rapid technological 
changes. Testing new technologies drives 
our business, but the opportunity also 
brings high risk since keeping at the forefront 
of these key future technologies is critical to 
our success and to ensuring that we remain 
competitive in our markets.
It is critical that our product development 
investment is directed at the right areas 
in order to deliver the solutions that our 
customers need, when they need them.
Spirent’s success is dependent in part 
on proprietary technology which may be 
infringed by others.
Protecting the Group’s proprietary 
technology is important to enable 
Spirent to compete successfully.
If product development investment does 
not keep pace with the speed of change in 
technologies, or if it is not directed at the 
right key areas, our competitive position 
and financial performance will suffer.
If Spirent’s solutions take longer to 
develop than anticipated or longer to 
develop than our competitors then our 
competitive position and financial 
performance will also suffer.
Changes in technologies may lead to 
a short-term pause by our customers 
investing in our solutions.
Intellectual property claims can result in 
significant defence costs, and may affect 
Spirent’s ability to market its products.
All Spirent’s businesses work very 
closely with customers and remain 
focused on their requirements.
Each business makes investment 
decisions specifically related to 
their solutions portfolio based 
on market needs.
Spirent continues to focus its 
investment into areas that offer 
the most potential for sustainable 
earnings growth. In 2017 the product 
development investment was 
$103.0 million (2016 $111.7 million).
Spirent has active intellectual property 
protection programmes in place to 
obtain appropriate protection in a 
cost-effective manner.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
28 Risk Potential impact Mitigating actions
Customer dependence / customer investment plans
The Group sells its products and services to 
a wide range of companies and continually 
seeks to expand its customer base. In 2017, 
no one customer accounted for more than 
ten per cent of Group revenue, although the 
top ten customers represented 41 per cent of 
Group revenue (2016 40 per cent).
In some of our markets certain customers have 
a dominant market share, which makes doing 
business with these customers and their 
suppliers critical to the success of our business.
In addition, many of the companies with which 
we do business are some of the largest global 
telecommunications corporations. Therefore 
meeting our development obligations, producing 
high quality products, and being on time are 
vital to Spirent’s reputation and success.
Changes in our major customers’ priorities 
in technology investments can also have a 
significant impact on their spending on 
Spirent products and on those in the 
customers’ supply chain.
The industry continues to experience 
consolidation which does disrupt the 
spending patterns of affected customers.
Loss of one or more of Spirent’s major 
customers could have a significant 
impact on Spirent’s financial results.
Spend on Spirent’s products is often capital 
in nature and so customer spend can 
fluctuate significantly from year-to-year.
Significant failings in either quality or being 
able to deliver in the appropriate timescale 
could cause long-lasting damage to 
Spirent’s reputation and relationships.
Over recent years there has been 
significant consolidation in our customer 
base amongst service providers and 
network equipment manufacturers. This 
trend continues and often results in delays 
in spending, thereby reducing demand for 
Spirent’s solutions and services. It also 
reduces the potential number of customers 
to whom those solutions and services 
could be sold.
Changes in our customers’ technology 
investments can result in reduced 
spending on our existing solutions 
before customers and those in the 
customer’s supply chain increase 
spending on new technologies.
Strong customer relationships are 
critical to Spirent. We aim to provide 
innovative solutions which meet 
customers’ needs and we place great 
emphasis on providing professional 
service and support.
One of the Group’s strategic 
objectives is to invest in deepening 
our customer relationships. We place 
engineers on-site with our customers, 
undertake site surveys of the use and 
intended plans for the use of test 
solutions in their business.
We seek to establish thought 
leadership in our industry through 
participation in standards bodies and 
industry forums, which in turn creates 
additional links with customers. Our 
approach is to play a key part in the 
wider supply chain to our key service 
provider customers by aligning with 
early adopters of technology.
Business continuity
Operational risks are present in the Group’s 
businesses, including the risk of failed internal 
and external processes and systems, human 
error and external events, such as a natural 
disaster or cyber security attacks. For example, 
a significant portion of our communications 
operations are located in California which has in 
the past experienced natural disasters, including 
earthquakes and wildfires.
Contract manufacturers are used for the 
manufacture of a substantial amount of 
Spirent’s products. Spirent’s major contract 
manufacturer is located in Thailand.
The incidence of cyber-crime continues to 
rise. Spirent is dependent on its information 
technology systems for both internal and 
external communications as well as for its 
day-to-day operations.
A significant natural disaster could 
disrupt the Group’s ability to conduct 
business and adversely impact 
revenue and operating results.
Failed internal and external processes, 
systems or human error could lead to 
compliance issues.
Disruption, financial problems of contract 
manufacturers or limitations in their 
manufacturing capacity could limit 
supply and/or increase cost.
If a cyber-attack were to be successful it 
could result in loss of data, confidential 
information and damage to Spirent’s 
intellectual property, causing major 
disruption to the business. There would 
also be a potential impact on Spirent’s 
credibility in the security market.
An important component of Spirent’s 
corporate governance is its risk 
management strategy. IT disaster 
recovery plans are in place for all 
core business systems and ensure 
that the wider operations are all fully 
covered. In 2017, we developed and 
implemented a new Group Business 
Continuity and Disaster Recovery 
Policy and Procedure.
Regular meetings are held with contract 
manufacturers and a regular on-site 
presence is maintained. In addition, 
the Group’s largest manufacturing 
subcontractor has multiple worldwide 
sites and comprehensive business 
continuity plans.
During 2017, we continued with a 
programme of work to develop 
processes and procedures in the 
area of cyber security.

Competition
Spirent operates in a range of highly competitive 
niche markets which experience rapid 
technological change. In order to compete 
effectively, it is necessary to establish and maintain 
technological differentiation in our solutions.
The Group faces competition from new 
market start-ups as well as more established 
and well-resourced companies.
Industry consolidation amongst our direct 
competitors may bring about a shift in 
competitive advantage.
Actions by competitors and increased 
competition can bring about pressure on 
Spirent’s gross margin. These factors 
could also affect Spirent’s competitive 
position, thereby reducing revenue and 
consequently affecting financial results.
In the last two years, significant 
consolidation has been announced in our 
sector. The consolidation of competitors 
may bring opportunities for Spirent but can 
also change the competitive landscape as 
competitors are able to leverage product 
capabilities or sales channels.
The Group’s broad solution portfolio, 
market-leading capabilities and 
customer focus continue to address 
this risk.
Spirent aims to maintain market-
leading positions through significant 
investment in the development of 
differentiated products.
Competitor activity is closely 
monitored with a view to maintaining 
clear differentiation based on 
Spirent’s products, services and 
global reach.
Acquisitions
A key element of Spirent’s strategy is to 
develop new capabilities and technologies, 
sometimes through acquisition.
Integration of acquisitions can be a complex 
process and the results expected from 
acquisitions may not be achieved due to 
problems encountered in integration, changes 
in market conditions, the rate of adoption of 
new technologies, or sometimes deficiencies 
arising in the due diligence processes.
Underperformance by acquisitions 
will impact the Group’s results and 
may lead to impairment of goodwill  
and/or intangible assets.
Rigorous strategic and financial 
evaluations of all acquisition 
opportunities are carried out. Detailed 
financial and commercial due diligence 
is performed. The Board will only 
authorise transactions after all due 
diligence has been successfully 
completed and where the financial 
hurdles are within the agreed guidelines.
Integration plans and processes are 
carefully considered prior to acquisition.
The Board reviews post-acquisition 
performance.

Employee skillbase
Spirent is its employees. Attracting and retaining 
highly qualified and skilled employees is 
essential to enable the Group to deliver on its 
strategy and to the success of the business.
Intense competition for personnel is faced 
from other companies and organisations 
and the loss of key employees, the failure 
to attract and retain other highly skilled 
employees, or the failure to adequately plan 
for succession may impair Spirent’s ability 
to run and expand the business effectively.
Investing in people is at the core of 
the Group’s strategy. The aim is to 
find, keep and engage the highest 
calibre of employees and encourage 
their contribution and development. 
An environment that fosters innovation 
and collaboration is critical to Spirent’s 
success, as is ensuring incentive plans 
are competitive.
Succession planning for senior posts 
in the Company is reviewed 
periodically by the Board.
Appropriate career paths and 
internal recognition programmes 
are developed for both technical 
and non-technical staff.
Regular reviews are performed 
to ensure that all elements of 
compensation across the Group 
are competitive with the market.

32 Ahead of the cloud
The rise of cloud computing and 
streaming high definition video services 
means that internet traffic is increasing by 
almost 25 per cent per year – a technical 
challenge if ever there was one. But 
along with China Telecom and Huawei, 
Spirent completed the world’s first 
400Gbps Ethernet (400G) test to verify 
short and long-range technologies using 
test cases based on real-world network 
applications. In other words, Spirent is 
keeping the internet running!
“As various international bodies are 
accelerating the standardisation 
process of 400G, the perfection and 
establishment of these standards will rely 
on early and sufficient testing to verify 
their performance” said Zhu Yongqing, 
director for IP technology research of 
the China Telecom Research Institute. 
“The collaborative test marks the first 
of its kind and is a landmark step for 
the adoption of standardised 400G 
medium and long-range technologies.”

What we test
We develop performance and security 
testing systems for networks and 
applications, simulating real-world high-
capacity conditions in the lab and on the 
network. Our portfolio covers high-speed 
Ethernet/IP for data centers and networks, 
cloud, virtualisation, applications, security, 
and global navigation satellite systems.
High-speed Ethernet/IP,  
cloud and virtualisation
Our high-speed Ethernet/IP test systems 
help our customers to validate high-speed 
network infrastructures, up to 400G, 
ensuring network functions and services 
can scale to millions of subscribers and to 
assess the security of devices, networks 
and applications. Our target customers are 
developers of devices, network equipment, 
applications and data centers, network 
operators, cloud and service providers, 
who want to measure the performance of 
new products and equipment for their 
network. In 2017, we experienced some 
softness as customers slowed test 
spending as they transitioned to new 400G 
technology platforms. We expect to see 
growth from these new speeds pick up in 
the second half of 2018.
Applications and security
We offer security test tools (Spirent 
CyberFlood) and security consulting 
services (Spirent SecurityLabs). Our 
application and security test products and 
services offer unprecedented realism, 
threat modelling and ease of use, 
Performance highlights

delayed expenditure as they transitioned 
to new technology platforms. 2017 revenue 
was $261.0 million, compared to 
$262.2 million in 2016.
Profitability
Operating profit before exceptional items 
for 2017 was $43.9 million, compared to 
$47.2 million in 2016, reflecting some 
softness in the year for our high-speed 
Ethernet testing products.

captured in the field, so that they 
can be simulated in the lab.
We grew our Application Security business 
revenue by more than 20 per cent as we 
penetrated new accounts.
• We expanded the security coverage of 
our flagship security product (Spirent 
CyberFlood), including ransomware, IoT, 
industrial controls and DDoS attacks. 
We provided near-zero-day testing 
for the latest application scenarios, 
attacks and malware. CyberFlood 
was the first platform to offer proactive 
testing for WannaCry ransomware, 
demonstrated at Black Hat. 
• We are a founding member of the 
industry group NetSecOPEN, focused on 
defining open standards for testing 
enterprise network security performance.

Transportation certification. 
Impact of market dynamics 
on Spirent business
Accelerate time to market
The primary value we deliver is to 
accelerate the time to market for 
developers and manufacturers to launch 
their new chipsets, modules, devices, 
equipment and applications and to connect 
to networks globally, while providing a 
comprehensive assessment of the 
performance and security of their products 
so they can protect and strengthen their 
brand and reputation.
Meet increasing network  
performance demands
The growth of cloud services, from 
bandwidth-hungry content and hosting 
services and applications to ‘always-
connected’ social media, drives innovation 
at an accelerating pace. Service providers 
worldwide are investing in their networks 
to keep up with these performance 
demands. We saw strong demand for 100G 
Ethernet testing by data center and 
network equipment suppliers as a 
consequence of their move to four 25G 
lanes from ten 10G lanes for 100G interface. 
In 2017, we saw the advent of 200G and 
400G development projects. As network 
equipment manufacturers develop new 
routers, switches and other network 
equipment for service providers, network 
equipment manufacturers and third-party 
test labs buy our test systems to measure 
and validate their performance.
Realise virtualised solutions
The internet protocol network industry 
is amid a revolutionary technology 
transformation driven by virtualisation 
enabling technologies, such as SDN and 
NFV. As developers and service providers 
develop their virtualised products, we 
provide test tools and services to measure 
and benchmark their performance in a 
range of operating environments and 
under different conditions.
Assess resilience against cyber 
security vulnerabilities and threats
We see strong demand for our security 
testing solutions across network equipment 
manufacturers, service providers and 
enterprise customers. Equipment providers 
with security capabilities, service 
providers, enterprises and government 
organisations contract our Spirent 
SecurityLabs service, in which we have 
security experts assess the product or 
service and provide a report on a one-time 
basis or periodically. Additionally, these 
organisations purchase our application 
and security products as they evaluate 
the functionality and performance of their 
products and networks themselves.

troubleshoot and resolve issues with production 
networks and services. We enable our customers 
to radically reduce time to characterise network 
performance and to identify and resolve user 
experience problems through automation, visibility and 
analytics. We will continue to develop new solutions 
that capitalise on the benefits that virtualisation 
enables. This improves customer satisfaction and 
retention while reducing the cost and complexity of 
operating and managing the network. 
Our strategy is to provide the leading active test 
assurance platform for hybrid networks by integrating 
physical and virtual test functions. Spirent’s patented 
active test technology provides unprecedented 
visibility of the customer’s true service experience 
for complex IP services that flow across providers, 
domains and hybrid networks. Our active test solutions 
provide superior ability to isolate and resolve issues 
in virtualised network environments where traditional 
passive approaches are less effective. By bringing 
these capabilities together in the Spirent 
VisionWorks
TM
 platform, we expect to win business 
at multiple Tier 1 carriers, expanding their mobile 
networks and deploying SDN, NFV and next-
generation services.

36 Eyes over London
“What’s that building, mum?” must be one of 
the most asked, and occasionally dreaded, 
questions posed on the London Eye. Not 
anymore, thanks to Spirent’s Landslide test 
platform. When the Coca-Cola London Eye 
planned to launch London Eye Guide, their 
augmented reality app of the London skyline, 
they wanted to be sure that the Telefónica 
O2 Wi-Fi service would be up to the job. 
Landslide units were placed in eight cabins 
to test customer reception and reliability 
and also to emulate the kind of user load 
anticipated with an enthusiastic complement 
of passengers. Landslide verified the service 
was good to go live with the Eye stationary 
and in rotation, all without putting the client’s 
brand reputation at the kind of risk real-life 
customer testing can entail.
“Digital communications have become a 
vital service, and customers want seamless 
connectivity no matter where they are,” 
said Robert Franks, Digital Director at O2. 
“Spirent’s test platform allows us to test the 
overall network experience so that we can 
be certain the end user experience is the 
best it can be.”

Service assurance systems 
Our service assurance systems help 
service providers turn-up new services 
and diagnose and troubleshoot issues 
within mobile backhaul, business services 
and global networks to support Ethernet 
service delivery.
Customer experience management
Our customer experience management 
solutions help service providers to identify 
critical network issues affecting customers. 
They reduce churn by aggregating and 
analysing data from multiple sources to 
provide real-time insights into the 
customers’ experience.
Mobile lab test systems
Our mobility lab test systems emulate 
subscribes and adjacent nodes to enable 
active testing of mobile network equipment 
and networks, including mobile core, 
wireless LAN, internet protocol multimedia 
subsystems and Diameter networks, in the 
lab and in the network. Network equipment 
manufacturers buy our test systems to 
develop and test their products. Service 
providers buy our test systems to qualify 
and validate network equipment in their 
vendor selection and acceptance testing 
and to actively test the functionality and 
performance of their network and services.
Test automation
Our industry leading Lab-as-a-Service and

Speed up, costs down!
The sheer scale of mobile phone use, requires infrastructure that 
few users ever contemplate. The load on that infrastructure is set to 
massively increase with the arrival of 5G services. With that in mind, 
Nokia deployed a first-of-a-kind 5G Lab-as-a-Service (LaaS) at their 
network infrastructure testing labs in Oulu, Finland and chose the 
aptly named Spirent Velocity as their LaaS platform. Spirent Velocity 
enables unprecedented automation of 5G testing to significantly 
accelerate Nokia’s releases of virtual network functions and 
physical infrastructure. The 5G LaaS also streamlines the use of 
shared lab resources across teams and geographies. The system 
is accessible by hundreds of simultaneous users across the globe, 
offering engineers unprecedented flexibility. Nokia envisage 
Spirent Velocity will speed up their 5G lifecycle tests while bringing 
down the costs. 
Needless to say, Nokia were impressed and have further plans. 
“Our goals for the 5G LaaS include automation of 5G lifecycle 
testing and more efficient sharing of physical and virtual test 
resources across teams,” said Rauno Jokelainen, Vice President 
of Radio and Advanced Antennas, Nokia.

automated testing for virtual core 
networks. The demonstration is part  
of a joint programme to develop a 
methodology for automated testing of 
the functionality and performance of 
China Mobile’s Telecom Infrastructure 
Cloud. The test methodology will be 
incorporated into an automated testing 
system developed by China Mobile 
Research Institute. The system will 
fully automate testing of services in 
operational virtual core networks and 
will be part of the complete virtual 
evolved packet core (vEPC) environment 
built by the Institute. Spirent provided 
the virtualised mobile core network 
emulation and performance testing 
tool, called Landslide Virtual, and the 
automated testing platform, called iTest. 
These test engines automate various 
types of performance and functionality 
tests used to develop, spin-up and 
monitor the vEPC. DevOps models 
have been developed for the test 
methodologies, allowing tests to 
be completely automated and 
incorporated into the operation 
of the virtualised network.
Impact of market dynamics  
on Spirent business
We compete in the service assurance 
market, estimated size of about $3.0 billion 
in 2017 and forecast to grow at a compound 
annual rate of 1.7 per cent from 2016 to 2021¹. 
Our current business depends on service 
providers’ investment in Ethernet/IP 
services, virtualisation, in-home data 
services, carrier Wi-Fi and mobile 
technologies, such as long-term evolution 
(LTE), voice over long-term evolution 
(VoLTE), and IP multimedia subsystem 
(IMS). The current market dynamics and 
outlook are favourable for our business. 
The investment in mobile networks and 
their operation and management remains 
a priority for network operators. As 4G LTE 
rolls out globally, there is wider commercial 
deployment of VoLTE, more 3G and LTE 
connected vehicles and an increase in IoT 
applications. GSA reported there are 814 
Revenue
Lifecycle Service Assurance revenue in 
2017 was $109.2 million, an increase of 
$10.0 million on 2016. The growth in 
revenue reflects multiple key strategic 
contract wins with expansion of our 
footprint in our largest Tier 1 mobile 
operator customers and new deployments 
at different Tier 1 mobile operators.
Profitability
Operating profit before exceptional items 
improved significantly, from $11.2 million 
in 2016 to $17.9 million, as a result of the 
increase in revenue.
Accomplishments
We enable network operators to rapidly 
on-board and proactively assure critical 
virtual, mobile and IoT services. In 2017, the 
Spirent VisionWorks
TM
 solutions have been 
deployed by four Tier 1 North American 
mobile network operators to address 
critical challenges stemming from the roll 
out of virtual and business mobile services. 
We participated in several high-profile 
demonstrations:
• At the TM Forum Live in Nice in May 
2017, Spirent collaborated with industry 
leaders to demonstrate rapid service 
innovation in virtual networks. In the 
Catalyst Project sponsored by AT&T, 
Orange and TIM, and working with 
Huawei, IBM, Infosys and Tech 
Mahindra, Spirent developed and 
demonstrated the automated validation 
of service enhancements in virtual 
networks using Spirent VisionWorks. 
The project demonstrates how network 
functions virtualisation (NFV) and open 
interfaces enable radically faster service 
innovation with fewer resources. The 
project addresses the core need for 
rapid service innovation, streamlining 
and automating the process by which 
virtual network functions (VNFs) 
are enhanced, validated and then 
deployed to the production network.
• At Mobile World Congress in Shanghai 
in June 2017, Spirent and China Mobile 
Research Institute demonstrated 
operators investing in LTE; 644 operators 
have commercially launched LTE or 
LTE-Advanced networks. There are 
125 commercial VoLTE networks, and 
205 operators investing in VoLTE². 
Network operators are reducing operating 
expenses. We reduce operating costs 
by accelerating service turn-up, 
reducing the time to diagnose problems 
and helping our customers understand 
and improve their network performance 
and customer experience.
Continued growth in the complexity of 
networks and services, coupled with intense 
competition between service providers 
and the fear of customer churn, has led to 
greater emphasis on customer experience 
management. Many operators are evolving 
from network-centric to customer-centric 
operations and need to support new 
technologies, such as VoLTE, voice over 
Wi-Fi (VoWi-Fi), 5G, IoT and virtualisation. 
Service providers remain cautious as they 
continue their shift from legacy networks 
to virtualisation and as they determine how 
best to realise the potential benefits. To 
manage NFV in a complex hybrid network 
and to manage new services, network 
operators require active performance 
test systems for service turn-up and 
troubleshooting. Active test systems can 
be combined with analytics to measure 
network performance and customer 
experience periodically and to quickly 
isolate and diagnose detected or reported 
network performance and customer 
experience problems.

40 Loud and clear
It’s all too easy to take smartphone call quality 
for granted, but extensive testing has been 
conducted to achieve the high-standard  
calls we enjoy today. To ensure that their 
smartphones deliver the best possible 
voice quality, China Telecom uses VoLTE 
(Voice over LTE) on their network and Spirent’s 
Umetrix® Voice solution to measure the 
performance of every new smartphone 
against stringent quality requirements. 
China Telecom tests how well each 
smartphone carries voice and how 
successful they are at establishing and 
maintaining calls. These tests are performed 
while simulating realistic network conditions, 
such as when handsets are moving between 
cells, when they are in low signal areas, 
when networks are congested, and while 
the handset is simultaneously sending and 
receiving data.

Impact of market dynamics  
on Spirent business
Economic pressure and consolidation 
in smartphone supply chain
Economic pressure and consolidation of 
top-tier global smartphone, chipset and 
network equipment vendors has led to 
a fiercely challenging, competitive and 
shrinking market. We anticipate the 
wireless device test market will transition 
as wireless component, module 
and network equipment manufacturers’ 
spending changes in the market shift 
between ongoing 4G enhancements 
and the early days of 5G. Spirent 
continues to manage this transition.
4G LTE services growth 
Spirent benefits from the development 
phase of 4G LTE services, such as 
VoLTE and Wi-Fi, and the focus on user 
experience. GSA reported in December 
2017 that there are 9,544 LTE user devices 
from 570 suppliers in existence; this is 
almost 60 per cent more than the number 
of devices in September 2016¹. 
Service experience
Our Umetrix platform accelerates user 
experience evaluation for new devices and 
services (VoLTE, VoWi-Fi, etc.). Umetrix 
assess the launch readiness of services 
and providers, device acceptance and 
pre-testing. Fit4Launch is our service to 
make these tests. We have evaluated over 
1,300 devices; over 450 of these devices 
required some changes due to serious user 
experience issues detected during the 
Fit4Launch tests.
Revenue
Connected Devices revenue decreased 
by $11.9 million to $84.6 million in 2017. 
The previously flagged decrease was due to 
the ongoing decline in the wireless device 
test market and the divestment of DI and DT, 
which accounted for $4.9 million and 
$7.0 million of the decrease, respectively.
Profitability
The profitability of Connected Devices 
turned from a loss before exceptional 
items of $4.4 million in 2016 to a profit of 
$5.2 million. This was achieved despite 
the revenue decline. $3.5 million of the 
improvement was due to the exit from DI 
and DT, with the remainder due to cost 
saving actions and expense control. 
Accomplishments
• We won key deals with our new 
channel emulator (Spirent Vertex).
• We released our Spirent Elevate IoT 
Device Test solution, a new cellular test 
solution designed to support Internet 
of Things applications, including 
end-to-end cloud server connectivity, 
security vulnerability assessment and 
battery life measurement. The compact 
and flexible device test solution 
addresses critical areas that are 
affected when designing 3G, LTE 
and upcoming narrowband wireless 
technologies into IoT devices.
• We demonstrated EVS with China 
Mobile at the GSMA Mobile World 
Congress in Shanghai. The EVS codec 
is increasingly being deployed on 
mobile devices as global operators 
recognise the improvements possible 
in speech quality for their customers 
and efficiencies gained in managing 
network resources. 
5G development
The standardisation work for 5G has been 
accelerated. The standard as specified in 
3GPP Release 15 was finalised in 2017 for 
non-standalone 5G new radio (NR) and will 
be set by mid-2018 for standalone 5G NR. 
Early 5G deployments are anticipated in 
several markets, including the United States, 
South Korea, Japan and China. The first 
commercial networks based on standalone 
5G NR are expected to go live in 2019, with 
major network deployments from 2020. 
By the end of 2023, over one billion 
5G subscriptions for enhanced mobile 
broadband are forecasted². Spirent is 
starting to see opportunities for 5G NR.
Growing opportunities and challenges 
in the Internet of Things
The importance of wireless IoT connectivity 
continues to rise in a variety of segments 
from connected vehicles, homes and 
industry to smart cities. This results in 
challenges in developing, connecting and 
operating IoT devices and applications on 
mobile and non-cellular networks, resulting 
in an attractive new market opportunity for 
Spirent. The number of IoT connected 
devices worldwide was 11.1 billion in 2015 
and is forecasted to reach 32.5 billion by 
2020, increasing at a CAGR of 39 per cent³.

Financial review
2017 saw effective cost control,  
very strong cash management and 
improved profitability. We are transitioning 
to provide services that fundamentally 
reduce our customers’ cost base. 
Group overview
Strong earnings growth and improved 
cash generation were delivered following 
the implementation of our improvement 
programmes, which included a portfolio 
review of our business and targeted cost 
and working capital management initiatives.
The Group delivered a strong increase in 
both adjusted basic earnings per share, 
up by 43 per cent and free cash flow, up 
by 118 per cent. Adjusted operating profit 
increased by $12.4 million or 27 per cent, 
on slightly reduced revenue. The highlights 
were a robust performance from Lifecycle 
Service Assurance, with 10 per cent 
revenue growth and adjusted operating 
margin increased to 16.4 per cent, and the 
profitability turnaround of Connected 
Devices, which delivered an improvement 
in adjusted operating profit of $9.6 million 
on lower revenue. Within Networks & 
Security, there were strong performances 
from our Positioning and Application 
Security lines of business but this was 
tempered by some softness for high-speed 
Ethernet testing, as we have previously 
noted, which is expected to rebound in the 
second half of 2018. 
The adjusted operating cost base of the 
Group reduced by $16.7 million, excluding 
foreign exchange and despite inflation, as 
the cost saving actions from the portfolio 
review programme and restructuring of the 
sales organisation which commenced in late 
2016, began to deliver benefits. These 
change programmes concluded at the end of 
2017, with $6.7 million of in year exceptional 
costs with a very fast cash pay back. 
Adjusted basic earnings per share increased 
by 43 per cent to 7.55 cents reflecting the 
growth in adjusted operating profit and 
reduced tax charge in 2017. 
Cash at bank closed at $128.4 million, an 
increase of $32.3 million on the position at 
31 December 2016. Free cash flow more

than doubled as a result of  
increased profit, and a reduced  
level of working capital. Free cash  
flow represented 122 per cent of  
adjusted earnings³. 
Following US tax reform, we expect  
the Group’s effective tax rate to  
decrease from 22 per cent in 2017  
to an estimated 17 per cent from 2018 
onwards. Further clarification of some  
of the new legislation is awaited  
which may impact this estimate.
As a result of improved financial 
performance and a review of our capital 
allocation policy, we propose a 5 per cent 
increase to the full year dividend per share, 
from 3.89 cents to 4.08 cents, and a further 
special dividend of 5.00 cents per share.

Note

Overall, Group revenue was broadly level 
compared to last year and up 2.4 per cent 
excluding Connected Devices which 
continues to be managed carefully 
during the decline of the wireless device 
testing market.
On 30 June 2017, we divested both the 
Device Intelligence (DI) and Developer 
Tools (DT) lines of business from Connected 
Devices which together generated revenue 
of $12.9 million in 2016 and $5.9 million for 
the first six months of 2017.
Continuing Group revenue, excluding the 
DI and DT businesses divested at the 
end of the first half of 2017, increased by 
$3.9 million or 1 per cent. Lifecycle Service 
Assurance had a particularly robust 
finish to the year increasing revenue by 
10 per cent, $10.0 million ahead of last year, 
Networks & Security was essentially 
level after a strong 2016 and Connected 
Devices experienced a decline of 
$11.9 million ($4.9 million excluding DI 
and DT), in line with our expectations.
Within Networks & Security, our Positioning 
and Application Security test lines of business 
saw strong demand and good growth but this 
was offset by lower demand for high-speed 
Ethernet performance test solutions as some 
customers delayed expenditure as they 
transitioned to new technology platforms, and 
also 2016 represented a strong comparator 
year. All of our lines of business within 
Lifecycle Service Assurance experienced 
growth on last year; particular highlights 
were Mobility Infrastructure and Customer 
Experience Management. Connected Devices 
included our DI and DT lines of business, 
which were divested on 30 June 2017. 
Excluding these businesses, the operating 
segment’s revenue decline slowed to 6 per 
cent in 2017, from 25 per cent in 2016.
Geographically, the trends we have 
experienced in recent years continued 
into 2017 with growth in Asia Pacific and 
decline in EMEA. Americas remained 
our largest regional market constituting 
55 per cent of total Group revenue but 
was down marginally in absolute terms 
on last year impacted by Cloud and IP, 
Connected Devices and the divestment  
of DI and DT. Asia Pacific again increased 
its share of Group revenue, to 35 per cent 
from 33 per cent, an increase of $10.9 
million. China drove much of the growth in 
the Asia Pacific region, contributing $7.3 
million of the increase, being 9 per cent 
growth. The decline in EMEA reflected 
continuing softness in service provider 
and network equipment manufacturer 
investment in the region, as well as the 
divestment of DI and DT; excluding 
these businesses the decrease was 
$5.4 million or 11 per cent.

$15.2 million in total (2016 $87.6 million).
As in 2016, 2017 was another year of 
material cost reductions. Despite inflation 
and excluding foreign exchange charges, 
total Group adjusted operating costs 
reduced by $16.7 million or 6 per cent 
compared to 2016, as a result of the cost 
reduction actions implemented under the 
portfolio review programme and sales 
reorganisation, and to a lesser extent, 
the divestment of DI and DT at 30 June 
2017. This follows a similar level of 
cost reduction in 2016 and reflects 
management’s continuing focus on 
effective resource allocation and cost 
control. Investment is being focused on 
high-growth, high-margin areas and this is 
apparent from the segmental analysis of 
operating costs, with the reduction in costs 
targeted in Connected Devices and the 
level of investment maintained and 
increased in Lifecycle Service Assurance 
and Networks & Security, respectively. 
Compared to 2016, the year-on-year 
movement in foreign exchange charged 
in the income statement, was a negative 
impact of $5.0 million. The net change 
in total operating costs before adjusting 
items was therefore $11.7 million. 
The total Group investment in product 
development was reduced by $8.7 million, 
despite cost inflation, which reflects our 
focused approach to concentrate 
resources on specific higher growth 
potential areas. 
Selling and marketing costs decreased by 
$8.6 million, being the full year effect of the 
cost reduction actions commenced at the 
end of 2016 following the review of the 
sales organisation and remuneration 
structures undertaken by external 
consultants. This programme has continued 
through 2017 with further actions and 
exceptional implementation costs. 
Administration costs in 2016 benefitted 
from $3.4 million of foreign exchange 
gains, related to exchange rate volatility 
between the US dollar and pound sterling, 
whereas 2017 includes a foreign exchange 
loss of $1.6 million. Therefore, the majority 
of the movement in administration costs 
year-on-year, is due to foreign exchange. 
The current year level of administration 
costs is considered more typical.
Looking forward into 2018, we will focus 
on driving improved productivity in 
product development.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
46 Adjusted operating profit increased by 
27 per cent to $58.9 million, compared 
with $46.5 million in 2016, and adjusted 
operating margin increased to 13.0 per cent 
from 10.2 per cent in 2016. 
Notwithstanding the ongoing reduction 
in the operating cost base, we have 
continued to invest in key growth areas 
identified from the portfolio review. 
Exceptional items
During the second half of 2016, the Group 
commenced a portfolio review with the 
objective of focusing Spirent’s lines of 
business on those test technologies and 
services which will best drive sustainable 
earnings growth. In addition, external 
consultants were engaged to benchmark 
the sales organisation and a programme 
was implemented to increase our 
effectiveness and efficiency in this area. 
These initiatives resulted in cost reduction 
actions which commenced at the end of 
2016 and continued throughout 2017, 
concluding at the end of the year. In

2. Before exceptional items, acquired intangible asset amortisation, goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment and share-based payment amounting to 
$15.2 million in total (2016 $87.6 million).
addition, in 2017, the Group undertook a 
strategic review of the Connected Devices 
operating segment. In total, $6.7 million of 
exceptional costs were incurred in the year, 
including $5.4 million of portfolio review 
and sales organisation restructuring costs 
(2016 $4.8 million) and $1.3 million of costs 
related to the strategic review of 
Connected Devices.
Acquired intangible asset amortisation, 
impairment and share-based payment
In 2016, the Group took a total impairment 
charge of $69.1 million in relation to goodwill 
and acquired intangible assets within the DI 
and DT lines of business and the Connected 
Devices cash generating unit. As a result, 
acquired intangible asset amortisation has 
decreased significantly in 2017, from 
$12.9 million in 2016 to $6.3 million.
Share-based payment has increased to 
$2.2 million in 2017 (2016 $0.8 million) 
reflecting the expected vesting of awards 
and the cost associated with the 2017 grant. 
Divestments
A consequence of the portfolio review 
was the decision to not invest further in 
the DI and DT lines of business within 
Connected Devices and this necessitated 
the impairment in full of the goodwill and 
acquired intangible assets in these 
businesses in 2016. At 30 June 2017, these 
businesses were divested to an Israeli 
company established by the former 
General Manager of the business units, 
for a total cash consideration of $1. As part 
of the sale, Spirent made a $2.0 million 
interest bearing loan to the divested 
subsidiaries to fund working capital 
requirements. This loan has been fully 
provided for by the Group and expensed in 
the calculation of the gain on divestments 
which amounted to $2.6 million. The 
businesses combined contributed 
$12.9 million revenue in 2016 and 
$5.9 million for the first six months of 2017.

Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Other Information Strategic Report
Financial review continued
Currency impact
The Group’s revenue and costs are 
primarily denominated in US dollars or 
US dollar-linked currencies. Currency 
exposures arise from trading transactions 
undertaken by the Group in foreign 
currencies and on the retranslation 
of the operating results and net assets 
of overseas subsidiaries.
The Group’s income statement includes 
a foreign exchange loss, included in 
administration costs, of $1.6 million 
(2016 $3.4 million gain) arising from:
1)  transacting in foreign currencies, primarily 
US dollars in the United Kingdom, of 
$0.9 million (2016 $2.3 million gain); and
2)  translation of foreign currency 
cash balances of $0.7 million 
(2016 $1.1 million gain).
Forward foreign currency exchange 
contracts are entered into to manage the 
exposure arising from transacting in US 
dollars in the United Kingdom.
Although the most significant currency 
exposure arises in relation to movements in 
pound sterling against the US dollar, there 
are other less significant currency exposures, 
notably the Euro and Chinese Yuan. 
Finance income and costs
Finance income of $0.6 million was earned 
from cash held on deposit (2016 $0.3 
million). Surplus funds are held principally in 
the United Kingdom and United States on 
short-term deposit and earn market rates of 
interest which remain relatively low. Finance 
costs of $0.3 million (2016 $0.7 million) 
comprised mainly of the interest cost on  
the defined benefit pension plan.
Share of result of associated company
Spirent’s share of the loss incurred by its 
associate, Jolata, Inc. (Jolata), was nil in 
2017 following the impairment of the full 
value of Spirent’s investment in Jolata 
taken at 31 December 2016 (2016 
$4.5 million loss, including an impairment 
charge of $2.6 million). 
Tax
The adjusted effective tax rate for 2017 was 
22.1 per cent, down from 26.9 per cent in 
2016, primarily reflecting benefits achieved 
from the successful introduction of UK 
Patent Box and a positive impact from 
the divestment of the DI and DT lines of 
business, which had unrelieved losses.
On 22 December 2017, the US President 
signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) 
into law. The Act includes a number of 
significant changes in the tax law that will 
have implications for Spirent. The most 
significant change is a permanent reduction 
in the corporate income tax rate from 35 per 
cent to 21 per cent with effect from 1 January 
2018. Other changes that will impact the 
Group include the repeal of the Domestic 
Production Activity Deduction (DPAD) and 
the enactment of a new deduction, the 
Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII) 
deduction. It is estimated that the impact of 
the US tax rate reduction together with the 
repeal of the DPAD and the addition of the 
FDII deduction will decrease the Group’s 
2018 effective tax rate to circa 17 per cent 
and deliver increased earnings and cash 
benefits. The precise impact is still to be 
determined as we are awaiting further 
guidance from the US government. 
While the changes highlighted above 
impact Spirent from 1 January 2018 going 
forward, there is an adverse impact to the 
Group’s US deferred tax assets (DTA). 
These assets have been previously 
booked with the expectation of a future US 
tax benefit at the pre-2018 35 per cent 
statutory tax rate. Our 2017 financial 
statements reflect a revaluation of these 
DTA using the new 21 per cent statutory tax 
rate. The resulting decrease in the value of 
DTA on our balance sheet of $7.9 million is 
reflected as a corresponding deferred tax 
expense in the income statement, 
classified as an adjusting item in the year.
Earnings per share
Adjusted basic earnings per share was up 
43 per cent at 7.55 cents (2016 5.29 cents). 
There were 610.6 million (2016 610.6 
million) weighted average Ordinary shares 
in issue. Basic earnings per share was 4.75 
cents compared with a loss per share of 
6.93 cents for 2016. See note 12 of Notes 
to the full year consolidated financial 
statements on page 130 for the calculation 
of earnings per share.
Treasury management
The key objective of the Group’s treasury 
department is to manage the financial 
risks of the business and to ensure that 
sufficient liquidity is available to the Group. 
All treasury activity operates within a 
formal control framework. The Board has 
approved treasury policies and guidelines 
and perodically reviews treasury activities. 
Additionally, it is the Group’s policy that 
speculative treasury transactions are 
expressly forbidden.
Spirent’s financial risk management 
objectives and policies and its exposure 
to risks are discussed in note 27 of Notes 
to the consolidated financial statements.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
48 Financing and cash flow
The Group was highly cash generative in 
2017. Following a refreshed focus on 
working capital management, we were 
able to more than double the free cash flow 
from $25.9 million in 2016 to $56.4 million 
in 2017, resulting in a free cash flow 
conversion which represented 122 per cent 
of adjusted earnings (2016 80 per cent). 
Working capital levels reduced in the year 
driven by lower inventory levels and higher 
payables. Cash and cash equivalents 
were $128.4 million at 31 December 2017 
compared with $96.1 million at 31 December 
2016, an increase of $32.3 million. There 
was no debt. 
Free cash flow is set out below:
$ million 2017 2016
Cash flow from 
operations 77.7 47.4
Tax paid (8.4) (4.7)
Net cash inflow 
from operating 
activities 69.3 42.7
Interest received 0.6 0.3
Net capital 
expenditure (13.5) (17.1)
Free cash flow 56.4 25.9
Net capital expenditure of $13.5 million 
was $3.6 million lower than last year due 
to the refit of an engineering lab in the 
United States in 2016. The Group exercised 
careful management of capital investment 
to ensure efficient use of capital and 
maximise return on investment.
In 2017, the final dividend for 2016 and 
an interim dividend for 2017 totalling 
$24.6 million were paid (2016 $24.2 million). 
Defined benefit pension plans
The Group operates two funded defined 
benefit pension plans in the United 
Kingdom, both of which were closed 
to new entrants some time ago. 
The accounting valuation of these plans at 
the end of 2017 showed a net deficit of 
$2.2 million, a marked improvement on the 
net deficit of $12.8 million at 31 December 
2016. The deficit has reduced because of 
contributions paid in the year, stronger 
asset returns and a beneficial change to 
the mortality assumption underpinning the 
value placed on liabilities, offset to some 
extent by a change to commutation factors 
and a decrease in the discount rate, both 
of which increase the value placed on 
liabilities. In addition, movements in the 
US dollar to sterling exchange rate impacts 
the deficit expressed in US dollars. The 
accounting valuation is based on the 
actuarial valuation dated 31 March 2015.
The Group has also reported a liability 
of $0.6 million (31 December 2016 
$0.7 million) in respect of UK unfunded 
plan liabilities.
The next Triennial Valuation of the plans 
is due on 31 March 2018. The technical 
deficit on 31 March 2015, the date of the 
last Triennial Valuation was $46.0 million, 
which is currently being funded over a 
seven-year period, which commenced 1 
July 2016, by an annual contribution of  
$7.0 million (£5.0 million).
Balance sheet and dividend policies
The Board currently intends to maintain 
a cash positive balance sheet over the 
medium to long term. This should allow 
the Company to maintain a strong capital 
position in the face of business risks, 
trading fluctuations and working capital 
demands. In addition, the Board wishes to 
maintain flexibility to invest in the business 
organically and inorganically. Where 
appropriate, the Company may take on 
modest gearing to fund inorganic 
investments. 
The Board will regularly review the 
Company’s balance sheet in light of 
current and expected trading performance 
and cash generation, working capital 
requirements and expected investments. 
To the extent the Company has excess 
cash, it will consider returning such cash to 
shareholders. The Board will consider from 
time to time the appropriate mechanism for 
returning surplus cash to shareholders.
We aim to build cover for the dividend 
to 2 to 2.5 times adjusted earnings and 
follow a progressive dividend policy.
Dividend
The Board is recommending the payment 
of a final dividend for 2017 of 2.40 cents 
(1.73 pence) per share which, together with 
the interim dividend of 1.68 cents (1.27 
pence) per share paid in September 2017, 
brings the full year dividend to 4.08 cents 
(3.00 pence) per share. This is a 5 per cent 
increase in the full year dividend for 2017 
compared to full year 2016. In sterling 
terms this represents a decrease of 2 per 
cent. The dividend is covered 1.9 times by 
adjusted earnings. 
The Board has also considered the 
Company’s cash position in line with the 
policies outlined above. As a result, it has 
decided to recommend a special dividend 
of 5.00 cents (3.60 pence) per share which 
equates to a cash distribution of circa 
$30.5 million.
Subject to approval by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting on 2 May 2018, 
the final and special dividends will be paid 
on 4 May 2018 to shareholders on the 
register at 16 March 2018. Payment to 
ADR holders will be made on 11 May 2018
Restatement of operating segments

Helping to revolutionise R&D labs: dramatically 
reducing test times and environmental impacts
Hardware R&D labs are energy intensive, with test 
equipment and development hardware mounted 
in racks in a noisy, air-conditioned environment. 
Labs can be inefficient with unused equipment 
left on, equipment duplicated across teams and 
sites, and equipment configured manually.
Spirent’s product Velocity helps companies to 
revolutionise their labs, dramatically reducing 
the time taken to complete tests whilst 
significantly reducing environmental impacts.
Using Velocity, Spirent has helped companies to:
• Reduce testing time: Velocity has helped 
complete tests four times quicker;
• Reduce equipment needed: Velocity allows 
global sharing of equipment and automates 
test scheduling, improving utilisation by up to 
77 per cent;
• Consolidate labs: Velocity allows engineers to 
use and configure equipment from anywhere 
in the world, which means fewer labs;
• Automate power controls for each device: 
Velocity can automatically switch 
off equipment when not needed;
• Reduced energy use and carbon emissions: 
The improved equipment utilisation can 
reduce energy use and carbon emissions 
by up to 63 per cent.

following a supplier assessment 
undertaken by EcoVadis and were finalists 
at this year’s QuEST Sustainability Awards. 
Sustainability in our products
We expanded the coverage of our 
sustainable product development 
processes during the period under review, 
introducing the processes at two additional 
business units.
Our focus areas
Our FuturePositive programme has 
four main focus areas: Product, People, 
Property and Procurement. Full details 
of our programmes are set out in our 
2017 Sustainability Report available at  
https://corporate.spirent.com
Product
Electronic waste and use  
of hazardous materials
Spirent’s business units comply with 
the EU’s Waste Electrical and Electronic 
Equipment Regulations 2013 and Batteries 
Directive and the California Electronic 
Waste Recycling Programme. 
Spirent’s hardware products came into 
scope of the EU’s Restriction of Hazardous 
Substances Directive (“RoHS”) in June 
2017 and all comply with the requirements 
of the Directive.
Conflict minerals
The Group is not directly required to 
comply with or report under Section 1502 
of the Dodd-Frank Act, the US Conflict 
Minerals Law. However, it has robust 
procedures in place to ensure that it would 
be in compliance if it were brought within 
the scope of this legislation. The Group will 
be subject to the EU Directive on Conflict 
Minerals when it is enacted into national 
policy in the UK. We are monitoring the 
development of the standards and are 
confident our existing practices will meet 
the specifications required.
Significant power reduction in Spirent’s 
latest 100Gb Ethernet test solutions 
We have reduced the power consumption 
per port of the latest version of our 100Gb 
ethernet test module, the mX3, by 27 per cent 
compared to the previous model.
The multi-speed mX3 modules are used 
to test the performance of datacenter and 
service provider network infrastructure, 
mounted in Spirent’s N11U or 4U chassis. 
Energy performance has been an important 
consideration during the design process, and 
the mX3 benefits from the latest semi-conductor 
technology, with smaller components and more 
ports per board. We have also made significant 
improvements in heat management, improving 
air-flow and heat sink design. We have 
introduced intelligent power controls that shut 
down unused test modules, along with variable 
speed fans and more efficient power supplies. 
As a result, we have reduced power 
consumption from 200 Watts per slot per port 
in the MX-100G-P2 to 145 Watts in the mX3.

People
Business ethics and human rights
Spirent’s core values and principles and 
the standards of behaviour to which every 
employee across the Group is expected 
to work are set out in the Group’s Ethics 
Policy. These values and principles are 
applied to all dealings with our customers, 
suppliers and other stakeholders, not only 
forming part of our pre-contract due 
diligence, but also being monitored through 
our ongoing supplier audit programme.
The Group has a zero-tolerance approach 
to all forms of bribery and corruption.  
As a UK registered company, Spirent 
Communications plc is bound by the laws 
of the UK, including the Bribery Act 2010, 
in respect of our conduct both at home 
and abroad. In addition, we will uphold 
all laws relevant to countering bribery 
and corruption, including the US Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act as well as human 
rights, in all jurisdictions in which we operate.
During the period under review, anti-
bribery and anti-corruption training 
was undertaken by all employees 
with customer-facing roles, with this 
training scheduled to be rolled out 
to all employees during 2018.
Equality and diversity
The Group employs a diverse workforce 
and prides itself in providing equal 
opportunities for all. High value is placed 
on rewarding our people for their 
commitment, their integrity and their 
service. We aim to ensure that no 
employee is discriminated against, 
directly or indirectly, on the grounds of 
colour, race, ethnic and national origins, 
sexual orientation or gender, marital status, 
disability, religion or belief, being a part 
time employee or on the grounds of age.
These practices are governed by our 
Business Ethics and HR policies.
At 31 December 2017, Spirent employed 
1,477 employees of whom 316 were female 
(21.4 per cent) and 1,161 were male (78.6 per 
cent). 31 of the Group’s senior management 
were female (16.2 per cent) and 160 were 
male (83.8 per cent), with one female 
member of the Board (20 per cent) and 
four male (80 per cent).
Gender Pay Gap
Under the current criteria, Spirent is not 
required to comply with the Gender Pay 
Gap reporting regulations but is looking 
at this issue and expects to publish its 
findings when they are available.
Health and Safety
The Board has designated the Chief 
Financial Officer as being responsible for 
health and safety performance within the 
Group and procedures are in place for 
incidents to be reported through the Audit 
Committee to the Board as necessary.
The health and safety risk profile for the 
Group remained low during 2017, with 
14 reportable accidents, none of which 
required hospitalisation.
Training and skills
Spirent provides all its employees with 
a wide range of technical and business 
training opportunities. We manage training 
through personal development plans 
which are assessed by all managers 
and updated periodically. 
Higher education and schools
Through knowledge transfer partnerships, 
we continue to promote STEM skills and 
innovation in early career development and 
young students. Our work in this area has 
been recognised by the BITC with Spirent 
being short-listed for their “Supporting 
Young Talent” award in 2016 and 
reaccredited in 2017.
Information security
Spirent takes data security and privacy 
seriously and we continually review 
the security of our data systems and 
procedures in order that we can react 
to areas of heightened risk promptly 
and effectively.
In preparation for the introduction of 
the General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR) in 2017, Spirent has undertaken 
a full review of its data protection policies 
and procedures in order to comply with 
the new regulation.
Spirent have procedures to restrict 
the type and quantity of confidential 
information collected and stored 
and there are robust procedures in 
place to protect customer data from 
unauthorised access and disclosure. 
Periodic information security risk 
assessments are performed, and training 
is provided to staff to prevent information 
security breaches. Our internal controls 
are audited, and we have a whistleblower 
procedure in place for staff to report 
information security or any other concerns. 
Spirent has implemented a response 
procedure to manage breaches of 
confidential information if they were 
to occur.
Confidential waste is shredded if in 
hard copy and certificates of destruction 
are provided for any electronic storage 
devices disposed of at end-of-life.
STEM initiatives and  
community impact projects
Spirent actively encourages its employees 
to become STEM ambassadors around 
the globe. Our ambassadors work with 
students in local schools and institutions 
to help them develop STEM skills and 
help them in their professional journey.
We also provide our employees in the 
US and EMEA with volunteering time 
off to make a positive contribution to 
the communities in which they work.
Through financial donations and staff 
volunteering, Spirent has continued to 
support community projects worldwide. 
Projects include ongoing initiatives to 
rebuild homes after hurricanes Sandy 
and Harvey in the US, and supporting 
education projects in India and China.

52 Property
Energy use
Energy use is an important environmental 
impact for Spirent. Our properties, which 
house engineering and development labs, 
are key energy-using processes within 
the scope of our direct operations.
Spirent’s energy use fell in 2017 by  
16.5 per cent to 14,023MWh. This is 
predominantly due to a 60 per cent 
decrease in gas use across our UK and 
US sites and a 12.5 per cent reduction in 
electricity use across our global estate.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Greenhouse gas emissions are a material 
issue for Spirent and we are committed to 
reporting emissions and acting to combat 
climate change. The group once again 
reported to the Carbon Disclosure Project 
in 2017, completing the Climate Change 
and Supply Chain questionnaire. In 2017 
we achieved a B rating.
Methodology
Reporting on emission sources is required 
under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 
2013 and these sources fall within our 
consolidated financial statements. We 
have reported on all the emission sources 
that fall within our consolidated financial 
statements. We do not have responsibility 
for any emission sources that are not 
included in our consolidated financial 
statements. We have used the GHG 
Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (Revised Edition), 
along with data gathered to fulfil our 
requirements under these Regulations, and 
emission factors from the UK Government’s 
GHG Conversion Factors for Company 
Reporting 2017 for all countries except the 
United States, where US EPA 2016 eGrid 
emissions factors for the applicable 
individual states was used.
Supplier audit programme expanded in 2017
Spirent’s supply chain team conducted audits 
on 18 of our key suppliers in 2017, which 
represents 52 per cent of our supply chain spend.
The on-site audits review the management and 
performance of the suppliers, and cover quality, 
health and safety, business ethics, labour and 
human rights, and environmental management.
Since the introduction of the supplier 
sustainability audit programme in 2016, around 
70 per cent of components now come from 
suppliers who have been audited by Spirent 
directly, or by our contract manufacturer or 
as part of the EICC VAP audit programme, 
exceeding our year-end target of 60 per cent.

revenue from 2016 figures. We have 
achieved this target, having reduced 
carbon emissions per $m of revenues 
by 5.8 per cent. 19 of our 39 sites have 
achieved absolute reductions in GHG 
emissions of five per cent or more.
Compliance
The Group is not required to comply 
with stage 1 of the UK Energy Savings 
Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) Regulations 
2014. We will review whether we are 
required to comply with stage 2 of 
the scheme at the qualification date, 
31 December 2018. If the Group meets 
the qualification criteria, Spirent has a 
compliance plan in place to ensure 
compliance by the deadline of  
5 December 2019.
Procurement
Vendor assessment and auditing
Vendors are required to abide by our Code 
of Conduct which sets out our expectations 
for environmental management, labour and 
human rights, health and safety, and business 
ethics. They are assessed using a detailed 
questionnaire. The questionnaire was 
revised in 2016 and again in 2017 to include 
enhanced disclosures of environmental, 
social and business ethics management.
Priority suppliers are audited by Spirent’s 
procurement team: 18 supplier audits were 
conducted in 2017 at contract manufacturers 
and component suppliers, representing 
52 per cent of our supply chain spend. 
No material issues were identified.
We also make use of industry-body 
audit programmes to determine the 
compliance status of our suppliers. 
Compliance
We comply with the requirements of the UK 
Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the California 
Transparency in Supply Chains Act 2010. 
We require slavery and human trafficking 
to be eradicated from our direct supply 
chain for the products we sell and monitor 
suppliers by performing regular evaluation 
surveys to assure ourselves of each 
supplier’s commitment in this area. 
Spirent’s full statement on Modern 
Slavery and Human Trafficking can

54 Corporate Governance
Chairman’s introduction to governance
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to report to you the Governance 
section of our Annual Report 2017.
I stepped into the role of Chairman in May 
2017 having joined the Board in December 
2016. During 2017 I have met with a large 
cross section of the stakeholders in our 
business to solicit a wide range of views 
on the opportunities and challenges that 
Spirent faces. I will continue to maintain that 
dialogue with as wide a cross section of the 
stakeholders in our business as possible as 
I aim to ensure that Spirent delivers not only 
on its financial goals, but also on its wider 
responsibilities as an employer in the 
communities in which it operates.
From a governance perspective, my first 
priority has been to expand the Board with 
new members who could bring strong 
technical backgrounds, international 
experience in our industry and who have 
specific knowledge of working with our 
customer base. In appointing Edgar Masri 
and Wendy Koh at the beginning of 2018, 
the Board and I are confident that we have 
found people with just the right profiles. 
They will help to supplement and develop 
Accountability, integrity and 
respect are the cornerstones  
for a healthy business.
My first priority has been to expand the  
Board with new members who could bring strong 
technical backgrounds, international experience  
in our industry and who have specific knowledge  
of working with our customer base.
the skillset and experience of the Board 
which will, in turn, help us to support our 
management team and build a platform 
for Spirent to grow in a sustainable way.
Just as important as the set of skills and 
experience of the Board is that we have the 
appropriate governance framework in place 
to ensure we meet our obligations. I am 
pleased to confirm that this year Spirent has 
complied in full with the principles of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2016. As you 
will see from reading our Remuneration and 
Audit Committee reports, we have sought 
to build on the existing strong governance 
framework in order that the Board can be 
confident that it has full visibility of issues 
within Spirent’s businesses and that we are 
fully considering the changing expectations 
of our stakeholders with regard to matters 
such as executive pay. I note our inclusion 
on the Investment Association register of 
companies with a significant vote against 
our Directors’ report on remuneration at the 
2016 AGM and, as explained by our Chair 
of Remuneration Committee in his letter on 
page 74, we are engaging with all investors 
to understand their points of view and, 
where possible, address their concerns.
Finally, I would like to extend my thanks 
and appreciation to my colleagues on the 
Spirent Board who stood down in the year 
under review. The composition of the Board 
changed significantly during the course of 
2017 and I would like to acknowledge in 
particular the contribution that Alex Walker 
made, serving on the Spirent Board for a 
total of 10 years, including seven years as 
Chairman. In that time, he led the Board 
with distinction as Spirent expanded into 
profitable and fast-growing markets and 
dealt with the challenges of rapid technology 
change. We wish him well in his retirement.
I look forward to meeting any shareholders 
who are able to attend our AGM in 
May and thank you for your continued 
support as we look to the year ahead.

framework of effective controls which 
enable risk to be assessed and managed 
and to ensure that sufficient resources 
are available to meet the objectives set.
There are a number of matters which 
are specifically reserved for the Board’s 
approval. These are set out in a clearly 
defined schedule which includes: matters 
relating to the Group’s strategic plan; 
approving the annual business strategy 
and objectives; the nature and extent of 
principal risks to be taken to achieve the 
strategic objectives; changes relating to 
structure and capital; approval of trading 
statements, half year results, final results 
and annual report and accounts; declaring 
interim dividends and recommending 
final dividends; the Group’s policies 
and systems of internal control and risk 
management, approving capital projects, 
acquisitions and disposals valued at over 
$2 million; and provision of adequate 
succession planning.
The schedule of matters reserved for the 
Board was reviewed during the year and 
approved and adopted at the March 2017 
Board meeting.
Certain specific responsibilities are 
delegated to the committees of the Board, 
notably the Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees, which operate 
within clearly defined terms of reference 
and report regularly to the Board. For 
further details, please see the reports of 
each Committee that follow this statement.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive Officer are separately held 
and the division of their responsibilities 
is clearly established, set out in writing, 
and agreed by the Board to ensure that 
no one person has unfettered powers of 
decision. The Chairman is responsible for 
the operation and leadership of the Board, 
ensuring its effectiveness and setting its 
agenda. The Chief Executive Officer is 
responsible for leading and managing 
the Group’s business within a set of 
authorities delegated by the Board 
and the implementation of Board 
strategy and policy.
Authority for the operational management of 
the Group’s business has been delegated to 
the Chief Executive Officer for execution or 
further delegation by him for the effective 
day-to-day running and management of the 
Group. The Group Executive Committee, 
led by the Chief Executive Officer, consists 
of the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief 
Operating Officer, the EVP Global Sales, 
the EVP Strategic Marketing and the 
Company Secretary & General Counsel.
Senior Independent Director
The role of Senior Independent Director 
is to act as a sounding board for the 
Chairman and to serve as an intermediary 
for other directors as necessary. He is 
also available to shareholders to convey 
concerns to the Board which they have 
been unable to convey through the 
Chairman or through the executive 
directors. During the year, led by the Senior 
Independent Director, the non-executive 
directors have met without the presence 
of the Chairman (including to appraise the 
Chairman’s performance).
Non-executive Directors
In addition to their responsibilities 
for strategy and business results, the  
non-executive directors play a key role 
in providing a solid foundation for good 
corporate governance and ensure that no 
individual or group dominates the Board’s 
decision making. They each occupy, or 
have occupied, senior positions in industry, 
bringing valuable external perspective to 
the Board’s deliberations through their 
experience and insight from other sectors 
enabling them to contribute significantly to 
Board decision making. The formal letters 
of appointment of the non-executive 
directors are available for inspection 
at the Company’s registered office.

Strategic Report      Corporate Governance Financial Statements Other Information Corporate Governance
Directors’ statement on corporate governance continued
Senior executives below Board level are 
invited, when appropriate, to attend Board 
meetings and to make presentations 
relating to the results and strategies of 
their business units and Group-wide 
responsibilities. Papers for Board and 
Committee meetings are provided to 
directors in advance of the meeting. 
The attendance of the directors at Board 
and Committee meetings during the year 
under review is shown in the table above. 
If a director is unable to participate in a 
meeting either in person or remotely, 
the Chairman will solicit their views on 
key terms of business in advance of the 
relevant meeting, so that that these 
can be shared with the meeting.
Directors’ indemnity provisions
In accordance with its Articles of 
Association, the Company has granted 
a qualifying third party indemnity, to the 
extent permitted by law, to each director. 
The Company also maintains directors’ 
and officers’ liability insurance.
These provisions are qualifying third party 
indemnity provisions as defined in section 
234 of the Companies Act 2006. Neither 
the Company’s indemnity nor the insurance 
provides cover in the event that a director 
is proven to have acted dishonestly 
or fraudulently.
Board activities during 2017
At each Board meeting, the Chief Executive 
Officer presents an update on the 
performance, strategy and business issues 
across the Group and the Chief Financial 
Officer presents a detailed analysis of the 
financial performance of the business units. 
Senior executives below Board level attend 
relevant parts of Board meetings in order 
to make presentations on their areas of 
responsibility; this gives the Board access 
to a broader group of executives and helps 
the directors make ongoing assessments 
of the Group’s succession plans. The 
Board has a rolling programme of visits 
to business unit locations to deepen its 
appreciation of the different opportunities 
and challenges that each unit faces.
Board Committees
The Board has established three principal 
Board committees, to which it has 
delegated certain of its responsibilities. 
These are the Audit Committee, the 
Nomination Committee and the 
Remuneration Committee. The 
membership, responsibilities and activities 
of these committees are described later 
in this corporate governance statement 
and, in the case of the Remuneration 
Committee, in the Report on directors’ 
remuneration beginning on page 74. 
Membership of these committees is 
reviewed annually and minutes of 
committee meetings are made available 
to all directors on a timely basis.
The chairmen of the Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees intend 
to be present at the Annual General 
Meeting to answer questions on the 
work of their respective committees.
The written terms of reference for the Audit, 
Nomination and Remuneration Committees, 
all of which were reviewed, updated where 
necessary and approved during the year, 
are available on the Company’s website 
at https://corporate.spirent.com.
Election and re-election of Directors
In accordance with the Code’s 
recommendations, all directors who wish to 
continue in their roles will be proposed for 
election or re-election at the 2018 Annual 
General Meeting to be held in May. 
The Board confirms that each of the 
directors standing for re-election has been 
subject to a formal performance evaluation 
in relation to their duty to act in the 
long-term interests of the Company, while 
also having regard to other stakeholders.
Company Secretary
In his role of Company Secretary and General 
Counsel, Angus Iveson is responsible for 
advising and supporting the Chairman and 
the Board on corporate governance matters 
as well as ensuring that there is a smooth flow 
of information to enable effective decision 
making. All directors have access to the 
advice and services of the Company 
Secretary and can take independent 
professional advice in respect of their 
duties, at the Company’s expense.
Board meetings
The Board held seven meetings during 
the year, including a two-day strategy 
meeting held at the Company’s site in 
Paignton, UK.

Strategic Report      Corporate Governance Financial Statements Other Information Effectiveness
Board composition
At the date of this Report, the Board 
comprises a non-executive Chairman, 
four independent non-executive 
directors and two executive directors.
The Chairman and the non-executive 
directors contribute entrepreneurial 
leadership and external expertise and 
experience in areas of importance to the 
Company, such as strategic investments, 
corporate finance, general finance 
and corporate governance. They also 
contribute independent challenge 
and rigour to the Board’s deliberations 
and assist in the development of the 
Company’s strategy, scrutiny of the 
performance of management in meeting 
agreed goals and targets, and satisfying 
themselves of the integrity of the 
Company’s internal controls and risk 
management systems. The Board believes 
that all of the directors devote sufficient 
time and attention as is necessary in order 
to perform their duties.
The Chairman holds regular discussions 
with the non-executive directors without 
the executive directors present to ensure 
a free and frank exchange of views on the 
effectiveness of the executive directors 
and senior management.
Independence
The independence of each non-executive 
director is reviewed on appointment and 
at least annually. The Board determined that 
the current non-executive directors are each 
independent in character and judgement, 
save for the Chairman who was deemed 
independent by the Board at the date of his 
appointment. None have been employed 
by the Company previously in any capacity 
or have any current material business 
relationship with any Group company.
Non-executive directors at Spirent receive 
no remuneration from the Company other 
than their fees (detailed in the Report on 
directors’ remuneration on page 80) and 
each non-executive director has confirmed 
that they do not represent any significant 
shareholder in the Company. No individual 
or group of individuals dominates the 
Board’s decision making and the Code 
requirement stating that at least half of the 
Board (excluding the Chairman) should 
comprise independent non-executive 
directors is satisfied.
Appointments to the Board
There is a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for the appointment of new 
directors to the Board. Details are available 
in the Nomination Committee report on 
pages 66 and 67 which also provides details 
of the Committee’s role and activities.
Commitment
The letters of appointment for the 
Chairman and non-executive directors 
set out the expected time commitment 
required of them and are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered 
office and at the Annual General Meeting. 
Other significant commitments of the 
Chairman and non-executive directors 
are disclosed on appointment and 
require approval thereafter.
Board development
On appointment, directors are offered an 
induction programme on the operations 
and activities of the Group, the role of 
the Board and the matters reserved 
to its decision, the Group’s corporate 
governance practices and procedures and 
their duties, responsibilities and obligations 
as directors of a listed public limited 
company. This may be supplemented by 
visits to key locations and meetings with, 
and presentations by, senior executives.
Further training for directors is available as 
required and can be provided by means of 
external courses, internal computer-based 
training, briefings from specific consultants 
or in-house presentations. In addition, 
directors’ knowledge of the legal and 
regulatory environment is updated through 
the provision of information by the Group’s 
advisers and by means of regular updates 
from the Company Secretary.
New directors are encouraged to take 
advantage of opportunities to meet 
with major shareholders and attend 
presentations to analysts where possible.
Corporate Governance
Directors’ statement on corporate governance continued
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
62 Board performance evaluation
An evaluation to assess the performance 
of the Board as a whole, its committees 
and that of the individual directors is 
conducted annually.
In accordance with the Code 
requirement that the evaluation should 
be conducted by an external facilitator 
at least every three years, in 2015 Useful 
Thinking Limited (“UTL”) was engaged to 
undertake a review of the Board and its 
Committees. UTL is independent, with 
no other connection with the Company. 
During the final quarter of 2017, an 
internally-led review took place.
Process
Following a scoping exercise with the 
Chairman and the Company Secretary to 
agree the priority areas and issues to be 
addressed in the review, the directors 
completed an online questionnaire, 
centring on themes including the 
strengths and values of the Board, the 
quality of succession planning, the 
interaction of the Board members with 
the Group’s various business units, the 
process of managing strategic planning 
and the management of risk.
During the year, the implementation of a 
number of recommended action points 
arising from the 2016 evaluation was 
overseen by the Chairman and included 
the following actions:
2017 actions
• More clearly articulate Spirent’s 
strategic vision;
• Strengthen knowledge of emerging 
sectors in order to better understand 
allocation of research and 
development resources;
• Review appropriateness of KPIs;
• Assess senior leadership depth in 
more detail;
• Review existing internal control 
procedures in the light of the 
recent appointment of a new 
Chief Financial Officer.
All respondents to the 2017 evaluation 
agreed that the conduct of Board 
meetings allows for an open and 
constructuve communication style 
and that the appointment of new 
non-executive directors would continue 
to expand the breadth of market 
and sector experience to the benefit 
of the Company. 
The Board members agreed that the 
Board and its principal committees 
continued to perform effectively.
The Board concluded that the actions 
arising from the 2017 review would 
continue to be developed through 2018, 
with the addition of the following areas 
of focus:
2018 Objectives
• Further explore the articulation of 
Spirent’s strategic vision;
• Continue to review the effectiveness 
of research and development spend;
• Deepen visibility of product 
development investment decisions 
and understanding of progress of 
such investments;
• Increase exposure to senior 
management for the purposes of 
developing internal talent pipeline;
• Monitor effectiveness of revised 
internal control procedures; and
• Review ‘Go To Market’ approach.
Information flow
The Company Secretary manages the 
provision of information to the Board at 
appropriate times in consultation with the 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. In 
addition to formal meetings, the Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer maintain 
regular contact with all directors. The 
Chairman also holds informal meetings 
with non-executive directors, without any 
of the executives being present, to discuss 
any issues affecting the Group, if this is 
thought necessary. Regular management 
updates are sent to directors to keep the 
non-executive directors informed of events 
throughout the Group between Board 
meetings and to ensure that they are kept 
fully advised of the latest issues affecting 
the Group.
Conflicts of interest procedures
The Company has procedures in place, 
which were reviewed and updated 
during the year, to deal with the situation 
where a director has a conflict of interest. 
As part of this process, the Board:
• considers each potential conflict situation 
separately on its particular facts;
• considers the potential conflict situation 
in conjunction with the rest of the 
directors’ duties under the Companies 
Act 2006;
• keeps records and Board minutes as to 
authorisations granted by directors and 
the scope of any approvals given; and
• regularly reviews conflict authorisation.

Directors’ statement on corporate governance continued
Accountability
Financial and business reporting
The Board recognises its responsibility to 
present a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of Spirent in all of its reporting 
obligations. This responsibility covers the 
Annual Report and extends to the half year 
report and other regulatory announcements. 
The Directors consider this Annual Report, 
taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and 
understandable, providing the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy. In arriving at this position, 
the Board asked the Audit Committee to 
review and confirm a process is in place 
to support this assessment. The Audit 
Committee confirmed that a robust 
approach is in place to support the fair, 
balanced and understandable assessment, 
details of which can be found in the Audit 
Committee’s report on pages 68 to 73.
Business model
A description of the Company’s business 
model for sustainable growth is set out in 
“Our business model” on pages 20 and 21. 
This section provides an explanation of the 
basis on which the Group generates value 
and preserves it over the long-term and its 
strategy for delivering its objectives.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Accordingly, and 
consistent with the guidance contained 
in the document titled ‘Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting’ published 
by the FRC, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the annual 
financial statements.
Internal control and risk management
The Board acknowledges its responsibilities 
for the Group’s system of internal control 
to facilitate the identification, assessment 
and management of risk, the protection of 
shareholders’ investments and the Group’s 
assets. The directors recognise that they 
are responsible for providing a return to 
shareholders which is consistent with 
the responsible assessment and 
mitigation of risks.
Effective controls ensure that the Group’s 
exposure to avoidable risk is minimised, 
that adequate accounting records are 
maintained, that the financial information 
used within the business is reliable and 
that the consolidated accounts preparation 
and financial reporting processes comply 
with all relevant regulatory reporting 
requirements. The dynamics of the Group 
and the environment within which it 
operates are continually evolving, together 
with its exposure to risk. Internal controls 
can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The directors confirm that there is an 
ongoing, robust process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the principal risks 
faced by the Group and the operational 
effectiveness of the related controls, which 
has been in place for the year under review 
and up to the date of approval of the annual 
report and accounts. They also confirm that 
they have regularly reviewed the system 
of risk management and internal controls 
utilising the review process set out below.
The directors confirm that a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Company has been carried out, including 
those risks that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity. More details are set out in the 
Principal risks and uncertainties section 
on pages 28 to 31 of this Annual Report.
Standards
Guidelines on the minimum Group-wide 
requirements for health and safety and 
environmental standards are set out in 
policy documents and procedures. There 
are also guidelines on the minimum level 
of internal control that each of the business 
units should exercise over specified 
processes. Each business has developed 
and documented policies and procedures 
to comply with the minimum control 
standards established, including 
procedures for monitoring compliance 
and taking corrective action.
High level controls
All businesses prepare annual operating 
plans and budgets which are supplemented 
by regular forecasts throughout the year. 
Performance against budget is monitored 
at operational level and centrally, with 
variances being reported promptly. The 
cash position at Group and operational level 
is monitored constantly and variances from 
expected levels are investigated thoroughly.
Clearly defined guidelines have been 
established for capital expenditure and 
investment decisions. These include the 
preparation of budgets, appraisal and 
review procedures, and delegated 
authority levels.
Financial reporting
Detailed management accounts are 
prepared every month, consolidated in 
a single system and reviewed by senior 
management and the Board. They include 
a comprehensive set of financial reports 
and key performance indicators covering 
commercial and operational issues. 
Performance against budgets and forecasts 
is discussed regularly at Board meetings 
and at meetings between operational and 
Group management. The adequacy and 
suitability of key performance indicators is 
reviewed regularly.
Internal audit
All of the internal audit activities are 
co-ordinated by the Head of Risk & 
Internal Audit, who has direct access 
to the Board Chairman and to the 
Audit Committee Chairman and is 
accountable to the Audit Committee.
All Group businesses are required to 
comply with the Group’s financial control 
framework that sets out minimum control 
standards. A key function of the Group’s 
internal audit resource is to undertake 
audits to ensure compliance with the 
financial control framework and make 
recommendations for improvement in 
controls where appropriate.
Senior members of the Group finance 
team meet with the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee as appropriate but 
at least annually, without the presence 
of executive management, and have 
direct access to the Chairman.
Remuneration
The Directors’ report on remuneration is 
set out on pages 74 to 93 and provides 
details of our remuneration policy and how 
it has been implemented, together with the 
activities of the Remuneration Committee.
Articles of Association and share capital
Information in relation to share capital, the 
appointment and powers of directors and 
the issue and buy back of shares and 
significant interests in share capital is set out 
in the Directors’ report on pages 94 to 97.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
64 Relations with shareholders
The Board is committed to maintaining 
good communications with shareholders. 
The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Financial Officer have regular face 
to face contact with individual institutional 
shareholders in order to develop an 
understanding of their views which are 
then discussed with the Board. Key themes 
for discussion in 2017 have included the 
appointment processes for the new 
Chairman and non-executive directors 
and the Remuneration Committee’s 
approach to executive remuneration.
All directors are offered the opportunity 
to develop a dialogue with major 
shareholders to listen to their views and 
executive directors receive regular reports 
prepared by an independent capital 
markets advisory firm which provides 
comprehensive information relating to 
the Company’s major shareholders.
Presentations are made to analysts, 
investors and prospective investors 
covering the full year and half year results 
and the Company seeks to maintain a 
dialogue with the various bodies which 
monitor the Company’s governance 
policies and procedures. On 5 May 2017, 
the Company held a Capital Markets 
Day for analysts and investors, with all 
presentations being made available to all 
shareholders via the Company’s website.
The Company is always keen to hear the 
views of its private shareholders and we 
encourage them to access our website 
at https://corporate.spirent.com for our 
Company reports and business information 
and to use our shareholder mailbox at 
investor.relations@spirent.com for 
detailed enquiries.
Any concerns raised by shareholders or 
their representatives, whether expressed 
directly or through voting patterns at the 
Company’s AGM, are discussed by the 
directors and an appropriate response 
given either specifically to the concerned 
party or, if it is felt to be of wider benefit, 
made available to all shareholders  
via the Company’s website.
Annual General Meeting
The Company’s 2018 Annual General 
Meeting (“2018 AGM”) will be held at 
10.30am on 2 May 2018 at the offices  
of FTI Consulting, 200 Aldersgate, 
Aldersgate Street, London EC1A 4HD.
The Board views the AGM as a valuable 
opportunity to communicate with private 
shareholders in particular, for whom it 
provides the opportunity to hear about 
the general development of the business 
and to ask questions of the Chairman 
and, through him, the chairmen of the 
key Committees and other directors.
The Board looks forward to welcoming all  
our shareholders to our 2018 AGM and to 
updating them on our business developments.

• Edgar Masri (appointed 11 January 2018)
Key duties
In accordance with its terms of reference, 
the Nomination Committee’s key 
duties include:
• leading the search process and 
making recommendations to the Board 
for the appointment of new directors;
• regularly reviewing the Board structure, 
size and composition (including the 
skills, knowledge, independence, 
experience and diversity), 
recommending any necessary 
changes and considering plans 
for orderly succession; and
• making recommendations to the Board 
about suitable candidates for the role 
of Senior Independent Director, and 
membership of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees in 
consultation with the chairmen 
of the relevant Committees.
How the Committee operates
Members of the Nomination Committee are 
appointed by the Board from the directors 
of the Company. The Committee comprises 
a minimum of three independent non-
executive directors. A quorum consists 
of two members, being either two 
independent non-executive directors 
or one independent non-executive 
director and the Chairman.
Only members of the Committee have 
the right to attend Committee meetings. 
Other individuals, such as the Chief 
Executive Officer and external advisers, 
may be invited to attend meetings 
when appropriate.
When dealing with the appointment of 
the Chairman, the Committee is chaired 
by the Senior Independent Director.
The terms of reference of the Nomination 
Committee, which were updated as 
necessary and approved during the year, 
are available on the Company’s website 
at https://corporate.spirent.com.
As part of its ongoing assessment of senior leadership 
depth, the Committee and the Board continue to work 
towards developing a diverse internal pipeline for future 
succession to the Board and senior management.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
66 Appointment of new Independent 
non-executive directors
During the year, the Chairman led the 
process for the appointment of two new 
independent non-executive directors as part 
of the progressive refreshing of the Board.
The services of external executive 
consulting firm Russell Reynolds Associates 
were retained to identify candidates. Russell 
Reynolds Associates is independent, with 
no other connection to the Company, and 
is a signatory to the “Voluntary Code of 
Conduct for Executive Search Firms” 
on diversity and best practice.
Following a rigorous process of 
interviews and assessments and, on 
the recommendation of the Nomination 
Committee, the Board approved the 
appointments of Wendy Koh and Edgar 
Masri with effect from 11 January 2018.
Diversity policy at Board level
The Board does not currently set specific 
aspirations in respect of diversity at 
Board level but supports fully the Code’s 
principles in respect of this key issue. 
As part of its ongoing assessment of 
senior leadership depth, the Committee 
and the Board continue to work towards 
developing a diverse internal pipeline 
for future succession to the Board and 
senior management.
Spirent as a whole recognises the benefits 
of diversity beyond that of gender, taking 
account of diversity of social and ethnic 
backgrounds and cognitive and personal 
strengths when considering appointments 
at all levels whilst ensuring appointments 
are made on merit and ability to enhance 
the performance of the business.
Performance review
The performance of the Committee was 
evaluated as part of the annual Board 
performance evaluation and the Committee 
was found to be operating effectively.
Re-election of Directors
The Committee reviews the results of the 
annual Board performance evaluation that 
specifically relate to the composition of the 
Board and whether the time commitment 
of those who fulfil the roles of Chairman, 
Senior Independent Director and  
non-executive director was appropriate.
The Committee was satisfied that all 
non-executive members of the Board 
devote sufficient time to their duties 
and remain independent in nature and 
recommends all continuing directors 
for re-election by shareholders at the 
forthcoming AGM.
Meetings
The Nomination Committee met three 
times during the year under review and has 
met once in 2018 to the date of this Report.
Committee activities during 2017
Board appointments process
The Chairman leads the process for new 
appointments with external, independent 
consultants engaged to conduct a search 
for potential candidates. These are 
considered on the basis of their skills, 
experience and fit with the existing 
members of the Board. Procedures for 
appointing a non-executive or an executive 
director are set out in the Committee’s 
terms of reference.
Appointment of new Chairman
Following the announcement in November 
2016 of Alex Walker’s intention to retire 
as both Chairman and Non-executive 
Director at the conclusion of the 2017 AGM, 
the Senior Independent Director was 
asked by the Committee to initiate a 
search for a replacement.
The services of external executive search 
firm Spencer Stuart were retained to 
assist with the process. Spencer Stuart is 
independent, with no other connection 
to the Company and is a signatory to the 
“Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive 
Search Firms” on diversity and best practice. 
Following an extensive process of interviews 
and assessments with both external and 
internal candidates for the role, on 18 May 
2017 the Board approved the appointment 
of Bill Thomas, an existing non-executive 
director of the Company, as Chairman.

Audit Committee Report
The Committee remains fully committed  
to championing good financial and risk 
reporting and to ensuring we have in  
place the appropriate internal controls.
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Audit Committee,  
I am pleased to present its report for 
the period ending 31 December 2017.
In 2017 the Committee completed its 
review of the Company approach to 
internal audit. We have now introduced 
a co-sourced function consisting of a 
Head of Risk & Internal Audit employed 
by the Company, supported by external 
professional advisers to assist with delivery 
of an internal audit programme. We believe 
that this will give the Committee greater 
assurance that internal controls operate as 
intended and provide greater visibility of 
potential enhancements that could be 
introduced. Alongside the investment in 
our approach to Internal Audit, we have 
augmented our approach to the internal 
reporting of any ethics or integrity 
breaches by employees through the 
appointment of an independent third party 
offering a confidential whistleblowing 
hotline. In addition, in 2017 there was a 
thorough review and subsequent refresh 
of the delegated levels of authority which 
was subject to review by the Committee 
and recommended to the Board.
Looking ahead, the Committee is aware 
that under the EU Audit Regulations it will 
be necessary to change the Company 
external auditors in time for the new 
auditor’s term to begin in 2021. The 
Committee will begin preparation for formal 
tendering of the external audit during 2019.
As stated in last year’s Audit Committee 
report, the Group will report in accordance 
with IFRS 15 with effect from the period 
beginning on 1 January 2018. The 
Committee has received several reports 
on the preparations being made to report 
under IFRS 15 and understand that this 
new standard will not result in a material 
impact to our financial results.
Further details on the Committee’s 
activities during the year under review 
are set out in the report to follow.
As you would expect, the Committee 
remains fully committed to championing  
good financial and risk reporting and 
to ensuring we have in place the 
appropriate internal controls.
I look forward to meeting any shareholders 
who attend our AGM this year to answer 
any questions shareholders may have on 
this report or on the Committee’s activities.
Jonathan Silver
Chairman, Audit Committee
8 March 2018
Alongside the investment in our approach to Internal 
Audit, we have augmented our approach to the internal 
reporting of any ethics or integrity breaches by employees 
through the appointment of an independent third party 
offering a confidential whistleblowing hotline.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
68 Members
During the year and at the date of this 
report, Committee members were:
• Jonathan Silver (Committee Chairman)
• Gary Bullard
• Wendy Koh (appointed 11 January 2018)
• Tom Lantzsch (until 3 March 2017)
• Edgar Masri (appointed 11 January 2018)
• Tom Maxwell (until 3 May 2017)
• Sue Swenson (until 8 March 2017)
• Bill Thomas (until 18 May 2017)
It is intended that the Audit Committee is 
comprised of at least three members, all 
of whom are independent non-executive 
directors of the Company who have 
the necessary range of financial and 
commercial expertise to challenge 
management. Two members constitute a 
quorum. For much of 2017, following the 
resignation of non-executive directors from 
the Board, the Committee comprised only 
two members until successors were 
appointed in January 2018.
The Code requires the inclusion of one 
financially qualified member (as recognised 
by the Consultative Committee of 
Accountancy Bodies) with recent and 
relevant financial experience. Currently, the 
Committee Chairman fulfils this requirement.
Key duties
In accordance with its terms of reference, 
the Audit Committee’s key duties include:
• monitoring the integrity of the Group’s 
financial statements and any formal 
announcements relating to the 
Company’s performance, reviewing 
significant financial reporting 
judgements contained in them 
before their submission to the Board 
for approval;
• on matters of financial reporting 
reviewing and challenging where 
necessary the consistency of and any 
changes to accounting and treasury 
policies; for example whether the Group 
has followed appropriate accounting 
policies and made appropriate 
estimates and judgements, the clarity 
and completeness of disclosure, 
significant adjustments resulting from 
the audit, and the going concern 
assumption and compliance with 
auditing standards;
Fair, balanced, understandable 
In making its recommendation to the 
Board that the Annual Report, taken  
as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable, the Committee 
applied robust governance 
arrangements, including:
• clear guidance and instruction 
of the disclosure requirement 
provided to contributors;
• comprehensive Group and subsidiary 
accounts processes, with written 
confirmations provided by business 
unit management teams on the health 
of the financial control environment;
• a verification process applied to 
factual content with the aim of 
providing the information 
necessary to assess the 
Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy;
• reviews of the Annual Report 
undertaken at different levels  
of the Group and by the senior 
management team that aim to ensure 
consistency and overall balance;
• additional scrutiny by senior 
management including focused 
review of risk registers;
• additional Committee reviews  
of the draft Annual Report in 
advance of final sign-off; and
• external audit review.
Final approval of the Annual Report 
is provided by the Board, on the 
recommendation of the Committee.
• at the request of the Board, reviewing 
the content of the Annual Report and 
Accounts and advising the Board on 
whether, taken as a whole, it is fair, 
balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position and performance, business 
model and strategy;
• as requested by the Board, assisting in 
relation to the Board’s assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Company 
and the prospects of the Company for 
the purposes of disclosures required 
in the Annual Report and Accounts;
• reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal financial controls, 
including the policies and overall 
process for assessing established 
systems of internal financial control and 
timeliness and the effectiveness of 
corrective action taken by management;
• reviewing the most appropriate 
fulfilment of the internal audit function, 
agreeing and assessing the annual 
internal audit plan and its effectiveness 
in the context of the Company’s overall 
risk management system;
• overseeing the Group’s policies, 
procedures and controls for preventing 
bribery, identifying money laundering, 
and the Group’s arrangements for 
whistleblowing; and
• overseeing the relationship with the 
Group’s external auditors, reporting 
to the Board each year whether it 
considers the audit contract should 
be put out to tender taking into account 
any legal requirements for tendering or 
rotation of the audit contract, reviewing 
and monitoring their objectivity and 
independence including seeking 
information from the external auditor 
on an annual basis about its policies 
and procedures for maintaining 
independence, agreeing the scope 
of their work and fees paid to them 
for audit, assessing the effectiveness 
of the audit process, and agreeing the 
policy in relation to the provision of 
non-audit services.

Audit Committee Report continued
Meetings
The Audit Committee met four times during 
the year, with the Committee agenda linked 
to events in the Group’s financial calendar.
Activities during 2017
The Audit Committee’s activities principally 
related to financial reporting, internal 
control and risk management, the 
preparation for publishing a viability 
statement and the external audit. In 
addition, the Audit Committee considered 
other specific matters such as the Group’s 
approach to IT controls and cyber security.
Financial reporting and significant issues
During the year, the Audit Committee:
• reviewed the full year and half year 
financial statements, trading updates, 
key accounting policies and significant 
financial reporting judgements 
contained therein (with particular 
reference to the critical accounting 
assumptions and judgements as set 
out in note 2 of the consolidated 
financial statements) and recommended 
the financial statements to the Board 
for approval;
• reviewed whether the Annual Report 
taken as a whole is fair, balanced 
and understandable and formed 
an opinion thereon prior to 
recommending it to the Board;
• reviewed and monitored risk management 
processes and their potential to impact on 
the viability of the Group;
• reviewed and considered assumptions 
in relation to the going concern basis for 
preparation of financial statements; and
• reviewed the external auditor’s report 
on the interim review and year end audit 
and management’s responses to the 
issues raised.
The Committee Chairman reports 
any significant findings or identified 
weaknesses to the Board.
How the Committee operates
All Committee members are expected 
to be financially literate and to have an 
understanding of the following areas:
• the principles of, and developments in, 
financial reporting including applicable 
accounting standards and statements 
of recommended practice;
• key aspects of the Company’s 
operations including corporate 
policies and the Group’s internal 
control environment;
• matters which may influence the 
presentation of accounts and key figures;
• the principles of, and developments in, 
company law, sector-specific laws and 
other relevant corporate legislation;
• the role of internal and external 
auditing and risk management; and
• the regulatory framework for the 
Group’s businesses.
The Committee invites the Chief Executive 
Officer, Chief Financial Officer and senior 
representatives of the external auditor 
to attend its meetings in full, although 
it reserves the right to request any of 
these individuals to withdraw.
During the year, the Committee held 
two meetings with the external auditor 
without any executive members of the 
Board being present.
The Committee has unrestricted access 
to Company documents and information, 
as well as to employees of the Company 
and the external auditor.
The Committee’s effectiveness is 
reviewed on an annual basis as part of 
the Board’s performance evaluation 
process and the Committee was found 
to be operating effectively.
The terms of reference of the Audit 
Committee were reviewed and updated 
during the year and can be viewed 
on the Company’s website at  
https://corporate.spirent.com.
Significant financial issues considered
The Audit Committee has reviewed each of 
the following key significant financial risks by:
• reviewing papers and 
management updates;
• holding discussions with management 
and key finance staff to challenge 
assumptions made;
• debating alternative treatments;
• receiving periodic reports on key areas 
of judgement;
• discussing with the external auditor; and
• considering presentations to analysts 
to assess for inconsistencies or areas 
of bias.
Revenue recognition
The Committee is aware that pressure on 
management to meet certain targets, and 
to respond to specific customer requests 
may drive additional deal complexity which 
in turn could lead to complex accounting. 
This may result in inappropriate recognition 
of revenue and associated balances. The 
Committee has been briefed on the finance 
organisation’s implementation of the new 
revenue recognition standard (IFRS 15), 
which will apply to the Company’s financial 
statements for the period beginning 
1 January 2018.
As part of their audit procedures agreed 
with the Committee, Ernst & Young LLP 
(“EY”) would examine the allocation of 
revenue, reviewing specific large and 
complex transactions and contracts 
containing non-standard acceptance 
clauses to ensure that revenue has 
been recognised appropriately. EY has 
also tested the allocation of revenue to 
the service element of multi-element 
contracts to ensure that deferred revenue 
and other associated balances have been 
recognised in accordance with Group 
accounting policies and IFRS.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
70 Misstatements
Management reported to the Committee 
that they were not aware of any material 
or immaterial misstatements made 
intentionally to achieve a particular 
outcome. The auditor reported to the 
Committee that all misstatements they had 
found in the course of their work had been 
corrected. After due consideration, the 
Committee concurred with management 
that no adjustments were required.
Internal control and risk management
During the year, the Audit Committee:
• monitored and reviewed internal  
control and risk management systems;
• reviewed and approved the internal 
audit programme for 2017; and
• reviewed regular reports on taxation, 
treasury operations, health and safety 
and cyber security.
The Board has overall responsibility for 
the Group’s system of internal control and 
risk management and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. The Board, assisted by 
the Audit Committee, has reviewed the 
effectiveness of this system and has 
enhanced the approach to Internal 
Control and Raising Concerns at Work 
as described below during 2017.
Internal Audit
During 2017 the Group further developed 
its assurance approach and resource  
and a Head of Risk & Internal Audit was 
appointed alongside an outsourced 
provider for financial control activities, 
with an Internal Audit Charter being 
approved by the Committee.
Deferred tax assets
The Committee recognises there is a 
risk that inappropriate use of brought 
forward tax losses and volatility in forecast 
sales may result in incorrect recognition 
of deferred tax assets. In addition, following 
the significant reduction in US Federal tax 
rates in 2017, due consideration has been 
given to the change in the measurement 
and resulting disclosures of these assets. 
Anticipated restrictions on the utilisation 
of carry forward losses in the UK may 
also increase the risk and uncertainty.
The Committee noted that EY has 
performed a detailed review of the 
recognition of deferred tax assets in 
the Group accounts as part of their audit 
review, with a good level of challenge of 
management’s underlying assumptions.
Goodwill impairment
Following the review of the lines of business 
by management in 2016 to focus on key 
areas for sustainable growth, changes 
were introduced to the Group’s operating 
segments which resulted in a reorganisation 
of the cash generating units for goodwill 
impairment purposes and some reallocations 
of goodwill to the new cash generating units. 
At the end of 2016, management performed 
an impairment review and a $69.1 million 
charge was made against goodwill and 
acquired intangible assets to reflect the 
reorganisation of reporting segments, the 
intended reduction of investment in certain 
business units, the changing outlook 
for certain areas of the business, the 
reassessment of value in use and a more 
competitive landscape. The Committee 
noted that as a result of this review, some 
areas of the business had limited remaining 
headroom for goodwill purposes.
Management undertook its annual review 
of impairment at the end of 2017 and the 
Committee challenged the assumptions 
made and concluded that management’s 
assessment of goodwill is appropriate.
As part of its audit process, EY undertook 
a review of the procedures followed 
and judgements made by management 
and agreed that management’s 
conclusions related to the impairments 
were reasonable.
The Committee approved the programme of 
work for the Internal Audit function, which 
was focused on addressing both financial 
and overall risk management objectives 
across the Group. The Committee oversees 
and monitors the work of the Internal Audit 
function, which reviews key controls and 
processes throughout the Group on a 
rolling basis, including resources, scope 
and effectiveness of the function.
The Head of Risk & Internal Audit has direct 
access to the Board Chairman and to the 
Committee Chairman, is accountable to the 
Committee and meets regularly with both 
the Committee and its Chairman, without 
the presence of management, to consider 
the work of Internal Audit.
Raising Concerns at Work
In 2017 the whistleblowing procedure in 
place across the Group was reviewed. The 
Committee aims to ensure that employees 
are able to raise any concern about any 
possible improprieties in business practices, 
or other matters, in confidence. In January 
2018 an external third party was appointed 
to receive any concerns raised by 
employees. Going forward, the disclosures 
under this arrangement will be investigated 
promptly by the Company Secretary, with 
the support of the Head of Risk & Internal 
Audit, and escalated to the Executive 
Directors and the Committee as appropriate, 
with follow-up action being taken as soon 
as practicable thereafter. With the revised 
procedure now in place, the Committee is 
satisfied that the means for employees to 
raise concerns at work are approporiate to 
the size and scale of the Group.

Audit Committee Report continued
Committee Oversight
Day-to-day responsibility for effective 
internal control and risk management and 
monitoring rests with senior management 
at business unit level. During the year, the 
Chief Financial Officer has attended all 
Audit Committee meetings to report on 
internal control and risk management and 
to notify the Committee of any control 
weaknesses, control failings and risks, 
their impact and the actions taken to deal 
with the issues. Detailed updates on 
specific areas, such as cyber security 
or business continuity, are provided 
by the Chief Financial Officer at the 
Committee’s request.
The Board and Audit Committee consider 
that having the following key elements 
in place is critical to underpinning the 
overall internal control environment:
Operating structure and controls
An organisational structure with clear 
operating procedures, defined lines 
of responsibility and delegated levels 
of authority which were subject to a 
thorough review and refresh during 2017.
Financial control structure
A comprehensive strategic planning, 
financial control and budgeting system 
which is properly documented and 
regularly reviewed.
Ethics Policy
A policy that sets standards of 
professionalism and integrity for all 
employees and operations. The Ethics 
Policy includes sections relating to bribery 
and corruption to ensure that all of 
Spirent’s systems, controls and training 
comply with the anti-bribery and corruption 
legislation in the countries in which we 
operate and that a culture of prevention 
and detection of all forms of bribery and 
corruption is in place.
Acquisitions and divestments
A disciplined due diligence process and 
post-acquisition integration programme.
The primary aim of the Group’s internal 
controls is to operate a system which is 
appropriate to the business and which can 
support the Group in delivering its strategic 
objectives, safeguard the Group’s assets 
and, over time, enhance shareholder value. 
The system is designed to identify, evaluate 
and manage the significant risks faced by 
the Group rather than to eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives 
and can only provide reasonable and 
not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. This is in accordance 
with the Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council in September 2014.
The Chief Financial Officer is responsible 
for internal control and for ensuring that the 
finance department employs a level of 
management and specialists appropriate 
for maintaining financial records and 
processes that provide financial 
information that is relevant, reliable, 
complies with applicable laws and 
regulations, and is distributed both 
internally and externally in a timely manner. 
A review of the consolidation and financial 
statements is undertaken by senior 
management to ensure that the financial 
position and results of the Group are 
appropriately reflected. All financial 
information published by the Group is 
subject to the approval of the Audit 
Committee prior to it being approved 
by the Board.
Risk Management
Members of the Group Executive 
Committee meet with each business unit 
periodically to challenge and debate the 
assessment of risk within each business 
unit, who then submit local risk registers 
for analysis and ranking together with 
Company-wide risks to form a robust 
corporate risk register. This corporate risk 
register is presented to the Audit Committee 
at least twice each year. Actions arising 
from the Audit Committee’s review of the 
corporate risk register are fed back to the 
business units for their management.
Fraud
The Group’s Ethics Policy has been 
communicated to all employees and states 
that all employees have a responsibility 
for fraud prevention and detection. 
Any suspicion of fraud will be reported 
immediately and investigated vigorously.
External audit
The Committee is responsible for 
overseeing the Company’s relations 
with the external auditor.
The Committee places great importance 
on ensuring that high standards of quality 
and effectiveness are maintained within 
the external audit process. It considers a 
number of areas in relation to the external 
auditor: their performance in discharging 
the audit and interim review of financial 
statements, their independence and 
objectivity, and their re-appointment 
and remuneration.
Auditor appointment
Each year the Committee assesses and 
reports to the Board on the qualification, 
expertise and resources, and 
independence of the external auditor 
and the effectiveness of the audit process, 
with a recommendation on whether to 
propose to the shareholders that the 
external auditor be re-appointed.
The Committee notes and confirms 
compliance with the Competition 
and Markets Authority Order 2014 
(“CMA Order”) in respect of statutory 
audit services for large companies.
Following the recommendation of the 
Board, EY was appointed (as predecessor 
firm Lindsay, Jamieson & Haldane) by the 
Company at its Annual General Meeting 
on 9 May 1950 to audit the financial 
statements of the Company for the period 
ending 31 December 1949 and subsequent 
financial periods. EY’s total uninterrupted 
period of engagement, covering the period 
from appointment to the period currently 
under review, is 68 years.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
72 The Committee reviewed and appropriately 
challenged the basis for these before 
agreeing the proposed approach and the 
scope of the external audit was identified.
As part of the review, the external auditor 
was questioned and challenged by the 
Committee about the work undertaken, 
its findings and what key assumptions 
had been made during the audit, especially 
with regard to the key areas of audit 
risk identified.
Auditor independence
The Committee assesses the independence 
and objectivity of the external auditor 
annually, taking into consideration relevant 
UK law, regulation, the FRC Revised 
Ethical Standard and other professional 
requirements. EY has provided a letter 
confirming its belief that it remained 
independent throughout 2017 and has 
discussed with the Committee the threats 
to its independence and the safeguards 
applied to mitigate those threats.
As part of this review, the Committee 
examined in particular:
• a report from the external auditor 
describing its arrangements to identify, 
report and manage any conflicts of 
interest; and
• the extent of non-audit services 
provided by the external auditor.
The Committee is aware that the 
transitional provisions of the CMA Order 
and the EU Audit Regulations (which 
became effective on 17 June 2016) will 
require the Company to change its external 
auditor no later than 2021. The Committee 
further affirms that its current intention is 
to change the external auditor no later 
than the expiry of the five-year term of the 
external audit partner (ie by 2021) and that 
on that basis, a competitive tender process 
will commence for the new auditor’s term to 
begin in 2021.
The Committee will continue to monitor 
legislative developments and will continue 
to review its conclusions on an annual basis, 
however it believes it is appropriate to 
recommend the re-appointment of the 
incumbent external auditor at the 2018 AGM.
There are no contractual obligations in 
existence that restrict the Company’s 
choice of auditor.
Auditor effectiveness
The Committee assesses the effectiveness 
of the audit process on an ongoing basis, 
with particular attention to the mindset and 
culture, skills, character and knowledge, 
quality control and judgement of the external 
auditor in their handling of key judgements, 
responsiveness to the Committee and in 
their commentary where appropriate on 
the systems of internal control.
The Committee holds regular private 
meetings with the external auditor to 
assist with their assessment, including 
discussion of:
• how the auditor has identified and 
addressed potential risks to audit quality;
• the controls in place within the audit firm 
to identify risks to audit quality, including 
the results of internal and external 
inspections of the audit team and firm;
• whether the auditor has met the agreed 
audit plan, in particular how it has 
responded to any changes that have 
been required during the process;
• feedback from the key people involved

Policy on non-audit services
The Committee is responsible for 
approving non-audit services, with the 
objective of ensuring that the provision 
of such services by the external auditor 
does not impair its independence or 
objectivity. Taking into account relevant 
ethical guidance, the Committee’s policy 
precludes a number of non-audit services, 
including those relating to the accounting 
records and financial statements, internal 
audit, IT consulting, legal and investment 
services and other services deemed by 
regulators to be precluded. The Committee 
accepts that certain work of a non-audit 
nature may be best undertaken by the 
external auditor. The policy is reviewed 
annually and financial limits for the 
provision of non-audit services, including 
audit-related fees and other fees, are set 
on the same annual basis (2017 $0.3 million 
(2016 $0.6 million)) and were one-third 
of the Group’s Audit fee of $0.9 million 
(2016 $0.9 million). In accordance with 
the Revised Ethical Standard issued by 
the FRC in June 2016, the lead audit 
engagement partner is required to notify 
the Audit Committee Chairman in advance 
for pre-approval of any proposed non-audit 
services. The Committee can confirm that 
no such non-audit services were provided 
by EY during the period under review 
(2016 $0.1 million).
In response to the introduction of further 
measures under the EU Audit Reform 
Directive, the Committee reviewed its 
policy regarding the provision of non-audit 
services. Tax-related services previously 
provided by the external auditor were 
re-tendered and, as a result of that 
process, these services are now provided 
by Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte”). The Committee 
is satisfied that Deloitte is independent, 
thoughtful and challenging; fees paid 
to Deloitte during the period totalled 
$0.1 million (2016 $0.1 million) based 
on time and materials.

Report on Directors’ Remuneration
We will seek to bring our executive 
reward model into alignment with  
the evolving expectations of investors.
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present our Report on 
Directors’ remuneration for the year ended 
31 December 2017. This Report has been 
prepared on behalf of the Board by the 
Committee and has been approved by 
the Board.
Investor expectations and the 
Committee’s approach to remuneration
I took on the Chairmanship of the 
Committee after the AGM in May 2017. 
There has been considerable change in 
the recent past in investor expectations 
both in terms of the breadth and depth of 
disclosures related to remuneration and 
to the structure of long term incentives. 
Although a clear direction of travel has 
been established with respect to certain 
matters, there is not yet alignment across 
all those with investments in Spirent on 
the preferred model of executive reward.
The Committee last presented its 
Remuneration Policy for approval at 
the 2016 AGM, with 96.7 per cent of 
shareholders voting in its favour. The 
advisory vote on the Remuneration Report 
at the 2017 AGM resulted in a vote in 
favour of 79.27 per cent. Accordingly, the 
Company was added to the Investment 
Association’s list of those companies who 
had received more than a 20 per cent vote 
against their remuneration reports. For 
Spirent, the vote against reflected what 
are currently irreconcilable differences 
in views between certain significant 
investors. While the Committee is keen to 
respond to shareholder views, there is also 
recognition that a balance needs to be 
struck where there are disparate views 
amongst our major investors.
Against that background, the Committee 
is striving to respond to the increasing 
requests for transparency on the breadth 
and depth of our disclosures and we 
believe this Remuneration Report 
achieves that goal. 
During 2018 the Committee will undertake 
a full review of Spirent’s remuneration 
policy in preparation for seeking 
shareholder approval of a revised policy at 
the 2019 AGM. Where we believe it is in the 
best interests of the Company, we will seek 
to bring our executive reward model into 
alignment with the evolving expectations 
of investors, for example with regard to the 
deferral of bonuses and the introduction 
of post-vesting holding periods for the 
Long-term Incentive Plan.
Committee’s activities in 2017
In 2017 the Committee focused on:
• Reviewing the fees for the new 
Chairman of the Board;
• Reviewing the base salary of the 
Executive Directors;
• Reviewing metrics and setting 
targets for annual cash incentives;
• Reviewing metrics and targets for 
long term incentives;
• Monitoring the changing landscape 
of investor expectations with regard 
to remuneration; and
• Consulting with shareholders on 
remuneration proposals for 2018.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
74 Variable Remuneration for 2017
Cash incentives in 2017 were based on 
achievement of targets for profitability, 
revenue and personal and strategic 
objectives. Details of achievements against 
targets can be found on page 78; this 
reflected a very good profit performance 
in the period, the achievement of a good 
proportion of personal and strategic 
objectives and reasonable performance 
against the revenue targets for the period.
Long-term incentives that were due to 
vest during 2017 failed to reach threshold 
for earnings per share or total shareholder 
return performance conditions, and 
therefore lapsed.
Shareholder engagement
At the end of 2017 I wrote to a number of 
our major shareholders explaining our 
proposed approach to base salary, cash 
incentive and long-term incentive awards 
for 2018 and sought their views. We did not 
propose material changes to the approach 
taken in 2017. The Committee and I believe 
that the metrics we will measure our 
executive directors against are appropriate, 
the targets challenging, and that reward is 
strongly linked to corporate performance 
for the benefit of Spirent and its 
shareholders. The Committee remains 
committed to engaging in regular, 
meaningful dialogue with shareholders 
and, where appropriate, investor 
representative bodies.
Remuneration in 2018
Base salaries of Executive directors 
were increased by three per cent over 
the prior year. This reflected the general 
increase awarded to the larger employee 
population. It should be noted that for 
the CEO, no increase in base salary had 
been made since his appointment in 2013.
For the annual cash incentive, on-target 
opportunities for the CEO and CFO will be 
reduced to 90 per cent of base salary and 
60 per cent of base salary respectively. 
As explained on page 76, the metrics used 
to determine any payout will be revenue 
(30 per cent), adjusted operating profit 
(50 per cent) and strategic and operational 
priorities (20 per cent). Although the 
financial metrics have not changed from 
2017, the weightings have been adjusted 
as we seek to increase the proportion 
of the incentive related to revenue and 
growth in the top line. The Committee 
believe the targets set are challenging 
and appropriate. In 2018, the Executive 
directors will, in addition to meeting what 
the Board believe are key operational 
priorities to drive the performance of the 
business, also need to deliver demanding 
profitability targets and restore the 
business to significant top line growth 
to achieve significant payouts in 2018.
Long-term incentive awards in 2018 will be 
at the same level as in 2017. The Committee 
has retained the earnings per share (“EPS”) 
and Absolute Total Shareholder Return 
(“TSR”) metrics and weightings at 50 per 
cent. The EPS targets reflect significant 
growth in the EPS of the company over the 
performance period; threshold vesting 
requires high single digit growth over the 
2017 outcome, with vesting at the upper 
end of the range requiring a significant 
outperformance of current consensus 
forecasts. The Committee acknowledges 
that the use of an Absolute TSR measure 
is relatively unusual, but we continue to 
be of the view that due to the limited 
number of true comparator companies, 
it remains an appropriate metric and 
retains the advantage of providing 
alignment with shareholders.
Finally, I would like to give my thanks to Tom 
Maxwell who chaired the Committee with 
distinction for the last seven years prior to 
my taking up the post. I would like to thank 
him for his valuable contribution to the 
Company and the work of the Committee.
I hope you find this Report clear and 
informative. I will be available at the 2018 
AGM to respond to any questions that 
shareholders may have with respect to 
the work of the Committee.

Strategic Report      Corporate Governance Financial Statements Other Information During 2017, fees for the non-executive directors were reviewed with effect from 1 January 2018. Having been frozen since 1 January 
2008, it was determined that the basic annual fee for non-executive directors should increase to £50,000 per annum for 2018 (2017 
£40,000). Fees for the Chairman, which are determined by the Remuneration Committee, will remain at £160,000 per annum for 2018, 
having been frozen since 1 January 2009. The Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees each receive additional fees of 
£11,000 and £9,000 per annum respectively in recognition of the increased time commitment of these roles (2017 £11,000 and £9,000 
respectively). During the period under review, the person who filled the role of Senior Independent Director was entitled to receive an 
additional fee of £7,500 per annum in recognition of the increased time commitment associated with the role but chose to waive the 
additional fee during the period under review.
Fees for non-executive directors and the Chairman will be reviewed again in 2020 for the period from 1 January 2021.

Notes
An explanation of each share plan and its operation is given in note 30 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group.
1.  Key to share plan and type of award: 
EIP PS – 2005 Employee Incentive Plan Performance Shares awarded as conditional share awards. 
LTIP PS – 2016 Long-term Incentive Plan Performance Shares awarded as conditional share awards.
2. The market price on date of grant is the price of an Ordinary Share at the close of business on the day before the date of grant.
3. There is no exercise price payable for a Performance Share upon vesting.
4. Awards which have passed the date first exercisable have vested and are unfettered, having passed the relevant performance conditions.
5. The performance conditions for this award are based on (i) an EPS growth target based on performance reported for 31 December 2017 and (ii) a TSR growth 
target based on the Company share price averaged over a 90 day period immediately prior to the announcement of the 2017 Full Year results. Full Year results 
for 2017 and EPS performance to 31 December 2017 will be reported on 8 March 2018, not 5 March 2018 as previously anticipated and therefore the 
performance condition testing date for this award has been updated accordingly.
6. The awards of EIP Performance Shares granted on 28 April 2014 were due to vest on 28 April 2017. However, after the testing of performance conditions 
attached to these awards the Remuneration Committee confirmed that the performance condition thresholds (15 per cent growth in EPS and 25 per cent 
growth in Absolute TSR) had not been met, resulting in the lapsing of the awards in full.

In determining TSR growth for the Company, share prices will be averaged over 90 day periods immediately prior to the announcement 
of the 2016 Full Year results on 2 March 2017 (91.92 pence) and the 2019 Full Year results.
Share incentive interests vesting during 2018
Ms Bell’s award which is due now to vest on 23 March 2018 is subject to an EPS performance condition and a TSR performance 
condition. The EPS condition has passed the growth threshold required for partial vesting, but has not achieved the growth required 
for full vesting. The TSR condition will be tested after the conclusion of the performance period.
Mr Hutchinson’s award which is due to vest on 18 May 2018 is subject to an EPS performance condition and a TSR performance 
condition. The EPS condition has passed the growth threshold required for partial vesting, but has not achieved the growth required 
for full vesting. The TSR condition will be tested after the conclusion of the performance period.
No new shares were issued during the year, with all exercises of share incentives being satisfied by the transfer of shares held by 
the Company’s Employee Share Ownership Trust (“ESOT”). At the date of this Report, the ESOT holds 0.6 million Ordinary Shares 
for the purpose of satisfying the exercises of current and future awards by employees and former employees of the Group.
Dilution
Overall shareholder dilution resulting from the Company’s share incentive plans (on a rolling ten-year basis) has fallen by 1.4 per cent 
when comparing the positions at 31 December 2017 (5.1 per cent) and 31 December 2016 (6.5 per cent). The overall number of share 
incentives outstanding has decreased by 0.6 million during the year to 10.0 million at 31 December 2017 (2016 10.6 million).

At its Annual General Meeting on 3 May 2017, Spirent Communications plc received a significant shareholder vote against the 
resolution seeking shareholder approval of the Company’s 2016 Report on directors’ remuneration, equating to 20.73% of the total 
voting rights in the Company. As required, the Company noted the votes against in its announcement of the Annual General Meeting 
results released on 3 May 2017.
The 20.73% of votes against largely reflected the views of two investors, representing 11.18% (“Investor A”) and 9.42% (“Investor B”) 
of total votes cast respectively.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
85
Strategic Report      Corporate Governance Financial Statements Other Information Investor A (11.18% of total votes cast on the resolution)
The Company’s Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) has engaged with Investor A since the Annual General Meeting,  
and has been given two reasons for their vote against:
(i)  Investor A’s primary concern is that it does not consider the Company’s long-term incentive plan as currently designed to be 
sufficiently generous to incentivise management.
While the Committee understands Investor A’s perspective, it believes it would be difficult to reconcile this with the views of other 
institutional investors. The use of long-term incentive plans will continue to be reviewed by the Committee on an ongoing basis.
(ii)  Investor A considered the buy-out awards and relocation package granted to the CFO on appointment in September 2016 to be 
unreasonable in magnitude.
As stated in the 2016 Report on directors’ remuneration, the Committee sought to reassure shareholders that, even including the 
buy-out awards granted to the CFO, the maximum level of variable pay awarded was in accordance with the Remuneration Policy 
and represented only a proportion of the actual value of the awards forfeited by the CFO upon her appointment to Spirent.
We continue an active dialogue with our shareholders on a wide range of issues and seek to strike a balance between the differing 
views amongst our investor base.
Investor B (9.42% of total votes cast on the resolution)
Investor B has a policy of voting against all remuneration reports where vesting of long-term incentive plans is not based on a minimum 
period of five years or three years plus a two-year holding period post-vesting.
The Committee will continue to keep under review and consider the views of shareholders on the issue of holding periods post vesting 
of LTIP awards.
Remuneration Committee
Responsibilities
The Remuneration Committee is responsible to the Board for determining:
• remuneration policy for the executive directors and Chairman taking into account remuneration trends across the Company;
• specific terms and conditions of employment of each individual executive director;
• overall policy for remuneration for the executive directors’ direct reports;
• design and monitoring of the operation of any Company share incentive plans;
• setting stretching incentive targets to encourage enhanced performance;
• determining an approach that rewards fairly and responsibly contribution to the Company’s long-term success; and
• other provisions of the executive directors’ service agreements and ensuring that contractual terms on termination, and 
payments made, are fair to the individual and the Company and that failure is not rewarded and loss is mitigated.
The Committee’s remit is set out in detail in its terms of reference, which are reviewed regularly and were approved in March 2017. 
They are available on the Company’s website at https://corporate.spirent.com.
Composition of the Committee
At the date of this Report, the Remuneration Committee comprises four independent non-executive directors, one of whom acts 
as Committee Chairman. The Company Secretary serves as Secretary to the Committee. All members are considered independent 
within the meaning of the 2016 UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”).

86 Advisers to the Committee
During the period under review the Committee consulted with the Company’s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer 
and the Company Secretary & General Counsel but not on matters relating to their own remuneration.
Deloitte LLP was appointed by the Committee in 2015 to undertake a market review of executive remuneration practices and assist 
with the design and introduction of a new long-term incentive plan. The Committee is satisfied that Deloitte LLP is independent, 
thoughtful and challenging. Deloitte LLP is also a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and complies with its 
voluntary Code of Conduct in respect of the provision of remuneration consulting services, details of which can be found at  
www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. The Committee considers Deloitte LLP to be independent in its approach.
The fees paid to Deloitte LLP to carry out work for the Remuneration Committee during the period under review totalled £25,380 
(2016 £65,880) and were based on time and materials.
Kepler Associates Limited, who were acquired in June 2015 by Mercer Limited, were appointed by the Committee some years ago to 
provide the results of TSR testing to determine the vesting of share incentives. The Committee has retained Mercer Limited in this role 
because it values the robust data provided and continuity of advice from the consultants involved. The Committee is satisfied that 
Mercer Limited is independent, thoughtful and challenging. Mercer Limited is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and 
complies with its voluntary Code of Conduct in respect of the provision of remuneration consulting services, details of which can be 
found at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com and has no other connection to the Company. The Committee considers Mercer 
Limited to be independent in its approach.
The fees paid to Mercer Limited to carry out work for the Remuneration Committee during the period under review totalled £11,325 
(2016 £7,260) and were based on time and materials.
Directors’ Remuneration Policy (unaudited)
This section sets out the Remuneration Policy for executive and non-executive directors. This Remuneration Policy was subject 
to a binding vote at the 2016 AGM on 4 May 2016 and, having received 96.7% of all votes cast in favour, became effective on  
5 May 2016. The full policy as approved by shareholders has been included below for ease of reference, however the illustration 
of application of policy has been updated for 2018. The Policy will be put to shareholders again no later than the 2019 AGM.
The most significant change from the policy approved at the Company’s 2014 AGM was the introduction of the new Spirent Long-term 
Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”).
The Company’s previous Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the Company’s 2014 AGM held on 23 April 2014 with 
99.02 per cent of all votes cast in favour and it had a binding effect on the Company from 24 April 2014.
Components of executive director remuneration
The Committee’s policy is to set remuneration levels which ensure that executive directors are fairly and responsibly rewarded 
in return for high levels of performance. The remuneration policy set by the Committee aims to promote value creation through 
transparent alignment with the agreed corporate strategy, supporting performance and encouraging the underlying sustainable 
financial health of the business while promoting sound risk management for the benefit of all stakeholders. The Committee 
believes that the aims of the policy are achieved by ensuring that a significant proportion of executive remuneration is tied to 
the achievement of the agreed corporate strategy and long-term value creation.

Performance conditions for awards under the Spirent Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
The Committee reviews the appropriateness of performance parameters for each award under the LTIP and sets stretching 
performance conditions in the light of the Company’s current and expected performance over the performance cycle.
2018 Policy on share incentive awards
The Committee expects to approve awards of Performance Shares to the CEO and CFO equivalent to 150 per cent and 100 per cent 
of annual base salary respectively.
Approach to recruitment remuneration
In the event that the Company recruits a new executive director (either from within the organisation or externally), when determining 
the appropriate remuneration arrangements, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors, (including but not limited 
to quantum, the type of remuneration being offered and the jurisdiction which the candidate was recruited from) to ensure that 
arrangements are in the best interests of both shareholders and the Company without paying more than is necessary to recruit an 
executive of the required calibre.
The Committee would generally seek to align the remuneration package offered with our Remuneration Policy outlined in the table 
above. However, the Committee retains discretion to make proposals on hiring a new executive director which are outside the 
standard Policy. In the first year of appointment, the Committee may offer additional remuneration arrangements that it considers 
appropriate and necessary to recruit and retain the individual. Such remuneration may be in the form of cash or share-based awards 
which may vest immediately or at a future point in time. Vesting may be subject to performance conditions selected by the Committee.
The Committee may make awards on appointing an executive director to “buy-out” remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a 
previous employer on a like-for-like basis. In doing so the Committee will take account of relevant factors, including any performance 
conditions attached to those awards, the form in which they were granted and the time over which they would have vested.
In the event of recruitment, the Committee may also grant an award to a new executive under Listing Rule 9.4.2 which allows for the 
granting of awards, specifically to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment or retention of an executive director, without 
seeking prior shareholder approval.
The maximum level of variable pay which may be awarded to new executive directors would normally be in line with the maximum level 
of variable pay set out in the policy table above but in any event would be limited to 400 per cent of base salary, excluding any buy-out 
awards. Any additional cash or share-based awards on recruitment of an executive director which may fall outside the policy statement 
would be performance-related and would therefore be regarded as variable remuneration and fall within the Company’s standard 
400 per cent cap.
For an internal appointment, any remuneration terms awarded in respect of the previous role may either continue on its original terms 
or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment.
When recruiting non-executive directors, the remuneration arrangements offered would normally be in line with those paid to existing 
non-executive directors, details of which are set out in the Annual report on remuneration.
Service contracts
Executive Directors
In normal circumstances, it is the Company’s Policy that service contracts for executive directors have no fixed term and are capable of 
termination on no more than 12 months’ notice from either the Company or the executive director. It is intended that this Policy would 
also apply to new appointments of executive directors.
Both Eric Hutchinson and Paula Bell currently have a service agreement with Spirent Communications plc, and, being UK residents, 
both their contracts are in line with UK employment practice and are governed by the laws of England and Wales. Eric Hutchinson’s 
service agreement dated 8 December 2014 may be terminated on 12 months’ notice from the Company and six months’ notice from 
Mr Hutchinson. Paula Bell’s service agreement, dated 12 April 2016 may be terminated on 12 months’ notice from the Company and 
six months’ notice from Ms Bell.
The Company recognises that its executive directors may, from time to time, be invited to become non-executive directors of other 
companies and that such appointments can broaden their knowledge and experience, to the benefit of the Company. Details of any 
such appointments are set out in the Annual report on remuneration.
The service agreements of executive directors are available for inspection on request and will be available for inspection at the 2018 AGM.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
90 Non-executive Directors
All non-executive directors have a letter of appointment with the Company for a period of not more than three years, subject to the 
Company’s Articles of Association. However, since 2011 and in accordance with the Code, all directors who are not stepping down 
from the Board will stand for re-election at each AGM.
The letters of appointment of non-executive directors are available for inspection on request and will be available for inspection  
at the 2018 AGM. An example of a letter of appointment for a non-executive director is available on the Company’s website at  
https://corporate.spirent.com.
Remuneration policy for Non-executive Directors
The Board aims to recruit high calibre non-executive directors, with broad commercial, international or other relevant experience.
The Company’s Remuneration Policy with regard to fees for non-executive directors, including the Chairman, is to pay fees which  
are in line with market practice for companies of a similar size and complexity. Individual fees reflect responsibility and commitment. 
Additional fees may be paid for further responsibilities, such as chairmanship of committees.
Non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in cash incentive or share incentive arrangements and their service does not 
qualify for pension. No element of their fee is performance-related. Travel and other reasonable expenses (including fees incurred in 
obtaining professional advice in the furtherance of their duties and any associated taxes) incurred in the course of performing their 
duties may be paid by the Company or reimbursed to non-executive directors.
When recruiting non-executive directors, the remuneration arrangements offered will generally be in line with those set out above.
Exit payment policy
The Committee is committed to ensuring that it does not pay more than is necessary when executives leave Spirent and its policy on 
exit payments is and will continue to be in line with market practice in the country in which the executive director resides. The current 
exit payment policy is:
• Service contracts contain provisions for the removal of the director without compensation for not performing their duties to the 
standard required by the Board or material misconduct
• Payment in lieu of notice may be paid under service contracts if the relevant notice period is not given to the director or if, having 
received notice from the director, the employer does not wish him/her to serve it
• Unless provided for in the service contract, the Company would seek to apply practical mitigation measures to any payment of 
compensation on termination, for example by reducing payments to reflect payments received in respect of alternative employment, 
taking into account all relevant circumstances
• Service contracts do not contain provision for additional compensation on termination following a change of control (as detailed in 
the Change of Control provisions set out in the Report of the directors on page 95)
• Service contracts do not contain provision for liquidated damages of any kind
• Service contracts contain appropriate provisions to protect the legitimate interests of the Company with respect to preventing any 
terminated director from working in a business which competes against the Company
• Incentives:
 – Cash incentives: Unless otherwise provided in the service contract to be consistent with market practice in the country in which 
the executive resides, executives are not entitled to accrued cash incentives payable following termination unless the individual 
is determined by the Committee to be a good leaver (defined as an individual leaving employment due to redundancy, ill-health, 
injury or disability, retirement, death, the individual’s employing company ceasing to be under the control of the Group, or a 
transfer of the undertaking in which the individual works (“Good Leaver”));
 – Spirent Long-term Incentive Plan: Leaver provisions were approved by shareholders when they approved the LTIP in 2016. 
Unvested awards will generally lapse at the time of exit. For individuals determined by the Committee to be a Good Leaver, the 
Committee has discretion to either (i) assess performance conditions at the point of exit by testing the performance conditions 
up to the date of exit for TSR performance and to the end of the most recent financial period for EPS performance, or (ii) assess 
performance conditions at the end of the applicable vesting period or such earlier date as may be appropriate. Any shares 
which vest would then normally be pro-rated to reflect the proportion of the vesting period actually served by the individual;
 – Employee Incentive Plan (EIP): Leaver provisions were approved by shareholders when they approved the EIP in 2005 and 
2015. Unvested awards generally lapse at the time of exit. For individuals determined by the Committee to be a Good Leaver, 
performance conditions are assessed by the Committee at the point of exit by testing the performance conditions up to the date 
of exit for TSR performance and to the end of the most recent financial period for EPS performance. Vesting is then pro-rated for 
the proportion of the performance period actually served and the individual has 12 months following the date of termination of 
employment in which to exercise them.

Strategic Report      Corporate Governance Financial Statements Other Information Consideration of employee remuneration arrangements elsewhere in the Group
When setting the policy for directors’ remuneration, the Committee has regard to the pay and employment conditions elsewhere within 
the Group, particularly in the jurisdictions in which the executive directors are based. The Committee is kept informed on a regular 
basis of salary increases for the general employee population and takes these into account when determining salary increases for 
executive directors. An increase in base salary of three per cent has been awarded for the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer for 2018, reflecting the general increase awarded to the larger employee population.
The Committee is aware of the FRC’s consultation on changes to the Corporate Governance Code and its proposals for increasing 
engagement with stakeholders including employees. While the Committee does not currently consult directly with employees as part 
of the process of reviewing executive pay, the Committee does take into account views expressed through employee surveys and will 
look to enhance this engagement in line with future Code requirements when finalised.
Consideration of the views of shareholders in setting Remuneration Policy
The Committee is mindful of the views of shareholders in determining appropriate levels of remuneration and in ensuring that 
shareholder and director interests are aligned. The Committee is committed to an ongoing dialogue with shareholders and seeks 
shareholder views when any significant changes are proposed to remuneration arrangements. The Committee consulted with major 
shareholders and shareholder representatives in January 2016 regarding the introduction of the new LTIP and again in December 2017 
regarding the Committee’s approach to base salary, cash incentives and LTIP awards in 2018.
Legacy matters
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Remuneration Policy, authority is given to the Company to make payments and honour 
any commitments entered into with current or former directors (such as the payment of pension or the unwinding of legacy share 
schemes) where the terms were agreed either prior to 24 April 2014 (the effective date of the first directors’ remuneration policy)  
or at a time when a previous remuneration policy was in force. Details of any payments will be set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration as they arise.
Illustrations of the application of Remuneration Policy in 2018
The following charts show an illustration of the proportion of total remuneration made up of each component of the Remuneration 
Policy and the value of each component.
Three scenarios have been illustrated for each executive director:
Minimum performance • Fixed remuneration (salary, benefits and retirement benefits)
• No payment under the Annual Cash Incentive
• No vesting under the Spirent Long-term Incentive Plan
On-target performance • Fixed remuneration (salary, benefits and retirement benefits)
• On-target payment under the Annual Cash Incentive (two-thirds of maximum)
• 25 per cent vesting under the Spirent Long-term Incentive Plan
Maximum performance • Fixed remuneration (salary, benefits and retirement benefits)
• Maximum payment under the Annual Cash Incentive
• Full vesting under the Spirent Long-term Incentive Plan

Dilution
The Committee is strongly committed to managing shareholder dilution in a responsible manner. Details of the Company’s dilution is 
set out in the Annual report on remuneration on page 83.
Committee discretion
The Committee has powers delegated by the Board under which it operates. In addition, it complies with rules which have either been 
approved by shareholders (the long-term incentive plans) or previously by the Committee (annual cash incentives). These rules provide 
the Committee with certain discretions which serve to ensure that the implementation of the Remuneration Policy is fair both to the 
individual director and to shareholders, taking overall performance and the position of the Company into account. The Committee also 
has discretions to set components of remuneration within a range from time to time. The extent of such discretions are set out in the 
relevant rules or in the maximum opportunity and performance metrics sections of the Policy Table.
The Committee may make adjustments to awards to reflect corporate events, such as a change in the Company’s capital structure. 
The Committee may adjust the calibration of performance measures and vesting outcomes, or substitute or amend any vesting 
condition (eg due to a significant acquisition or disposal) provided that the resulting condition is appropriate.
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Remuneration Policy to aid its operation or implementation without seeking 
shareholder approvals (eg for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes).
In addition, the Committee requires discretion to deal with genuinely exceptional or unforeseen circumstances. This form of discretion 
will only be applied in the best interests of the Company and when, in the view of the Committee, it would be disproportionate to 
seek specific approval from shareholders in general meeting. It is intended that this discretion be used only in the event of changed 
circumstances or strategy that has not been provided for in the Remuneration Policy.
The Remuneration Committee will not exercise discretion to reward failure and will report on any exercise of discretion that changes 
the amount of remuneration paid in any year.
The Remuneration Committee can confirm that no discretion was used either during the period or to the date of this Report and in 
particular that it does not envisage any cash payment being offered which could be construed as a “golden hello”.

Share capital
The Company has a single class of share which is divided into Ordinary Shares of 3⅓ pence each. Each Ordinary Share carries one 
vote and all of the Ordinary Shares rank pari passu. There are no special control rights relating to any of the Ordinary Shares. At the 
date of this Report, 611.7 million Ordinary Shares of 3⅓ pence each had been issued which are fully paid up and are listed on the 
London Stock Exchange. The Company also operates a Level 1 American Depositary Receipt (“ADR”) programme with each ADR 
representing four Ordinary Shares. The ADRs trade on the US over-the-counter market and BNY Mellon is the authorised depositary 
bank for the programme. Further details on share capital are set out in note 29 to the consolidated financial statements and note 15 
to the parent Company financial statements. The rights, including those relating to voting, obligations and any restrictions on transfer 
relating to the Company’s Ordinary Shares, as well as the powers of the Company’s directors, are set out in the Company’s Articles 
of Association, a copy of which can be found on our website at https://corporate.spirent.com/ or can be obtained from Companies 
House or by writing to the Company Secretary. The Company’s Articles of Association may only be amended by a special resolution 
at a general meeting of shareholders. The most recent changes to the Articles of Association were approved at the 2010 AGM and 
became effective at the close of that meeting on 5 May 2010.
The Company has established two employee benefit trusts in connection with the operation of the Company’s share incentive plans: 
the Spirent Employee Share Ownership Trust (“ESOT”) and the Spirent Sharesave Trust (“SST”). The trustees of both trusts have waived 
their right to receive dividends on any Ordinary Shares held by them except for a nominal amount of 1 pence other than for those 
Ordinary Shares held in the ESOT which are the beneficial property of an employee/shareholder. For further details on the employee 
benefit trusts see “Investment in own Ordinary Shares” in note 29 to the consolidated financial statements and note 15 to the parent 
Company financial statements. Trustees of both trusts do not vote their Ordinary Shares, except for those Ordinary Shares held in the 
ESOT that are the beneficial property of an employee/shareholder, which the trustees will vote in accordance with the instructions 
received from the beneficial owner.
Restrictions on share transfers
There are no restrictions on the transfer of Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company other than certain restrictions which 
may from time to time be imposed by law, for example insider trading law. In accordance with the Market Abuse Regulation, 
certain employees are required to seek the approval of the Company prior to dealing in its securities.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or 
on voting rights. The Company is also not aware of any contract of significance between itself or any subsidiary undertaking and a 
controlling shareholder.
Powers for issue of new shares
During the year to 31 December 2017 and to the date of this Report, no new Ordinary Shares have been allotted as a result of the 
exercise of options and rights pursuant to the Company’s share incentive plans.
At each AGM, the directors seek authority to allot shares for cash and to disapply pre-emption rights within prescribed limits. At the 
2018 AGM, authority will be sought to allot new Ordinary Shares up to a nominal value of £6,797,132, which is equal to approximately 
33.3 per cent of the Company’s issued share capital as at 9 March 2018.
Return of capital
The Company was first authorised to repurchase up to 14.99 per cent of its own issued Ordinary Shares, within certain limits and as 
permitted by the Company’s Articles of Association, at the 2006 AGM.
This authority has been renewed at each subsequent AGM, reducing to 9.99 per cent at the 2010 AGM and subsequent AGMs. 
The authority from the 2017 AGM remains valid until the earlier of the 2018 AGM or 30 June 2018. Since the Company began returning 
capital to shareholders in May 2006, a total of £270.2 million has been returned, through the repurchase of 397.6 million Ordinary Shares.
No shares were repurchased during 2017 or to the date of this Report.
The Company will seek authority to repurchase up to 9.99 per cent of its own Ordinary Shares at the 2018 AGM to facilitate any further 
return of capital if the Board concludes that it is in the best interests of shareholders to do so.
Political donations
In accordance with the Group’s Ethics Policy, no political donations were made during the year (2016 nil).

96 Financial risk management
Details of the Group’s use of financial instruments, together with information on our risk objectives and policies and our exposure 
to price, credit, liquidity, cash flow and interest rate risks, can be found in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements.
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries and taking into account the matters set out in the Principal risks and uncertainties section on pages  
28 to 31 of this Annual Report, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis when preparing the financial statements.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2016 Code, the directors have assessed the prospects of the Company over a period 
significantly longer than 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. The Board has concluded that the most 
appropriate period for this assessment should be three years.
This period was selected for the following reasons:
• the Group’s strategic planning cycle covers a three-year period;
• the Board reviews a three-year financial corporate plan; and
• when considering a major investment in product development, three years is considered by the Board to be a reasonable time 
horizon in which the product should achieve meaningful sales.
The Board’s assessment has been made with reference to the Company’s current position and prospects, the Group’s strategy, 
the Board’s risk appetite and the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties as set out on pages 28 to 31 of this Annual Report.
The plans and cash flow projections used as the basis for the assessment were the 2018 budget and the three-year strategic plan. 
They were drawn up on the basis that the Group maintains a cash balance sufficient to fund normal operations and that there will be 
no material changes to the business structure over the review period. 
The Board has reviewed plausible and severe stress tests based on the occurrence of a mix of the principal risks to which the Company is 
exposed, considering the potential impact of these risks on the business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity over the period.
Based on this assessment and the expected successful impact of mitigating actions, the directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period.
Post balance sheet events
No post balance sheet events are required to be disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.
Disclosure of information to Auditor 
Each of the directors of the Company at the date of this Report confirms that:
• so far as the director is aware, there is no information needed by the Company’s auditor in connection with preparing their Report 
of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
• he (she) has taken all the steps that he (she) ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself (herself) aware of any 
information needed by the Company’s auditor in connection with preparing their Report and to establish that the Company’s auditor 
is aware of that information.
Independent Auditor
As described in more detail on page 73 of the Audit Committee report, the Board will be proposing a resolution to re-appoint EY as 
auditor at the 2018 AGM.
Annual General Meeting
The 2018 AGM will be held at 10.30am on Wednesday 2 May 2018 at the offices of FTI Consulting, 200 Aldersgate, Aldersgate Street, 
London EC1A 4HD.

Directors’ responsibilities statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Report on directors’ remuneration, the consolidated financial 
statements of the Group and the financial statements of the parent Company.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they are required to prepare 
the consolidated financial statements of the Group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the European Union (EU) and have elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK Generally 
Accepted Accounting Principles (including FRS 101) and applicable law.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group are required by law and IFRS to present fairly for each financial period the financial 
position and performance of the Group; the Companies Act 2006 provides, in relation to such financial statements, that references in 
the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
The parent Company financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the parent Company.
In preparing each of the consolidated financial statements of the Group and parent Company financial statements, the directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state for the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted by the EU;
• state for the parent Company financial statements whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the parent Company financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume the Group and the parent Company 
will continue in operational business for the foreseeable future.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and the parent Company 
and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, for the Group, Article 4 of the 
International Accounting Standards (IAS) Regulation. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a strategic report, a directors’ report, a 
directors’ remuneration report and a statement on corporate governance that comply with the law and those regulations. They are 
also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors consider that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
This Annual Report complies with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTR) of the Financial Conduct Authority in respect of the 
requirement to produce an annual financial report.
The Annual Report and consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of, and have been approved by, the directors.
Each of the directors confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the consolidated financial statements of the Group and parent Company financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and the profit or loss of 
the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the Annual Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and

for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements of Spirent Communications plc which comprise:

Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our 
report below. We are independent of the Group and Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant 
to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, 
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the Annual Report, in relation to which the ISAs(UK) require us to 
report to you whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to:
• the disclosures in the Annual Report set out on page 28 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being managed 
or mitigated;
• the directors’ confirmation set out on page 97 in the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the entity, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the directors’ statement set out on page 97 in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the entity’s ability to 
continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;
• whether the directors’ statement in relation to going concern required under the Listing Rules in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or 
• the directors’ explanation set out on page 97 in the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the entity, 
over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they 
have a reasonable expectation that the entity will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

Overview of our audit approach 
Key audit matters • Inappropriate revenue recognition
• Recoverability of deferred tax assets
• Carrying value of goodwill and investments in subsidiary undertakings (parent Company only)
Audit scope • We performed an audit of the complete financial information of three components and audit procedures 
on specific balances for a further five components.
• The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for 90 per cent of 
profit before tax adjusted for non-recurring items, 93 per cent of revenue and 94 per cent of total assets.
Materiality • Overall Group materiality of $2.5 million which represents 5 per cent of profit before tax adjusted for  
non-recurring items.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation 
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our 
audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated 
to the Audit Committee
Inappropriate Revenue Recognition
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 68); Accounting policies (page 
117); and Note 3 of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements (page 120).
The Group has reported revenue of 
$454.8 million (2016 $457.9 million). 
There is a risk of inappropriate revenue 
recognition of bundled contracts 
comprising of software, hardware and 
post contract support services which 
can require separate recognition.
The complexity of accounting, as 
well as the potential pressure on 
management to meet certain targets, 
may result in inappropriate recognition 
of revenue and associated balances.
We performed full and specific scope audit procedures 
over this risk area in four locations, which covered 
93 per cent of Group reported revenue. For revenue 
in each full and specific scope audit location: 
• We performed walkthroughs of each significant class 
of revenue transactions and assessed the design 
effectiveness of key controls.
• We performed procedures to identify and audit large 
or unusual transactions, as well as a sample of regular 
transactions at each in scope location during the year. 
• For the transactions selected, we agreed the revenue 
recognised and associated balance sheet accounts to 
supporting evidence, focusing on the accounting for the 
service element of bundled products, where applicable. 
• We tested that customer acceptance clauses had been 
met and, where appropriate, revenue had been deferred 
at year end.
• We evaluated the appropriateness of journal entries 
impacting revenue, as well as other adjustments 
made in the preparation of the financial statements. 
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures in respect of the accounting policies for 
revenue recognition in notes 2 and 3 respectively.
Based on the procedures 
performed, we did not identify 
any evidence of material 
misstatement in the revenue 
recognised in the year nor 
in amounts deferred at 
31 December 2017.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
100 Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated 
to the Audit Committee
Recoverability of deferred tax assets
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 68); Accounting policies (page 
119); and Note 24 of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements (page 139). 
The Group has deferred tax assets 
of $23.2 million (2016 $33.1 million). 
There is a risk that inappropriate use of 
brought forward tax losses and volatility 
in forecast profit may result in incorrect 
recognition of deferred tax assets. 
Procedures on the deferred tax assets were performed 
centrally by the Group team supported by overseas teams 
including specialists: 
• We performed walkthroughs of the tax process and 
assessed the design effectiveness of key controls. 
• We reviewed and challenged the future profit forecasts 
against current period profitability and historic 
performance and through consideration of the 
consistency of the projections with other forecasts 
made by management and approved by the Board.
• We considered the appropriateness of the utilisation 
of unrecognised losses based on our assessment of 
the impact evolving tax legislation in the jurisdictions 
in which the Group operates.
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosure and offsetting of deferred tax balances in 
the Group financial statements.
We concluded that 
management’s judgements 
in relation to the extent of 
recognition of deferred tax 
assets is appropriate.
Carrying value of goodwill (Group), 
and investments in subsidiary 
undertakings (Parent Company) 
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 68); Accounting policies (page 
118); and Note 14 of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements (page 132).
The Group has goodwill of $156.8 
million (2016 $155.7 million) and 
investments in subsidiary undertakings 
of £351.8 million (2016 £338.7 million). 
Given the continuing uncertain 
economic environment there remains a 
risk that goodwill in the Group financial 
statements and investments in the 
Parent Company financial statements 
may be impaired including in the 
Connected Devices Cash Generating 
Unit (CGU) where a goodwill impairment 
charge of $61.4 million was recognised 
in 2016.
Procedures on the carrying value of goodwill and 
investments in subsidiary undertakings were performed 
centrally by the Group team supported by specialists 
where necessary:
• We reviewed the appropriateness of management’s 
methodology for identifying CGUs, the associated 
goodwill and the carrying value allocation to each CGU. 
• We assessed the methodology as compared to the 
requirements of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, and the 
mathematical accuracy of management’s model.
• For the CGU with low headroom, we assessed the key 
information and assumptions used in determining the 
valuation including the discount rate, cash flow forecasts 
and the implicit growth, utilising our specialist support as 
necessary. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis to 
understand how much these projections would need to 
change by for there to be an impairment.
We considered the appropriateness of the related disclosures 
provided in note 14 to the Group financial statements.
We concluded the 
methodology in testing for 
impairment is appropriate and 
the assumptions relating to the 
impairment models fell within 
acceptable ranges. We also 
concluded that management’s 
disclosure is appropriate.

An overview of the scope of our audit 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope 
for each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We 
take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business 
environment and other factors such as recent internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage 
of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the reporting components of the Group, we selected components covering 
entities within the United Kingdom, North America and Asia, which represent the principal business units within the Group.
Of the eight components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of three components (“full scope 
components”) which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining five components (“specific scope 
components”), we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had the potential for the 
greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.

Note 1
The Group audit risk in relation to the carrying value of goodwill was subject to full scope audit procedures by the primary audit team on the entire balance.
Note 2
The Group audit risk in relation to the recoverability of deferred tax assets was subject to full scope audit procedures by the primary audit team on the entire balance.
Note 3
One of the five specific scope components relates to the corporate division of the parent Company which includes consolidation and elimination adjustments.
Note 4
The specific scope loss before tax adjusted for non-recurring items coverage of 5 per cent represents four specific scope components having a positive 
contribution of 20 per cent offset by the corporate component having a negative contribution of 25 per cent.
Note 5
The audit scope of these components may not have included testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of the 
significant account tested for the Group.
Note 6
Of the remaining components that together represent 10 per cent of the Group’s profit before tax adjusted for non-recurring items, none are individually greater 
than 6 per cent of the Group’s profit before tax adjusted for non-recurring items. For these components, we performed other procedures, including analytical 
review procedures and specified procedures to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements. 
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
102 Changes from the prior year
Changes from the prior year include increasing two components from specific scope to full scope due to their relative contribution to 
revenue and profit and combining two full scope components to reflect how management operates the business. We have also 
increased the number of specific scope locations due to our risk focused approach which considered relative sizes of certain accounts 
or other qualitative considerations. 
Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the 
components by us, as the Group audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating 
under our instruction. Of the three full scope components, audit procedures were performed on one of these directly by the primary 
audit team and two by component audit teams. Of the five specific scope components, audit procedures were performed on two of 
these directly by the primary audit team and three by component audit teams. Where the work was performed by component auditors, 
we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a 
basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.
At the start of the audit, a Global Team Planning event was held in the UK with representatives from all full and specific scope 
component audit teams in attendance. Detailed instructions were sent to all auditors in these locations. These instructions covered the 
significant areas that should be addressed by the component team auditors (which included the relative risks of material misstatement 
detailed above) and set out the information to be reported back to the Group audit team. In addition the Group audit team continued 
to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory Auditor visits certain material or 
high risk locations on a rotational basis. During the current year’s audit cycle, visits were undertaken by the Group audit team to the 
component teams in North America and Asia. These visits involved meeting with our component team to discuss and direct their 
planned audit approach, holding meetings with local management and reviewing interim procedures performed to date on the Group 
risk areas.
The primary team interacted regularly with the component teams where appropriate during various stages of the audit, including 
attendance at all closing meetings by phone, review of key working papers and were responsible for the scope and direction of the 
audit process. This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion 
on the Group financial statements.

Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the 
audit and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our 
audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be $2.5 million (2016 $1.5 million), which is 5 per cent (2016 5 per cent) of profit before tax 
adjusted for non-recurring items, of $50.7 million (2016 $30.5 million). We believe that profit before tax adjusted for non-recurring items 
provides us with a consistent year on year basis for determining materiality and is the most relevant performance measure to the 
stakeholders of the entity. Detailed audit procedures are performed on material non-recurring items. 
We determined materiality for the Parent Company to be £2.8 million (2016 £2.8 million), which is 1 per cent (2016 1 per cent) of net 
assets. Parent Company materiality is higher than Group materiality as it is calculated on a different basis as it is primarily a head office 
company rather than the trading group. 
Management make further adjustments to the profit before tax adjusted for non-recurring items (basis for materiality) to arrive at adjusted 
operating profit, the measure used by the directors to evaluate the overall performance of the Group. These adjustments include 
intangible asset amortisation of $6.3 million (2016 $12.9 million), share-based payment expense of $2.2 million (2016 $0.8 million),  
net interest income of $0.3 million (2016 $0.4 million expense) and share in loss of associate of $nil (2016 $1.9 million). Adjusting for 
these items gives adjusted operating profit of $58.9 million (2016 $46.5 million).
The $1.0 million increase in materiality is in proportion to the $20.2 million increase of profit before tax adjusted for non-recurring 
items (2017 $50.7 million, 2016 $30.5 million). That increase is a result of the $12.4 million increase in adjusted operating profit 
(2017 $58.9 million, 2016 $46.5 million), the $6.6 million reduction in intangible asset amortisation (2017 $6.3 million, 2016 $12.9 million), 
the $1.9 million reduction in share in loss of associate (2017 $nil, 2016 $1.9 million), partially offset by a $0.7 million increase in net 
finance income.
During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and the only change in final materiality was to reflect the actual 
increase in net finance income reported performance of the Group in the year.
Starting basis
• Profit before tax $46.6 million (2016 loss before tax $46.0 million)
Adjustments
Adjusted for non-recurring items:
• Exceptional costs of $6.7 million (2016 $4.8 million)
• Gain on divestments of $2.6 million (2016 $nil)
• Goodwill, intangible asset and investment in share of associate impairment of $nil (2016 $71.7 million)
Materiality
• Profit before tax adjusted for non-recurring items $50.7 million (basis for materiality) (2016 $30.5 million)
• Materiality of $2.5 million (2016 $1.5 million) (5 per cent of materiality basis)
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
104 Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level 
the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was 
that performance materiality was 75 per cent (2016 75 per cent) of our planning materiality, namely $1.8 million (2016 $1.1 million). 
We have set performance materiality at this percentage to ensure that total detected and undetected audit differences do not 
exceed our planning materiality of $2.5 million (2016 $1.1 million) for the financial statements as a whole.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is 
undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based 
on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that 
component. In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was $0.3 million to $1.1 million  
(2016 $0.2 million to $0.9 million). 
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of $0.12 million 
(2016 $0.08 million), which is set at 5 per cent of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of 
other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Other information 
The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, including the strategic report (set out on pages 1 to 54), 
corporate governance and directors’ report (set out on pages 94 to 97), and other information (set out on pages 170 to 172) other than 
the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in 
this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, 
we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the 
other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, 
we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address the following items in the other 
information and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that those items meet 
the following conditions:
• Fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 69 – the statement given by the directors that they consider the Annual Report 
and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit; or 
• Audit committee reporting set out on page 68 – the section describing the work of the audit committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the audit committee or is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code set out on page 58 – the parts of the directors’ 
statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a 
departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
• the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent Company and its environment obtained in the course of 
the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 98, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group and Parent Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
106 Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
The objectives of our audit, in respect to fraud, are; to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements 
due to fraud; to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud, 
through designing and implementing appropriate responses; and to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected fraud identified 
during the audit. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with 
governance of the entity and management. 
Our approach was as follows: 
• We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the 
most significant frameworks which are directly relevant to specific assertions in the financial statements are those that relate to 
the reporting framework (IFRS, FRS 101, the Companies Act 2006 and the UK Corporate Governance Code) and the relevant tax 
compliance regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
• We understood how Spirent Communications plc is complying with those legal and regulatory frameworks by making enquires of 
management, Internal Audit, those responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the Company Secretary. We corroborated 
our enquires through our review of Board minutes and papers provided to the Audit Committee.
• We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s ﬁnancial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur, by 
meeting with management from various parts of the business to understand where it considered there was susceptibility to fraud. 
We also considered performance targets and their propensity to inﬂuence eﬀorts made by management to manage earnings. 
We considered the programmes and controls that the Group has established to address risks identiﬁed, or that otherwise prevent, 
deter and detect fraud; and how senior management monitors those programmes and controls. 
• Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations 
identiﬁed in the paragraphs above. Our procedures involved: journal entry testing, with a focus on manual consolidation journals 
and journals indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the business; enquiries of Legal Counsel, 
Group management, Internal Audit, and component management. Where the risk was considered to be higher, we performed 
audit procedures to address the identiﬁed fraud risk as referred to in the key audit matters section above. In addition, we completed 
procedures to conclude on the compliance of the disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts with the requirements of the 
relevant accounting standards, UK legislation and the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Other matters we are required to address
• We were appointed by the company on 3 August 2017 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2017 and 
subsequent financial periods.
• Following the recommendation of the board we were appointed (as predecessor firm Lindsay, Jamieson & Haldane) by the Group 
at its annual general meeting on 9 May 1950 to audit the financial statements of the Group for the period ending 31 December 1949 
and subsequent financial periods. Our total uninterrupted period of engagement is 68 years, covering periods from our appointment 
through to the period ending 31 December 2017.
• The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company and we 
remain independent of the Group and the Parent Company in conducting the audit. 
• The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
112 Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1. CORPORATE INFORMATION
The Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue by the Board of 
directors on 8 March 2018. Spirent Communications plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales 
(registration number 00470893). The registered address of the Company is Northwood Park, Gatwick Road, Crawley, West Sussex, 
RH10 9XN, United Kingdom.
The Company’s Ordinary Shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
As required by the European Union’s (EU) IAS Regulation and the Companies Act 2006, the Group has prepared its consolidated 
financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
The Company has elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards. These are 
presented on pages 150 to 151 and the accounting policies in respect of the Company are set out on pages 152 to 156.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounting convention
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis apart from certain financial instruments that have been 
measured at fair value.
Going concern basis of accounting
At 31 December 2017 the Group had cash balances of $128.4 million and no debt.
The directors have reviewed the detailed financial projections for a period of 12 months from the date of this report and the business 
plans for the 2019 and 2020 financial years. They have also considered the principal risks and uncertainties that the Group faces and 
its current financial position and are satisfied that the Group has adequate financial resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report. Accordingly, the going concern basis of 
accounting continues to be used in the preparation of the financial statements.
New accounting standards
No applicable new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations effective from 1 January 2017 have been applied by the 
Group which have resulted in a significant impact on its consolidated results or financial position.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to 
31 December each year. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company, 
using consistent accounting policies. A full list of subsidiary undertakings is provided on pages 166 and 167.
Subsidiary undertakings are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is 
exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the entity.
Results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from 
the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
The separable net assets, including intangible assets of newly acquired subsidiaries, are incorporated into the consolidated financial 
statements based on their fair values at the effective date of control.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. 
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20 and 50 per cent of the voting power of another entity.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost. The Group’s investment includes goodwill 
identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share 
of the total comprehensive income from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases. 
When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil 
and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or 
made payments on behalf of an associate.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
113
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Other Information 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Dividends received from associates reduce the carrying value of the associate. Investments in associates are reviewed for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is 
recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations and goodwill
A business combination is a transaction or other event in which an acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses. Business 
combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
At acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including intangible assets, are measured at their fair 
values. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree. Non-controlling interests are measured at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
Contingent consideration resulting from business combinations is valued at fair value at the acquisition date as part of the business 
combination. When the contingent consideration meets the definition of a financial liability, it is subsequently re-measured to fair value 
at each reporting date, with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. The determination of fair value is based on discounted 
cash flows. The key assumptions take into consideration the probability of meeting each performance target and the discount rate.
Acquisition costs are expensed and included in administration costs.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, representing the excess of cost over the net fair value of the net assets acquired,  
is capitalised as an intangible asset. Goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is subject to an annual review for impairment. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related 
cash-generating units monitored by management. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying 
amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Separately identifiable 
intangible assets such as patent fees, licence fees, trademarks and customer lists and relationships are capitalised on the balance 
sheet only when the value can be measured reliably, or the intangible asset is purchased as part of the acquisition of a business. 
Such intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight line basis. The carrying value of intangible 
assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Acquired intangible assets, being customer lists, current technology, database, brand names and a non-compete covenant, are 
amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives and the charge is included within other items in the income 
statement. Licences are amortised over their useful lives or term, and are expensed within cost of sales or selling costs.
The estimated useful lives of intangible assets and the amortisation expiry dates are as follows:
Useful life Expiry date
Customer lists 2 to 7 years 2020
Current technology 5 to 7 years 2021
Database 2.5 to 7 years 2016
Brand names 5 years 2020
Non–compete covenant 4 years 2016
Licences 3 to 5 years 2018
Product development
Research expenditure is recognised in the year in which it is incurred. Intangible assets arising on the Group’s various product 
development projects are recognised only if the recognition criteria of IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ are met.
Product development costs are expensed as incurred until the technological feasibility of the product under development has 
been established. Technological feasibility in Spirent’s circumstances occurs when a working model is completed. For software 
development, technological feasibility is not established until the process of developing the software is complete. After technological 
feasibility is established, additional costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life.
At 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, no amounts have met the recognition criteria.
Financial Statements
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
114 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment. Depreciation is not provided 
on freehold land. Depreciation is provided to write-off the cost, less estimated residual value, of all other assets over their estimated useful 
lives on a straight line basis at rates which take into account commercial conditions at their location. Usual asset lives are as follows:
Freehold buildings 50 years
Plant and machinery 3 to 8 years
Fixtures, fittings and equipment
Building installations 20 years or lease period if lower
Fittings and equipment 3 to 8 years
Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years
Business systems software 4 years
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the 
carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment of assets
Intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment at each reporting date where 
there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are assessed at least 
annually. When an impairment test is performed, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of the net present 
value of the expected cash flows (value in use) of the relevant cash-generating unit or asset and the fair value less cost of disposal. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Where the carrying amount of an 
asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment 
losses are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Where an impairment loss has been recognised against an asset, it may be reversed in future periods where there has been a change 
in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised, but only to the 
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation 
or amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years. Such a reversal is recognised in the income statement. This 
does not apply for goodwill, for which an impairment loss must not be reversed in any circumstances.
Leases
Operating leases are leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset and are not 
finance leases. Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value, after provisions for obsolescence. Cost includes all costs 
incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition, being the full manufacturing cost on a first-in, first-out basis, 
including all attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity.
Provisions
Provisions are recorded when the Group has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, for which it is 
probable that the Group will be required to settle by an outflow of resources and for which a reliable estimate of the amount of the 
obligation can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision shall be the present value of the expenditures 
expected to be required to settle the obligation.
Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only on the occurrence or non-occurrence of 
uncertain future events outside the Group’s control, or present obligations that are not recognised because it is not probable that a 
settlement will be required or the value of such a payment cannot be reliably measured. The Group does not recognise contingent 
liabilities but discloses them. 
Foreign currencies
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the Group’s presentation currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rates ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. All exchange differences are taken to 
the consolidated income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are measured in terms of 
historical costs using the exchange rate at the date of the initial transaction.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
115
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Other Information 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
The functional currencies of the Group’s operations are principally US dollar, sterling or euro. On consolidation, the assets and 
liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated into the Group’s presentation currency at exchange rates ruling at the 
balance sheet date. The results of foreign operations are translated into US dollars using average rates for the period. The exchange 
differences arising on retranslation are classified as a separate component of equity, the translation reserve. Such translation 
differences are recognised as part of the profit or loss on disposal should an operation be disposed of. The Group has elected to 
apply the exemption in IFRS 1 ‘First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’ which allows the cumulative 
translation differences for all foreign operations to be deemed to be zero at the date of transition to IFRS, being 1 January 2003.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are stated at original invoiced amount less an appropriate allowance for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts. Such allowances are based on an assessment of receivable ageing, past experience or known customer 
exposures.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits which usually have an 
original maturity of three months or less. For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist 
of cash and cash equivalents as defined above. There are no bank overdrafts.
Trade payables
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at the original invoiced amount.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Spirent Communications plc Ordinary Shares held 
by the Group are classified in equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost and included as a deduction from retained earnings. 
Consideration received for the sale of such treasury shares is also recognised in equity.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage exposures arising on receipts and payments in foreign 
currencies relating to firm commitments.
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the contract is entered into, 
and are subsequently re-measured to fair value at each reported balance sheet date. The fair value of forward foreign currency 
exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. The Group 
has not adopted the hedge accounting rules. Consequently all gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are taken to the 
income statement.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts.
Retirement benefits
The Group operates two funded defined benefit pension plans which are in the United Kingdom, all other pension plans are defined 
contribution in nature. For the defined contribution plans, the amount charged to the income statement is the employers’ contributions 
paid or payable during the year.
For defined benefit pension plans, full actuarial valuations are carried out every three years using the projected unit credit method, 
and updates are performed at each balance sheet date. Re-measurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of changes 
to the asset ceiling (if relevant) and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the balance sheet liability 
or asset with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Re-measurement 
recognised in other comprehensive income will not be reclassified to profit or loss. Past service cost is recognised in profit or loss 
in the period of plan amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net 
defined benefit pension liability or asset, taking account of any changes in the net defined benefit pension liability during the period 
as a result of contribution and benefit payments. Defined benefit pension costs are categorised as:
• service cost (including current service cost, past service cost and gains and losses on curtailments or settlements);
• net interest expense or income; and
• re-measurement.
Financial Statements
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
116 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
The Group presents the first two components of defined benefit pension costs in profit or loss.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group, the revenue can be reliably measured and 
when the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership. In addition, revenue is only recognised 
when collectability is probable.
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered. Revenue from maintenance 
contracts is recognised over the period of performance on a straight line basis.
Revenue from product sales of hardware and software is recognised at the time of delivery and acceptance and when there are 
no significant vendor obligations remaining. It is not until acceptance has occurred that the risks and rewards of ownership are 
transferred to the buyer. Terms of acceptance are dependent upon the specific contractual arrangement agreed with the customer.
Revenue from sales or usage-based royalties is recognised as the subsequent sale or usage occurs.
Contractual arrangements are accounted for as two or more separate transactions only where the commercial substance is that the 
individual components operate independently of each other, because they are capable of being provided separately from one another 
and it is possible to attribute reliable fair values to every component. To the extent that a separate component comprises a product 
sale of hardware or software, revenue is recognised as described above. Revenue is recognised on other components as the Group 
fulfils its contractual obligations and to the extent that it has earned the right to consideration.
Government grants
A government grant is recognised in the balance sheet initially as deferred income when there is reasonable assurance that it will be 
received and that the Group will comply with the conditions attached to it. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred 
are recognised as other operating income on a systematic basis in the same periods in which expenses are incurred. Grants that 
compensate the Group for the acquisition of an asset are presented by deducting them from the acquisition cost of the related asset in 
accordance with IAS 20 ‘Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance’.
Employee benefits
When an employee has rendered services to the Group during an accounting period, short-term benefits expected to be paid in 
exchange for those services are recognised in the same accounting period.
Share-based payment
The Group operates various equity-settled share-based compensation plans and accounts for these awards in accordance with IFRS 2 
‘Share-based Payment’.
The fair value of these awards is recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period together with 
a corresponding change in equity. The fair value is measured using the Hull-White trinomial model by reference to the share price, 
and taking into account the terms and conditions of the award, excluding non-market vesting conditions, at the date the awards 
were granted. The charge is reassessed at each balance sheet date to reflect the expected and actual levels of vesting, due to 
achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions. Awards where vesting is conditional upon satisfying a market condition or 
non-vesting condition are treated as vesting irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition has been satisfied.
The Group has an employee share trust for the granting of certain share incentives to employees. Shares in the Group held by the 
employee share trust are treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.

Tax
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items in other comprehensive income or equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable for previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
• where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill (taxable temporary differences only) or of an asset or 
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable 
profit or loss;
• in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related 
asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Dividends paid
The interim dividend is included in the financial statements in the period in which it is paid, and the final dividend and the special 
dividend are included in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.
Adjusting items
Adjusting items are disclosed separately in the income statement where it is necessary to do so due to their nature or amount and 
to provide further understanding of the Group’s financial performance. Adjusting items comprises exceptional items, amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets, goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment, share-based payment, impairment of associate, the 
tax effect of these items, revaluation of deferred tax assets due to US tax reform and prior year tax. 
Certain items are classified as exceptional items due to their nature, amount or infrequency. Such presentation is relevant to an 
understanding of the Group’s financial statements. These items are not part of the Group’s normal ongoing operations.
Critical accounting assumptions and judgements
The preparation of financial statements requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect items reported. Such 
estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best knowledge of current facts, circumstances and future events. 
Actual results may differ, possibly significantly, from those estimates. The areas requiring a high degree of judgement or where 
assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are discussed below.
Estimates
Business combinations and goodwill
For the purpose of impairment tests, the goodwill arising from each business combination is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) 
that are expected to benefit from the combination and which represent the lowest level within the Group at which management 
monitors goodwill. There have been no changes to the CGUs in the year.
The Group tests annually by CGU whether goodwill has suffered impairment and more frequently when events or circumstances 
indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable. The recoverable amounts of CGUs have been determined based on 
value in use calculations which require estimates and assumptions to be made in relation to management’s expectations of growth in 
adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation; long-term growth rates; and appropriate discount rates to reflect the 
risks involved.
Changing the assumptions selected by management, in particular the discount rate and growth rate assumptions used in the cash 
flow projections, could significantly affect the Group’s impairment evaluation and hence reported assets and profits and losses. 
Further details are included in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.

Defined benefit pension plans
The pension cost and the defined benefit pension obligation of the Group’s defined benefit pension plans are based on a number 
of selected assumptions; these include the discount rate, inflation rate, salary growth and longevity. Differences arising from actual 
experience or future changes in assumptions will be reflected in future periods. The effect of changing these assumptions is described 
in note 10.
Recognition of deferred tax assets
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is more likely than not that there will be sufficient and suitable taxable 
profits in the relevant legal entity or tax group against which to utilise the assets in the future. The extent to which deferred tax assets 
can be recognised is based on current forecasts and estimates prepared by management. A change to these forecasts and estimates 
could result in a different recognition outcome. Judgement is required when determining probable future taxable profits, which are 
estimated using the latest available profit forecasts. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are disclosed in note 24.
Provisions and contingent liabilities
Provisions are estimates and the actual cost and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events. The Group exercises 
judgement in recognising provisions and the exposures to contingent liabilities. Judgement is necessary to assess the likelihood that 
a liability will arise and to quantify the possible amount of any financial settlement. The inherent uncertainty of such matters means 
that actual amounts of transactions may differ materially from estimates provided. Any difference between the amounts previously 
recognised and the actual amount is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. Provisions and contingent 
liabilities are disclosed in notes 26 and 17, respectively.
Judgements
Revenue recognition
For revenue recognition purposes, contractual arrangements are accounted for as two or more separate transactions only where the 
commercial substance is that the individual components operate independently of each other, because they are capable of being 
provided separately from one another and it is possible to attribute reliable fair values to every component. Management exercises a 
degree of judgement in setting the criteria used for determining when revenue which involves several elements should be recognised 
and the fair values allocated to each element. The fair values determined and allocated to each element may impact the timing of 
revenue recognition and the determination of fair values can involve complex judgements. The Group generally determines the fair 
value of individual elements based on prices at which the deliverable is regularly sold on a standalone basis after considering 
customer discounts, where appropriate.
Applicable new standards and interpretations not applied

financial statements:

financial statements in the period of initial application other than in relation to IFRS 16 which is discussed below. The Group has 
completed its impact assessment of IFRS 15 which is discussed below.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017

Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Other Information 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ was issued in May 2014 and is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018. It establishes a new five-step model that will apply to revenue arising from contracts with customers. Under IFRS 15, 
the core principle is that revenue is recognised to depict the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that 
reflects the consideration to which the entity is entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
For the Group, transition to IFRS 15 took place on 1 January 2018. The Group has adopted the standard using the fully retrospective 
approach which means that the cumulative impact of the adoption will be recognised in retained earnings as of 1 January 2017 and 
comparatives will be restated.
The Group has completed its assessment of the impact of the standard on its financial statements and has identified the following area 
that will be affected:
Incremental costs incurred to obtain a contract
In 2017, the Group expensed costs in relation to commissions and agency fees incurred as they did not qualify for recognition as an 
asset under any of the other accounting standards. However, the costs would not have been incurred had the contract not been 
obtained and, by their nature, are expected to be recovered through the Group’s performance of its contractual obligations. Certain 
of these costs will therefore be eligible for capitalisation under IFRS 15 and recognition as a contract asset with effect from 1 January 
2018, and then amortised as the revenue is recognised on the goods and services to which the asset relates.
The Group will apply the practical expedient in paragraph 94 of IFRS 15 and continue to recognise such incremental costs as an 
expense when incurred if the amortisation period of the asset that the Group would otherwise have recognised is one year or less. 
The financial impact on the Group’s financial statements is therefore limited and primarily applicable to maintenance, service and 
software subscription contracts that extend beyond 12 months.
Presentation of contract assets and contract liabilities in the balance sheet and related disclosures
IFRS 15 requires separate presentation of contract assets and contract liabilities in the balance sheet. This will result in some 
reclassifications as of 1 January 2017 in relation to advance payments and deferred revenue which are currently included in other 
balance sheet line items. Other presentation changes are limited to additional disclosure requirements under IFRS 15 only.
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ was issued in January 2016 to replace IAS 17 ‘Leases’ and is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2019. 
IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases as per IAS 17, and introduces a single lessee 
accounting model. Lease agreements will give rise to the recognition of an asset representing the right to use the leased item and a 
corresponding loan obligation for future lease payables. Lease costs will be recognised in the form of depreciation of the right to use 
asset and interest on the lease liability. Consequently, there will be a reduction in operating expenses and an increase in finance costs. 
The accounting for leases that are currently designated as finance leases will be largely unchanged under IFRS 16. The accounting for 
leases that are currently designated as operating leases will be fundamentally different to the current treatment of expensing the rental 
charges on a straight line basis. The Group’s operating lease commitments are disclosed in note 28.
The Group continues to assess the impact of IFRS 16 on the financial statements, however, the changes are expected to have a 
material impact on the consolidated balance sheet. The Group is continuing to assess the impact on the consolidated income 
statement.
When IFRS 16 is adopted, the Group has the choice to apply it on a fully retrospective basis, restating comparative information, or to 
recognise the cumulative effect of application as an adjustment to opening equity on the date of adoption. The Group intends to adopt 
the fully retrospective approach.

The Group’s organisational structure is based on differences in the products and services offered by each segment and information 
regularly reviewed by the Group’s Chief Executive Officer, its chief operating decision maker, is presented on this basis. The Group’s 
operating segments follow this structure.
The Group’s reportable operating segments are Networks & Security, Lifecycle Service Assurance and Connected Devices. The 
Group evaluates adjusted operating profit before exceptional items, acquired intangible asset amortisation, goodwill and acquired 
intangible asset impairment and share-based payment. Finance income, finance costs and share of loss of associate are not allocated 
to the reportable segments. Corporate is not an operating segment and costs are separately reported and not allocated to the 
reportable segments. Information on segment assets and segment liabilities is not regularly provided to the Group’s Chief Executive 
Officer and is therefore not disclosed below. There is no aggregation of operating segments.

2016 operating segment information has been restated for the following changes to the Group’s operating segments which came into 
effect on 1 January 2017:
The operating segments were reorganised to focus certain product lines and to combine resources and planning efforts in other 
product lines. The following changes were made to the operating segments:
• The Networks & Applications operating segment was divided into five distinct lines of business; Cloud and IP, Application Security, 
Automation Platform Technologies, Mobility Infrastructure and Spirent Technologies.
• The Service Assurance Broadband line of business was split by product offering between the core Service Assurance business 
and Service Experience line of business.
From 1 January 2017, the new operating segments were as follows:
• Networks & Security comprising our Cloud and IP, Application Security and Positioning lines of business with the aim of addressing 
the needs of the lab test market for Ethernet, Virtual, Data Centre, applications test and timing for critical infrastructure.
• Lifecycle Service Assurance comprising our Mobility Infrastructure, Customer Experience Management, Service Assurance and 
Automation Platform Technologies lines of business. All businesses in this segment target wireless service providers’ production 
networks aimed at reducing operating costs, increasing service quality and providing real-time analytics to trigger automatic tests 
and fixes to network degradation.
• Connected Devices comprising our Wireless and Service Experience lines of business together with Device Intelligence and 
Developer Tools. Device Intelligence and Developer Tools were divested by the Group on 30 June 2017. Further details are 
disclosed in note 33. The future opportunities for this segment are centred around 5G wireless development, performance and 
security of connected devices and the challenges to network providers coming from the Internet of Things.

6. EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS CONTINUED
In 2016, Spirent undertook a fundamental review of the lines of business in order to bring more focus to certain product lines and 
to combine resources and planning efforts in other product lines. This resulted in a change to the Group’s reported operating 
segments. In addition, Spirent reviewed the sales organisation and compensation structure. The change in product line emphasis 
and organisational review resulted in exceptional restructuring costs. In 2017, the portfolio and sales organisation reviews were 
continued and concluded, which resulted in further headcount reductions, an onerous lease provision and other associated costs. 
The Group also incurred a contract amendment fee in relation to outsourced research and development services. In addition, in 2017 
the Group undertook a strategic review of the Connected Devices operating segment incurring advisors’ fees of $1.3 million.
The tax effect of exceptional items is a credit of $1.9 million (2016 $1.1 million). The total cash outflow in respect of exceptional items 
charged in 2017 is anticipated to be $6.8 million, with $3.4 million paid in the year (2016 $3.9 million with $1.4 million paid in the year). 
The cash outflow in 2017 in respect of exceptional items charged in 2016 was $2.5 million (2016 $7.0 million).
The total cash outflow in respect of exceptional items charged in 2017 will be reported within cash flows from operating activities in 
the consolidated cash flow statement.

Defined benefit plans
i) Characteristics and risks associated with the Plans
The Group sponsors two funded defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom: the Spirent Communications plc Staff Pension 
& Life Assurance Plan (“Staff Plan”) and the Spirent Communications plc Retirement Cash & Life Assurance Plan (“Cash Plan”). These 
plans are funded and have full UK HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) tax-exempt approval. Both schemes are administered by a 
trustee board which is comprised of representatives from the employer, member nominated trustees and an independent trustee. 
The trustee board operates in accordance with the Trust Deed and Rules of each Plan and acts in the interests of all of its members.
• The Staff Plan is the Group’s most significant plan, and it provides its members with retirement benefits based on their final salary 
and length of service. The Staff Plan is closed to new entrants
• The Cash Plan is primarily a defined contribution arrangement, although there are some legacy defined benefits (“Old Section”) 
that have been valued for the purpose of these accounts in accordance with IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’. Members who left service 
before 1992 are entitled to a cash lump sum on retirement that is based on their salary and length of service. Members of the Old 
Section are entitled to defined contribution benefits, but with an underpin based on salary and length of service. The Cash Plan is 
closed to new entrants.
There is also a UK unfunded plan, which consists of a contractual obligation for the Group to top up certain former employees’ benefits 
whose salaries exceeded the statutory earnings cap.
As with the vast majority of similar arrangements in the United Kingdom, the Group ultimately underwrites the risks relating to the defined 
benefit plans. These risks include investment risks and demographic risks, such as the chance of members living longer than expected.
The plans hold a significant proportion of their assets in equity. Strong future equity returns would be expected to reduce the Group’s 
future cash contributions (and vice versa).
Expected contributions to the defined benefit plans in 2018 are $7.1 million. This includes the contributions agreed with the funded 
plans’ trustees in accordance with UK legislation. Following the triennial valuations as at 1 April 2015, the Group has agreed to pay 
$7.0 million (£5.0 million) per annum into the Staff Plan from 1 July 2016, over a seven year period, in order to clear the funding deficit 
as assessed by the trustees’ independent actuary.
If the contributions currently agreed are insufficient to pay the benefits due, the Group will need to make further contributions.

Approximately two thirds of the Staff Plan’s assets are held in a combination of LDI funds, cash benchmarked bonds and hedge funds. 
The objective of this allocation is to hedge against the plan’s liabilities, provide protection against inflation risk and to provide a level of 
investment returns in all market scenarios.
These funds have a wide investment remit and as such the investments of the funds may or may not be listed on recognised 
exchanges and markets and will be without restriction as to geographical, industrial or sectoral exposure. These funds may take both 
long and short positions and may utilise a broad range of derivatives. The funds’ investments may include sub-investment grade 
securities, corporate debt securities, gilts, sale and repurchase agreements, loans, and emerging markets debt and currencies.
The plans are prohibited from investing in Spirent’s own financial instruments.
The fair values of the quoted equity and debt instruments are determined based on quoted market prices in active markets whereas 
the fair values of the other assets are not.
The Group has determined that it has an unconditional right to refund of surplus assets if the schemes are run off until the last member 
dies, on which basis IFRIC 14 does not cause any change in the balance sheet disclosures before tax.
For the purposes of the following disclosures the Staff Plan and Cash Plan have been combined as the Cash Plan is immaterial to these 
financial statements.

f) The key financial assumptions
The assumptions used for both plans using a weighted average were as follows:
2017
%
2016
%
Inflation – RPI 3.1 3.2
Inflation – CPI 2.0 2.1
Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 2.0 2.1
Rate of increase for pensions in payment pre 2001 service 3.6 3.7
Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2001 to 5 April 2005 service 3.0 3.1
Rate of increase for pensions post 5 April 2005 service 2.1 2.1
Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.0 2.1
Rate used to discount plan liabilities 2.5 2.8
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. The assumptions are 
such that a member currently aged 65 (2016 aged 65) will live on average for a further 22.7 years (2016 23.1 years) if they are male and 
for a further 24.6 years (2016 25.2 years) if they are female. For a member who retires in 2037 (2016 in 2036) at age 65 (2016 age 65), 
the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 24.1 years (2016 24.8 years) after retirement if they are male and for a 
further 26.1 years (2016 27.1 years) after retirement if they are female.
iii) Amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows
The approximate impact to the past service liabilities of changing these main assumptions is as follows:
• Reducing the discount rate by 0.1 per cent per annum would increase past service liabilities by $4.2 million (2016 $3.8 million).
• Increasing RPI inflation by 0.1 per cent would increase the plans’ liabilities by $1.5 million (2016 $1.5 million).
• Increasing the life expectancy of a member by one year (by modifying the standard mortality tables using an appropriate scaling 
factor) would increase past service liabilities by $13.9 million (2016 $11.7 million).
There will also be an impact on the future service cost but given the small active population in these plans this is likely to be insignificant.
The sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual change as the changes in assumptions may not occur in isolation.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 15 years (2016 15 years).
Deferred compensation plan
The Group operates a deferred compensation plan for employees in the United States. The plan enables participating employees to 
defer a portion of their salary and invest it in deemed investments, that are used to measure the gains or losses that are attributed to 
the deferral account over time. The plan has elements of a defined benefit pension retirement obligation and therefore is required to 
be valued in accordance with IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’.
At 31 December 2017, the deferred compensation plan deficit amounted to $3.7 million (2016 $2.3 million) and is included within  
non-current trade and other payables (note 25). During the year, $0.3 million was charged to the income statement (2016 $0.1 million) and a 
re-measurement loss of $0.9 million (2016 nil) was recognised directly in the statement of other comprehensive income. The key financial 
assumptions include a discount rate used to discount plan liabilities of 3.4% and an expected investment yield of 7.5%. In the prior year, no net 
investment yield growth was assumed for the plan. There is no material impact of changing each of the key assumptions by 0.1 per cent, in 
isolation. 
Defined contribution plans
United Kingdom
The Group contributes towards defined contribution pension plans for employees in the United Kingdom. Employer contributions into 
these plans for 2017 were $0.8 million (2016 $0.8 million).
United States
The Group maintains a defined contribution pension plan for employees of its United States subsidiaries. This plan, also known as a 401(k) 
Plan, allows employees to defer a percentage of their salary for retirement. The investment choices offered by the plan are a selection of 
diversified mutual funds offering a broad mix of investment return potential with varying levels of risk. In aggregate, the Group’s contributions 
to the US plan totalled $4.0 million for 2017 (2016 $4.1 million). There were no defined benefit plans in the United States in 2017 or 2016.
Other jurisdictions
Outside the United Kingdom and the United States, employees are provided with pension arrangements determined in accordance 
with approved local practice and regulations. These arrangements are defined contribution plans. Total employer contributions for 
2017 in respect of these plans amounted to $1.1 million (2016 $1.1 million).
Total employer contributions to defined contribution plans were $5.9 million (2016 $6.0 million).

Included in the above reconciliation are the following items: US tax rate change of $7.9 million which relates to the re-measurement 
of the Group’s US deferred tax assets due to the decrease in the tax rate from 35 per cent to 21 per cent; non-taxable income of  
$1.3 million which relates to offshore income in the rest of the world of $0.9 million and non-taxable gains on disposals in the United 
Kingdom of $0.4 million; permanent differences of $0.4 million largely relate to the UK patent box deduction; tax underprovided in prior 
years of $1.4 million which relates to corrections to US deferred tax assets of $0.7 million and the France tax assessment received for 
prior years of $0.7 million.
The Group’s tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of products and reflects a combination of higher tax in certain jurisdictions, 
such as the United States, with a statutory rate of 35 per cent and other regions’ significantly lower tax rates, such as the United 
Kingdom at 19.25 per cent, China at 15 per cent and other rates that fall in between. Research and Experimental credits of  
$2.5 million (2016 $3.2 million) bring down the rate but items such as state taxes and withholding tax increase the tax rate. 
12. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic
Earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) for the year attributable to owners of the parent Company by the weighted 
average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) for the year attributable to owners of the parent Company by the 
weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares that 
would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary Shares into Ordinary Shares.

Annual impairment test
The Group has an annual impairment testing date of 30 November. The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations were:
• revenue growth rates;
• gross margin;
• operating expenses;
• discount rate; and
• growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the five-year period covered by management’s projections.
The cash flows are derived from the most recent financial budgets for the next financial year, as approved by the Board, and the Group’s 
three-year strategic plan. Cash flows in years four and five are extrapolated based on long range plans. Cash flows in subsequent years 
have been extrapolated using a steady 2.5 per cent for all CGUs (2016 2.5 per cent for all CGUs), which management estimates to be the 
approximate average long-term growth rate for the industries in which these units operate. Fundamentally this long-term growth is based 
on a proxy for global long-term inflation taking into consideration more developed and developing markets. The growth rates used in the 
value in use calculations are set at the same level for each CGU as all the CGUs operate within similar markets which share the same 
growth drivers and characteristics. The discount rates incorporate the specific risks relating to each CGU.
The discount rate applied to the cash flows is based on the weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies by taking the 
risk free rate for 30-year government bonds and making an adjustment to reflect the increased risk of investing in equities. In making 
this adjustment, the inputs required are the equity market risk premium, beta, and the risk adjustment applied to reflect the systematic 
risk of Spirent and the specific CGUs, taking into account factors such as size and the territories in which each CGU operates.
The cash flows have been discounted using the following pre-tax discount rates:
2017 
%
2016
%
Networks & Security 16.0 16.0
Lifecycle Service Assurance 17.4 17.4
Connected Devices 14.3 15.6
For Spirent the key factor in relation to the cash flow forecasts is the ability to forecast revenue. All CGUs operate in the data technology 
market and generate a high gross profit (gross margin); consequently changes in revenue can have a significant impact on the operating 
profit and cash flows. Revenue growth rates used in the projections are based on management’s estimate of growth in the markets 
served and take into account historical levels of growth, expected future developments in products and technology, industry forecasts 
and macro-economic conditions in the territories in which the CGUs operate. Gross margin and operating expenses are based on 
historical values adjusted for the effect of revenue growth and cost reduction actions committed prior to the impairment testing date.
The Networks & Security three-year plan delivers growth from Cloud and IP into core emerging markets such as Automotive, Wi-Fi and 
TSN. Cloud and IP growth in high speed ethernet is expected to continue, supported by ongoing product development. Further growth 
in Networks & Security is expected in the Positioning business from launches of new tailored solutions. Management expects that the 
Application Security product line will deliver growth in market share within network equipment manufacturers and service providers 
with new hardware and synergies with Positioning and continued expansion in complementary solutions with Cloud and IP.

The continuing drive in lab sales and enhancements to the feature set at the Mobility Infrastructure business unit is expected to grow 
revenue in Lifecycle Service Assurance on a relatively flat cost base in the near term. Management expects revenue increases at the 
Customer Experience Management business unit driven by the VisionWorks sales strategy and a relatively flat gross margin over the 
three-year forecast period. The Lumos legacy business in Lifecycle Service Assurance is expected to drop in the near term to be 
replaced by growth in new Ethernet products supported by investment in product development, particularly in virtualisation. The 
individual business units in Lifecycle Service Assurance are expected to work together to deliver the three-year plan to meet changes 
in customer needs and the competitive landscape.
Revenue is expected to grow at Connected Devices as the smartphone market recovers, driven by network emulator partnerships 
with growth in 5G. Management expects gross margin improvement as a result of product mix shifting to more software solutions and 
cost reduction initiatives, including a new channel emulator platform and a new network emulator platform. Operating expenses are 
expected to remain relatively flat as business unit integration synergies are leveraged following recent organisational change and 
research and development flexibility is gained from outsourcing programmes and shifting investment to new growth areas.
The recoverable amount of each CGU was calculated on a value in use basis and was in excess of its carrying value for every CGU. 
As the Networks & Security and Lifecycle Service Assurance CGUs satisfied the carry forward criteria as per IAS 36 ‘Impairment of 
Assets’, no detailed value in use calculations were undertaken for these CGUs. 
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions
The directors believe that no reasonable possible change in any of the key assumptions used, in isolation, would cause the value in 
use of the Networks & Security and Lifecycle Service Assurance CGUs to fall below the carrying value.
The headroom on the Connected Devices CGU was $27.3 million. Sensitivity analysis around the key assumptions has indicated that 
for the Connected Devices CGU, a 33.6 per cent decrease in forecast revenue in year 1 and continuing to apply the forecast growth 
rates to subsequent years, in isolation, would cause the value in use to fall below the carrying value. There is no reasonable possible 
change in the discount rate and the long term growth rate, in isolation, that would cause the value in use of the Connected Devices 
CGU to fall below the carrying value.
Intangible asset impairment
Year ended 31 December 2017
There was no impairment charge in respect of the other intangible assets.
Year ended 31 December 2016
An intangible asset impairment charge of $7.7 million was incurred in respect of the customer list, current technology, database, 
brand names and non-compete covenant intangible assets arising on the acquisitions of the Radvision Technology Business Unit and 
Mobilethink in 2014. At acquisition, the acquired intangibles were expected to be amortised over useful lives of between 2.5 and 7 
years, however, lower than anticipated projected cash flows within these businesses resulted in a reassessment of expected future 
business performance in light of current trading and planned future investment. The cash flows from these businesses, which formed 
the recently divested Developer Tools and Device Intelligence lines of business, were not expected to support the acquired intangible 
assets identified at acquisition and, therefore, they were fully impaired.

The carrying amount for Jolata is nil in 2017 (2016 nil)
Jolata, Inc. (“Jolata”) is a company incorporated in the United States and its principal activity is the provision of network testing.
Jolata is considered an associate as the Group controls 26 per cent (2016 26 per cent) of the voting power and therefore has 
significant influence over the entity.
During the prior year, the investment in Jolata was impaired in full by $2.6 million . Following the impairment, the recoverable amount 
in Jolata was nil.
The Group has $1.0 million cumulative unrecognised share of losses in Jolata (2016 nil).

The Group had capital commitments of $0.8 million at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016 $1.8 million).
The Group has provided indemnities of $0.1 million (2016 $0.1 million) for certain ongoing business obligations under letters of credit

The Group has received enquiries from the Direction Générale des Douanes et Droits Indirects (French Customs) in relation to the 
valuation and classification of imports into France but has not received a formal demand for unpaid duty and it is unclear whether a 
formal demand will be received. Spirent has adopted a duty tariff based on World Customs Organisation guidelines that potentially 
conflicts with European Union import regulations, resulting in a possible liability to the French authorities.
There is uncertainty with regard to not only the legitimacy of any potential claim, but also the appropriate tariff classification, the 
period in question and both the population and valuation of goods potentially subject to duty. The determination of the amount of any 
liability in respect of unpaid duty and associated penalties and interest is therefore dependent on a number of significant inter-related 
uncertainties and therefore the Group cannot reasonably make an assessment of the quantum of that contingent liability at the date of 
the signing of these financial statements. It is not practicable to state the timing of the payment due, if any, since no formal demand for 
unpaid duty has been made.
Due to the aforementioned uncertainties, the Group considers it possible, but not probable, that a settlement will be required.

A deferred tax asset of $23.2 million has been recognised at 31 December 2017 (2016 $33.1 million). $3.5 million is in the United 
Kingdom (2016 $3.7 million), $18.9 million is in the United States (2016 $28.2 million) and $0.8 million is in the rest of the world 
(2016 $1.2 million).
The deferred tax asset includes $1.1 million (2016 $0.5 million) in respect of the tax deduction which may be available on the future 
exercise of share incentives.
The Group has tax losses arising in the United Kingdom of $40.0 million (2016 $37.1 million), at the State level in the United States of 
$22.4 million (2016 $31.1 million), and the rest of the world of $0.4 million (2016 $0.4 million) that are available for offset against suitable 
future taxable profits. The significant increase in the United Kingdom is mostly due to favourable foreign exchange movements. 
The US tax losses can be carried forward until 2022 through to 2036. Additionally, there are short-term timing differences in the rest 
of the world of $3.5 million (2016 $3.8 million), tax credits in the United States (State level) and the rest of the world of $7.1 million and 
$2.2 million, respectively (2016 $7.1 million and $2.1 million). A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these items as 
their future recovery is uncertain.
The Group has capital losses carried forward of $1,103.2 million (2016 $1,020.9 million) for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised 
on the balance sheet. This increase is due to favourable foreign exchange movements. These capital losses have no expiry date.

Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Other Information 24. DEFERRED TAX CONTINUED
US tax reform and other future changes in tax rates
On 22 December 2017, the US government enacted ‘The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’ (the Act). The Act has significant tax implications for 
the Group. The most significant change made is the reduction in the statutory corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 21 per cent with 
effect from 1 January 2018. Other changes that will impact the Group include the repeal of the Domestic Production Activity Deduction 
(DPAD) and the enactment of a new deduction, the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII) deduction. It is estimated that the impact 
of the US tax rate reduction together with the repeal of the DPAD and the addition of the FDII deduction will decrease the Group’s 2018 
effective tax rate. The precise impact is still to be determined as we are awaiting further guidance from the US government. We also 
expect to see cash savings resulting from the Act’s changes.
The enactment of the lower tax rate prior to the balance sheet date results in our re-measurement of the Group’s US deferred tax 
assets. As a result, the Group’s US deferred tax assets were written-down by $7.9 million with a corresponding deferred tax charge 
to the income statement. This charge is reflected in the tax on adjusting items.
The Finance Bill 2016 was enacted 15 September 2016 and reduced the United Kingdom rate of corporation tax from 20 per cent as 
of 1 April 2017 to 19 per cent and by a further 2 per cent to 17 per cent from April 2020. No further United Kingdom corporation tax rate 
reductions have been announced. As such, the United Kingdom temporary differences have been recognised at the rate at which the 
temporary differences are expected to unwind.
In line with these rate changes, deferred tax assets and liabilities being realised or settled before 2020 have been based on a rate of 
19 per cent. Those being realised or settled after 2020 have been based on a rate of 17 per cent.

The lease provisions are for the continuing obligations under leases in respect of space which has been vacated by the Group and 
property dilapidation and restoration provisions. Where material, lease obligations are discounted. The Group expects these provisions 
to be utilised over one to seven years.
Restructuring provisions relate to severance costs which are expected to be utilised within one year.
Other provisions comprises environmental provisions related to property disposed of and provisions relating to legal claims. The Group 
expects these provisions to be utilised in less than one year.
27. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The main purpose of the Group’s financial instruments, other than trade receivables, trade payables and provisions, is to fund the 
Group’s liquidity requirements.
All of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are categorised as loans and receivables stated at amortised cost, except for forward 
foreign currency exchange contracts, included within current other financial assets and liabilities, that are designated at fair value 
through profit and loss and corporate owned life insurance, amounting to $2.5 million (2016 $2.2 million), included within non-current 
trade and other receivables, that is designated as available-for-sale through profit or loss. These are shown in the below table:

The Group enters into derivative transactions, forward foreign currency exchange contracts, for the management of the Group’s foreign 
currency exposures when deemed appropriate. 
The key objective of the Group’s treasury department is to manage the financial risks of the business and to ensure that sufficient 
liquidity is available to the Group. All treasury activity operates within a formal control framework. The Board has approved treasury 
policies and guidelines and periodically reviews treasury activities. Additionally, it is the Group’s policy that speculative treasury 
transactions are expressly forbidden.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
141
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Other Information 27. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
a) Market risk
The main types of market risk that affect the Group are interest rate risk and exchange rate risk.
Interest rate risk
The Group has no external debt and has limited exposure to interest rate risk. The Group’s excess funds are principally held in the 
United Kingdom and the United States and invested in on-demand or short-term bank deposits. It therefore has some exposure to 
interest rate risk arising on changes in sterling and US dollar interest rates.
Cash and cash equivalents, long-term cash on deposit and forward foreign currency exchange contracts are the Group’s financial 
instruments which are exposed to interest rate risk.
Short-term bank deposits and forward foreign currency exchange contracts mature within three months. The financial instruments bear 
the following interest rates:
2017 2016
Effective 
interest rate 
% $ million
Effective 
interest rate 
% $ million
Fixed rate
Fixed deposits 1.46 45.1 0.98 5.0
Floating rate
Cash at bank and in hand 83.3 91.1
Interest rates on financial instruments classified as fixed rate are fixed until the maturity of the instrument. All fixed rate deposits 
mature within three months after which date they will be exposed to floating rates of interest.
Interest receivable for the year (note 7) was $0.6 million (2016 $0.3 million) and is under the effective interest method.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above table are non-interest bearing and are therefore not 
subject to interest rate risk.
A movement of 25 basis points in interest rates based on levels of investment at 31 December 2017 would increase or reduce interest 
income and equity by $0.2 million (2016 $0.1 million).
Exchange rate risk
Currency exposures arise from trading transactions undertaken by the Group in foreign currencies and on the translation of the 
operating results and net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
The Group has the majority of its operations in the United States and presents its consolidated financial statements in US dollars. 
The Company’s functional currency is sterling and its share capital is denominated in pounds sterling; the Group also has operations 
in Europe and Asia and therefore its results and assets and liabilities are affected on translation by movements in exchange rates in 
relation to the US dollar. The Group does not enter into instruments to hedge the translation exposure of the operating results or net 
assets of its overseas subsidiaries since these are considered accounting and not cash exposures.
The Group undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. 
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters using forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The main exposures arise in relation to US dollar receivables and cash balances held by non-US operations. Group treasury, by means 
of forward foreign currency exchange contracts, carries out transaction hedging. A ten per cent appreciation or depreciation of sterling 
and euro against the US dollar would increase or reduce profit before tax by $1.9 million (2016 $1.5 million) based on the balances at 
the reporting date.
Financial Statements
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
142 27. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
b) Credit risk
Investment counterparties are subject to pre-approval by the Board with pre-approved limits set for each bank to avoid any 
concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum credit exposure at the balance sheet date under financial instruments in relation to cash and bank deposits is equal to 
the carrying value of $128.4 million (2016 $96.1 million).
Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for uncollectable 
amounts where appropriate. Trade receivable exposures are managed in the business units where they arise. Allowance is made for 
bad and doubtful debts based on management’s assessment of the risk-taking into account ageing profile, experience and circumstance.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk attributable to its trade receivables as the exposure is spread over a large 
number of customers with no one customer accounting for more than 10 per cent of total Group revenue. The maximum credit 
exposure at the balance sheet date in relation to trade receivables is equal to the carrying value of $113.8 million (2016 $112.2 million).
The composition of trade receivables at 31 December is as follows:
2017 
$ million
2016 
$ million
Neither impaired nor past due 86.0 69.1
Past due but not impaired:
Less than 30 days overdue 15.1 18.5
30 to 60 days 6.7 12.5
Over 60 days 6.0 12.1
Trade receivables 113.8 112.2
The Group closely monitors amounts due from customers and performs activities such as credit checks and reviews of payment history 
and has put in place appropriate credit approval limits. Based on these procedures, management assessed the quality of those 
receivables that are past due but not impaired as low risk.
The movement on the receivables’ provision during the year is given in note 20. The value of impaired trade receivables is $1.2 million 
(2016 $2.3 million). For all other financial assets, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount.
c) Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to ensure that there are sufficient sources of funding to meet projected requirements. Its operations are 
financed through cash and cash equivalents held centrally and cash generated from operations.
At 31 December 2017, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of $128.4 million (2016 $96.1 million) of which $83.3 million (2016 
$91.1 million) is available on demand and $45.1 million matures within three months (2016 $5.0 million matures within three months).
During 2017, the Group generated $69.3 million of cash from operating activities (2016 $42.7 million) and considers that, with current 
cash resources, no debt and positive cash flow from its operating activities, it has adequate resources available to it to remain in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Group has entered into forward foreign currency exchange contracts all of which mature within three months. The gross settlement 
amounts of these contracts are as follows:
2017 
$ million
2016 
$ million
Sale of US dollars against sterling 8.0 5.0
The Group is debt free and does not have loans payable. Financial liabilities are trade and other payables, the majority of which are 
due to be settled within one year, and provisions (note 26). 
The Group does not have any other material financial contractual commitments.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017

Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Other Information 27. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
d) Fair value of financial instruments
The carrying value of all financial assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value although the amounts at 31 December 2017 and 2016 were immaterial.
e) Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to support its business and maximise shareholder value. The Group’s 
capital is its total shareholders’ funds.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions.
Spirent’s policy on the payment of dividends to shareholders is to maintain a sustainable dividend.
28. OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS
At 31 December, the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, 
which fall due as follows:
2017 
$ million
2016 
$ million
Within one year 9.2 9.1
In the second to fifth years 30.2 29.0
Over five years 6.9 12.6

The Group leases certain land and buildings under non-cancellable operating lease agreements with a variety of terms. The Group 
also leases certain plant and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.

The nature and purpose of each reserve within equity is as follows:
• Share premium account: this reserve records the consideration premium for shares issued at a value that exceeds their nominal value;
• Capital redemption reserve: this reserve arises in relation to share capital cancellation;
• Other reserves: share capital, share premium account and capital redemption reserve are translated into US dollars at the rates of 
exchange at the balance sheet date and the resultant exchange differences are included in other reserves; and
• Translation reserve: this reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of 
foreign subsidiaries.
Investment in own Ordinary Shares
At 31 December 2017, the Employee Share Ownership Trust held 0.6 million Ordinary Shares (2016 0.6 million Ordinary Shares) to 
satisfy awards under various share incentive plans. At 31 December 2017, the Spirent Sharesave Trust held 0.5 million Ordinary Shares 
(2016 0.5 million Ordinary Shares) to satisfy awards made to United Kingdom based employees under an all employee share scheme. 
The market value of own Ordinary Shares held in trust, being in total 1.1 million Ordinary Shares (2016 1.1 million Ordinary Shares), at 
31 December 2017 was $1.5 million (2016 $1.3 million).

For Performance Share awards made prior to 2011, performance conditions related to Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”). For awards 
made since 2011, performance conditions relate to the Company’s EPS and TSR.
Further information on the performance conditions for EIP share incentives is set out in the Report on directors’ remuneration.
Options and SARs granted under the EIP expire on the tenth anniversary of their grant unless they have previously lapsed or been exercised.
All employee plans
UK Employee Share Purchase Plan (“UK ESPP”)
The UK ESPP, which is an HMRC-approved share incentive plan, was approved by shareholders in 2005 and 2015 and is available to 
all UK employees. The UK ESPP offers four ways to provide Ordinary Shares to employees: free shares, partnership shares, matching 
shares and dividend shares. The UK ESPP operates in conjunction with a trust, which holds the shares on behalf of participants.
In November 2010, the Company commenced making invitations to all UK employees to acquire partnership shares on market using 
deductions from payroll.
US Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“US ESPP”)
The US ESPP was initially approved by shareholders in 2000, with amendments being approved by shareholders in 2005 and 2011.
The US ESPP enables the Company to invite all US employees to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company on market using deductions 
from payroll. In November 2010, the Company commenced making six-monthly invitations to employees.
The US ESPP also enables the Company to grant eligible US employees the right to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company using 
the proceeds of a savings contract. If such a grant were made, when joining the US ESPP, participants would enter into a 12 month 
contract to save up to 15 per cent of base salary subject to an individual limit of $1,000 per month. No grants of this nature have been 
made since 2003.
Global All Employee Share Purchase Plan (“GAESPP”)
The GAESPP was initially approved by shareholders in 2001 with amendments being approved by shareholders in 2005 and 2011. 
The GAESPP enables the Company to invite employees in countries other than the United States or United Kingdom to acquire Ordinary 
Shares in the Company on market using deductions from payroll. In September 2011, the first such invitation was made to all employees 
in Canada, Hong Kong, France and Germany and subsequent invitations have been made on a six-monthly basis since 2012.
The GAESPP can also be operated on similar terms to the US ESPP above, with participants entering into a 12 month contract to save 
up to 15 per cent of base salary subject to an individual limit. No grants of this nature have been made since 2003.

2.9 million share incentives were granted during 2017 (2016 4.1 million). The fair value of share incentives has been estimated as at 
the date of grant using the Hull-White trinomial model. The following table gives the assumptions made in arriving at the share-based 
payment charge and the fair value:

The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the previous two 
years which management considers to be the period which is likely to be most representative of future volatility. The risk free rate 
is calculated by reference to UK government bonds.

On 16 February 2017, the Group divested of certain assets and liabilities of Epitiro Group Limited (Epitiro) for consideration of 
$0.4 million. Epitiro was reported within the Lifecycle Service Assurance operating segment. 
On 30 June 2017, the Group divested the entire issued share capital of its subsidiaries, Spirent Communications Israel Limited, its 
Developer Tools (DT) line of business, and Spirent Holdings Denmark ApS and its subsidiaries, its Device Intelligence (DI) line of 
business, to Dorfi Limited, an Israeli entity established by the former General Manager of the business units, for a total cash 
consideration of $1. Both DI and DT were reported within the Connected Devices operating segment.
In 2016, DI and DT reported combined revenue of $12.9 million, made an adjusted operating loss of $2.1 million and a loss before 
tax of $6.8 million (after exceptional items of $1.1 million and acquired intangible asset amortisation of $3.6 million). In 2017, DI and 
DT reported combined revenue of $5.9 million and made an adjusted operating profit and profit before tax of $1.4 million. 
These divestments do not constitute discontinued operations under IFRS 5 ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’.

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Corporate information
Spirent Communications plc (the Company) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales (registration 
number 00470893). The registered address of the Company is Northwood Park, Gatwick Road, Crawley, West Sussex, RH10 9XN, 
United Kingdom.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework 
(FRS 101).
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (Adopted IFRS), but makes amendments where necessary in order 
to comply with Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions have been taken.
• A Cash Flow Statement and related notes;
• Comparative period reconciliations for share capital, tangible fixed assets and intangible assets;
• Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries;
• Disclosures in respect of capital management;
• The effects of new but not yet effective IFRS; and
• Disclosures in respect of the compensation of key management personnel.
As the consolidated financial statements include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under  
FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures:
• IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payment’ in respect of Group-settled share-based payments;
• Certain disclosures required by IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ in respect of the impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible 
assets; and
• The disclosures required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments Disclosures’ and IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ regarding financial 
instrument disclosures have not been provided apart from those which are relevant for the financial instruments which are held at 
fair value.
The following exemptions have been taken in these financial statements, as granted by IFRS 1 ‘First-time adoption of IFRS’:
• Business combinations – business combinations that took place prior to 1 January 2014 have not been restated.
• Use of previous GAAP carrying amounts as at date of transition as a deemed cost for investment in subsidiaries.
As the Company is included in the consolidated financial statements, made up to 31 December each year, it is not required to present 
a separate profit and loss account as provided by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. Information on fees for non-audit services 
in respect of the parent Company accounts have not been disclosed as the Company prepares Group accounts which disclose 
information on fees for non-audit services on a consolidated basis.
Accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis apart from certain financial instruments that have been measured at 
fair value.
Going concern basis of accounting
The directors have reviewed the detailed financial projections for a period of 12 months from the date of this report and the business 
plans for the 2019 and 2020 financial years. They have also considered the principal risks and uncertainties that the Company faces 
and its current financial position and are satisfied that the Company has adequate financial resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report. Accordingly, the going concern 
basis of accounting continues to be used in the preparation of the financial statements.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
152 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Business combinations and goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business, representing the excess of cost over the net fair value of the net assets acquired, 
is capitalised as an intangible asset. Goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management. Where the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in 
the profit and loss account.
The UK Companies Act requires goodwill to be reduced by provisions for depreciation on a systematic basis over a period chosen by 
the directors, it’s useful economic life. However, under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ goodwill is not amortised. Consequently the 
Company does not amortise goodwill, but reviews it for impairment on an annual basis or whenever there are indicators of impairment. 
The Company is therefore invoking a ‘true and fair view override’ to overcome the prohibition on the non-amortisation of goodwill in 
the Companies Act. 
Had the Company amortised goodwill a period of 20 years would have been chosen as the useful life for goodwill. The profit for the 
year would have been £0.6 million lower had goodwill been amortised in the year.
Tangible assets
Tangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment. Depreciation is not provided on 
freehold land. Depreciation is provided to write-off the cost of all other assets, less residual value, on a straight line basis over their 
estimated useful lives at rates which take into account commercial conditions at their location. Usual asset lives are as follows:
Freehold buildings 50 years
Plant and machinery 3 to 8 years
Fixtures, fittings and equipment
Building installations 20 years or lease period if lower
Fittings and equipment 3 to 8 years
Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years
Business systems software 4 years
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment of assets
Tangible assets with finite useful lives are tested for impairment at each reporting date where there is an indication that an asset may 
be impaired. Goodwill with an indefinite useful life is assessed at least annually. When an impairment test is performed, the recoverable 
amount is assessed by reference to the higher of the net present value of the expected cash flows (value in use) of the relevant 
cash-generating unit or asset and the fair value less cost of disposal. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered 
impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the profit and loss account in those 
expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Where an impairment loss has been recognised against an asset, it may be reversed in future periods where there has been a change 
in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised, but only to the 
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation 
or amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years. Such a reversal is recognised in the profit and loss account. 
This does not apply for goodwill, for which an impairment loss must not be reversed in any circumstances.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if there are indications that the carrying value may not 
be recoverable.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017

Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Other Information 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Leases
Operating leases are leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset and are not 
finance leases. Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Stocks
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value, after provisions for obsolescence. Cost includes all costs in 
bringing each product to its present location and condition, being the full manufacturing cost on a first-in, first-out basis, including all 
attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity.
Provisions
Provisions are recorded when the Company has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, for which it is 
probable that it will be required to settle by an outflow of resources and for which a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation 
can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision shall be the present value of the expenditures 
expected to be required to settle the obligation.
Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only on the occurrence or non-occurence of 
uncertain future events outside the Company’s control, or present obligations that are not recognised because it is not probable 
that a settlement will be required or the value of such a payment cannot be reliably measured. The Company does not recognise 
contingent liabilities but discloses them.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rates ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. All exchange gains and losses are 
taken to the profit and loss account.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument.
Trade debtors
Trade debtors are non-interest bearing and are stated at original invoiced amount less an appropriate allowance for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts. Such allowances are based on an assessment of debtor ageing, past experience or known customer exposures.
Trade creditors
Trade creditors are non-interest bearing and are stated at the original invoiced amount.
Loans and borrowings
Loans and borrowings are recognised initally at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and 
borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, and in respect of financial assets, less any impairment losses.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Spirent Communications plc Ordinary Shares 
held by the Company are classified in equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost and included as a deduction from retained 
earnings. Consideration received for the sale of such treasury shares is also recognised in equity.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Company uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage exposures arising on receipts and payments in foreign 
currencies relating to firm commitments.
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the contract is entered into, and 
are subsequently re-measured to fair value at each reported balance sheet date. The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange 
contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. The Company has not 
adopted the hedge accounting rules. Consequently all gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are taken to the profit and 
loss account.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts.
Financial Statements
Notes to the parent Company financial statements continued
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
154 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Pensions
The Company operates two funded defined benefit pension plans. All other pension plans are defined contribution in nature where 
the amount charged to the profit and loss account is the employer’s contributions paid or payable during the year.
For defined benefit pension plans, full actuarial valuations are carried out every three-years using the projected unit credit method, 
and updates are performed at each balance sheet date. Re-measurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of changes 
to the asset ceiling (if relevant) and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the balance sheet liability 
or asset with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Re-measurement 
recognised in other comprehensive income will not be reclassified to profit or loss. Past service cost is recognised in profit or loss 
in the period of plan amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net 
defined benefit pension liability or asset, taking account of any changes in the net defined benefit pension liability during the period 
as a result of contribution and benefit payments. Defined benefit pension costs are categorised as:
• Service cost (including current service cost, past service cost and gains and losses on curtailments or settlements);
• Net interest expense or income; and
• Re-measurement.
The Company presents the first two components of defined benefit pension costs in profit or loss.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Company, the revenue can be reliably measured and 
when the Company has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership. In addition, revenue is only recognised 
when collectability is probable.
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered. Revenue from maintenance 
contracts is recognised over the period of performance on a straight line basis.
Revenue from product sales of hardware and software is recognised at the time of delivery and acceptance and when there are 
no significant vendor obligations remaining. It is not until acceptance has occurred that the risks and rewards of ownership are 
transferred to the buyer. Terms of acceptance are dependent upon the specific contractual arrangement agreed with the customer.
Revenue from sales or usage-based royalties is recognised as the subsequent sale or usage occurs.
Contractual arrangements are accounted for as two or more separate transactions only where the commercial substance is that  
the individual components operate independently of each other, because they are capable of being provided separately from one 
another and it is possible to attribute reliable fair values to every component. To the extent that a separate component comprises  
a product sale of hardware or software, revenue is recognised as described above. Revenue is recognised on other components  
as the Company fulfils its contractual obligations and to the extent that it has earned the right to consideration.
Government grants
A government grant is recognised in the balance sheet initially as deferred income when there is reasonable assurance that it will be 
received and that the Company will comply with the conditions attached to it. Grants that compensate the Company for expenses 
incurred are recognised as other operating income on a systematic basis in the same periods in which expenses are incurred. Grants 
that compensate the Company for the acquisition of an asset are presented by deducting them from the acquisition cost of the related 
asset in accordance with IAS 20 ‘Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance’.
Product development
Research expenditure is recognised in the year in which it is incurred. Intangible assets arising on the Company’s various product 
development projects are recognised only if the recognition criteria of IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ are met.
Product development costs are expensed as incurred until the technological feasibility of the product under development has 
been established. Technological feasibility in Spirent’s circumstances occurs when a working model is completed. For software 
development, technological feasibility is not established until the process of developing the software is complete. After technological 
feasibility is established, additional costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life.
At 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 no amounts have met the recognition criteria.
Employee benefits
When an employee has rendered service to the Company during an accounting period, short-term benefits expected to be paid in 
exchange for that service are recognised in the same accounting period.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2017
155
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Other Information 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Share-based payment
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted. 
The fair value is determined using the Hull-White trinomial model.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised as a cost to the Company or as an addition to the cost of investment in the 
subsidiary in which the relevant employees work, over the vesting period of the equity-settled transactions with a corresponding 
adjustment to reserves. Any payments received from the Company’s subsidiaries in respect of these share-based payments result in 
a reduction in the cost of investment.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other vesting 
conditions are satisfied.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet 
recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
The Company has an employee share trust for the granting of certain share incentives to employees. Shares are held by the employee 
share trust, treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
Tax
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the profit and loss account 
except to the extent that it relates to items in other comprehensive income or equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable for previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
• where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill (taxable temporary differences only) or of an asset or 
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable 
profit or loss;
• in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related 
asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Dividends paid
The interim dividend is included in the financial statements in the period in which it is paid, and the final dividend and the special 
dividend in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.
Critical accounting assumptions and estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect items reported. Such 
estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best knowledge of current facts, circumstances and future events. Actual 
results may differ, possibly significantly, from those estimates. The areas requiring high degree of judgement or where assumptions

Defined benefit plans
i) Characteristics and risks associated with the Plans
The Company sponsors two funded defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom: the Spirent Communications plc Staff 
Pension & Life Assurance Plan (“Staff Plan”) and the Spirent Communications plc Retirement Cash & Life Assurance Plan (“Cash Plan”). 
These plans are funded and have full UK HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) tax-exempt approval. Both schemes are administered by 
a trustee board which is comprised of representatives from the employer, member nominated trustees and an independent trustee. 
The trustee board operates in accordance with the Trust Deed and Rules of each Plan and acts in the interests of all of its members.
• The Staff Plan is the Company’s most significant plan. It provides its members with retirement benefits based on their final salary 
and length of service. The Staff Plan was closed to new entrants on 1 October 2002.
• The Cash Plan is primarily a defined contribution arrangement, although there are some legacy defined benefits (Old Section) that 
have been valued for the purpose of these accounts in accordance with IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’. Members who left service 
before 1992 are entitled to a cash lump sum on retirement that is based on their salary and length of service. Members of the 
Old Section are entitled to defined contribution benefits, but with an underpin based on salary and length of service. The cash 
plan was closed to new entrants on 31 May 2016. 
There is also a United Kingdom unfunded plan, which consists of a contractual obligation for the Company to top up certain former 
employees’ benefits whose salaries exceeded the statutory earnings cap.
As with the vast majority of similar arrangements in the United Kingdom, the Company ultimately underwrites the risks relating to 
the defined benefit plans. These risks include investment risks and demographic risks, such as the chance of members living longer 
than expected.
The plans hold a significant proportion of their assets in equity. Strong future equity returns would be expected to reduce the 
Company’s future cash contributions (and vice versa).
Expected contributions to the defined benefit plans in 2018 are £5.1 million. This includes the contributions agreed with the funded 
plans’ trustees in accordance with UK legislation. Following the triennial valuations as at 1 April 2015, the Group has agreed to pay 
£5.0 million per annum into the Staff Plan from 1 July 2016, over a seven-year period, in order to clear the funding deficit as assessed 
by the trustees’ independent actuary.
If the contributions currently agreed are insufficient to pay the benefits due, the Company will need to make further contributions.

Approximately two thirds of the Staff Plan’s assets are held in a combination of LDI funds, cash benchmarked bonds and hedge funds. 
The objective of this allocation is to hedge against the plan’s liabilities, provide protection against inflation risk and to provide a level of 
investment returns in all market scenarios.
These funds have a wide investment remit and as such the investments of the funds may or may not be listed on recognised 
exchanges and markets and will be without restriction as to geographical, industrial or sectoral exposure. These funds may take both 
long and short positions and may utilise a broad range of derivatives. The funds’ investments may include sub-investment grade 
securities, corporate debt securities, gilts, sale and repurchase agreements, loans, and emerging markets debt and currencies.
The plans are prohibited from investing in Spirent’s own financial instruments.

The fair values of the quoted equity and debt instruments are determined based on quoted market prices in active markets whereas 
the fair values of the other assets are not. 
The Company has determined that it has an unconditional right to refund of surplus assets if the schemes are run off until the last 
member dies, on which basis IFRIC 14 does not cause any change in the balance sheet disclosures before tax.
For the purposes of the following disclosures, the Staff Plan and Cash Plan have been combined as the Cash Plan is immaterial to these

f) The key financial assumptions
The assumptions used for both plans using a weighted average were as follows:
2017
%
2016
%
Inflation – RPI 3.1 3.2
Inflation – CPI 2.0 2.1
Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 2.0 2.1
Rate of increase for pensions in payment pre 2001 service 3.6 3.7
Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2001 to 5 April 2005 service 3.0 3.1
Rate of increase for pensions post 5 April 2005 service 2.1 2.1
Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.0 2.1
Rate used to discount plan liabilities 2.5 2.8
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. The assumptions 
are such that a member currently aged 65 (2016 aged 65) will live on average for a further 22.7 years (2016 23.1 years) if they are male 
and for a further 24.6 years (2016 25.2 years) if they are a female. For a member who retires in 2037 (2016 in 2036) at age 65 (2016 age 
65), the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 24.1 years (2016 24.8 years) after retirement if they are male and for 
a further 26.1 years (2016 27.1 years) after retirement if they are female.
iii) Amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows
The approximate impact to the past service liabilities of changing these main assumptions is as follows:
• Reducing the discount rate by 0.1 per cent per annum would increase past service liabilities by £3.1 million (2016 £3.1 million)
• Increasing RPI inflation by 0.1 per cent would increase the plans’ liabilities by £1.1 million (2016 £1.2 million)
• Increasing the life expectancy of a member by one year (by modifying the standard mortality tables using an appropriate scaling 
factor) would increase past service liabilities by £10.3 million (2016 £9.4 million)
There will also be an impact on the future service cost but given the small active population in these plans this is likely to be insignificant. 
The sensitity analysis may not be representative of the actual change as the changes in assumptions may not occur in isolation.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 15 years (2016 15 years).
Defined contribution plans
The Company contributes to defined contribution pension plans for employees. Employer contributions for 2017 were £0.6 million 
(2016 £0.6 million).

The directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2017 of 1.73 pence per Ordinary Share 
(2016 1.80 pence), which will absorb an estimated £10.6 million of shareholders’ funds (2016 £11.0 million). The directors are also 
proposing a special dividend of 3.60 pence per Ordinary Share, which will absorb an estimated £22.0 million of shareholders’ funds.
The final dividend and special dividend will be paid on 4 May 2018 to Ordinary shareholders who are on the Register of Members at 
close of business on 16 March 2018. Payment will be made to ADR holders on 11 May 2018. No liability is recorded in the financial 
statements in respect of these dividends.
Dividends are determined in US dollars and paid in pounds sterling. The exchange rate for determining the amount of the final and 
special dividends to be paid for 2017 was $1.39: £1 (2016 $1.23: £1).

In 2017, no Ordinary Shares were transferred from the Spirent Employee Share Ownership Trust (“ESOT”) to satisfy options exercised 
under the 2005 Employee Incentive Plan (2016 nil).
There has been no material increase in the issued Ordinary Share capital, whether by exercise of share incentives or otherwise, 
between 31 December 2017 and 8 March 2018, the date on which these financial statements have been signed.
Please refer to note 29 of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements on page 144 for disclosures relating to the nature and 
purpose of each reserve within equity.
Investment in own Ordinary Shares

share incentive plans. At 31 December 2017, the Spirent Sharesave Trust held 0.5 million Ordinary Shares (2016 0.5 million Ordinary 
Shares) to satisfy awards made to United Kingdom-based employees under an all-employee share scheme. The market value of own 
Ordinary Shares held in trust, being in total 1.1 million Ordinary Shares (2016 1.1 million Ordinary Shares), at 31 December 2017 was 
£1.1 million (2016 £1.0 million).
Capital redemption reserve
During 2017, the Company did not cancel any Ordinary Shares (2016 nil) and did not make any transfers to the capital redemption 
reserve (2016 nil).
Employee share plans
The Company operates a number of employee share incentive plans which are described in note 30 of Notes to the consolidated

A list of subsidiaries, including the name, country of incorporation, registered office address and proportion of ownership interest is 
given on pages 166 and 167 of this Annual Report.
17. CAPITAL COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
There were no capital commitments at 31 December 2017 or 31 December 2016.
Spirent Communications plc has provided indemnities of nil (2016 nil) for certain ongoing business obligations under letters of credit for 
subsidiary companies.
The Company has received enquiries from the Direction Générale des Douanes et Droits Indirects (French Customs) in relation to the 
valuation and classification of imports into France but has not received a formal demand for unpaid duty and it is unclear whether a 
formal demand will be received. Spirent has adopted a duty tariff based on World Customs Organisation guidelines that potentially 
conflicts with European Union import regulations, resulting in a possible liability to the French authorities.
There is uncertainty with regard to not only the legitimacy of any potential claim, but also the appropriate tariff classification, the 
period in question, and both the population and valuation of goods potentially subject to duty. The determination of the amount of 
any liability in respect of unpaid duty and associated penalties and interest is therefore dependent on a number of significant inter-
related uncertainties and therefore the Company cannot reasonably make an assessment of the quantum of that contingent liability at 
the date of the signing of these financial statements. It is not practicable to state the timing of the payment due, if any, since no formal 
demand for unpaid duty has been made.
Due to the aforementioned uncertainties, the Company considers it possible, but not probable, that a settlement will be required.

claimed to have high robustness to delay jitter and packet losses. It has been developed in 3GPP 
and is described in 3GPP TS 26.441. The application areas of EVS consist of improved telephony 
and teleconferencing, audiovisual conferencing services and streaming audio.
Ethernet A family of networking technologies originally developed for local area networks, which migrated to 
metro area networks and eventually became the dominant standard in wireline networks worldwide.
Evolution-Data Optimised 
(EV-DO or EVDO)
A telecommunications standard for the wireless transmission of data through radio signals, typically 
for broadband internet access. EV-DO is an evolution of the CDMA2000 (IS-2000) standard that 
supports high data rates and can be deployed alongside a wireless carrier’s voice services.
Evolved Packet  
Core (EPC)
A framework for providing converged voice and data on a 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network to 
support user mobility, wireless data connections, routing and authentication.
Frequency division  
duplex (FDD)
A technique where separate frequency bands are used at the transmitter and receiver side.
Fuzzing A software testing technique commonly used to uncover security vulnerabilities in software, 
operating systems or networks by inputting large amounts of invalid, unexpected or random  
data to the system in an attempt to make it crash.
Global Navigation  
Satellite Systems (GNSS)
The standard generic term for satellite navigation systems that provide autonomous geo-spatial 
positioning with global coverage. GNSS allows users’ receivers to determine their location to within  
a few metres by employing a triangulation technique that uses information from multiple satellites.
Global Positioning  
System (GPS)
A global navigation satellite system operated by the United States government for determining  
a user’s location and height at any point on the earth’s surface. A receiver uses minute differences  
in measured time signals from clocks on satellites to calculate these positions and altitudes.
Internet of Things (IoT) A network of physical objects or “things” embedded with electronics, software, sensors and  
connectivity to enable data exchange with the manufacturer, operator and/or other connected  
devices. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able  
to interoperate within existing internet infrastructure.

Strategic Report      Corporate Governance Financial Statements Other Information Internet Protocol (IP) The primary network protocol used on the internet and on other network devices to facilitate and control 
the flow of data.
Internet Protocol 
Multimedia  
Subsystem (IMS)
A standardised next-generation architecture for telecoms operators who want to provide mobile and 
fixed multimedia services.
Jamming The intentional emission of radio frequency signals to interfere with the operation of a GNSS receiver 
by saturating it with noise or false information.
Lab-as-a-Service (LaaS) A cloud-based build and deploy environment to manage lab resources required by developers, testers, 
pre and post-sales support teams and others on an on-demand basis. LaaS is proven to reduce CapEx 
and increase lab user efficiency.
Long-Term Evolution (LTE) An advanced wireless data communications technology standard (sometimes called “4G”) which is an 
evolution of 3G UMTS standards. In addition to its wireless interface specification, LTE uses a simplified 
flat IP-based network architecture.
Multiple-Input Multiple-
Output (MIMO)
A wireless technology that employs multiple radio antennas on both the transmitter and receiver to 
improve the data transmission speeds and capacity of wireless networks.
Network Functions 
Virtualisation (NFV)
An initiative to provide a network production environment which lowers cost, raises efficiency 
and increases agility by hosting network functions previously carried out by proprietary, dedicated 
hardware on virtual machines running on industry-standard commodity hardware.
Radio Frequency (RF) A technology used for wireless broadcasting and/or communications that uses radio waves within 
the range over which they may be transmitted, from about 3 kilohertz to about 300,000 megahertz.
Software-as-a-Service 
(SaaS)
A way of delivering applications over the internet as a service instead of installing and maintaining 
software.
Software-Defined 
Network (SDN)
An approach to networking in which control is decoupled from hardware and given to a software 
application called a controller.
Spoofing An attempt to deceive a GNSS receiver’s estimate of its position or time by broadcasting counterfeit 
GNSS signals, structured to resemble a set of normal GNSS signals, or by rebroadcasting genuine 
signals captured elsewhere or at a different time.
Time Division  
Duplex (TDD)
TDD refers to duplex communication links where uplink is separated from downlink by the allocation of 
different time slots in the same frequency band.
Universal Mobile 
Telecommunications 
System (UMTS)
The most common 3G wireless technology globally, which uses wideband code division multiple access on 
its underlying air interface and offers support for data transfer rates from hundreds of kilobits per second to 
tens of megabits per second.

resources to simplify the way in which other systems, applications or end users interact with those resources.
Virtual Evolved Packet 
Core (vEPC)
A framework for virtualising the functions required to converge voice and data on 4G Long-Term 
Evolution (LTE) networks. vEPC moves the core network’s individual components from dedicated 
hardware to software that operates on low-cost commercial off-the-shelf servers.
Virtual Network  
Functions (VNF)
The implementation of a network function using software that is decoupled from the underlying hardware 
leading to more agile networks with potential Opex and Capex savings.
Voice over LTE (VoLTE) A standards-based scheme adopted by the GSMA, the cellular industry’s association, to provide voice 
service over data-only LTE networks. VoLTE’s use of an IP Media Subsystem enables voice to be offered
