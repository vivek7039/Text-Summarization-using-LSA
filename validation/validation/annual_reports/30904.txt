Construction
Annual Report 2017 Who we are
Morgan Sindall Group is a leading UK construction and 
regeneration group. We offer support at every stage of a 
project’s life cycle through our six divisions of Construction & 
Infrastructure, Fit Out, Property Services, Partnership Housing, 
Urban Regeneration and Investments.
What we do An overview of our market Our Group strategy
Our construction services 
include design, new build, fit out, 
refurbishment and property 
maintenance, working on 
standalone projects or through 
strategic alliances. In regeneration 
we work in close partnership with 
landowners, local authorities and 
housing associations to revive cities 
with mixed-use developments.
Four macroeconomic trends 
will support long-term growth in 
the Group: the housing shortage; 
investment in infrastructure; 
population growth; and pressure 
on the public sector to achieve 
savings in managing their assets. 
We target growing markets 
that match our expertise.
We specialise in construction 
and regeneration, investing cash 
from our construction activities 
in long-term regeneration 
programmes. This strategy is 
supported by our objectives of 
winning work, retaining talented 
people, a disciplined use of 
capital, maximising resources 
and innovating.

Our structure and approach Our core values and commitments How we manage our business
We are a decentralised 
organisation. Our divisions have 
the autonomy to meet the needs 
of their markets and the flexibility 
to innovate and react quickly to 
opportunities. The Group is also 
cohesive. Our divisions achieve 
synergies by sharing opportunities 
and collaborating on schemes.
We share one set of core values 
throughout the Group that guide 
our approach to everything we 
do. Aligned to these values, our 
Group-wide Total Commitments 
to being a responsible business 
support our strategy and are 
measured against performance 
targets.
We measure our performance 
using financial and non-financial 
performance indicators related to 
our strategic objectives. Principal 
risks are identified and managed 
at divisional and Group level. 
Our risk governance system is 
designed to ensure that risks 
are reviewed at every level.

MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 ——— 01
Strategic report Chairman’s statement
This is my second statement since joining the Group and I am 
pleased to report a strong performance in 2017. We have remained 
committed to our values and focused on delivering our strategy, while 
creating long-term benefit for all our stakeholders.
I have now completed my first full 
financial year at the Group. During the 
year I and the non-executive directors 
met with the divisional managing 
directors and their teams, and visited 
a number of their projects. This provided 
us with valuable knowledge of operations 
and assisted in our reviews of the 
divisions’ strategic plans.
Performance
The Group achieved growth in 2017 and 
ended the year with a robust balance 
sheet which gives us flexibility to invest 
in the business. Revenue for the year 
was up 9% at £2,793m (2016: £2,562m), 
with adjusted profit before tax up 46% 
to £66.1m (2016: £45.3m).
The cash performance of the Group 
has also remained strong, due to a 
disciplined monitoring of average 
daily cash levels together with our 
tight management of working capital.
Values and strategy 
Our core values and our Total 
Commitments to being a responsible 
business (set out on pages 15 and 17) 
are at the heart of our culture, supporting 
our strategic objectives and underpinning 
our performance. Every new employee 
is inducted in our core values, and 
encouraged to adopt them as part 
of their approach to work and their 
relations with colleagues and 
external stakeholders.
Daily average cash

(2016: £25m)
02 ———  MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017
Strategic report Our Total Commitments focus primarily 
on our stakeholders, and the importance 
of engaging with them is driven by the 
Board. Our directors communicate 
regularly with institutional investors and 
analysts, and deliver presentations at 
each results announcement (see page 
71). Our divisions develop stakeholder 
engagement programmes tailored to 
their individual businesses. More detail 
of these initiatives can be found in our 
operating review on pages 26 to 27, 
together with the results of a survey 
recently undertaken with our 
stakeholders on social and 
environmental issues.
We have stayed focused on our strategy 
of specialising in construction and 
regeneration, which is supported by the 
UK’s need for new housing, improved 
infrastructure and urban regeneration. 
Operating in both the public and 
commercial sectors, we continue to 
target markets where demand is stable 
or growing and our divisions have the 
experience and the ability to deliver 
what is needed.
Board changes
I would like to welcome Tracey Killen 
to the Board, who joined us in May 
as a non-executive director. Tracey is 
director of personnel at the John Lewis 
Partnership and brings expertise in 
strategy development, business planning 
and corporate governance. I believe 
Tracey’s significant commercial and HR 
experience will contribute valuable new 
skills, knowledge and insight to Board 
discussions. Tracey will become chair 
of the remuneration committee in 2018.
Simon Gulliford has decided not to 
stand for re-election at the 2018 annual 
general meeting, and will therefore be 
leaving the Board with effect from the 
conclusion of the meeting. I would like to 
thank Simon for his valued contribution 
to the Board and its committees during 
his time as a director.
Dividend
The total dividend for the year has been 
increased by 29% to 45.0p per share 
(2016: 35.0p), which includes a proposed 
increase in the final dividend of 32% to 
29.0p per share (2016: 22.0p), reflecting 
the improved result in the year and the 
Board’s confidence in the future 
prospects of the Group.
Looking ahead
Our 2017 results demonstrate our 
continued progress in executing our 
strategy and can be credited to the 
hard work of our 6,400 employees, 
who I would like to thank on behalf of the 
Board. To sustain these achievements, 
the Board will ensure that our divisions 
engage in continuous succession 
planning, training and development, 
as well as initiatives to increase our 
diversity and inclusiveness, so that 
we have the best people in place to 
deliver our strategy and growth over 
the long term.

MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 ——— 03
Strategic report Market overview
There are four fundamental long-term trends that will support growth 
in the Group over the next 10 to 20 years. We target sectors that are 
forecast to grow and our diverse portfolio of activities mitigates the 
impact of fluctuations within each market.
Long-term trends
Housing shortages Investment in infrastructure Population growth Constrained public expenditure
£15.3bn
new government financial support
£8bn
increase in government investment fund
65.6m
UK population at its largest ever
Cost efficiencies 
required in the 
public sector
The housing shortage has made buying 
a new home less affordable, costing on 
average more than seven times annual 
earnings (Office for National Statistics 
(ONS)). In its 2017 Autumn Budget the 
government pledged support to build 
300,000 new homes per year by the 
end of the current Parliament, including 
£15.3bn of new financial support over 
the next five years. As a result of the 
reduced affordability of new homes, 
more people are turning to renting, 
and the private rented sector market 
is projected to grow from 19% to 25% 
of all UK households by 2020 (FT).
Opportunities for the Group
■ To deliver mixed-tenure homes, 
including social and affordable 
housing, in partnerships with local 
authorities and housing associations.
■ To provide accelerated housebuilding 
through continued investment in 
modern methods of construction.
■ To build homes for sale and private 
rent which can be forward-sold 
to investors.
Investment in infrastructure remains 
a government priority to boost 
UK productivity. The government 
announced in its 2017 Autumn 
Budget that it will expand its National 
Productivity Investment Fund for 
2016-2021 from £23bn to £31bn 
to underpin its industrial strategy, 
support innovation and upgrade the 
UK’s infrastructure, including housing. 
The Budget also announced a £1.7bn 
Transforming Cities Fund to improve 
local transport connections.
Opportunities for the Group
■ To deliver for the transport, energy, 
education, health and defence sectors 
through Construction & Infrastructure 
and for the housing sector through 
Partnership Housing.
■ To regenerate areas around 
transport hubs.
The UK population is at its largest ever 
at 65.6m in July 2016 and is projected 
to grow to over 70m by 2026 (ONS July 
2017). The increase on the previous year 
was the largest since the 12 months to 
mid-1947, although the annual growth 
rate at 0.8% is in line with the average 
since 2005. The population is also getting 
older, with 18% aged 65 and over (ONS).
Opportunities for the Group
■ To develop and regenerate urban areas.
■ To deliver, upgrade and maintain 
social infrastructure, particularly 
in our targeted markets of housing, 
education, transport and healthcare.
■ To deliver supported housing for the 
elderly, through Investments.
Despite reduced borrowing, the 
government has stated that debt 
is still too high and “it is vital that the 
government continues to control public 
spending and improve the productivity 
of public bodies and services” (2017 
Autumn Budget). The public sector 
therefore requires services that help 
it reduce its expenditure.
Opportunities for the Group
■ To deliver increased efficiencies in 
public sector assets and services 
through all divisions, via standalone 
projects or positions on local and 
national public sector frameworks 
(see pages 28 to 47 for further details).
■ To regenerate areas related to public 
sector land disposals and property 
consolidation.
■ To provide funding solutions for local 
authority and NHS Trust development 
schemes via Investments.

Fit Out
Working in partnership with LOM architecture and design, a 1980s 
cash-handling facility was transformed into a state-of-the-art, co-working 
campus for tech start-up companies.
The building was stripped back to its original concrete frame and the upper 
floors divided into open plan accommodation, dedicated workspaces and 
cellular office space. The double-height basement provides a networking hub 
and event space with tiered seating, teaching facilities, media pods, meeting 
rooms and a bar. The original bank vault was retained and redesigned as a 
themed games room.
During the strip out, more than 1,200 tonnes of materials were removed, 
of which 97.5% was recycled.

Page width = 197mm Chief Executive’s statement
Our strong results are evidence of the significant operational 
progress being made across the Group. They are testament 
to the quality and commitment of our people.
The Group has delivered another 
strong year of growth in 2017, providing 
an encouraging platform for future 
progress across all divisions. Our result was 
driven by another excellent performance 
from Fit Out, with revenue growth of 
16% to £735m and significant margin 
improvement to 5.3% (2016: 4.3%), 
delivering operating profit of £39.1m, 
up 42% (2016: £27.5m). Construction 
& Infrastructure has made further 
operational progress with an improved 
operating margin of 1.5%, up from 0.7%, 
and operating profit up to £20.4m 
(2016: £8.9m). Progress in Property 
Services was impacted by restructuring 
costs in the year with the division 
making a loss of £1.3m, however this 
now leaves the division better placed 
to benefit from its secured workload 
in future years.
In regeneration, Partnership Housing 
increased its operating profit 5% to 
£14.1m (2016: £13.4m), although its 
performance was affected by lower 
mixed-tenure open market sales in the 
year and by cost escalation on a single 
design and build housing contract. 
Urban Regeneration reported operating 
profit of £10.0m (2016: £13.4m) which, as 
expected, was lower than last year but in 
line with its schedule of development 
completions. Investments made good 
progress with developing its portfolio 
of property partnerships, delivering 
a small profit of £0.5m in the year.
Our positive cash generation and 
increase in average net cash in the year 
has further strengthened our balance 
sheet and provides us with the flexibility 
to invest in our regeneration activities 
while allowing us to continue being 
highly selective with bidding in our 
construction activities.
Performance against strategy
We achieved our Group strategic 
objectives as outlined on pages 16 to 17. 
We have continued to target industry 
sectors within the UK where there is 
growth, and we have the capability to 
service areas of particularly high demand 
such as housing, infrastructure and urban 
regeneration, all of which are underpinned 
by firm government commitment.
Each of our divisions has succeeded 
in pursuing its business strategy. 
Construction & Infrastructure has 
continued to focus on operational 
delivery, contract selectivity and quality 
of earnings in its core sectors, securing 
appointments to a number of new public 
sector frameworks. Fit Out has continued 
to win work in its targeted sectors and 
secured places on two large public sector 
frameworks. Through Property Services 
we are currently delivering planned and 
response maintenance services to over 
25 social housing providers.
Partnership Housing made progress in 
developing partnerships with housing 
associations and local authorities, 
supported by its comprehensive 
research into development opportunities 
on underutilised public land. A highlight 
for the division was being formally 
awarded its largest ever project 
as a single phase, for the Defence 
Infrastructure Organisation. Urban 
Regeneration entered into an agreement 
with the Greater London Authority to 
develop a 2.2 hectare site in Canning 
Town through its English Cities Fund 
(ECf) joint venture and started on site 
with the fourth phase of its regeneration 
scheme in Warrington.
Investments’ successful regeneration 
programmes in Slough and Bournemouth 
are growing, and it has entered a new 
joint venture in the extra care sector. 
In addition, the division is continuing to 
provide collaborative opportunities for 
other parts of the Group through its 
schemes. More detail on the performance 
of our divisions can be found on pages 
28 to 47.
Our commitment to being a responsible 
business is integral to achieving our 
strategic objectives, as our activities 
affect a wide range of stakeholders. 
I am pleased to report that this year 
we achieved FTSE4Good Index Status. 
We have continued to reduce our 
greenhouse gas emissions and expect 
this trend to continue, but to avoid any 
complacency, we have set up a Carbon 
and Energy Action Group to drive 
best practice across the divisions.

See the health, safety and environment 
committee report on page 75 for

Looking to the future
The Group’s prospects look very 
positive for 2018 and beyond. While 
focusing on an appropriate level of risk, 
our committed order book was £3.8bn, 
up 6% from the previous year and up 1% 
on the half year position. Our regeneration 
and development pipeline also grew, up 1% 
to £3.2bn, providing longer-term visibility 
of activity for the regeneration divisions. 
In the year ahead we expect continued 
margin progression in Construction & 
Infrastructure, another strong performance 
from Fit Out, further growth from Urban 
Regeneration and Partnership Housing 
and positive contributions from Property 
Services and Investments. Consequently 
we are confident of another good year 
of progress and with this positive 
momentum, the Group is well-placed 
to deliver a result for the year which is 
slightly above our previous expectations.
John Morgan
Chief Executive
Our sustainability strategy for next year 
will include the adoption of science-based 
targets, and the UN’s sustainability 
development goals.
Health, safety and wellbeing 
We are committed to the health and 
safety of all who come into contact with 
our business. Over the past three years 
we have seen a significant improvement in 
our overall health and safety performance. 
In 2017 the number of RIDDOR
1
 incidents 
fell from 62 to 43, a reduction of 31%, 
and our accident frequency rate
2
 reduced 
from 0.14 to 0.09. We recognise that we 
need to remain focused on health and 
safety to try and reduce our RIDDOR 
incidents further.
During 2017 the Group supported a 
number of external UK programmes 
including the Health and Safety Executive’s 
‘Helping Great Britain work well’ strategy, 
Mental Health in Construction and a 
number of industry research projects 
including the University of East Anglia’s 
research on distributed workforces and 
Caledonian University’s research on 
worker engagement. See page 31 for 
examples of how we support mental 
wellbeing within the Group.
The Group health and safety forum met 
during the year to discuss key areas, 
including emerging technologies and 
the consideration of human behaviours 
in creating safe environments. In 2018, 
we will identify areas where we can 
develop more common approaches 
across the divisions, such as a Group-
wide focus on how best to promote 
occupational health, including mental 
health and wellbeing, and an in-depth 
look at high potential incidents to improve

Our order book increased 6% on 2016, 
with increases in most divisions. The quality 
of the order book was maintained with a similar 
proportion of work secured through negotiated, 
framework or two-stage bidding processes. 
We will continue to be selective in the work 
for which we bid in 2018.
See page 22 for a definition of regeneration 
and development pipeline.
Our pipeline was up 1% on 2016. The pipeline 
is long term with 67% relating to 2020 onwards. 
We continue to pursue regeneration opportunities 
which will contribute to the pipeline in future years.
The accident frequency rate is the number 
of RIDDOR reportable accidents multiplied 
by 100,000 and divided by the number of 
hours worked.
Our health and safety performance has 
continued to improve. We are encouraged to 
see a 36% reduction in the AFR and over the 
last 12 months, and our accident incident rate 
has also fallen from 330 to 216, a reduction of 
35%. We continue to review causation from 
incidents to develop our approach. As well as 
continuing our focus on safety, we have been 
reviewing how we can improve the wellbeing 
of employees through our work with the 
mental health charity, Mind.
This is the number of employees leaving the 
business voluntarily during the year divided 
by the average number of employees.
Over the last two years our employee 
turnover rate has improved significantly. 
We recognise that a certain level of turnover 
among employees is essential to ensure a 
regular injection of new ideas and approach. 
Our long-term target is to reduce employee 
turnover to 10%.
We are committed to developing a succession 
pool of talent across the Group. Offering 
employment opportunities to graduates and 
apprentices helps us to create and further 
develop these pools. In 2017 we sponsored 
21 undergraduates and supported 547 people 
through NVQs and professional qualifications. 
This KPI is calculated by dividing the 
total number of days of training provided 
to employees by the average number 
of employees.
We provide employees at all levels with the 
skills they need to advance their careers. In 
2017, 94 (2016: 101) employees completed our 
leadership development programme. As well 
as providing individuals with tools that will help 
develop their leadership skills, the programme 
provides an opportunity for them to network 
with colleagues from different divisions within 
the Group.

Operating cash conversion is cash flow 
(excluding investment in regeneration activities) 
as a percentage of adjusted* operating profit.
Cash conversion was strong during the year 
due to efficient working capital management. 
As expected, the percentage was lower than 
in the previous year, which benefited from 
a number of long-standing final account 
settlements. We continue to target operating 
cash conversion of close to 100% after allowing 
for changes in capital employed in regeneration 
schemes which often do not follow an 
annual cycle.
Return on capital employed is calculated as 
adjusted* operating profit less interest on 
non-recourse debt less unwind of discount 
on deferred consideration, divided by average 
capital employed.
The decrease in return on capital employed 
was in line with our expectations as we invested 
further capital into schemes that will deliver higher 
profits and return on capital employed in 2018 
and beyond.
Working capital is defined as inventories plus 
trade and other receivables, less trade and 
other payables, adjusted to exclude deferred 
consideration payable, accrued interest, 
capitalised arrangement fees and derivative 
financial assets and liabilities.
Our continuing focus on working capital 
management has enabled us to maintain 
this ratio at a similar level to 2016. No material 
change is expected in 2018 as the Group targets 
operating cash conversion of 100%.
Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage 
of revenue.
Our gross margin improved by 80bps, reflecting 
the higher quality of work secured as well as 
ongoing improved operational delivery. This 
trend is expected to continue as Construction 
& Infrastructure continues to progress towards 
delivering more normalised margins.
The ratio remained broadly unchanged on 
2016 as the overhead base grew in line with 
revenue. No material change is anticipated 
in 2018.
Carbon intensity is total carbon emissions 
as a percentage of revenue.
We continue to effectively manage our 
environmental impact and in 2018 we will 
roll out science-based targets to help drive 
further improvements in our management 
of carbon (see page 76).

Operating cash conversion is cash flow 
(excluding investment in regeneration activities) 
as a percentage of adjusted* operating profit.
Cash conversion was strong during the year 
due to efficient working capital management. 
As expected, the percentage was lower than 
in the previous year, which benefited from 
a number of long-standing final account 
settlements. We continue to target operating 
cash conversion of close to 100% after allowing 
for changes in capital employed in regeneration 
schemes which often do not follow an 
annual cycle.
Return on capital employed is calculated as 
adjusted* operating profit less interest on 
non-recourse debt less unwind of discount 
on deferred consideration, divided by average 
capital employed.
The decrease in return on capital employed 
was in line with our expectations as we invested 
further capital into schemes that will deliver higher 
profits and return on capital employed in 2018 
and beyond.
Working capital is defined as inventories plus 
trade and other receivables, less trade and 
other payables, adjusted to exclude deferred 
consideration payable, accrued interest, 
capitalised arrangement fees and derivative 
financial assets and liabilities.
Our continuing focus on working capital 
management has enabled us to maintain 
this ratio at a similar level to 2016. No material 
change is expected in 2018 as the Group targets 
operating cash conversion of 100%.
Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage 
of revenue.
Our gross margin improved by 80bps, reflecting 
the higher quality of work secured as well as 
ongoing improved operational delivery. This 
trend is expected to continue as Construction 
& Infrastructure continues to progress towards 
delivering more normalised margins.
The ratio remained broadly unchanged on 
2016 as the overhead base grew in line with 
revenue. No material change is anticipated 
in 2018.
Carbon intensity is total carbon emissions 
as a percentage of revenue.
We continue to effectively manage our 
environmental impact and in 2018 we will 
roll out science-based targets to help drive 
further improvements in our management 
of carbon (see page 76).

Strategic report Performance
Revenue for the year was up 9% at 
£2,793m (2016: £2,562m), with adjusted 
operating profit up 41% to £68.6m (2016: 
£48.8m). This resulted in an adjusted 
operating margin of 2.5%, a significant 
improvement of 60bps compared to 
the prior year. The net finance expense 
reduced to £2.5m (2016: £3.5m) due 
to a lower net interest charge on 
borrowings and, after deducting this, 
the adjusted profit before tax was 
£66.1m, up 46% (2016: £45.3m).
The tax charge for the year is £12.5m, 
which broadly equates to the UK 
statutory rate after adjusting for the 
impact of tax on joint ventures. Almost 
all of the Group’s operations and profits 
are in the UK, and we maintain an open 
and constructive working relationship 
with HMRC.
The adjusted earnings per share was up 
43% to 121.1p (2016: 84.7p), with the fully 
diluted adjusted earnings per share of 
114.8p up 39% (2016: 82.3p). The total 
dividend for the year increased 29% 
to 45.0p.
Details on performance by division

considering the financial performance of our divisions, the principal measure used by management is 
operating profit adjusted to exclude intangible amortisation. We believe that this makes it is easier to 
interpret financial performance between periods as the adjusted measure removes the distorting effect of 
the excluded item.

Strategic report Net cash
The Group’s cash performance has 
been strong with an operating cash 
inflow of £41.0m (2016: £179.9m) 
and free cash inflow of £27.1m (2016: 
£173.7m). As expected, this included 
further investment in inventories in 
regeneration activities as the Group 
started 2017 from a relatively low base 
following a large number of scheme 
completions in the fourth quarter of 
2016. The cash outflow for the year was 
£15.3m, resulting in closing net cash of 
£193.4m (2016: £208.7m). The average 
daily net cash for the year was £118.0m, 
compared to £25.0m in the prior year. 
This improvement was due to our ongoing 
focus on working capital management.
Financing facilities
We renewed our banking facilities 
during the year and now have £180m 
of committed loan facilities maturing in 
2022. The banking facilities are subject 
to financial covenants, all of which have 
been met throughout the year.
In the normal course of our business, 
we arrange for financial institutions to 
provide client guarantees (bonds) as 
security against the financial instability 
of the contractor prejudicing completion 
of the works. We pay a fee and provide 
a counter-indemnity to the financial 
institutions for issuing the bonds. As at 
31 December 2017, contract bonds in 
issue under uncommitted facilities 
covered £192.0m (2016: £227.7m) 
of our contract commitments.

of financial instruments is explained in

Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect our future 
development, performance and position, 
are set out in this strategic report. As at 
31 December 2017, the Group had net 
cash of £193.4m and committed banking 
facilities of £180m which are in place for 
more than one year. The Group has no 
pension funding requirements for its 
small defined benefits scheme that was 
closed to future accrual in May 1995. 
The directors have reviewed the Group’s 
forecasts and projections, which show 
that we will have a sufficient level of 
headroom within facility limits and 
covenants over the period of 
assessment. After making enquiries the 
directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Thus, they continue to prepare 
the annual financial statements on the 
going concern basis. See page 60 for 
further information on the Group’s 
longer-term viability.

Strategic report Operating responsibly
As a Group, we endeavour to ensure that our activities 
are conducted in a responsible manner. Our five Total 
Commitments to being a responsible business support 
the delivery of our strategic objectives (see page 17).
In 2017, we reviewed the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) adopted by the United Nations in 2015 “to end 
poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all”. 
As part of our responsible business strategy, we have 
decided to adopt the following SDGs which are core 
to our Total Commitments:

and our application of the SDGs, please see our 2017 
responsible business report.
People
We aim to create a working environment where people feel 
respected, empowered and inspired. We help our employees 
learn new skills and gain new experiences to support their 
personal ambitions and drive the business forward.
We work with industry bodies and initiatives such as 
Construction United, Women into Construction and the 
5% Club, a national campaign to get more graduates and 
apprentices into the UK workforce. The table below shows 
the percentage of Group employees making up the 5% Club.
2017 2016
Apprentices 161 104
New graduates recruited 56 63
Sponsored students 21 116
Percentage of structured trainees 3.8% 4.8%
Our percentage of structured trainees in the Group has 
reduced in 2017, primarily due to a lower number of graduates 
recruited and sponsored. In addition to the structured trainees 
under the 5% Club, we have sponsored a further 547 people 
on NVQs and professional qualifications. We are committed 
to treating all our employees fairly and equally, without 
discrimination. A diverse workforce provides us with a deeper 
insight into different markets and the needs of our clients. 
Further details of our approach to inclusivity can be found in 
the nomination committee report on page 74.
Environment
We maintained our A- position in the CDP
1
 index, the highest 
score for a UK construction company, and achieved a 7.6% 
reduction in our carbon emissions for 2017, giving a total 
reduction of 55% against our 2010 baseline, which is a 
significant achievement. Details of our carbon emissions 
are set out in the health, safety and environment committee 
report on page 76.

Strategic report Stakeholder engagement
In order to ensure that our responsible 
business approach is both relevant and 
appropriate, we engage in continuous 
dialogue with our different stakeholders 
to help us understand their various 
needs. This is supported by formal 
stakeholder materiality and employee 
engagement surveys.
Materiality survey
We conduct regular surveys with our 
stakeholders to find out which issues 
are material to them. The results of the 
last survey were published in 2016. At 
the beginning of 2018, we surveyed all 
employees and over 1,300 external 
stakeholders (including customers 
and supply chain partners). Over a 
third of employees and a fifth of 
external stakeholders responded to the 
survey and early indications from the 
results identify the issues set out 
below as material to them.
Over the next few months we will be 
considering the impact of these results 
on our responsible business strategy. 
See our 2017 responsible business 
report for further information.

Investors
The executive directors undertake a 
programme of regular communication 
with institutional shareholders and analysts 
covering the Company’s activities, 
performance and strategy. In particular, 
presentations are made to institutional 
investors and analysts following the 
announcements of the full year and 
half year results. All shareholders are 
invited to the Company’s annual general 
meeting and the non-executive directors 
are available to meet with shareholders 
at any time.
Employees
We use regular newsletters, email 
notifications and briefing sessions 
to make our employees aware of our 
financial performance, including external 
factors and significant events and the 
potential impact of these on the Group’s 
performance. The Group has a ‘Next 
Generation’ panel of about 20 young 
people from across the Group who 
undertake two projects each year to 
help drive improvements in key areas. 
In 2017, the panel focused on how to 
improve employee retention among 
the Group’s younger employees. Their 
proposal of developing an induction video 
to explain the breadth of opportunities 
across the Group was adopted by the 
Group management team.
In addition, the divisions use a variety 
of ways to communicate with their 
teams about their divisional progress 
and ensure that they are aware of key 
business priorities. Employees are 
actively involved in driving continuous 
improvement using briefing groups 
and consultative meetings where open 
dialogue and feedback is encouraged. 
To reinforce this two-way approach, our 
divisions undertake employee surveys of 
their teams every two years. The results 
of the surveys are reviewed, shared with 
employees and acted on. All new 
employees receive a formal induction 
during which we explain the pivotal role 
of our core values in driving everything 
we do.
In 2017, our Fit Out and Investments 
divisions completed their employee 
engagement surveys. Together these 
surveys covered 13% of the Group’s 
employees. Feedback from these 
surveys and the subsequent action 
plans have been communicated to the 
employees of each division. Construction 
& Infrastructure, Partnership Housing, 
Urban Regeneration and Property 
Services will all undertake employee 
engagement surveys in 2018.

We are committed to developing 
long-term partnerships with high- 
quality suppliers and subcontractors. 
The Morgan Sindall Supply Chain 
Family consists of 379 (2016: 330) 
manufacturers and suppliers, and 
around 80% of materials used by 
the Group can now be traced back to 
members of the Supply Chain Family, 
which guarantees that they are 
responsibly sourced. Of the Group’s 
total spend on materials and plant 77% 
(2016: 71%) is covered by Group-wide 
agreements with our supply chain. We 
agree payment terms with our supply 
chain and have procedures in place 
to minimise late payments.
Each of our divisions operates preferred 
partner status programmes for their 
subcontractors. We aim to work with 
a smaller number of preferred partners 
in long-term relationships. Preferred 
partner status sets our expected 
standards and governs how we manage 
our supply chain performance, including 
both assessment and reward. It is only 
offered to those subcontractors that 
meet our high standards.
Customers
Our Perfect Delivery
1
 programme helps 
to ensure that we deliver our projects to 
the standard expected by customers as 
well as driving continuous improvement 
in our delivery. Each of our divisions 
actively engages with its customers and 
aims where possible to secure work on 
frameworks or from repeat business. On 
completion of each project, customers 
are asked to complete a questionnaire 
providing feedback on their experience 
of the division’s performance, the results 
of which are used to drive further 
improvements.
Local communities
Each of our divisions has dedicated 
engagement teams that are responsible 
for liaising with local communities and 
residents before and during our 
projects. Where appropriate, members 
of the local community are engaged in 
the development of particular projects. 
Our divisions also participate in various 
local outreach programmes which may 
include talks in schools or refurbishing 
community centres or public parks.
The following pages set out our 
operational and financial performance 
by division, including how their activities 
have created value for our stakeholders.

delivered an operating margin of 1.7% 
for the year, slightly up on the prior year. 
Its margin also showed a strong second

continued to grow its order book, up 
6% from the prior year to £1,377m 
(74% of the total by value), with the 
focus maintained on its key sectors of 
highways, rail, aviation, nuclear, energy 
and water. The Construction (including 
Design) order book was £478m (26% of 
total value), a reduction of 19% against 
the prior year. Consistent with its focus

in Salford Quays, and the division has 
started on site on the first of two 
projects totalling £47m for Liverpool 
City Council as part of its Paddington 
Village scheme, with the second due 
to start in mid-2018.
Construction was also appointed to 
a number of other new and renewed 
public sector frameworks during the 
year that offer future projects across 
its core markets. These include the new 
four-year Scape Group framework for 
public sector projects in the upper 
Midlands, covering the largest projects 
in the framework from £1m to £5m, and 
the new ESFA (Education and Skills 
Funding Agency) framework to build 
schools valued between £4.5m and 
£16m over four years.
Infrastructure
In highways, Infrastructure was awarded 
two Highways England Smart Motorway 
upgrade contracts in joint venture, on 
the M62 and M27 (worth more than 
£300m to the joint venture) while also 
securing four projects (Stanford le Hope 
Station Redevelopment, A414 Edinburgh 
Way, Stratton Park Phase 5 and A421 
Dualling) with a combined value of 
c£32m as part of the Eastern Highways 
Alliance framework. The division also 
won its first project under Transport 
for London’s £500m civils projects 
framework, the c£15m upgrade of Old 
Street roundabout. In addition, work 
continued on the c£100m repair of the 
M5’s Oldbury viaduct (in joint venture). 
Thames Tideway Tunnel 
Work began in 2017 on the construction phase of 
the seven-year, £416m project to deliver the western 
section of the Thames Tideway Tunnel, or ‘super sewer’, 
in joint venture with BAM Nuttall and Balfour Beatty. 
When complete, the tunnel will greatly reduce the 
39m tonnes of untreated sewage that currently 
flows into the River Thames in a typical year, and 
equip London’s sewers to cope with the city’s 
demands well into the next century.

under London Underground’s £350m 
Civils and Tunnelling Works framework, 
a c£20m train modification unit depot in 
Acton. Additionally, a c£18m project 
was awarded by Network Rail for the 
electrification of the Stirling, Alloa and 
Dunblane lines to improve journey times 
for passengers travelling to Edinburgh 
or Glasgow. 
In aviation, key projects secured include 
a c£30m project from IAG Cargo and 
British Airways to construct a cargo 
building at Heathrow Airport, 
incorporating an automated 
handling system.
In energy, Infrastructure secured a 
c£30m joint venture project for Scottish 
and Southern Energy Networks (SSEN) 
to design and build approximately 
18.5 km of new overhead lines in 
northern Scotland, and a separate 
£3.5m contract to install c9 km of 132kV 
cabling. The division was also awarded 
a £23m project related to National 
Grid’s IFA2, a high-voltage, direct 
current interconnector cable running 
between England and France. In water, 
projects awarded include a c£14m water 
quality improvement project at Irton 
Water Treatment Works in Scarborough, 
under the Yorkshire Water framework. 
Infrastructure was also appointed 
to places on multiple lots of the £1bn 
YORcivil2 framework, set up to deliver 
civil engineering and construction works 
for local authorities and other public 
sector bodies across the Yorkshire 
and Humber regions. The framework 
is scheduled to run for four years with 
a possible two-year extension and with 
an estimated total value of £324m for the 
North and East framework and £720m 
for the South and West section.
Divisional outlook
Looking ahead, Construction & 
Infrastructure will continue to focus on 
margin improvement and securing higher 
quality work with the appropriate risk 
balance. The target for Construction 
(including Design) is an operating margin 
of 2%, while the target for Infrastructure 
is an operating margin of 2.5%. 2018 
is expected to show further progress 
towards these targets, supported by 
the quality of core sector work in the 
division’s secured order book.
Progress against 2017 strategic priorities
Develop and retain talented people and 
increase diversity and inclusiveness
New initiatives included an online 
‘People Portal’ for employees, two 
virtual careers fairs and a ‘returnships’ 
programme to attract people back into 
the sector after a career break. Our 
proportion of women has increased to 
18.6% (2016: 17.7%) and voluntary staff 
turnover reduced to 10.3% (2016: 12.4%).
Construction
Select projects based 
on capability, relationships, 
procurement route and risk profile
Over 90% of new work came via 
preferred procurement routes, and 
work continues to flow from the Slough 
regeneration with Investments (see 
page 47). We secured places on three 
Scottish local authority frameworks 
and a five-year partnership with 
Brighton & Hove Council.
Focus on core markets of education, 
health and defence and selected 
projects in the commercial and 
industrial markets
Of work secured in 2017, 68% came 
from the public sector and 22% from the 
private regulated sector. Our ‘My School’ 
design, used in the ESFA Priority 
Schools Building Programme, is now 
being used on projects for Rhondda 
Cynon Taf and Cardiff Councils.
Infrastructure
Continue to drive safety, 
including health and wellbeing
Our safety performance improved 
significantly in the year and we adopted 
the ‘Readiband’, a wrist-worn device 
that monitors daily fatigue levels and is 
currently being used by 100 employees.
Focus on productivity and efficiency 
to ensure delivery for clients and 
achievement of financial targets
We are increasing productivity and 
efficiency by concentrating on the 
basics of programming, cost, safety 
and quality.
Strategic priorities for 2018

took part in the 2016-2017 
Workplace Wellbeing Index, 
run by the mental health 
charity, Mind, and received 
their Bronze ‘Achieving 
Change’ award. In 2017 the 
division set up a continuous 
improvement group to focus 
on its occupational health 
and wellbeing strategy, 
introduced mental health 
first aiders and launched 
stress reduction workshops. 
Through its partnership 
with Mind, Construction & 
Infrastructure hosted the 
launch of ‘Thriving at Work’, 
a government-commissioned 
report on mental health 
and employers.

Fit Out delivered another excellent 
result, with revenue for the year up 
16% to £735m (2016: £634m), operating 
profit up 42% to £39.1m (2016: £27.5m), 
and operating margin increasing to 
5.3% (2016: 4.3%).
Of the total revenue for the year, 84% 
related to traditional fit out work (2016: 
81%), while 16% related to design and 
build (2016: 19%), a broadly similar split 
to previous years. In terms of the nature 
of work undertaken, the proportion of 
revenue generated from the fit out of 
existing office space reduced slightly to 
77% (2016: 82%), while the remaining 23% 
related to new office fit out (2016: 18%). 
Of the fit out of existing office space, 64% 
related to refurbishment in occupation.
By sector, the commercial office market 
remains the largest, contributing 84% of 
revenue (2016: 86%). However, there was 
a small change in overall balance in favour 
of higher education which accounted for 
12% of revenue, compared to 6% in the 
prior year. Retail banking, government 
and local authority work made up 
the remainder. 
Geographically, the London region 
remained the division’s largest market, 
accounting for 71% of revenue. Although 
this proportion was an increase from the 
prior year when 65% of total revenue was 
derived from London, this is not viewed 
as a significant trend.
Significant project completions in the year 
included an 85,000 sq ft office fit out for 
Network Rail in Birmingham, 64,000 sq ft 
for Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer at 
One New Bailey in Manchester, and 
42,000 sq ft for EY in Manchester. In 
addition, the division finished a three-

Fit Out is carrying out two major projects for Deloitte and 
Schroders, each involving the installation of an Intelligent 
Building Management System (IBMS). The IBMS will 
integrate multiple building management systems such as 
air-conditioning, lighting, room-booking, AV and catering 
services, and enable employees and visitors to control 
settings for the rooms they use. An intelligent building will 
run more efficiently, save energy and have a much reduced 
life cycle cost. The data collected by the IBMS can be used to 
design ways of further optimising the building’s performance. 
The Deloitte project is one of the first fit outs in the UK to 
target both a BREEAM Outstanding rating and a WELL 
Building Standard Gold certificate. A building certified by 
WELL will score highly against their benchmarks in ‘air’, 
‘water’, ‘nourishment’, ‘light’, ‘fitness’, ‘comfort’ and ‘mind’.

Strategic report refurbishment of 70,000 sq ft for Sony 
Playstation in Soho, London. Completed 
design and build projects include a 
collaborative workspace in Croydon for 
Superdrug, new London headquarters of 
global media company AMC Networks 
International, and an activity-based 
workspace for Costa Coffee at its 
recently-opened flagship roastery in 
Basildon, Essex. Work also continues 
on projects for Deloitte and Schroder 
Corporate Services in London (see 
page 33) and, in education, a £44m 
refurbishment for King’s College 
London (see opposite page).
Continued strong operational delivery 
and a focus on customer experience 
and better procurement has driven the 
increase in operating profit, up 42% to 
£39.1m (2016: £27.5m) and an operating 
margin of 5.3% (2016: 4.3%). Performance 
in the second half of the year was 
particularly strong, with an operating 
margin of 6.2%, compared to a first 
half margin of 4.3%, due to the blend 
of higher margin contracts and the 
operational leverage benefit from 
increased activity in the second half.
At the year end, the secured order book 
was £500m, an increase of 7% on the 
prior year end. Of this year end total, 
£468m (94%) relates to 2018 and provides 
significant visibility of workload for the 
year. This level of orders of £468m for 
the next 12 months is 14% higher than it 
was at the same time last year of £410m.
Key business wins during the year 
include the appointment to three lots of 
the £1bn Government Hubs Programme, 
a national framework run by the 
Government Property Unit, which 
will provide a four-year pipeline of 
opportunities. The division also secured 
a place on a £250m four-year framework 
to deliver improvements to the 
Metropolitan Police Estate in London 
and the South East for projects ranging 
from £2.5m to £10m, which will include 
the fit out of existing buildings, offices, 
stations and training facilities. Other key 
projects won include a 450,000 sq ft 
fit out for the Cabinet Office in Canary 
Wharf, London, a 57,000 sq ft fit out for 
Amazon in Cambridge, and a 400,000 
sq ft fit out for a leading asset manager 
in London, which started on site in 
January 2018.
Divisional outlook
Fit Out’s stated target is to deliver annual 
profit in the range of £25m-£30m. In 2017 
this target was significantly exceeded. 
Looking ahead to 2018, based on its 
strong order book and visible pipeline 
of opportunities through its various 
frameworks, Fit Out is expected to 
deliver a performance in excess of 
the top end of this range.
Market overview
Office lease break activity 
is continuing to generate 
opportunities, with over 40m 
sq ft of occupied floor space 
in London becoming subject 
to a lease event in 2017-2023
1
, 
and there is a pipeline of new 
office development in central 
London of 33m sq ft in 
2017-2021
2
. Despite the 
building activity, availability 
of Grade A office space in 
London and other cities 
remains low, encouraging 
occupiers to opt for 
refurbishment in occupation, 
a core expertise of our 
division. Opportunities are 
also arising from relocations 
out of London.
The higher education market 
continues to grow and we 
have built up a strong track 
record in large-scale schemes 
for clients such as King’s 
College London, University 
of Leeds and UCL. University 
refurbishments often stretch 
over three to five years, 
providing good visibility 
of future income.
Fit Out has the advantage of 
being the largest UK service 
provider of fit out and 
refurbishment in our sectors 
and the only one to provide 
real national coverage.

Progress against 2017 strategic priorities
Continue to deliver high quality work
The quality of work that Fit Out 
is delivering is evidenced by our 
increased revenue, with 7% of work 
in 2017 delivered through frameworks 
and 21% secured through negotiation 
rather than competitive bidding. 
Our Net Promoter Score at year 
end was 83%. 
Invest in and develop people
We increased investment in 
management development and NVQ 
training in 2017, and designed bespoke 
courses to support the delivery of 
exceptional quality. We also recruited 
for dedicated roles in our Foundation 
Programme for school leavers and 
graduates. Nineteen students, 
including six women, joined the 
programme this year, the largest 
cohort since it began in 2015. All seven 
‘Foundationers’ who completed the 
programme in 2017 have remained 
employed by the division and are 
currently mentoring new joiners.
Under 25s represent 7% of Fit Out’s 
workforce, compared to 5% in 2014. 
Our voluntary staff turnover rate 
reduced to 5.2% in 2017 despite a 
highly competitive market for 
talented people.
Invest in enabling technology
In 2017 we launched a new health 
and safety application, H&SPLUS, 
to improve safety on our sites. The 
app is used by our safety advisers 
and project managers during site 
inspections and data collected by 
the app is used to discuss high 
risk activities, provide feedback 
to subcontractors and share best 
practice. The app has been made 
available to all staff.

Property Services made an operating loss of £1.3m on revenue 
of £66m. Although revenue was up 20% compared to the prior 
year, the reported result was impacted by costs of £1.1m incurred 
on exiting its legacy insurance services business and £1.3m of 
costs relating to the streamlining of its contract portfolio by 
exiting underperforming contracts.
The committed order book has increased 22% to £836m, 
compared to £687m at the prior year end. Latest appointments 
include a £10m, five-year contract with housing association 
Optivo to deliver gas servicing, boiler replacements and 
heating upgrades for more than 8,000 homes in and around 
Croydon. Earlier in the year, the division secured a place on the 
£52m planned maintenance framework for Network Homes, 
which manages over 19,000 homes mainly in London and the 
Home Counties; a 10-year, £38m contract by social housing 
provider EastendHomes to provide repairs, maintenance and 
refurbishment services for 3,600 homes in Tower Hamlets, 
London; and a number of repairs and maintenance contracts 
for CityWest Homes, which manages properties on behalf of 
Westminster City Council, with a combined expected value 
of £219m over 10 years.
Under the £140m ‘Better Homes’ framework for Camden 
Council, Property Services is also currently delivering two 
internal works projects including 459 kitchen and 171 bathroom 
refurbishments, rewiring and heating system replacements; 
£7m of upgrades in the borough following fire risk assessments; 
and a £1m refurbishment to two residential blocks at the 
Gamages Estate in Hatton Garden. In addition during the 
year, £2m of extensive external refurbishment works to 
Flaxman Court, a six-storey block in Camden containing 
84 properties, were completed.
Divisional outlook
The target for Property Services is to grow its operating margin 
to at least 3%. Looking ahead to 2018, the strong order book 
is expected to deliver increased revenue and the operational 
leverage impact of additional volumes, together with the 
benefit of the restructuring undertaken this year, underpin 
the expected growth in margin towards this target.

in the UK, incurring an annual 
repairs and maintenance 
expenditure of £7bn
1
. The 
market is stable with no 
significant fluctuations in size 
or value over the past three 
years. Local authorities and 
housing associations remain 
open to integrated asset 
management contracts that 
combine planned works, 
repairs and maintenance, 
and compliancy services 
such as gas servicing into 
single contracts. We are 
well placed to meet these 
demands through our MSi 
property management 
software that drives down 
the need for responsive 
repairs. Local authorities 
and housing associations 
are seeing the benefits 
of longer-term contracts, 
providing us with greater 
forward visibility of revenue.

Revenue increased by 9% in the year 
up to £474m. Growth was driven by the 
division’s contracting activities, where 
revenue (including planned maintenance 
and refurbishment) was up 27% in the 
year to £290m (61% of divisional total). 
Mixed-tenure revenue was 10% lower at 
£184m (39% of divisional total), which 
was impacted by lower than expected 
sales completions in the fourth quarter 
of the year. 
In mixed tenure, 887 units were 
completed across open market sales 
and social housing, lower than the prior 
year number of 1,060. This was due in 
part to a lower number of sales than 
expected completing in the fourth 
quarter. The average sales price of 
£207k compared to the average of 
£192k in the prior year.
Operating profit increased to £14.1m, up 
5%, and resulted in an operating margin 
of 3.0%, down 10bps on the prior year. 
The lower margin was impacted by 
lower mixed-tenure open market sales

In mixed tenure, the regeneration and 
development pipeline increased 11% to 
£851m, supported by the committed 
order book for the contracting element 
in mixed tenure of £78m. The division 
currently has a total of 45 mixed-tenure 
sites at various stages of construction and 
sales, with an average of 102 open market 
units per site. Average site duration is 39 
months, providing long-term visibility 
of activity.
Work started on site at several 
developments in the year, including a 
£46m regeneration at Ponders End in 
partnership with the London Borough 
of Enfield, while progress was made on 
a number of ongoing schemes, including 
The Mill at Canton, Cardiff (see page 39) 
and Trinity Walk in Woolwich. The division 
was chosen for a £45m redevelopment 
in Hatfield, Hertfordshire to create c150 
new homes and a shopping parade for 
Welwyn Hatfield Borough Council. Key 
completions included the final 23 homes 
in a £25m development at Towcester, 
as part of a regeneration scheme 
being delivered in collaboration with 
Investments. As well as this, the division 
secured a number of mixed-tenure 
projects which ensure it is well placed 
for the future. These included Priorslee 
in the Midlands, a project for 220 homes; 
Lakeside Doncaster which comprises 
142 homes; Branston in Lincolnshire for 
73 homes; Beck Row in Norfolk which 
will see 117 homes being built; and 
Llantarnam in South Wales which 
will produce 78 homes. 
The division is continuing to develop 
partnerships with housing associations 
and local authorities, supported by its 
extensive research completed into 
underutilised government land. New 
partnership opportunities are being 
progressed with Clarion Housing Group, 
Flagship Housing Association and Home 
Group. The division was also appointed to 
two major frameworks: Homes England’s 
(formerly the Homes and Communities 
Agency) improved Delivery Partner 
Panel, DPP3, which runs for four years 
until 2021 and is used by a wide range 
of public sector bodies; and the £1.8bn 
Sanctuary Housing Group Framework 
set up to deliver 30,000 new homes 
over the next 10 years. 
In contracting, the secured order book 
increased 46% to £445m. Performance 
was adversely impacted by unexpected 
cost escalation and programme slippage 
on one design and build contract in 
London, which is due for completion 
in the first half of 2018. 
The division was formally appointed by 
the Defence Infrastructure Organisation 
on a £250m scheme to build 900 homes 
at Salisbury Plain for service families 
returning from Germany. Other 
appointments include the £6m phase 
three of the Nar Ouse Regeneration 
Area project to deliver 50 houses for the 
Borough Council of King’s Lynn & West 
Norfolk; and a £5m scheme for Hafod 
Housing, in partnership with Bridgend 
County Borough Council, to provide 48 
social rented homes in Bridgend, South 
East Wales. In planned maintenance and 
refurbishment works, the division secured 
a £10m improvement programme to 
three blocks of flats on the Lion Farm 
Estate in Oldbury, for Sandwell Council. 
Divisional outlook
The division’s target is to generate a return 
on capital employed of over 20%. Looking 
ahead to 2018, with its strong order 
book and pipeline and other identified 
partnership opportunities, the division 
is well placed to deliver further progress 
towards its returns target, at the same 
time as increasing overall profitability.
Market overview
Our main customer is the 
first-time buyer, and the 
gap in the housing market 
between supply and demand 
makes homes less affordable. 
Land is scarce and expensive, 
particularly in urban areas, 
but at the same time, a 
significant amount of public 
land is underutilised. Our 
strategy is therefore to 
identify underutilised public 
land (see case study below) 
and work in partnership 
with government bodies 
to develop it. This has the 
advantage of securing 
long-term access to land for 
development without the 
need to forward purchase.
So far our sales have not 
been affected by Brexit. 
Our continued investment 
into modern construction 
methods will help offset any 
labour shortages brought 
about by the change.

Unlocking land for new housing 
In 2017 Partnership Housing completed 
a large body of research into public 
land and built a comprehensive 
database of off-market development 
opportunities. The research provided 
evidence for a report into the housing 
crisis, produced by the independent 
think tank, Localis and co-funded by 
Partnership Housing. The report, 
launched by the Housing Minister in 
October, highlights the value of the 
public/private partnership model in 
progressing housing development.

Progress against 2017 strategic priorities
Pursue digital strategy, linking 
sales, design and construction 
Our augmented reality software 
system, that enables customers 
to select, reserve and customise a 
home online before meeting with 
the sales team, has helped 
increase the number and volume 
of sales in 2017 and resulted in 
a faster sales process. It also 
enables us to analyse buying 
patterns to inform the design 
and the rate at which new 
homes are built. In 2017 we 
launched a new customer 
relationship management 
system which will enable 
quicker responses to enquiries 
and efficiencies in reporting 
and data analysis. 
Increase sales outlets 
from 20 to over 30
Our total sales outlets at the 
end of the year was 28. This is 
lower than our target, as some 
sites did not progress as quickly 
as we hoped due to planning 
issues. These sites will come 
to market in 2018.
Create at least two strategic 
partnerships with housing 
associations or local authorities 
in every region
Most of our regions formed 
at least two partnerships with 
housing associations and local 
authorities. During the year we 
also focused on securing national 
partnerships with a variety of 
registered providers.
Achieve a minimum strike rate 
on land and contracting bids 
of one-in-three
Our win rates varied during 
the year. We are achieving a 
one-in-three win rate on larger 
contracting projects but less so 
on land bids due to the high level 
of competition. Our strategy has 
been to remain prudent in the 
current market to prevent 
overexposure to the open 
market sector.
Strategic priorities for 2018
■ Increase pipeline of 
government land
■ Form three national 
partnerships
■ Deliver an exceptional

■ by sector, 51% by value relates to 
residential, 30% to offices, and the 
remainder is broadly split between 
retail, leisure, and industrial.
Divisional outlook
The target for Urban Regeneration is to 
increase its ROCE
2
 towards 20%. Looking 
ahead to 2018, based upon the higher 
level of scheme activity and the current 
profile of scheduled completions, Urban 
Regeneration is expected to deliver 
increased profits from higher average 
capital employed and to make progress 
towards its target ROCE.
Market overview
The government continues to be very 
supportive of residential development, 
and a number of projects in our portfolio 
will benefit from funding through the 
£2.3bn Housing Infrastructure Fund. In 
London, mixed-tenure schemes can be 
developed faster by incorporating both 
private sale and private rental homes in 
a single phase. The northern region is 
experiencing a relatively strong city 
office market, and the growth in online 
retailing has resulted in the development 
of large distribution centres, with a 
positive effect on the industrial and 
commercial markets. With shops moving 
out of the high street, local authorities 
are challenged with maintaining the 
vibrancy of town centres, however it 
also releases land and development 
opportunities for new leisure facilities, 
restaurants and housing.
Operating from four offices across the 
country, we remain close to our markets 
and can react quickly to local trends. 
We manage risk by targeting a range 
of growth sectors. As at the end of 2017, 
our portfolio was split between 51% 
residential, 30% offices and 19% in retail, 
manufacturing, distribution and leisure.

The operating profit of £0.5m in the year 
was derived from a number of Investments’ 
partnership platforms, with the largest 
single contribution coming from the 
Milestone residential development, 
part of the SUR joint venture. 
Through its existing joint venture 
partnerships, significant progress was 
made in securing new opportunities 
and progressing current developments. 
Through the SUR joint venture, there are 
currently 10 projects under construction 
with a combined construction value of 
c£95m: two residential developments, 
three primary school extensions, one 
secondary school extension and four 
leisure projects. In addition, two new 
appointments were achieved: Slough 
Borough Council agreed to appoint 
SUR to deliver a major, mixed-use 
development on the former Thames 
Valley University site, and a deal was 
secured with Cycas Hospitality for a 
mixed-use development on the former 
site of Slough’s central library, including 
private residential apartments and two 
new hotels. 
In Bournemouth, through the partnership 
with Bournemouth Borough Council, 
the regeneration of the town centre 
has continued, including Berry Court in 
St Peter’s Road where 113 new private 
rental homes are under construction on 
the former site of an underused car park. 
The council also approved investment 
in a second residential development at 
St Stephen’s Road, which will provide 
46 high quality homes for market rent. 
In addition, a planning application 
has been submitted for a £150m 
redevelopment of Winter Gardens, a 
landmark site overlooking the seafront, 
currently used as a car park.

Market overview
As a result of continued cuts 
to their grant funding, local 
authorities, despite being asset 
rich, lack the income needed 
to fund their front line services. 
One solution is to redevelop 
underutilised land they own, 
either to directly provide those 
services, such as housing, or 
to generate revenue with 
which to fund services. The 
Naylor review of NHS estates 
published in March 2017 made 
similar recommendations for 
the NHS foundation trusts. Local 
authorities and NHS trusts without 
large, in-house estate teams are 
therefore seeking development 
skills from the private sector. 
We aim to provide our public 
sector partners with long-term, 
strategic advice at the earliest 
possible stages, to help them 
make the most effective use of 
their estates and generate lasting 
value for the communities 
they serve.

Investments has been working in partnership with Slough 
Borough Council over the past five years to regenerate the 
borough, through the Slough Urban Renewal (SUR) joint 
venture. This year SUR was appointed to deliver a mixed-use 
development on the former site of Slough’s central library, 
including two Marriott International hotels and 62 private 
residential apartments; and a planned mixed-use 
development on the former Thames Valley University site 
will potentially deliver 1,400 homes, 270,000 sq ft of Grade 
A office space, 50,000 sq ft of leisure and retail facilities 
and high quality public realm.
The programme has continued to generate work for other 
divisions, including Partnership Housing (the Milestone 
and Wexham Green residential developments) and Urban 
Regeneration (providing development expertise on the 
Thames Valley University site). Construction & Infrastructure 
has an order book of more than £50m over the next three

In early 2017, we secured £100m 
of funding from the Universities 
Superannuation Scheme for our 
HB Villages joint venture. During 
2017, £14m of this funding was 
deployed on four projects.
Progress projects within 
the development pipeline
We delivered 30 projects through 
our partnerships this year, with 
another 30 reaching contract 
close and starting on site, and 
15 achieving or being submitted 
for planning approval. STRIDE, 
the strategic estates partnership 
between Community Solutions, 
Burton Hospitals NHS Foundation 
Trust and Arcadis, signed an option 
to develop a health village on 
surplus hospital land to provide 
a range of health and social 
care infrastructure.
Develop a second 
institutional investor fund
We are currently in discussions 
with institutional investors to 
create and develop a second 
institutional investor fund in 
the extra care sector.
Strategic priorities for 2018
■ Create long-term capital 
platforms with investors
■ Progress projects within 
the development pipeline
■ Extend pipeline within 
existing platforms, and 
leverage successful track 
record in strategic partnering 
into new platforms
of Investments’ partners. Examples 
include the acquisition of a 50% stake 
in a joint venture with Ashley House plc, 
to focus on development activity in the 
extra care sector, into which Ashley 
House transferred its pipeline of extra 
care and supported living schemes with 
a development value of £200m to the 
joint venture; and a new strategic 
estates partnership with Oxleas NHS 
Foundation Trust to deliver its Strategic 
Estate Partnership (SEP) for an initial 
10-year period.
During the year, £143m of construction and 
regeneration work on schemes sourced 
by Investments was delivered across 
the Group (primarily by Construction & 
Infrastructure). A further £135m of work 
was secured for future delivery.
Divisional outlook
Looking ahead, Investments is expected 
to consistently deliver a positive return 
from its capital employed each year, 
as well as generating construction 
and regeneration work for the rest of 
the Group. Its medium-term target is 
to increase ROCE

 up towards 20%, 
however due to the phasing of its 
scheme developments, progress 
towards this target is not expected 
to follow a uniform profile.

balance sheet, continued focus on contract selectivity 
and no noticeable impact relating to Brexit.
Our approach
Risk is inherent in our business and 
cannot be completely eliminated if 
we are to achieve growth. Our risk 
governance model ensures that 
our principal risks and the controls 
implemented throughout the Group 
are under regular review at all levels.
Overview of the Group’s risk profile 
The UK’s decision to withdraw from the 
EU continues to generate uncertainty, 
however the economy has performed 
well in the reporting period and this is 
reflected in our trading position. It is 
still too early to predict the medium- 
to long-term effects of Brexit, and we 
are keeping a close eye on developments. 
We will adjust our strategy in response 
to any clear indicators, but are reassured 
that most of our regeneration schemes 
and a sizeable portion of our construction 
order book and pipeline are supported 
by public sector clients via frameworks 
and joint venture arrangements.
Our diversity of offering through 
construction and regeneration protects 
the business from cyclical changes 
in individual markets. Government 
commitments continue to support 
our business model: in house building, 
expected to be a primary growth driver, 
and in infrastructure, where our work in 
the public and private regulated sectors 
has longer-term visibility.
Based on current trading patterns, 
a strong balance sheet, high-quality 
secured order book and visible pipeline 
of opportunities, our outlook for 2018 
looks positive. All businesses remain 
focused on long-term partnerships, 
our favoured route to market with more 
predictable outcomes. Our regeneration 
activities are mostly non-speculative and 
underpinned by a long-term pipeline. 
Residential schemes have shown 
no short-term impacts since the 
referendum, with demand continuing 
to meet expectations. With relatively low 
interest rates and government support 
for housing, we are confident that the 
homes we build will continue to be in 
demand and affordable. Should the 
market change, the majority of our 
schemes are subject to economic 
viability conditions: future phases 
can be remodelled or deferred, which 
together with robust risk and capital 
controls would help mitigate negative 
fluctuations. Construction’s long-term 
focus on selectivity has significantly 
improved its risk profile, reflected in its 
outturn margin, cash and order book. 
Fit Out, while more susceptible to GDP 
fluctuations, has a strong secured order 
book for 2018 and beyond, providing 
higher visibility of future workload 
than in previous years.
In terms of resourcing our medium- 
and long-term plans, we have committed 
banking facilities until 2022, an improving 
cash profile and robust cash and capital 
controls in place. Voluntary staff turnover 
continues to fall and new people are 
being recruited who will help us 
achieve our strategic objectives.
This review should be read in 
conjunction with the viability 
statement on page 60.
Principal risks
The principal risks to the business are set 
out overleaf. They have been extensively 
reviewed but have not changed 
significantly in the reporting period. 
The list is not exhaustive but includes 
those risks currently considered most 
significant in terms of potential impact. 
The risks are set out as they relate to 
our Group strategic priorities, indicating 
any change in severity and likelihood of 
impacts compared to 2016 and describing 
mitigating actions being taken.
“Our diversity of 
offering through 
construction and 
regeneration 
protects the 
business from 
cyclical changes 
in individual 
markets.”

Group Board
The Board is responsible for risk management and assesses the principal risks to the Group that threaten our strategy and 
performance. For detailed information on our risk management and internal control governance, see pages 80 to 82.
Divisional boards Risk committee
In accordance with our decentralised philosophy, each 
division identifies the risks facing its business and takes 
measures to mitigate the impacts. Senior managers take 
ownership of specific risks and ensure that tolerance levels 
are not exceeded.
The risk committee consists of heads of key Group 
functions, including legal, company secretarial, IT, finance, 
internal audit, tax, treasury and commercial. The committee 
identifies risks for entering in the Group risk register. It also 
reviews both the Group and divisional risk registers before 
they are presented to the Board and audit committee.
Risk reviews Strategic planning Delegated authorities Divisional reporting
Twice a year every division 
carries out a detailed 
risk review, recording 
significant matters in its 
risk register. Each risk is 
evaluated, both before 
and after the effect of 
mitigation, on its likelihood 
of occurrence and severity 
of impact on strategy. The 
Group head of audit and 
assurance follows the same 
process for identifying and 
reviewing Group risks, 
conferring with the 
risk committee.
We view risk management 
as a fundamental part of our 
business planning process. 
Each year objectives and 
strategies are set that align 
with the risk appetite defined 
by the Board.
Our finance director and 
Group head of audit and 
assurance have produced 
a formal document which 
delegates approval for 
material decisions throughout 
the Group to appropriate 
levels of management. Such 
decisions include project 
selection, tender pricing, and 
capital requirements. Board 
approval is required before 
undertaking large, complex 
projects. The approval 
system is regularly reviewed.
The divisional risk registers 
record the activities 
needed to manage each 
risk, with mitigating 
activities embedded in 
day-to-day operations for 
which every employee 
has some responsibility. 
Rigorous reporting 
procedures are in place to 
monitor significant risks 
throughout the divisions 
and ensure they are 
communicated to the 
Group head of audit 
and assurance.
Internal audit Audit committee
The Group head of audit and assurance reviews and collates 
the divisional risk registers and draws from them when 
compiling the Group risk register.
The audit committee assists the Board in monitoring risk 
management and internal control, and formally reviews 
the Group and divisional risk registers before they are 
presented to the Board.

Mitigating activities Trend
Changes in the economy
The number of opportunities in our 
chosen markets could be reduced or 
become less profitable. Allocation of 
resources and capital to the pursuit 
of declining markets or less attractive 
opportunities would reduce the Group’s 
profitability and cash generation.
■ EU exit negotiations have to date 
had little impact in the UK market but 
longer-term effects remain difficult to 
predict and could affect both investor 
and consumer confidence.
■ The industry relies on a pool of EU 
labour in order to sustain construction 
output. To date we have not seen any 
significant impact, however this is a 
concern that we need the government 
to resolve.
■ The government remains committed 
to investment in housing supply 
and infrastructure.
■ This commitment complements our 
business model which is designed to 
provide a mix of earnings across 
different market cycles.
■ Opportunities have continued to 
flow in all our markets. There is high 
demand for our development and 
regeneration schemes (with high 
barriers to entry), which are now 
benefiting from historic investment.
■ Competition in construction remains 
high against a backdrop of lower 
growth and rising inflation. However 
we are being selective and our 
procurement routes, margins, 
contract terms and order book 
remain favourable.
■ Maintaining a high profile and competency 
in sectors identified for investment, such as 
infrastructure, housing and urban regeneration.
■ Monitoring changes in the economy, which 
helps us detect shifts in spending and adapt 
our strategy if necessary.
■ Strategic focus on market spread, geographical 
capability and diversification to protect against 
the cyclical effect of individual markets 
(see ‘At a glance’ section on the inside 
front cover and pages 4 to 5).
■ Business planning that focuses on markets and 
opportunities consistent with our risk appetite.
■ Committing only to viable development schemes, 
allowing us to maximise our residential portfolio 
while responding quickly to any market changes.
■ High proportion of our construction and 
regeneration order book secured with 
public sector and regulated entities.
■ Construction and regeneration divisions work 
together, adding value for clients and offering 
a scale of service that enables us to compete in 
areas with higher barriers to entry (see Slough 
regeneration scheme, page 47).
■ Regular monitoring and reporting of financial 
performance, work won, prospects and pipeline 
of opportunities.
No change
Exposure to UK housing market
The UK housing sector is strongly 
influenced by government stimulus 
and consumer confidence. If mortgage 
availability and affordability are reduced 
this could make existing schemes 
difficult to sell and future developments 
unviable, reducing profitability and 
tying up capital.
■ There continues to be clear 
government and cross-party 
support in terms of housing 
supply, policy and stimulus, which 
complements our business model 
and market positioning.
■ Sales volumes, pace and inflation 
across the regions have all generally 
held up during EU discussions in 
both the investor and private markets, 
albeit with some signs of plateauing 
in the London market.
■ Dialogue continues with local 
authorities and housing associations, 
not yet reflected in our pipeline.
■ We are well positioned to support 
current and future affordable and 
regeneration housing with high 
demand across our existing property 
portfolio.
■ Monitoring key UK statistics, including 
unemployment, lending and affordability.
■ A residential portfolio that targets and 
supports the government’s demand for 
housing supply and partnerships.
■ Rigorous three-stage approval process before 
committing to development schemes.
■ A constrained land bank, targeting option type 
agreements with owners that limit long-term 
exposure and boost return on capital employed.
■ Largely non-speculative, risk-share development 
vehicles, subject to viability conditions that 
minimise any negative impact from market 
fluctuations. 
■ High majority of schemes in partnership with 
the public sector and in regenerative areas 
that attract government funding.
■ Targeting forward selling sections of large-scale 
residential schemes to institutional investors.
■ Regular forecasting and monitoring of 
development pipeline and order book.
No change
Poor contract selection
In a volatile market where competition is 
high, a division might accept a contract 
outside its core competencies or for 
which it has insufficient resources.
Failure to understand the project risks 
may lead to poor delivery and ultimately 
result in reputational damage and loss 
of opportunities.
■ A significant proportion of our larger 
projects continue to be secured with 
longer-term repeat clients with whom 
we have good relationships and 
sensible terms.
■ Our forward order book continues to 
improve. It includes a high proportion 
of public sector and framework clients 
with typically healthier risk profiles.
■ We continue to be selective when 
bidding for contracts, enabled by our 
strong order book and cash position.
■ Having improved selectivity in 
Construction three years ago, we are 
now benefiting from a business with 
an improved risk profile delivering 
better outcomes. 
■ We have an enhanced understanding 
of medium-term pipeline quality, 
enabling us to predict trends more 
accurately and adjust our strategy 
in response.
■ Clear selectivity, strategy and business plan to 
target optimal markets, sectors, clients and projects.
■ Divisions select projects according to pre-agreed 
types of work, contract size and risk profile.
■ A multi-stage process of bid approval, including 
tender review boards, risk profiling and sign off 
by appropriate levels of management.
■ Staff planning and profiling to ensure appropriate 
levels of qualified resource for future work. 
u Maturing selectivity strategy and tools, delivering 
projects with improved outcomes and sustainable 
margins, and leading to repeat business.
■ Initiatives to select supply chain partners who 
match our expectations in terms of quality, 
sustainability and availability.
■ Regular reporting on sales, pipeline and 
order book, using customer relationship 
management software.
■ Communication of feedback from the 
supply chain.
■ A deliberately large proportion of projects 
conducted via framework or joint venture 
arrangements with repeat clients who share 
our philosophy and values, making predictable 
outcomes more likely.
■ Construction strategy and culture of prioritising 
bid selectivity over volume.

MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 ——— 59
Strategic report As required by provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the directors have assessed the prospects and financial 
viability of the Group and have concluded that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of the assessment. This assessment took account of the Group’s 
current position and the potential financial and reputational impact of the principal risks (as set out on pages 48 to 59) on the 
Group’s ability to deliver the Company’s business plan. This describes and tests the significant solvency and liquidity risks involved 
in delivering the strategic objectives within our business model. The assessment has been made using a period of three years 
commencing on 1 January 2018, which is consistent with the Group’s budgeting cycle. Most of the Group’s contracts follow a 
life cycle of three years or less and the majority of the Group’s secured and framework order book falls within this time period. 
The directors have compiled cash flow projections on a bottom up basis incorporating each division’s detailed business plans. 
At Group level, the base case financial projections assume modest revenue growth and an improvement in gross margin. 
Operating cash flows are assumed to broadly follow forecast profitability in the Group’s construction activities, but are much more 
independently variable in regeneration, driven by the timing of construction spend and programmed completions on schemes. 
In 2017 the Group secured £180m of new five-year committed revolving credit facilities replacing the previous facilities which 
were due to expire in 2018. Due to the continued strong cash performance of the Group, the new facilities were not utilised 
in the period, however they provide ongoing funding headroom and financial security for the Group throughout the period 
reviewed. The Group has no anticipated pension funding requirements as its closed defined benefits scheme is in surplus. 
The impact of a number of downside scenarios on the Group’s headroom against its committed facilities and the financial 
covenants thereon has been modelled based on the Group’s principal risks. The scenarios are focused on the risks that are 
scored as most likely to occur or that would have the greatest potential severity should they occur and include declining 
revenue, failure to improve gross margin from current levels, a decline in gross margin and deterioration in working capital, 
specifically client receivables. 
The Board has also considered a range of potential mitigating actions that may be available if one or more of the scenarios arose.

Corporate governance report
This report explains our approach to governance in practice and the work the Board has done throughout the year. It also includes 
reports from each of the committee chairs which provide detail on key matters addressed by the committees during the year.
Governance structure
The Board is responsible to all stakeholders, including our 
shareholders, for the approval and delivery of our strategic 
objectives to ensure the Group’s long-term success. 
Responsibility for developing and implementing our strategy 
and commercial objectives is delegated to the chief executive 
who is supported by the finance director and Group 
management team. The Board is our principal decision-
making body, and in line with the Code, delegates certain 
roles and responsibilities to its various committees. The 
committees assist the Board by fulfilling their delegated 
responsibilities, focusing on specific activities throughout the 
year, reporting to the Board on decisions and actions taken, 
and making any necessary recommendations in line with their 
terms of reference. The terms of reference of each committee 
comply with the provisions of the Code.
Day-to-day management of the Group is delegated to the 
executive directors, who are supported by the executive team 
and the Group management team (see pages 64 to 65 for 
details of the members). The Group management team meets 
regularly to consider operational matters affecting the Group as 
a whole. These include health and safety, strategy, the Group 
budget and our responsible business strategy. We also have 
several forums with representatives from across the divisions 
that report into the Board. These include a health and safety 
forum, HR forum, commercial directors’ forum and sustainability 
steering group. Each forum meets on a regular basis, focuses 
on specific topics, and acts as a channel for sharing ideas 
and best practice. The forums assist in ensuring that good 
governance is adopted at all levels throughout the Group.
UK Corporate Governance Code
As a UK premium-listed company, we have adopted 
a governance structure based on the principles of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code). In April 2016, 
the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) published the latest 
edition of the Code, which is available on its website at  
frc.org.uk. Further details of how we have applied the 
Code’s principles and complied with its provisions are set out 
in this report and the directors’ remuneration report.
The Board considers that it, and the Company, were compliant 
throughout the accounting period with the main principles and 
provisions of the Code applicable to premium-listed companies.

MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 ——— 67
Governance A formal programme of meetings is put in place each year 
to ensure that the Board is able to allocate sufficient time to 
each of the matters reserved for its decision-making. The 
programme allows the Board to plan its meetings while being 
sufficiently flexible to allow items to be added should they 
arise. This enables Board members to use their time together 
more effectively. The Board’s key activities in 2017 can be 
found in the panel below. There is a process in place whereby 
key matters can be escalated to the Board outside of the 
formal programme of meetings and the executive 
management keeps the Board updated with interim 
Board reports in between the regular meetings.
Key activities in 2017
Strategy
■ comprehensively reviewed progress against strategy; and
■ attended presentations from each divisional managing 
director on their strategic plans.
Risk management and internal controls
■ reviewed and monitored the Group’s safety performance; 
and
■ reviewed the appropriateness of the Group’s risk 
management framework.
Board effectiveness
■ reviewed the effectiveness of the Board as a whole, 
the Board’s committees and each individual director;

Board; and

accordance with the Modern Slavery Act;
■ approved the Group’s tax strategy;

Strategy day
Every year the Board holds a strategy day in October to 
review the Group’s five-year strategic plan and each of the 
divisional strategic plans and priorities. In 2017, as part of this 
review, the chairman, chief executive and a non-executive 
director met with the managing directors of each division 
to discuss their divisional strategic plans in detail prior to the 
meeting in October. Each non-executive director provided 
a summary to the Board of their findings on strategy.
Divisional meetings
Following the 2016 Board review it was agreed that the 
non-executives would gain a deeper understanding of each 
division and the divisional teams through additional visits. 
Prior to the review of each division’s strategic plan, the 
chairman and the non-executive directors each made two 
visits to the division whose strategic plan they would be 
reviewing. These visits included site visits to at least one 
project per division.
In June 2017, the Board held an evening reception with the 
directors and senior management teams of the Construction 
business and in October the Board held a dinner with 
the Group management team. These events allowed the 
non-executive directors to meet operational managers 
and discuss a range of topics in a less formal setting.
Senior management team conference
The chairman and two of the non-executive directors 
attended our senior management conference in October, 
which gave them an opportunity to meet around 80 
managers from across the Group and gain insight into 
how best practice is shared between the divisions. The 2017 
conference focused on how we can deliver outperformance, 
including examples from the divisions.
Culture
Our culture is fundamental to the successful delivery of 
our strategic objectives. The Board ensures that the tone is 
set from the top and the executive directors ensure that our 
core values are embedded throughout the Group by meeting 
regularly with all divisions, attending and participating in their 
staff conferences and running sessions at the leadership 
development programme, where participants are asked to 
consider what the core values mean for them individually 
and for the Group as a whole. The Board regularly monitors 
various indicators of our culture which include our health and 
safety performance, matters raised through our independent 
whistleblowing hotline, called Raising Concerns, employee 
turnover and stakeholder engagement (see page 26). 
Following the Sharesave invitation sent to employees in April 
2017, the Board is pleased to report that participation in the 
Sharesave plan now stands at over 42% of eligible employees. 
At the forthcoming annual general meeting (AGM), the Board 
will propose a resolution to shareholders to approve plan rules 
for a new Sharesave plan as no further awards can be made 
under the existing plan.
Our measures for ensuring good corporate governance 
practice across the Group include regular internal audit reviews, 
encouraging employees to speak up and taking appropriate 
action where behaviour does not meet expectations.
68 ———  MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017
Governance Corporate governance report
— continued In addition to formal meetings, the Board meets informally 
several times a year to allow the directors to spend more 
time together and discuss specific areas of the business with 
the Group management team and other senior executives. 
Tracey Killen visited various divisions as part of her induction. 
More information on the informal meetings is set out in the 
panel on the previous page.
Attendance
Attendance of individual directors at scheduled Board 
and committee meetings in 2017 is set out below. Sufficient 
time is given at the end of each meeting for the chairman to 
meet privately with the senior independent director and 
non-executive directors to discuss any matters.
The chairman met formally with the non-executive directors 
on seven occasions in the year without the executive directors 
present. No material issues were raised at any of these meetings.

■ Effectiveness
Composition
As at the date of this report, the Board consists of the 
chairman, two executive directors and four non-executive 
directors. Biographical details of each of the directors are 
given on pages 62 to 63. Tracey Killen will be standing for 
election at the 2018 AGM as this is the first AGM following her 
appointment. Simon Gulliford has advised the Board that he 
will step down as a non-executive director at that AGM and 
therefore will not offer himself for re-election. In accordance 
with the Code, all of the other directors will stand for re-election 
at the forthcoming AGM.
All of the non-executive directors are considered by the 
Board to be independent in character and judgement and 
no cross-directorships exist between any of the directors. 
Individually, each director acts in a way they consider will 
promote the long-term success of the Group for the benefit 
of, and with regard to, the interests of its various stakeholders.
See the nomination committee report on pages 72 to 74 for 
further information.
Development, information and support
Newly appointed directors receive a detailed information pack 
describing our values and culture and governance matters 
relevant to the Group, and participate in a comprehensive and 
tailored induction programme which includes visits to our 
divisions and meetings with senior divisional management. 
Following Tracey Killen’s appointment to the Board in May 2017, 
her induction programme contained each of these elements, 
detailed further overleaf. 
Training on the role and responsibilities of directors is offered 
on appointment and subsequently as necessary. The chairman 
reviews on an annual basis each of the director’s training 
undertaken and any development needs.
MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 ——— 69
Governance Ongoing training and development
This includes:
■ briefing papers;
■ divisional visits;
■ strategic planning and review;
■ one-to-one meetings with management;
■ e-learning; and
■ external seminars.
The regular presentations from management and informal 
meetings included in the Board programme increase the 
non-executive directors’ understanding of the Group and the 
construction and regeneration industries. During the year the 
non-executive directors met individually with members of the 
management team and visited projects on site.
The company secretary provided updates to the Board during 
the year on relevant governance matters, new legislation and 
its impact on the Company. This included further information 
on the requirements under the gender pay gap and payment 
practices reporting obligations, the Criminal Finance Act 2017, 
the General Data Protection Regulation and the Modern 
Slavery Act. The audit committee regularly considers new 
accounting developments through presentations from 
management and the external auditor (see page 78). 
All Board members completed the Group’s e-learning module 
on Directors’ duties that was rolled out in the third quarter of 
2017. Further details can be found on page 82.
There are agreed procedures by which directors are able to 
take independent professional advice, at the expense of the 
Company, on matters relating to their duties. The directors 
also have access to the advice and services of the company 
secretary, who attends all Board and committee meetings.

each committee.
Discussion held by 
the whole Board 
and agreement 
of areas of focus. 
The 2017 evaluation questionnaire focused on the Board’s effectiveness and that of the audit, nomination and remuneration 
committees. Due to changes in the membership of the HSE committee during the year, the Board decided to postpone the 
evaluation of this committee until 2018. The results of the 2017 evaluation confirmed that the Board and each of the committees 
debate and spend adequate time on the right topics and that each of the directors are given the opportunity to participate fully 
and overall are operating effectively. There were, however, areas identified for future focus by the Board which are highlighted 
in the table on the following page.

Governance Corporate governance report
— continued Topic Area of focus Actions
Corporate 
reputation
Consideration of corporate reputation, its 
enhancement and the risks surrounding it.
Board to review the long-term opportunities and trends 
influencing the Group as part of the 2018 strategy review.
Succession 
planning and 
diversity
Ensure there is appropriate succession 
planning for key Board members and 
senior executives.
Board will continue to monitor and engage with potential 
leadership talent across the Group for future succession. 
Delegation of 
Board authority
Review and update where necessary 
the schedule of matters reserved for the 
Board and the delegation of authorities 
across the Group.
Board reviewed and approved these documents at the 
Board meeting in November.
Risk appetite 
framework
Consideration of how each divisional 
managing director assesses and manages 
risk and reward in each of their divisions.
Board agreed to review its appetite and approach to risk 
as part of its 2018 Board agenda. 
Training Continuing training and development 
of directors.
Each director is responsible for ensuring they are up to 
date with legislation and best practice and will submit an 
annual declaration of training undertaken during the year.
Through an internal evaluation and appraisal process, the chairman provided feedback to each executive and non-executive 
director on their individual contributions to the Board, reviewed with each of them the training they had undertaken during 
the year, and considered development priorities individually tailored to each director’s experience and role. In particular, the 
chairman reviewed the continued independence and value provided to the Board by Patrick De Smedt and Simon Gulliford 
who have both served on the Board for more than six years. The senior independent director reviewed the chairman’s 
performance with the other directors and subsequently met him to provide feedback. Overall, no significant issues 
were highlighted in the feedback given to each director and the chairman.
■ Relations with shareholders
The Board recognises its responsibility to our shareholders 
and wider stakeholders. Further information can be found 
in our strategic report on pages 25 to 27.
Engagement
The chair of the remuneration committee held meetings 
with various shareholders to discuss proposed changes to 
our remuneration policy in early 2017 (see page 83 in the 
remuneration report for further information). The chairman 
and the non-executive directors are available to meet with 
shareholders to listen to their views, although no such 
meetings were requested in the year. 
The executive directors undertake a programme of regular 
communication with institutional shareholders and analysts 
covering the Company’s activities, performance and strategy. 
In particular, presentations are made to institutional investors 
and analysts following the announcements of the full year and 
half year results. Written feedback from these meetings and 
presentations is distributed to all members of the Board.
Capital Markets event and site visit
In June 2017 a Capital Markets event was held for analysts 
and investors, followed by a site visit to a Partnership Housing 
development in Woolwich. The series of presentations and 
a tour of the site provided a more detailed insight into our 
regeneration activities in Partnership Housing and 
Urban Regeneration. 
Drinks reception
A drinks reception was hosted in London in November 2017 
which was an opportunity for financial analysts and institutional 
investors to meet with the divisional managing directors.
Division visit
In November 2017 one of the Company’s institutional investors 
visited Urban Regeneration to obtain an update on the division’s 
development activities in Salford Central.
AGM
We encourage all shareholders to use the AGM as an 
opportunity for effective communication with the Company. 
The AGM also provides a valuable opportunity for the Board 
to communicate with private shareholders. Shareholders are 
invited to ask questions related to the business of the meeting 
and have the opportunity to meet all the directors informally. 
All directors normally attend the AGM and all serving directors 
plan to attend the 2018 AGM. Shareholders unable to attend 
are encouraged to vote using the proxy form mailed to them 
or sent electronically as detailed in the notice of meeting. As in 
previous years, at the forthcoming AGM each of the resolutions 
put to the meeting will be taken by voting on a poll.
The directors believe that a poll vote is more representative of 
shareholders’ voting intentions because shareholder votes are 
counted according to the number of shares held and all votes 
tendered are taken into account. The results of voting at general 
meetings, including proxy directions to withhold votes, are 
published on our website.

■ Effectiveness
Succession planning
Board
The Board takes succession planning for its members seriously. 
We believe we have good balance and diversity among our 
non-executive directors with each of them having highly relevant 
skills, derived from serving in a range of executive and non-
executive positions throughout their careers. As part of the 
Board evaluation process undertaken during the year, the 
Board reviewed the skills needed to deliver our Group strategy 
and whether the Board had all the appropriate skills. A similar 
process was undertaken as part of the Board’s succession plan 
review. The committee also considered the overall structure 
and balance of the Board, including the length of tenure of the 
existing non-executive directors. The Board recognises the value 
and independence that the longer-serving directors continue to 
bring. The committee is satisfied that the Board has the required 
balance of skills and that appropriate succession plans are in 
place across the Group for future Board appointments.
During the year, Liz Peace resigned as a non-executive director. 
In determining the right type of candidate, the committee 
considered the skills, experience and time commitment 
required for the role, and the length and tenure of the existing 
non-executive directors. The committee noted the length of 
tenure of Patrick De Smedt as non-executive director and chair 
of the remuneration committee and concluded that the new 
non-executive director should have the requisite skills to 
succeed Patrick as remuneration committee chair during 2018.
The committee appointed a sub-committee consisting of 
the chairman, the chief executive and the senior independent 
director to manage the recruitment of a new non-executive. 
Following a review of potential headhunters, the sub-committee 
appointed Zygos Partnership. The sub-committee identified a 
shortlist of candidates from a selection of individuals suggested 
by Zygos Partnership and, following meetings with each of 
these candidates, identified a further shortlist for the other 
Board members to meet. After completing the comprehensive 
process, the Board was delighted to appoint Tracey Killen as 
a non-executive director on 5 May 2017. Tracey’s significant 
commercial and HR experience will bring new skills, knowledge 
and insight to Board discussions and be of great benefit to the 
Board and the Group. Tracey became a member of the audit, 
nomination and remuneration committees following her 
appointment. Zygos Partnership does not provide any other 
services to, or have any connection with, the Company.
Our non-executive directors’ tenure on the Board as at the 
year end was as follows:
Board tenure non-executive Number Percentage
< 1 year 1 20
1 to 2 years 1 20
2 to 3 years 1 20
7 to 8 years 1 20
8 to 9 years 1 20
MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 ——— 73
Governance Wider Group
During 2016, the executive directors reviewed the short-term 
succession arrangements for the Group management team 
and in 2017 the committee reviewed its processes for 
monitoring succession planning across the Group. As 
mentioned above, the committee also considered the skills 
required across the Group and the ongoing development of 
these skills through talent and training programmes. Due to 
the diverse nature of our activities the committee reviewed 
the divisional succession and talent development plans 
individually and in the context of our Group strategic 
objective to develop and retain talented people. We have 
an overarching leadership development programme in place 
which provides core and consistent leadership training for 
about 500 senior employees across the Group. In addition, 
each of the divisions has its own specific training programmes 
incorporating both technical and broader business training 
specific to their divisions and employees’ requirements and 
professional development. These training programmes 
range from apprenticeships for different skills to supporting 
employees through professional qualifications. Where 
practically possible each division seeks to consider existing 
employees for new roles and development opportunities and 
in 2017, 8% of employees across the divisions were promoted 
internally. Simon Smith’s appointment as managing director 
for Infrastructure when Nick Fletcher resigned was as a result 
of being previously identified as a potential candidate within 
the division’s succession plan.
Diversity
In June 2017, the Board adopted a diversity policy which sets 
out its commitment to inclusivity and equal opportunity within 
the Board and among all employees in the Group. Female 
representation on the Board in 2017 was 14%. As set out in 
its diversity policy, the Board ensures that the selection 
processes for Board candidates will provide access to a 
diverse range of candidates. Appointments will be made on 
merit and without resorting to quotas, but with due regard 
for the benefits of diversity on the Board, including gender.
We believe that a diverse workforce reflecting different skills 
and experience at all levels is critical for innovation and ensuring 
that we benefit from the broadest range of ideas and expertise. 
As part of the Board’s ongoing commitment to provide 
leadership on inclusion, during 2017 we continued to include 
a ‘people report’ in the Board meeting papers, covering key 
statistics and details of activities undertaken by each division 
to improve inclusivity and diversity. These included activities to 
broaden the range of skills, industry experience, gender, race, 
disability, age, nationality and other attributes which can enhance 
the contribution of the divisions and the Group as a whole.
At the November 2017 Board meeting, the Board reviewed 
the results of the Group’s gender pay gap. Our median gender 
pay gap of 31% provides a benchmark that enables the Board 
to drive improvement in inclusivity and diversity across the 
Group over the next couple of years. The Board is satisfied 
that the results are not due to any equal pay issues within 
the Group, but are attributable to the lack of women in senior 
positions. While 21% of the Group’s employees are women, 
only 8% of our senior managers (those attracting the highest 
levels of remuneration) are female. To address this, the Board 
will implement a range of activities in 2018 that will help drive 
greater inclusivity and diversity across the Group. These 
activities will include:
■ undertaking further detailed analysis of our data to 
ascertain whether or not we have any underlying issues 
that are impacting the percentage of women employed in 
the Group and the percentage in senior positions, and to 
identify specific actions to address them if appropriate; 
■ introducing an e-learning module on inclusivity;
■ introducing anonymised shortlists as part of our 
recruitment process;
■ tracking underrepresented groups’ employment experience 
with the Group; and 
■ undertaking a review of our ethnic pay gap in conjunction 
with our annual gender pay gap review.
2018 priorities and performance review
The committee’s performance was assessed as part of the 
Board’s annual effectiveness review. It was concluded that 
all members of the committee play an effective role and that 
the committee manages the process of appointments to the 
Board effectively. During 2018, the committee will continue 
to focus on:
■ succession planning for the Board as a whole;
■ reviewing succession planning in the divisional 
management teams; and
■ reviewing progress against our activities to improve 
inclusivity and diversity across the Group.

Liz Peace (until 4 May 2017)
Responsibilities
The committee is responsible for the following:
■ assisting the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities 
in relation to health, safety and environment (HSE) matters 
and making recommendations to the Board for any changes 
considered necessary;
■ assisting the Board in reviewing our Group strategy with 
respect to HSE matters;

regulatory environmental obligations (including CRC 
(carbon reduction commitment) compliance) and how 
compliance with these and with applicable laws and 
regulations is ensured across the Group;
■ receiving and reviewing periodic HSE reports of the Group’s 
performance; and
■ reviewing our responsible business strategy and 
performance against our Total Commitments.
The principal purpose of the committee is to focus on our 
health and safety culture in order to drive better behaviour 
and performance in this area. It also aims to support the 
existing Group health and safety forum and divisional health 
and safety teams.
The committee’s terms of reference, setting out its duties, are 
available on our website.
Activities during the year
The committee has an annual work plan, developed from 
its terms of reference, which includes standing items 
considered at each meeting together with any additional 
matters the committee has decided to focus on. The 
divisional managing directors are responsible for HSE 
issues within their respective divisions and for providing 
the committee with information for its consideration at 
each meeting. Monthly monitoring and reporting to the 
Board includes a report from the Group commercial 
director on the Group’s performance in relation to health 
and safety matters as well as a verbal report from the HSE 
committee chair following each meeting. Further details 
are included in the chief executive’s statement on page 15 
and the risk review on pages 52 to 53.
In 2017, the committee met four times to review our strategy 
with respect to HSE matters and carried out one site visit. 
Details of attendance at meetings are disclosed on page 69.
A summary of the committee’s other principal activities in 
2017 is as follows:
■ reviewed divisional health and safety performance 
during the year;
■ continued to review our approach in respect 
of occupational health, particularly in respect of 
assisting employees in identifying and managing 
mental wellbeing issues;
■ carried out a site visit;
■ reviewed our environmental reports;
■ monitored our performance as a Group against 
HSE targets and KPIs; 
■ reviewed our performance against the Total 
Commitments; and
■ reviewed the committee’s terms of reference.
Safety
We have well-established safety systems designed to 
minimise the risks of health, safety and environmental 
incidents occurring as a result of our activities. These systems 
include tool box talks, detailed method statements, health and 
safety briefings at induction, site visits, detailed investigation 
of all incidents, regular training and updates. 
We are committed to achieving a continuing reduction in 
the number of incidents on sites and to protecting those 
who work on and visit our projects. Overall, the committee 
is encouraged by the continued improvement in the Group’s 
accident frequency rate in 2017 (see page 18). During the year, 
a number of trials and initiatives were put in place by each of 
the divisions in connection with improving workplace safety 
and wellbeing, which will be reviewed by the committee 
during 2018. These included the use of new technology and 
a trial to change behaviours to help improve safety at work. 
MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 ——— 75
Governance Each division sets its own strategy and targets focusing on 
areas that are relevant to its business within an overarching 
framework. At the end of 2017, our health and safety forum 
reviewed and updated this framework. From 2018, it will cover 
three key strategic areas: severity, mental health and wellbeing. 
Divisional strategies and targets are reviewed and approved 
by the committee and learning is shared by the divisions. 
Site visits
As mentioned in the 2016 annual report, on 12 January 2017 
the committee made an unannounced visit to a Construction & 
Infrastructure project in Birmingham. The committee was 
impressed that health and safety was demonstrably a key 
priority on the project. For example, tarmac had been placed 
on all walkways around the site prior to construction to reduce 
the level of mud and potential slippages. In addition, all external 
barriers had been pre-fitted with cladding to avoid the risk of 
falls from height by cladding the barriers after they were in place. 
In January 2018 the committee also made an unannounced visit, 
to a Construction & Infrastructure ice arena project in Slough. 
Health and wellbeing
The committee reviewed management plans to improve health 
and wellbeing across the Group. All employees have access to 
an employee assistance programme that provides confidential 
counselling and support on a variety of issues. During the year, 
each of the divisions continued its focus on occupational 
health, particularly mental health and wellbeing. These initiatives 
included wellbeing clinics and health surveillance programmes. 
Work was also undertaken during the year in Construction & 
Infrastructure surrounding fatigue management (see page 31). 
Environment
We are committed to reducing energy consumption across the 
Group and in our supply chain. During the year, the committee 
reviewed the Group’s performance in reducing our environmental 
impact. Highlights of our activities in 2017 included:
■ creating a climate action group to develop science-
based targets;
■ retaining our A- score in the CDP index;
■ decreasing the Group’s carbon intensity measure by 15%; 
■ reducing our total waste produced by 20% to 687,803 
tonnes (2016: 860,209 tonnes);
■ diverting 89% of total waste from landfill (2016: 90%);
■ reducing construction waste by 23% to 99,704 tonnes 
(2016: 129,691 tonnes); and
■ increasing the percentage of construction waste diverted 
from landfill to 96% (2016: 94%).
Managing our emissions
Our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been calculated 
based on the ISO 14064-1:2006 standard. Emissions reported 
correspond with our financial year and include all areas for 
which we have operational control in the UK, excluding joint 
ventures. The materiality threshold has been set at a Group 
level of 5% with all operations estimated to contribute more 
than 1% of the total emissions included. No material emissions 
have been omitted from this report.
Emissions have been calculated using data gathered for the 
recertification audit of the Group’s energy data by supply 
chain risk management company, Achilles, under its Certified 
Emissions Measurement and Reduction Scheme (CEMARS). 
Emission factors are from the Department for Environment, 
Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) conversion factor guidance current 
for the year reported. All data has been verified by Achilles.
Emissions are predominantly from bulk fuel used on sites, 
our vehicle fleet and electricity use. Our target is to reduce 
our absolute emissions by 26% by 2020 from a baseline of 
the data set as at 31 December 2010. Our Group director of 
sustainability and procurement is responsible for the delivery 
of this target.

For further details on the Group’s environmental performance 
see our 2017 responsible business report.
Responsible business strategy
During the year, our sustainability steering group decided to 
review our responsible business strategy to take account of 
the United Nations Development Programme’s Sustainable 
Development Goals (see page 25 for further details). In addition, 
the steering group agreed to undertake a materiality survey in 
2018 to ensure that our responsible business strategy and the 
sustainable development goals that we had agreed to adopt 
remained relevant and appropriate. The committee therefore 
decided to postpone its review of the responsible business 
strategy to its meeting in March 2018. Although the review of 
the strategy was not undertaken during the year, the committee 
did monitor the Group’s performance over the last 12 months 
against our Total Commitments. Overall, this performance 
was positive, although further work is needed to embed the 
use of Local Multiplier 3 (LM3) for assessing the social value 
contribution made on our projects.
Looking ahead
In 2018, the committee will continue to challenge each of the 
divisions to seek continual improvement in managing and 
reducing the number of safety incidents. This will include:
■ a review of data collected by the divisions in respect of high 
potential incidents;
■ a review of any actions needed to protect the health and 
wellbeing of employees;
■ rolling out an independent personal financial education 
programme across the Group during the first half of 2018. 
This programme is provided by an independent third party 
and is not affiliated to any financial product; and
■ reviewing and approving any amendments to our 
responsible business strategy and our overarching 
health and safety policy framework.

Further information on the work of the committee during the year including full descriptions of the risk management and internal

Financial and business reporting
The committee’s detailed review of the year end position 
by reference to the year end accounts assisted the Board in 
making the going concern statement set out on page 23. In 
line with the Code, the committee considered and approved 
the key assumptions in the long-term viability statement 
(see page 60 for further information).
Fair, balanced and understandable assessment
One of the key compliance requirements of the Code is 
for the Board to confirm that the annual report and financial 
statements (annual report), taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy (see the strategic report from the 
inside front cover to page 60). To enable the Board to make 
this declaration, a formal review is embedded in the year end 
process to ensure the committee and the Board as a whole 
have access to all relevant information and, in particular, 
management papers on significant issues faced by the Group.
The committee receives a paper from the company secretary 
detailing the approach taken in preparing the annual report.
The committee and the Board as a whole receive drafts of 
the annual report in sufficient time to facilitate their review and 
enable them to challenge the disclosures where necessary. In 
addition, the Group’s external auditor reviews the consistency 
between the narrative reporting of the annual report and the 
financial statements.
Application of accounting policies, judgements and estimates
In carrying out its duties, the committee is required to assess 
whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted and 
to challenge the robustness of significant judgements and 
estimates reflected in the financial results. This process 
involves reviewing relevant papers prepared by the finance 
team in support of the policies adopted and judgements 
and estimates made.
These papers are discussed with the finance director, the external 
auditor and, where appropriate, the Group head of audit and 
assurance. In addition, the committee reviews the year end 
report to the audit committee from the external auditor based 
on the work it performed and findings from the annual audit.

The matters considered by the committee during the year are listed below.
Issue Basis of assurance Conclusion
Contract revenue, margin, 
receivables and liabilities
The recognition of revenue 
and margin on long-term 
contracts in the financial 
statements, and the 
associated contract 
receivables and payables, 
require management to 
make estimates.
In addition to updates on the key contract issues at Board 
meetings, at which management identify any significant 
differences in contract valuations that exist with either client 
or supplier, the committee has reviewed the status of these 
key contract issues at each audit committee meeting. The 
committee also reviewed the analysis undertaken by 
management on the areas of difference between current 
accounting standards for revenue recognition and IFRS 15 
(‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’), which will be 
applicable for the Group’s 2018 financial statements. 
Based on its review 
and discussions with the 
management team and 
external auditor, the 
committee concluded that 
the treatment of contract 
revenue, margin, receivables 
and payables in the financial 
statements is appropriate.
Impairment of goodwill The value of goodwill is supported by a value-in-use model 
prepared by the management team. This is based on cash 
flows extracted from the Group budget and strategic plan, 
which have both been approved by the Board. The committee 
reviewed and challenged the management team on the 
assumptions used in the value-in-use model.
Based on its review 
and discussion with the 
management team and 
the external auditor the 
committee was satisfied 
that the value of goodwill 
is appropriate.
Valuation of shared 
equity loan receivables
The valuation of shared 
equity loan receivables is 
reliant upon the assumptions 
made by the management 
team and the accompanying 
valuation model.
Key assumptions include the discount rate, redemption rates and 
house price inflation. The committee reviewed and challenged 
the management team on the supporting assumptions used 
in the valuation of shared equity loan receivables.
Based on its review 
and discussion with the 
management team and 
the external auditor the 
committee was satisfied 
that the supporting 
assumptions used 
remain appropriate.
Going concern The committee reviewed papers supporting the going 
concern assessment which was compiled based on the latest 
management forecasts and covers the next 12 months. In 
addition a number of sensitivities were considered to determine 
the effect on headroom against our committed facilities. The 
review has been performed in conjunction with the viability 
statement assessment which covers a 36-month period.
Additionally, the committee discussed each issue with the 
external auditor and sought its opinion based on the work 
it performed during the audit.
Based on its review and 
discussions with both the 
management team and our 
external and internal auditors, 
the committee is satisfied 
that, after raising appropriate 
challenges, the judgements 
outlined above are reasonable 
and that the appropriate 
disclosures have been included 
in our consolidated financial 
statements.

Governance Auditor
External auditor’s independence and effectiveness
The committee oversees the Company’s relationship with 
the external auditor. To ensure that the external auditor 
remains independent of the Company it carries out an 
annual assessment of the auditor’s independence along with 
an appraisal of its qualifications, expertise and resources. To 
fulfil these obligations, the committee reviewed the external 
auditor’s presentation of its policies and safeguards to ensure its 
continued independence within the meaning of all regulatory 
and professional requirements and that the objectivity of the 
audit engagement partner and audit staff had not been 
impaired. In addition, key members of the audit team rotate off 
the Company’s audit after a specific period of time. The previous 
audit engagement partner, Mark Beddy, rotated on completion 
of the 2016 audit and was replaced by Makhan Chahal, a 
senior audit partner with over 20 years’ experience, who leads 
Deloitte LLP’s business, infrastructure and professional services 
audit team. Those policies and safeguards, together with the 
Company’s own policies on engaging the external auditor for 
non-audit work and employment by the Company of former 
employees of the external auditor, enabled the committee to 
confirm that it was satisfied with Deloitte LLP’s continued 
independence and objectivity. The committee noted that, 
during the year, Fit Out commenced work on a contract for 
the fit out of a new building for Deloitte LLP in London. The 
committee was satisfied that given the contract was awarded 
after a competitive procurement process carried out at arm’s 
length, auditor independence is unaffected.
As part of its responsibility for assessing the effectiveness 
of the external audit, the committee discussed the external 
audit plan at the committee meeting held in July 2017 and 
reviewed progress against the audit plan at the meeting 
held in November 2017, noting at that time the significant 
accounting issues being addressed by the external auditor. At 
the meeting prior to the announcement of the full year results, 
the committee reviewed the external auditor’s fulfilment of the 
agreed audit plan and the major issues highlighted as part of 
the external audit. In addition, the internal evaluation on the 
external audit process was undertaken with the assistance of 
the Group head of audit and assurance and senior members 
of the Company’s and the divisions’ finance teams. The feedback, 
which covered matters including the quality of the process, 
the adequacy of resources employed by the external auditor, 
its communication skills and its objectivity and independence, 
was then reviewed by the committee as part of its assessment 
of the external auditor’s effectiveness. No issues arose in the 
course of these reviews which impacted the effectiveness of 
the external auditor.
Reappointment of external auditor
Deloitte LLP has been the Company’s auditor since the Group 
was established from the reverse takeover of William Sindall 
plc in 1994 and the audit has not been put out for tender since 
that time. There are no contractual obligations which restrict 
the committee’s choice of external auditor. The committee 
has noted the requirements of the Competition & Markets 
Authority 2014 Order and The Statutory Auditors and Third 
Country Auditors Regulations 2016 that all public interest 
entities are required to conduct an auditor tender at least 
every 10 years and to rotate their auditors after at least 20 
years. While not subject to the provisions set out within the 
Code for FTSE 350 companies, the committee has taken into 
account the formal regulatory tender requirements that form 
part of UK law and confirms that the Group intends to put the 
external audit contract out to tender during 2020 to take 
effect from the conclusion of the 2020 financial year end at 
the AGM in 2021. Having regard to the considerations referred 
to above, the committee has satisfied itself that Deloitte LLP, 
the external auditor, remains independent and effective. 
The committee has recommended to the Board that a 
resolution proposing the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as 
external auditor be put to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.
Policy on the auditor providing non-audit services
The Company’s policy on the engagement of the external 
auditor for non-audit related services which applied during 
the 2017 financial year complies with the EU audit directive 
and regulation. 
The Company’s policy is designed to ensure that the provision 
of non-audit services does not impair the external auditor’s 
independence or objectivity. The policy applies to the Company 
and all its wholly-owned subsidiaries and provides guidance 
on the type of work that is acceptable or prohibited for the 
external auditor to undertake, and the process to be followed 
for approval. The categories of services that are prohibited are 
in line with the legislation and preclude Deloitte LLP from 
providing certain services such as valuation work and preparing 
accounting records and financial statements. For other services 
not falling within the prohibited services list, the external auditor 
is eligible for selection by the Company provided that its skills 
and experience make it competitive and the most appropriate 
supplier of these services. Permitted services can be carried 
out by the external auditor subject to the advance approval 
of the finance director or, if the fees for such services exceed 
a threshold of £50,000, the advance approval of the audit 
committee chair. In 2017, Deloitte LLP did not provide any 
non-audit services that required the approval of the committee.
The fees for non-audit services during the year are set out in 
note 3 to the consolidated financial statements on page 124 
and total £22,800 (2.6% of the audit fee) in respect of town 
planning advice in relation to a planning application for one 
of the Group’s regeneration schemes. The committee has 
reviewed the nature of the work and level of fees for these 
services and concluded that they have not affected Deloitte 
LLP’s objectivity or independence.
Risk management and internal controls
The Board has reserved for itself specific responsibility 
for formulating the Group’s risk management strategy, 
reviewing the system of internal controls and monitoring 
their effectiveness. The Board fulfils this obligation by 
agreeing the strategy, setting delegated authorities and 
approving appropriate policies and procedures which are 
then cascaded throughout the Group. Certain of these 
responsibilities have been delegated to the audit committee 
as outlined below and in the risk review on pages 48 to 49. 
We also have a risk committee that meets twice a year and 
assists the Board and audit committee in monitoring risk 
management and internal control. The risk committee ensures 
that both inherent and emerging risks across the business are 
properly identified and managed, approving new standards 
and processes where any weaknesses are considered to exist.
The risk management process and the system of internal 
controls were in place for the whole year and up to the date 
of approval of the annual report. They accord with the FRC’s 
internal control revised guidance for directors and with the Code.
80 ———  MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017
Governance Audit committee
— continued The committee has conducted a review of the effectiveness of 
the system of internal control for the year ended 31 December 
2017 and for the period to the date of this report. The process 
included a review of the relationship between the internal and 
external audit function, a formal review of the Group risk 
register, and a review of the results of internal audit work 
and the overall effectiveness of the process.
Risk management process
The risk management system is designed to identify principal 
risks attached to our Group strategy and objectives as well 
as the root cause for each risk, and to confirm the internal 
controls in place to mitigate the risk and any further actions 
required. This process includes the identification and 
assessment of the key environmental, social and corporate 
governance risks facing the business. The executive directors 
met regularly with the divisions throughout the year to discuss 
matters relating to strategy, financial and operational 
performance, and risk. Internal control and risk management 
processes are embedded in the operations of each division. 
In addition, the Board devoted time during some of the 
scheduled Board meetings to considering specific commercial 
issues which at the time represented the greatest risks to the 
achievement of our objectives and the mitigating actions in 
place to address them.
Further details of our approach to risk and the principal risks 
identified facing the Group are highlighted in the risk review 
on pages 48 to 59.
The system is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve certain business objectives 
due to circumstances which may reasonably be foreseen 
and can only provide reasonable assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. Overall, the committee considers that 
the Group’s risk profile is continuing to improve due to our 
strong cash performance, strengthened balance sheet and 
the resolution of older contract issues.
System of internal controls
The system of internal controls, which includes financial, 
operational and compliance controls, is based on a process 
of identifying, evaluating and managing risks. The committee 
assesses the effectiveness of the internal controls system on 
an ongoing basis. The key features of our system of internal 
controls are as follows:
Group structure
The Group consists of six divisions, each with its own 
management board with authority and responsibility for 
managing its division. This authority is set within a framework 
of overarching Group policies, reporting lines and detailed 
delegated authorities which ensure that decisions and approvals 
are made at the appropriate level. While responsibility for 
managing each division is delegated to its management Board 
as far as practicable, responsibility for certain of the Group’s 
key functions, including treasury, internal audit, pensions 
and insurance, is retained at Company level.
Financial reporting system
The Board recognises that an essential part of the 
responsibility for running a business is the effective 
safeguarding of assets, the proper recognition of liabilities 
and the accurate reporting of profits. The Company has 
internal control and risk management systems in place in 
relation to its financial reporting process and the Group’s 
process for preparing the consolidated accounts.
We have a comprehensive budgeting and forecasting 
system which is regularly reviewed and updated, together 
with a management reporting system established in each 
division for monthly reporting to the Board. In addition, the 
annual internal audit plan includes financial reviews to validate 
the integrity of the divisions’ management accounts.
Investment and capital expenditure
There are detailed procedures and defined levels of authority, 
depending on the value and/or nature of the investment or 
contract, in relation to corporate transactions, investment, 
capital expenditure, significant cost commitments and 
asset disposals.
Tender, project selection and contract controls
Individual tenders are subject to detailed review with 
approvals required at relevant levels and at various stages 
from commencement of the bidding process through to 
contract award. As part of this process, the financial standing 
of both clients and key subcontractors is assessed. In addition, 
robust procedures exist to manage the ongoing risks associated 
with contracts, with monthly reviews of each contract’s 
performance.
Working capital
We continually monitor current and forecast cash and 
working capital balances through a regime of daily and 
monthly reporting.
Internal audit 
The Group head of audit and assurance is responsible for 
managing the internal audit function, overseeing the divisional 
heads of internal audit and assisting with risk management 
practices. During the year, the Group head of audit and 
assurance met separately with the chair of the committee and 
has direct access to him whenever required. No new matters 
or issues were raised by the internal audit team directly to the 
committee that had not already been reported to the 
committee by the executive directors.
The committee is responsible for approval in advance of the 
plans of the internal audit function: 
■ an audit plan for each year is drawn up following a review of 
the divisional and Group risk registers and discussion with 
the management team and the committee to ensure it is 
aligned to the principal risks of the Group focusing 
predominantly on areas of key risks and materiality;
■ internal audit and assurance work carried out in 2017 
included operational, project and financial reviews across 
the Group and the results of these reviews were recorded in 
audit reports and presented to the committee; and
■ the status of agreed management actions to address 
identified operational weaknesses is actively tracked 
through to implementation.
At each meeting, the committee receives a report on the 
internal controls framework and the internal audit activities. 
In 2017 the committee received information on and reviewed 
risk management tools being implemented in Construction & 
Infrastructure, reviews carried out by the internal audit teams, 
management’s response to the reports and any key trends 
that emerged during the year. 
MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 ——— 81
Governance The Group head of audit and assurance also reports to the 
Board monthly on a range of performance metrics including 
the current status of agreed audit actions and progress 
against the annual audit plan.
The internal audit process is supplemented by a rolling 
programme of peer group reviews in Construction & 
Infrastructure and Partnership Housing, which assist in the 
professional development of the individual staff concerned 
while providing a mechanism for the cross-fertilisation of 
ideas and dissemination of best practice.
These peer group reviews are overseen by the divisional 
heads of internal audit and tracking of agreed management 
actions is included in the overall internal audit process.
The committee assesses annually the effectiveness of the 
internal audit function and reviews and confirms that the 
internal audit group is staffed appropriately and operating 
effectively. 
In its annual assessment the audit committee:
■ met with the Group head of audit and assurance separately 
without management present to discuss the effectiveness 
of the internal audit function;
■ reviewed and assessed the audit plan; and
■ assessed the role and effectiveness of the internal 
audit function in the overall context of the Company’s 
risk management system and whether the function is 
able to continue to meet the needs of the Group.
The results of the latest assessment were reviewed by the 
committee in November 2017 and it was satisfied that the 
internal audit team remained independent, was operating 
effectively, and that the risk to their independence and 
objectivity was low.
Business conduct and ethics
Raising concerns procedures 
Our procedures are supported by the operation of an 
independent external phone line and an online reporting 
mechanism for raising concerns, which enables employees 
across the Group and other workers on our sites to report 
concerns anonymously and in confidence. During the year 
we extended the methods by which concerns can be reported 
by introducing a ‘Speaking Up’ app which can be downloaded 
by employees in order to submit reports. The existence of the 
various reporting mechanisms is covered with all employees 
on induction and is publicised via the Company’s and 
divisions’ intranets and on construction site notice boards. 
Reports of concerns raised are presented to the committee 
at each meeting, together with the results of investigations 
and any follow-up actions. Any significant matter arising from 
a call would be brought to the attention of the committee 
without delay, although no such matters arose during the year. 
Following a focused drive in the year on raising awareness 
of the concerns helpline through our online training and 
a refreshed poster campaign our calls have increased by 
400% in the year. Of the total calls 44% related to human 
resource matters and 12% to health and safety. All such 
reports were investigated appropriately.
E-learning 
During the year, we rolled out an e-learning module to 
employees across the Group which explained and highlighted 
the duties of directors under the Companies Act 2006 sections 
171-177 as well as wider responsibilities under health and safety, 
anti-bribery and corruption and competition legislation. The 
directors’ duties module was aimed at statutory directors 
and senior employees with either director in their job title 
or a position of seniority akin to a director, ultimately being 
delivered to 414 colleagues. At the time of writing, 68% of 
these employees had successfully completed the module. 
Those yet to complete a module are sent a reminder email or 
called by their line manager to check on their progress. New 
joiners are invited to complete our e-learning modules as 
part of their induction. We aim to launch refresher training 
periodically and, in early 2018, we issued refresher training 
on bribery and corruption and competition law, two of the 
e-learning modules released in 2016. In early 2018, we also 
released additional e-learning modules relating to the Market 
Abuse Regulation. The market abuse e-learning is split into 
two modules, the first being an in-depth training module 
for the Board and another more general overview for all 
employees in the Group. Future plans for e-learning include 
insurance and tax-related modules.
Group tax strategy
The committee reviewed the Group’s tax strategy statement 
and submitted it for Board approval. The statement was 
approved by the Board at the November meeting and 
has been published on our website.
Modern slavery
The committee reviewed and approved the Group’s modern 
slavery statement in respect of the 2016 financial year which is 
available on our website. The 2017 statement will be published 
in the first half of 2018, explaining in more detail the actions 
taken during the year to ensure that we do not undertake 
activities or engage suppliers or subcontractors who undertake 
activities that may be in breach of the Modern Slavery Act. 
We confirmed that we would be reporting against various 
KPIs in future statements (see below) and the committee 
reviewed our progress against those KPIs in November 2017.
Modern slavery KPIs:
■ staff training levels;
■ the results of mapping exercises of the supply chain;
■ the development of an online due diligence questionnaire;
■ progress with the Supply Chain Sustainability School 
members to develop an industry review and audit 
process for common suppliers; and
■ investigations undertaken into reports of modern slavery 
and remedial actions taken in response.

— continued Remuneration report
■ Remuneration
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to introduce our remuneration report for the year 
ended 31 December 2017. The report is split into two sections: 
i) the annual report on remuneration which includes this 
letter and will be subject to an advisory vote at our AGM 
on 4 May 2018; and
ii) the 2017 remuneration policy approved at the AGM on 
4 May 2017.
Key remuneration committee activities in 2017
■ review of remuneration policy;
■ consultation with shareholders regarding potential 
changes to the policy;
■ submission of the 2017 remuneration policy for approval 
by shareholders;
■ adjudication of the 2016 annual bonus outcome and the 
vesting outcome for the 2014-2016 long-term incentive 
plan (LTIP) awards; 
■ setting of targets for the 2018 bonus plan and 2018-
2020 LTIP awards;
■ approval of rules for the new deferred bonus plan and 
Sharesave scheme (SAYE) rules;
■ review of senior executive salaries for 2018; and
■ review of the committee’s performance.
Performance in 2017
2017 was a successful year for the Group, with further financial 
and strategic progress made. The increase in underlying revenue 
growth, profit before tax (adjusted*) (PBTA*) and adjusted 
earnings per share (EPS), shown below, reflect management 
actions to improve commercial performance and operational 
efficiency (see the strategic report from the inside front cover 
to page 60 for further information).
2017 2016 % change
Revenue £m 2,793 2,562 +9
PBTA* £m 66.1 45.3 +46
Adjusted EPS pence 121.1 84.7 +43
Share price at 31 December £14.28 £7.45 +92
Review of remuneration for 2017
Reflecting the strong results set out above, the executive 
directors will each receive a bonus of 125% of salary, of which 
30% will be deferred in shares for three years. LTIP awards 
granted in 2015, which vest on three-year performance to 
31 December 2017 (two thirds on EPS and one third on relative 
total shareholder return (TSR)) will vest in full. The committee 
satisfied itself that the outcome reflected the underlying 
performance of the business over the relevant period.
Remuneration policy 
Following detailed debate by the committee and extensive 
consultation with shareholders, the 2017 remuneration policy 
was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 4 May 2017, and 
is set out again on pages 92 to 93. 88% of shareholders voted 
in favour of the 2017 remuneration policy, and 99% in favour 
of the annual report on remuneration (see pages 92 to 96). 
The committee expects the remuneration policy to remain 
effective until the 2020 AGM.
Our policy is that performance-related components should form 
a significant portion of the overall remuneration opportunity, 
with maximum total potential rewards being earned through 
the achievement of appropriately stretching performance 
targets based on measures that the committee believes 
reflect the interests of shareholders.
When considering the remuneration of executive directors, 
the committee takes account of remuneration levels offered to 
other senior executives within the Group as well as pay awards 
affecting Group employees generally. For example, in reviewing 
the executive directors’ remuneration for 2018, we reviewed the 
salaries and proposed incentive arrangements for the senior 
executives in the divisions to ensure that there was a coherent 
and fair approach across the Group. The committee does not 
formally consult with employees in respect of the design of the 
remuneration policy, although we will keep this under review.
Summary of proposed remuneration arrangements for 2018 
Fixed pay
From 1 January 2018, the base salaries for John Morgan and 
Steve Crummett will be increased by 3%, which is in line with 
average salary increases awarded across the rest of the Group. 
No changes have been made to benefit provision or to pension 
allowances which at 10% of salary are consistent with those for 
the employee population. 
Annual bonus
In line with our remuneration policy the maximum bonus 
opportunity for the executive directors for 2018 is 125% of 
salary. 30% of any bonus earned will be deferred into nil cost 
share options for three years. 
Long-term incentive plan
The executive directors will each receive LTIP awards 
equivalent to 150% of basic salary. These awards will be 
subject to a two-year holding period on vesting. For 2018, 
EPS targets will be equivalent to a growth rate of 6–13% per 
year over the three-year period, while the TSR target will require 
10% per year outperformance of the comparator median, a level 
which is broadly equivalent to an upper quartile level of difficulty. 
Reflecting concerns around the robustness of the current 
comparator group, the committee has changed the comparator 
group for the 2018 awards to be the constituents of the FTSE 
250 Index (excluding investment trusts). See page 87 for 
further details.
Conclusion
The committee remains committed to a remuneration policy and 
implementation which we feel provides suitable opportunity for 
the executive directors to be rewarded for their contribution 
to the business, aligned with the interests of all stakeholders. 
We value the support which shareholders have provided, as 
reflected in the feedback from our engagement and the votes 
on remuneration at our 2017 AGM. We hope to continue to 
receive your support at the forthcoming AGM.

All members of the committee are independent. The chairman 
of the Board and chief executive attended all meetings of the 
committee and the company secretary acted as secretary to 
the committee. The chairman of the committee reported to 
subsequent meetings of the Board on the committee’s work. 
No person was present during any discussion relating to their 
own remuneration.
Responsibilities
The committee is responsible for:
■ reviewing the ongoing appropriateness and effectiveness 
of the remuneration policy including in relation to retention 
and development;
■ proposing to shareholders changes to the remuneration 
policy and approve its implementation for executive 
directors and other senior executives taking into 
account arrangements for the wider employee group;
■ approving the design of our annual bonus arrangements 
and LTIPs, including the performance targets that apply; 
and
■ determining the award levels for the executive directors 
and other senior executives based on performance 
against annual bonus targets and long-term incentive 
performance conditions.
The terms of reference of the committee are available on 
our website.
Activities during the year
The committee met on two occasions during the year. 
Attendance at the meetings is disclosed in the corporate 
governance report on page 69. The meetings covered a 
review of the feedback from the shareholder consultation on 
proposed changes to the remuneration policy, finalisation 
of the remuneration policy to put to shareholders for 
approval at the AGM in May 2017 and a benchmarking 
review of fees for company chairmen. In addition, the 
committee undertook its normal business of confirming 
performance-related pay for the year ended 31 December 
2017 and setting bonus and long-term incentive targets for 
2018. Additional consultation between committee members 
and between the chair of the committee and the chief 
executive took place outside of formal meetings.
Advisers
During the year, remuneration advisers, Kepler, updated 
the committee on best practice in executive remuneration, 
changes in shareholders’ voting guidelines, benchmarking 
information for the executive directors, chairman and 
non-executive directors and updates in respect of the TSR 
performance condition. The committee also consulted the 
chief executive but not in relation to his own remuneration.
Kepler also provided advice to the Company on accounting 
for share awards and the operation of the Group’s share 
option schemes but provided no other material services 
to the Company or the Group.
The fees paid by the Company to Kepler during the financial 
year for advice to the committee in relation to the above 
were £33,010 (2016: £55,576). 
Kepler is a founding member and signatory of the Code 
of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants, details of which 
can be found at remunerationconsultantsgroup.com and the 
committee considers its advice objective and independent. 
Kepler has no connection with the Company.
Consideration of shareholder views
We are committed to maintaining good communications with 
investors. The committee considers the AGM an opportunity 
to meet and communicate with investors and considers 
shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each 
year. This feedback, plus any additional feedback received 
during any meetings from time to time, is then considered 
as part of our annual review of remuneration policy.
In addition, the committee seeks to engage directly with 
major shareholders and their representative bodies should 
any material changes be made to the remuneration policy 
(for example, this was done in respect of the changes to 
the revised policy approved by shareholders at the AGM 
in May 2017).

Governance Annual report on remuneration
The information provided in this section of the remuneration report which is subject to audit has been highlighted.
Implementation of the remuneration policy for 2018 
Base salaries
In setting the 2018 base salaries, the committee considered 
the budgeted level of increases in base salary for senior 
executives below Board level and the workforce generally, 
which averaged 3%. The committee determined that the base 
salaries for John Morgan and Steve Crummett should increase 
by 3% with effect from 1 January 2018. In considering the salary 
increases, the committee took account of the performance of 
each executive director and their respective responsibilities as 
well as benchmarking information for comparable roles at 
companies of similar revenue and market capitalisation.

1 January
2017
£ Increase
John Morgan 505,254 490,537 3%
Steve Crummett 402,877 391,142 3%
Pension arrangements
The Company contributes up to 10% of base salary to 
a personal pension plan and/or as a cash supplement. 
Consistent with all employees participating in the Morgan 
Sindall Retirement Benefits Plan (the Retirement Plan), 
relevant executive directors may exchange part of their gross 
salary and bonus awards in return for pension contributions. 
Where additional pension contributions are made through 
the salary exchange process, the Company enhances the 
contributions by half of the saved employer’s National 
Insurance contribution.
Annual bonus
The maximum annual bonus potential for 2018 will be 125% 
of base salary with 70% of any bonus earned paid in cash 
and the remaining 30% deferred in shares for three years. To 
ensure that management is focused on the Group’s financial 
performance in 2018, 100% of the bonus will continue to be 
based on a PBTA* target range set in relation to the Group 
budget. The annual bonus including the deferred shares 
will be subject to malus and clawback provisions.
The targets for the forthcoming year are set in relation to the 
Group budget, which is considered commercially sensitive. 
Retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance 
against them will be disclosed in next year’s annual 
remuneration report.
Long-term incentives
The committee intends to make awards to the executive 
directors under the 2014 LTIP in March 2018.
The awards to be granted in 2018 will be set at 150% of base 
salary. Two thirds of awards (100% of salary) will be based on an 
EPS performance target with the remaining one third of awards 
(50% of salary) based on the Company’s TSR performance 
compared with the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index 
(excluding investment trusts), over a three-year period. Further 
details on these performance conditions are set out below.
Net shares vesting under LTIP awards granted in 2018 will be 
subject to a mandatory two-year holding period at the end 
of the vesting period. All awards are subject to malus and 
clawback provisions.
EPS performance condition (two thirds of award)
For the awards granted in 2018, EPS targets will be expressed 
in cumulative pence terms in order to reduce the sensitivity of 
vesting to final year performance and incentivise executives 
to deliver sustained steady growth. For 2018, targets will be 
equivalent to a growth rate of 6-13% per year over the 
three-year period. The committee believes these targets 
represent an appropriately stretching range in the context 
of internal and external reference points, and are broadly 
consistent with the average target range for EPS growth 
in other FTSE long-term incentives.
The vesting range for the EPS targets is shown in the 
graph below:

Governance TSR performance condition (one third of award)
TSR targets for 2018 awards will be expressed as an 
outperformance of median as per the 2017 awards.
The committee has reviewed the comparator group for 
TSR, as the number of comparator companies has reduced to 
six following the recent liquidation of Carillion. The committee is 
concerned about the robustness of this reduced comparator 
group and therefore has decided to change the TSR 
comparator group to be based on the constituents of the 
FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts). It is proposed 
that full vesting for the TSR component will remain at 10% per 
year outperformance of comparator median, a level which is 
broadly equivalent to an upper quartile level of difficulty.
The target range for the TSR performance condition is shown 
in the graph below:

(50% of salary)
The committee has discretion to scale back (potentially to zero), 
vesting outcomes under the TSR element in the event it considers 
that financial performance has been unsatisfactory and/or the 
outcome has been distorted due to the TSR for the Company 
or any comparator company being considered abnormal.
Fees for the non-executive directors
The chairman’s fee is determined by the committee while the 
non-executive directors’ remuneration is determined by the 
Board (excluding non-executive directors) within the limits 
set by the Company’s Articles of Association and is based 
on relevant market data, together with external advice 
as appropriate. Following a benchmarking review of the 
chairman’s fees during 2017, it was decided that it be 
increased by 17% with effect from 1 January 2018. This 
increase is in recognition of the fact that Michael Findlay was 
paid below the market benchmark when he joined the Group. 
Following a review by the Board, it was further agreed that the 
base fee for non-executive directors be increased in line with 
the increase for wider employees across the Group, i.e. by 3%.
Accordingly, the annual fees from 1 January 2018 are as follows:
From 
1 January
2018
£
From
1 January
2017
£ Increase
Chairman 170,000 145,000 17%

Additional fees:
Audit committee chair 7,500 7,500 0%
Remuneration committee chair 6,000 6,000 0%
Senior independent director 6,000 6,000 0%
Non-executive directors receive no other benefits and do not 
participate in any short-term or long-term incentive schemes.
Dilution and share usage under employee share plans
Shares required for the 2007 Employee Share Option Plan are 
satisfied by shares purchased in the market via The Morgan 
Sindall Employee Benefit Trust (the Trust) and shares for the 
Company’s other share plans may be satisfied using either 
new issue shares or market purchase shares. Our present 
intention is to use market purchase shares to satisfy these 
awards, however we retain the ability to use new issue 
shares and may decide to do so up to the dilution limits 
recommended by the Investment Association (10% of issued 
ordinary share capital for all employee share plans over a 
10-year period and, within this limit, no more than 5% of issued 
ordinary share capital for executive or discretionary share 
plans). The outstanding level of dilution against these limits 
equates to 7.56% of the current issued ordinary share capital 
under all employee share plans, of which 0% relates to 
discretionary share plans.
As at 31 December 2017, the Trust held 555,104 shares, 
which may be used to satisfy awards.

Shareholding guidelines
Through participation in performance-linked share-based plans, there is strong encouragement for senior executives to build 
and maintain a significant shareholding in the business. Shareholding guidelines are in place requiring the executive directors 
to build and maintain a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 200% of base salary. Until such time as this threshold is 
achieved there is a requirement for executives to retain no less than 50% of the net of tax value of vested incentive awards.

1 Of the awards granted in 2014, 62% vested as a result of the EPS and TSR performance achieved. Adjusted EPS for the Group as at 31 December 2016 was 84.7p which equated 
to 98.13% of the EPS element of the award vesting. The Group achieved a TSR percentile rank of 53.41% (between the fifth and fourth positions) which equated to 26% of the 
TSR element of the award vesting.
2 Of the awards granted in 2015, 100% will vest as a result of the EPS and TSR targets being achieved. Adjusted EPS for the Group as at 31 December 2017 was 121.1p (RPI+34.8% 
per year) which resulted in 100% of the EPS element of the award vesting. The Group also achieved a TSR of 132.2% which was top of the comparator group, and resulted in 
100% of the TSR element of the award vesting.
3 The awards of performance shares over 150% of salary granted in 2016 are subject to adjusted EPS growth targets and a TSR performance condition. For awards over 100% of 
salary, awards vest in full for achieving adjusted EPS growth of RPI+15% per year, reducing on a sliding scale to 40% vesting for achieving EPS growth of RPI+10% per year and 
again on a sliding scale down to 12.5% vesting for achieving EPS growth of RPI+5% per year. There is no vesting for this part of an award for EPS growth less than RPI+5% per 
year. For awards over the remaining 50% of salary, the award is subject to the same TSR performance measure relative to seven listed comparators, with 25% vesting for 
performance in line with median, rising to full vesting if the Company’s TSR is equal to or exceeds the TSR of the company ranked second.
4 The awards of performance shares over 150% of salary granted in 2017 are subject to cumulative EPS growth targets equivalent to a growth rate of 6-13% and a TSR performance 
condition. There is no vesting for the EPS part of an award for compound annual EPS growth of less than 6% per year. Full vesting for the TSR component will require 10% per 
year outperformance of the comparator median.

Governance Remuneration policy
The table below summarises the main elements of the remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the AGM on 4 May 2017 
and which came into effect from that date. 
Remuneration policy table
Fixed 
elements
Purpose and link 
to strategy
Operation Maximum 
opportunity
Performance  
targets
Base 
salary
T o provide competitive 
fixed remuneration.
T o attract, retain and 
motivate executive 
directors of the calibre 
required in order to 
deliver the Company’s 
strategy and enhance 
earnings over the 
long term.
Basic salary is reviewed annually by the committee 
or, if appropriate, in the event of a change in an 
individual’s position or responsibilities.
Salary levels are set by reference to market rates, 
taking into account individual performance, 
experience, company performance and the pay and 
conditions of other senior management in the Group.
The committee will take into account the general 
increase for the broader employee population but 
on occasion may need to recognise, for example, 
an increase in the scale, scope or responsibility of 
the role.
There is no prescribed 
maximum annual increase.
Current salary levels are 
presented on page 86.
Not applicable.
Benefits
T o provide market 
consistent benefits, 
including insured 
benefits to support 
the individual and 
their family during 
periods of ill health, 
accidents or in the 
event of death.
Car or travel 
allowances to 
facilitate effective 
travel.
Current benefits include travel allowance, private 
medical insurance, income protection insurance 
and life assurance. Other benefits may be 
provided where appropriate.
The travel allowance 
is £17,000.
The value of other 
benefits is based on 
the cost to the Company 
and is not predetermined.
Not applicable.
Pension
T o provide a pension 
arrangement to 
contribute towards 
retirement planning.
The Company will contribute to the defined 
contribution pension scheme, The Morgan Sindall 
Retirement Benefits Plan (the Retirement Plan) or 
to personal pension arrangements at the request 
of the individual.
The Company may also consider a cash alternative 
(for example where a director has reached the 
HMRC’s lifetime or annual allowance limit).
Employer contributions 
are 10% of base salary.
Directors who are 
members of the 
Retirement Plan may 
elect to exchange part 
of their salary or bonus 
award in return for 
pension contributions, 
where the Company will 
enhance the additional 
contributions by half of 
the saved employer’s 
National Insurance 
contribution.
Not applicable.
Annual 
bonus
Rewarding the 
achievement of 
demanding annual 
performance metrics.
Performance measures and targets are reviewed 
annually by the committee.
70% of any bonus earned is payable in cash 
and 30% is normally deferred for three years 
and satisfied in Company shares. Dividends 
accrue during the deferral period and may be 
paid in cash or shares at the time of release.
The committee has discretion: (i) to override the 
formulaic outturn of the bonus to determine the 
appropriate level of bonus payable where it believes 
the outcome is not truly reflective of performance; 
and (ii) to ensure fairness to both shareholders 
and participants.
The maximum 
opportunity is 125% 
of base salary.
Financial targets 
incorporate an 
appropriate sliding 
scale range around 
a challenging target.
T arget performance will 
typically deliver up to 50% 
of maximum bonus, with 
threshold performance 
typically paying up to 
15% of maximum bonus.
All or a majority of the 
bonus will be based on 
PBTA*, set relative to the 
Group’s budget or such 
other financial measures 
as the committee deems 
appropriate.
Financial targets will 
account for not less than 
80% of the annual bonus.
A minority of the bonus 
may be based on non- 
financial, strategic and/or 
personal objectives linked 
to the strategic objectives 
of the Group to provide a 
rounded assessment of 
Group and management’s 
performance.

LTIP
T o balance

achievement of 
financial performance 
objectives and 
delivering sustainable 
stock market 
outperformance.
T o encourage share 
ownership and provide 
further alignment 
with the interests 
of shareholders.
Annual awards of conditional shares or nil (or 
nominal) cost options are granted with vesting 
dependent on the achievement of performance 
conditions over a three-year period.
For awards granted in 2017 onwards net LTIP shares 
vesting will typically be subject to a two-year holding 
period, creating a total of five years between the 
award being granted, and the first opportunity 
to sell.
Performance targets are reviewed annually 
by the committee for each new award.
Dividends that accrue during the vesting period may, 
at the committee’s discretion, be paid in cash or 
shares at the time of vesting. The calculation of the 
dividend equivalent may assume the reinvestment 
of dividends.
The committee has discretion to scale back 
(potentially to zero), vesting outcomes under the 
TSR element in the event it considers that financial 
performance has been unsatisfactory and/or the 
outcome has been distorted due to the TSR for 
the Company or any comparator company 
being considered abnormal. 
Any use of committee discretion with respect to 
waiving or modifying performance conditions 
will be disclosed in the relevant annual report.
150% of base salary. Awards are subject to 
performance conditions 
based on the Company’s 
EPS and on relative TSR 
compared to a group of 
UK-listed peers.
The committee has 
discretion to introduce 
additional performance 
condition(s) (to 
complement EPS and 
TSR) for up to one third 
of future awards.
For both the EPS and 
TSR conditions, no more 
than 25% of the awards 
will vest for achieving 
threshold performance, 
increasing to 100% 
vesting for achievement 
of stretching performance 
targets.
All

Sharesave 
plan
T o encourage share 
ownership and provide 
further alignment with 
shareholders.
This is an HMRC tax-advantaged plan under which 
regular monthly savings can be made over a period 
of three years and can be used to fund the exercise 
of an option to purchase shares. Options are 
granted at up to a 20% discount.
This scheme is open to all employees including 
executive directors.
Prevailing HMRC 
limits apply.
Not applicable.
Non-
executive 
directors' 
fees
Set to attract, retain 
and motivate talented 
individuals.
Non-executive directors receive a basic annual 
fee in respect of their Board duties. Additional 
fees may be paid to the chairs of the committees 
and the senior independent director to reflect 
their additional responsibilities.
The chairman receives a fixed annual fee. 
Fees are normally reviewed annually.
The committee is guided by fee levels in 
the non-executive director market and may 
recognise an increase in certain circumstances 
such as assumed additional responsibility or 
an increase in the scale or scope of the role.
Non-executive directors are reimbursed for 
reasonable expenses and any tax arising on 
those expenses will be settled directly by the 
Company. T o the extent that these are deemed 
taxable expenses, they will be included in the 
annual remuneration report as required.
For the non-executive 
directors, there is no 
prescribed maximum 
annual increase.
The Company’s Articles 
of Association provide 
that the total aggregate 
remuneration paid to the 
chairman of the Company 
and non-executive 
directors will be 
determined by the Board 
within the limits set by 
shareholders and detailed 
in the Company’s Articles.
Not applicable
Notes to the policy table
The committee is satisfied that the above remuneration policy is in the best interests of shareholders and does not promote 
excessive risk-taking.
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this directors’ remuneration policy, authority was given to the Company to honour 
any commitments entered into with current or former directors (such as the payment of a pension or the vesting or exercise 
of past share awards).
MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 ——— 93
Governance Performance measure selection and approach to target setting
The annual bonus is currently based 100% on PBTA*, which is the key measure of how successful the Group is in managing 
its operations. Any additional measures which may be introduced in the future would be aligned to our strategy and we would 
provide details at the relevant time. The long-term incentive performance measures, EPS and TSR, reward long-term financial 
growth and significant long-term returns to shareholders. The TSR performance condition is monitored on the committee’s 
behalf by Kepler, while EPS is derived from the Group’s audited financial statements.
Targets take account of internal strategic planning and external market expectations for the Group and are set appropriate to 
the economic outlook and risk factors prevailing at the time, ensuring that such targets remain challenging in the circumstances, 
while remaining realistic enough to motivate and incentivise management.
Overview of remuneration policy for other employees 
Employees across the Group below Board level may be eligible to participate in an annual bonus arrangement. Long-term 
incentive awards and/or discretionary share options may be awarded to certain other senior executives and employees, for 
which the maximum opportunity and the performance conditions may vary by organisational level.
Use of discretion
The committee will operate the incentive plans in accordance with their respective rules, the Listing Rules and HMRC rules 
where relevant. The committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the 
operation and administration of certain plan rules. These include (but are not limited to) the following:
■ who participates in incentives;
■ the timing of grant of awards and/or payments;
■ the size of awards (up to plan/policy limits) and/or payments;
■ where the result indicated by the relative TSR performance condition should be scaled back (potentially to zero) in the event 
that the committee considers that financial performance has been unsatisfactory and/or the outcome has been distorted 
due to the TSR for the Company or any comparator company TSR being considered abnormal;
■ measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction;
■ determination of good leaver status (in addition to any specified categories) for incentive plan purposes;
■ payment of dividends accrued during the vesting period;
■ adjustments required in certain circumstances (for example, rights issues, corporate restructuring and special dividends);
■ adjustments to existing performance conditions for exceptional events so that they can still fulfil their original purpose;
■ the release of deferred bonus shares for leavers; and
■ retention of LTIP shares subject to a holding period for leavers.
Malus and clawback
Awards under the annual bonus, the deferred bonus and the LTIP are subject to malus and clawback provisions which can 
be applied to both vested and unvested awards. Clawback provisions will apply for a period of three years post vesting. 
Circumstances in which malus and clawback may be applied include: for overpayments due to material misstatement of the 
Company’s financial accounts; gross misconduct on the part of the award-holder; an error in calculating the vesting outcomes; 
or in the event of corporate failure.
Remuneration scenarios for the executive directors
The charts below provide an indication of the level of remuneration that would be received by each executive director under 
the following three assumed performance scenarios.
Below threshold performance Fixed elements of remuneration only – base salary, 
benefits and pension.
On-target performance Assumes 50% pay out under the annual bonus.
Assumes 16.7% pay out under the LTIP 
(aligned with threshold performance).
Maximum performance Assumes 100% pay out under the annual bonus 
(125% of salary).

Recruitment remuneration
The committee takes into account the need to attract, retain and motivate the best person for each position, without paying 
more than is necessary.
External appointment
For external appointments, the committee would seek to align the remuneration package with the remuneration policy 
approved by shareholders, as follows:
Fixed  
elements Approach
Maximum annual  
grant value
Base salary The base salaries of new executive directors will be determined by reference to 
relevant market data, experience and skills of the individual, internal relativities 
and their current basic salary. In the event that the committee elects to set 
the initial basic salary of a new appointee below market, any shortfall may be 
managed with phased increases over a period of two to three years subject 
to the individual’s development in the role.
Pension New executive directors will receive company contributions or cash alternative 
not greater than the existing policy.
Benefits New executive directors will be eligible to receive benefits which may include 
(but are not limited to) travel allowances, private medical insurance, income 
protection insurance, life assurance and any necessary relocation and/or 
incidental expenses.
Sharesave plan New appointees will also be eligible to participate in all-employee share schemes.
Annual bonus The structure described in the policy table will apply to new executive directors, 
with the maximum opportunity being pro-rated to reflect the proportion of the 
financial year served.
125% of base salary.
LTIP New appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP on the same terms as 
other executives, as described in the policy table.
150% of base salary.
In determining appropriate remuneration, the committee will take into consideration all relevant factors to ensure that 
arrangements are in the best interests of both the Company and its shareholders. The committee may additionally make 
awards or payments in respect of deferred remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
The committee will look to replicate the arrangements being forfeited as closely as possible and, in doing so, will take account 
of relevant factors including the value of deferred remuneration; the performance conditions; and the time over which they 
would have vested or been paid. Any such arrangements would typically have an aggregate fair value no higher than the 
awards being forfeited.
MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 ——— 95
Governance Internal promotion
In cases of appointing a new executive director by way of internal promotion, the committee will be consistent with the policy 
for external appointees detailed above. Any incentive amount awarded in respect of a prior role may be allowed to vest on its 
original terms, or adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. Any other ongoing remuneration obligations 
existing prior to appointment may continue.
Non-executive directors
For the appointment of a new non-executive director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the approved 
remuneration policy at that time.
Directors’ service contracts and payments for loss of office 
Current executive directors’ service agreements are terminable on 12 months’ notice. In circumstances of termination on notice, 
the committee will determine an equitable compensation package, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case. 
The committee has discretion to require notice to be worked or to make payment in lieu of notice or to place the director on 
garden leave for the notice period. In respect of new hires, the initial notice period for a service contract may be longer than 
the policy of a 12-month notice period, provided it reduces to 12 months within a short space of time.
In case of payment in lieu or garden leave, base salary, employer pension contributions and employee benefits will be paid 
for the period of notice served on garden leave or paid in lieu. The committee will endeavour to make payments in phased 
instalments and to apply mitigation in the case of offsetting payments against earnings elsewhere.
The annual bonus may be payable in respect of the period of the bonus scheme year worked by the director; there is no 
provision for an amount in lieu of bonus to be payable for any part of the notice period not worked. The bonus would be 
payable at the normal date. Leavers would normally retain deferred bonus shares, albeit release would normally be at the 
end of the deferral period, with committee discretion to treat otherwise.
Long-term incentives granted under the LTIP will be determined by the LTIP rules which contain discretionary good leaver 
provisions for designated reasons (that is, participants who leave early on account of injury; disability; death; a sale of their 
employer or business in which they were employed; statutory redundancy; retirement; or any other reason at the discretion 
of the committee). In these circumstances a participant’s awards will not be forfeited on cessation of employment and instead 
will vest on the normal vesting date. In exceptional circumstances, the committee may decide that the participant’s awards 
will vest early on the date of cessation of employment. In either case, the extent to which the awards will vest depends on 
the extent to which the performance conditions have been satisfied and a pro rata reduction of the awards will be applied 
by reference to the time of cessation (although the committee has discretion to disapply time pro rating if the circumstances 
warrant it).
Leavers would normally retain vested LTIP shares subject to a holding period and these would normally be released at the 
end of the holding period with committee discretion to treat otherwise.

Powers of directors
Subject to the Articles of Association (the Articles), the Act and any directions given by the Company by special resolution, 
the business of the Company will be managed by the Board who may exercise all the powers of the Company, whether relating 
to the management of the business or not. In particular, the Board may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money, 
to mortgage or charge any of its undertaking, property, assets (present and future) and uncalled capital and to issue debentures 
and other securities and to give security for any debt, liability or obligation of the Company or of any third party.
MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 ——— 97
Governance Directors’ indemnities
The Articles entitle the directors of the Company to be 
indemnified, to the extent permitted by the Act and any 
other applicable legislation, out of the assets of the Company 
in the event that they suffer any loss or incur any liability in 
connection with the execution of their duties as directors. 
Neither the indemnity nor any applicable insurance provides 
cover in the event that a director (or officer or company 
secretary as the case may be) is proved to have acted 
fraudulently or dishonestly.
In addition, and in common with many other companies, 
the Company had during the year and continues to have in 
place directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in favour of 
its directors and other officers in respect of certain losses or 
liability to which they may be exposed due to their office. The 
insurance is categorised as a ‘qualifying third-party indemnity 
provision’ for the purposes of the Act and will continue in 
force for the purposes of the Act and for the benefit of 
directors (or officers or company secretary as the case 
may be) on an ongoing basis.
The Company also had and continues to have in place a 
pension trustee’s liability insurance policy in favour of the 
trustees of The Morgan Sindall Retirement Benefits Plan in 
respect of certain losses or liabilities to which they may be 
exposed due to their office. This constitutes a ‘qualifying 
pension scheme indemnity provision’ for the purposes 
of the Act.
Amendment of Articles 
The Company’s constitution, known as the Articles, 
is essentially a contract between the Company and its 
shareholders, governing many aspects of the management 
of the Company. The Articles may be amended by special 
resolution at a general meeting of the Company’s 
shareholders and are available on our website.
Power to issue and allot shares
At each AGM the Board seeks authorisation from its 
shareholders to allot shares. The directors were granted 
authority at the AGM on 4 May 2017 to allot relevant securities 
up to a nominal amount of £745,165. That authority will apply 
until the conclusion of this year’s AGM or close of business on 
4 August 2018, whichever is the earlier, and a resolution to 
renew the authority will be proposed at this year’s AGM, as 
explained further in the notice to shareholders accompanying 
this report.
Special resolutions will also be proposed to renew the 
directors’ power to make non-pre-emptive issues for cash, 
as explained in the notice to the shareholders accompanying 
this report. The Board confirms that the Company has not 
used this authority in the last three years and there are 
no immediate plans to make use of this provision.
Rights and obligations attaching to shares
Subject to applicable statutes, shares may be issued with 
such rights and restrictions as the Company may by ordinary 
resolution decide or (if there is no such resolution or so far as 
it does not make specific provision) as the Board as defined 
in the Company’s Articles may decide. Subject to the Articles, 
the Act and other shareholders’ rights, unissued shares are at 
the disposal of the Board.
Subject to the Act, if at any time the share capital of the 
Company is divided into different classes of shares, the rights 
attached to any class of shares may be varied with the written 
consent of the holders of not less than 75% in nominal value 
of the issued shares of that class (calculated excluding any 
shares held as treasury shares), or with the sanction of a 
special resolution passed at a separate general meeting 
of the holders of those shares.
The rights conferred upon the holders of any shares shall not, 
unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to 
those shares, be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue 
of further shares ranking pari passu with them.
Voting
Subject to any other provisions of the Articles, every member 
present in person or by proxy at a general meeting has, upon 
a show of hands, one vote and, upon a poll, one vote for every 
share held by him or her. In the case of joint holders of a share, 
the vote of the senior holder who tenders a vote, whether in 
person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the 
votes of the other joint holders and, for this purpose, seniority 
shall be determined by the order in which the names stand 
in the register of members in respect of the joint holding 
(the first-named being the most senior).
No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting in 
respect of any share held by him or her if any call or other sum 
then payable by him or her in respect of that share remains 
unpaid or if a member has been served with a restriction 
notice (as defined in the Articles) after failure to provide the 
Company with information concerning interests in those 
shares required to be provided under the Act.
No person has any special rights of control over the 
Company’s share capital and the directors are not aware of 
any agreements between holders of shares which may result 
in restrictions on voting rights.
Transfer of shares
There are no restrictions on the transfer of securities in the 
Company, except:
■ that certain restrictions may, from time to time, be imposed 
by laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws); and
■ pursuant to the Listing Rules of the FCA whereby certain 
employees of the Company require its approval to deal 
in the Company’s shares.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
holders of securities that may result in restrictions on 
the transfer of securities or voting rights.
Purchase of own shares
At the AGM on 4 May 2017, a resolution was passed giving 
the directors authority to make market purchases of Company 
shares up to 4,470,994 shares of 5p each at a maximum price 
based on the market price of a share at the relevant time, as 
set out in the resolution. No purchases of shares were made 
during the year pursuant to this authority. The authority 
expires on the date of this year’s AGM or close of business on 
4 August 2018, whichever is earlier. A resolution to renew this 
authority will be proposed at this year’s AGM, as explained 
further in the notice to shareholders accompanying this report.

Governance Directors’ report
— continued Dividends and distributions
The Company may, by ordinary resolution, from time to time, 
declare dividends not exceeding the amount recommended 
by the Board. Subject to the Act, the Board may pay interim 
dividends, and also any fixed rate dividend, whenever the 
financial position of the Company, in the opinion of the 
Board, justifies its payment.
The Board may withhold payment of all or any part of 
any dividends or other monies payable in respect of the 
Company’s shares from a person with a 0.25% interest if such 
a person has been served with a restriction notice (as defined 
in the Articles) after failure to provide the Company with 
information concerning interests in those shares required to 
be provided under the Act. Other than as referred to under 
‘Rights under employee share schemes’ below, during the 
year there were no arrangements under which a shareholder 
has waived or agreed to waive any dividends nor any 
agreement by a shareholder to waive future dividends.

held 1.2% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 
31 December 2017 on trust for the benefit of the employees 
and former employees of the Group and their dependants. 
The voting rights in relation to these shares are exercised by 
the Trustee and there are no restrictions on the exercise of 
the voting of, or the acceptance of any offer relating to, those 
shares. The Trust agreed to waive its right to both the final and 
interim dividends payable in 2017 which equated to 1.5% of the 
total dividend paid.

MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 ——— 99
Governance Directors’ responsibility statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
and applicable law), including FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’. Under company law the directors must not approve the 
accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or 
loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the directors are required to:
■ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
■ make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
■ state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and
■ prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company 
will continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
■ properly select and apply accounting policies;
■ present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information;
■ provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
■ make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Act. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
therefore taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
■ the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole;
■ the strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and
■ the annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board and is signed on its behalf by:

MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 ——— 101 Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion:
■ the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
■ the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
■ the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice including Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’; and
■ the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements of Morgan Sindall Group plc (the ‘Parent Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) 
which comprise:
■ the consolidated income statement;
■ the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
■ the consolidated and Company balance sheets;
■ the consolidated cash flow statement;
■ the consolidated and Company statements of changes in equity;
■ the critical accounting judgements and estimates;
■ the significant accounting policies; and
■ the related notes 1 to 26 and Company only notes 1 to 2.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law 
and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of 
the Parent Company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 
‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report. 
We remained independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant 
to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, 
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit 
services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independent auditor’s report
to the members of Morgan Sindall Group plc
102 ———  MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017
Financial statements Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
■ Recognition of contract revenue, margin and related receivables and liabilities
■ Carrying value of land and work in progress
■ Impairment of goodwill
■ Valuation of shared equity loan receivables
■ Increasing uncertainty in the construction and business support services industry
The key audit matters identified within this report are consistent with those reported on in 
the prior year with the exception of the final matter, as set out within the significant changes 
in our approach section.
Materiality The materiality that we used in the current Group financial statements was £3m which was 
determined on the basis of 5% of the profit before tax for the year.
Scoping We consider the principal business units to reflect the components of the Group as this is 
how management monitor and control the business. Our full-scope audit of components 
provided coverage of 91% of the Group’s revenue, 92% of the Group’s net absolute assets 
and 84% of the Group’s profit before tax.
Significant changes 
in our approach
As a result of recent uncertainty within the construction and business support services 
industry, triggered by the liquidation of Carillion, we identified a key audit matter relating to 
increasing uncertainty in the construction and business support services industry.
In addition we have reconsidered the benchmark used for materiality in the current year. The 
materiality that we used in the prior year was determined on the basis of 7.5% of the average 
profit before tax and exceptional items over the last five years. As the level of profits is more 
reflective of ongoing trading now that legacy contract issues have been worked through, 
profit before tax has been considered the appropriate benchmark.
Conclusions relating to going concern, principal risks and viability statement
Going concern
We have reviewed the directors’ statement in the significant accounting polices to the 
financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material 
uncertainties to the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue to do so over a period 
of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in 
relation to that statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have 
nothing material to report, 
add or draw attention to in 
respect of these matters.
Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering whether they were 
consistent with the knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, including the 
knowledge obtained in the evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the Group’s and the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, we are required to state whether we have 
anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
■ the disclosures on pages 48 to 59 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are 
being managed or mitigated;
■ the directors’ confirmation on page 60 that they have carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity; or
■ the directors’ explanation on page 60 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the 
Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement relating to the prospects of 
the Group required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have 
nothing material to report, 
add or draw attention to in 
respect of these matters.
MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 ——— 103
Financial statements Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due 
to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Recognition of contract revenue, margin and related receivables and liabilities
Key audit matter 
description
For construction companies, there is judgement in assessing the appropriate contract revenue and 
margin to recognise and this is therefore a key audit matter.
Revenue and margin are recognised based on the stage of completion of individual contracts, 
calculated on the proportion of total costs at the reporting date compared to the estimated total costs 
of the contract.
This involves the assessment of the valuation of work performed considering performance against the 
programme of works, claims and liquidated damages, the completeness and accuracy of forecast costs 
to complete, and in turn the evaluation of the related receivables and liabilities at each reporting date. 
Profit is not recognised until the outcome of the contract is reasonably certain.
In light of recent events within the construction and business services industry, including the liquidation 
of Carillion, certain contracts may be directly impacted. In addition the wider impact on the industry 
could see an impact on the security of the supply chain and cash management.
The audit committee considered the recognition of contract revenue, margin and related receivables and 
liabilities as an issue as set out in the audit committee report on page 79. Management have included this 
within key sources of estimation uncertainty on page 122.
The accounting policies are set out within the significant accounting policies on page 115. Revenue 
from construction contracts at 31 December 2017 was £1,992.4m (2016: £1,846.0m) as set out in note 1. 
Amounts due from construction contract customers was £174.2m (2016: £147.9m) and trade receivables 
were £208.5m (2016: 163.9m) as set out in note 15.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to the 
key audit matter
■ We evaluated the design and implementation of controls over revenue recognition, amounts due 
from construction contract customers and contract debtors and for certain divisions we also tested 
the operating effectiveness of such controls. Additionally we carried out site visits for a number of 
contracts in the year.
■ We selected a sample of contracts to allow us to assess and challenge the most significant and more 
complex contract positions and the accounting thereon under the percentage of completion 
methodology. The sample selected was based on both quantitative and qualitative factors.
■ For this sample of contracts, we critically assessed the forecast costs to complete, variations within 
contract revenue and contract costs, and the completeness and validity of provisions arising from 
customer disputes. This assessment included agreeing contract valuation positions to third-party 
certificates and signed variations, reviewing contract terms and conditions, interviewing and 
challenging contract managers and commercial directors and reviewing correspondence 
with customers and solicitors.
■ For the sample of contracts selected we tested the recoverability of amounts due from construction 
contract customers and the related receivables by agreeing to certifications and cash receipts.
■ We assessed the completeness and validity of allowances recorded based upon the liabilities that 
may arise from disputes with customers or rectification works required through interviewing and 
challenging contract managers, commercial directors and a review of correspondence with 
customers and solicitors.
■ We compared the final outcome on projects completed in the year to previous estimates to determine 
the reliability of management estimates.
■ We considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect of contract accounting and the key 
risks relating to these amounts.
Key observations We are satisfied that the judgements applied by management in assessing the appropriate contract 
revenue and margin to recognise are appropriate.

Financial statements Independent auditor’s report
— continued Carrying value of land and work in progress
Key audit matter 
description
The determination of net realisable value is an area of judgement due to the assumptions made by 
management on future expected sales values and development opportunities. Due to the size of the 
balance and the level of management judgement, for example around market values, local demand and 
likelihood of success of planning applications this area is a key audit matter.
The accounting policies are set out within the significant accounting policies on page 115. The carrying 
value of inventory at 31 December 2017 was £295.0m (2016: £213.9m) as set out in note 14.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to the 
key audit matter
For a sample of land and development appraisals, we have:
■ assessed the design and implementation of controls surrounding the land and development appraisals;
■ evaluated the assumptions made which underpin the assessments, such as market values, local 
demand and likelihood of success of planning applications, by scrutinising them against recent sales 
information and external market data on house prices and commercial property values;
■ tested the future development cost assumptions against detailed site appraisals and to contractual 
documentation; and
■ reviewed and challenged the site appraisals for reasonableness against externally available data to 
benchmark the inherent assumptions against wider market forecasts of cost increases, likely sales 
rates and planning developments.
Key observations We concur with management that the carrying value of land and work in progress is recoverable.
Impairment of goodwill
Key audit matter 
description
Under accounting standards, goodwill must be tested annually for impairment, which requires a comparison 
between the carrying amount of the cash generating unit (CGU) and its recoverable amount.
Determination of the recoverable amount incorporates judgements based on assumptions about future 
profitability and cash flows for the related businesses and the application of appropriate long-term 
growth rates and discount rates.
Management use judgement in determining the value-in-use model to support the value of goodwill. 
Together with the size of the balance, goodwill is therefore a key audit matter.
In light of recent events within the construction and business support services industry there could be 
an impact on assumptions used within the value-in-use model. 
The audit committee also considered this as an issue as set out in the audit committee report on page 79.
The accounting policies are set out within the significant accounting policies on page 115. The carrying 
value of goodwill at 31 December 2017 was £213.9m (2016: £213.9m).
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to the 
key audit matter
We challenged the assumptions used in the impairment model which calculates the recoverable amount 
of goodwill, described in note 9 to the financial statements. Our challenge focused on:
■ assessing the appropriateness of the design and implementation of the controls surrounding the 
impairment model;
■ assessing the appropriateness of the CGUs identified and goodwill allocation during the period; 
■ assessing the appropriateness of cash flow projections relative to previous performance, current 
order book, and Office for National Statistics guidance on construction growth rate; 
■ benchmarking against the wider peer group; 
■ recalculating the discount rates and perpetuity rates used; 
■ challenging management’s sensitivity analysis on reasonable reductions in the cash flow projections 
and discount rates; and 
■ considering the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect of contract accounting and the key 
risks relating to these amounts.
We tested the mechanical accuracy of the models, performed our own sensitivity analysis and utilised 
our internal valuation experts to assist in the assessment of the appropriateness of the discount rates.
Following the changes in our approach set out above we reassessed the headroom within our 
sensitivity analysis.
Key observations We concluded that management’s assumptions around forecast growth and discount rates were within 
a reasonable range and as a result have not identified that any impairment of goodwill is required.
MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 ——— 105
Financial statements Valuation of shared equity loan receivables
Key audit matter 
description
The determination of the fair value of the loans issued under the shared equity schemes in the 
Partnership Housing division requires judgement in relation to the discount rate, rate of expected 
default and forecast house price growth therefore making this a key audit matter.
The audit committee also considered this as an issue as set out in the audit committee report on page 79.
The accounting policies are set out within the significant accounting policies on page 115. The carrying 
value of shared equity loan receivables at 31 December 2017 was £15.6m (2016: £18.4m) as set out in 
note 13.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to the 
key audit matter
We have reviewed, challenged and sensitised the assumptions in accounting for shared equity schemes 
and assessed the model methodology, as disclosed in note 13. We have also assessed the design and 
implementation of controls surrounding the model.
Key observations There have been no significant changes in the valuation model and we consider management’s 
underlying assumptions to be within a reasonable range.
Increasing uncertainty in the construction and business support services industry 
Key audit matter 
description
In January 2018 Carillion plc entered liquidation which is expected to have wide ranging impacts on the 
construction and business support services industry. The event has highlighted key considerations 
within the industry, some captured above as key audit matters.
We have revisited our risk assessment and enhanced our procedures in other areas such as contract 
revenue, margin and related receivables and liabilities, impairment of goodwill and appropriateness of 
the going concern assumption.
Due to the uncertainty following this event and potential impact on the Group we have determined this 
to be a key audit matter and have considered other potential impacts below.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to the 
key audit matter
In addressing this key audit matter we have:
■ in light of recent events revisited what would be considered reasonable reductions in the forecasts 
used to drive the goodwill and going concern assumptions;
■ assessed the solvency and liquidity of the Group by taking into account the daily average cash 
position, relevant liquidity ratios, the ability of the Group to collect receipts and settle payments 
in a reasonable timescale, and its commitments (including pension scheme funding);
■ considered the Group’s financing arrangements;
■ confirmed our understanding of the business model, key contractual arrangements and how actual 
performance on contracts compares with the bidding stage;
■ included within our testing sample the joint venture contracts the Group had with Carillion and 
assessed the Group’s exposure in light of recent events; and
■ assessed the wider issues impacting the industry highlighted by these events including the security 
of the supply chain, cash management and the culture within the entity.
Key observations We concur with management that there are no significant matters identified as a result of these 
procedures. We have set out our observations in relation to goodwill and the recognition of contract 
revenue, margin and related receivables and liabilities in the key audit matters above which are unchanged.

profit before tax and exceptional items over the 
last five years.
2.4% of net assets, capped below Group 
materiality (2016: 3% of net assets, capped 
below Group materiality)
Rationale for the 
benchmark 
applied
We used profit before tax as it represents a key 
performance measure for the Group. We have 
reconsidered the benchmark used for materiality 
in the current year. The materiality that we used in 
the prior year was determined on the basis of 7.5% 
of the average profit before tax and exceptional 
items over the last five years. As the level of profits 
is more reflective of ongoing trading now that 
legacy contract issues have been worked through, 
profit before tax has been considered the 
appropriate benchmark. 
As the Parent Company is a non-trading entity and 
a cost centre, it is considered appropriate to use 
net assets as the basis for determining materiality. 
We agreed with the audit committee that we would report to the committee all audit differences in excess of £0.15m (2016: 
£0.1m) for the Group, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We also report to the audit committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.

Financial statements An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, 
and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level.
Based on this assessment, our Group audit scope focused primarily on the audit work at the significant components which 
were selected based on our assessment of the identified risks of material misstatement identified above. These represent the 
principal business units within the Group’s reportable segments. We have performed full audit procedures for the significant 
components which account for 92% (2016: 95%) of the Group’s revenue, 84% (2016: 90%) of the Group’s reported profit before 
tax and 91% (2016: 90%) of the Group’s absolute net assets. 
Our audit work on the remaining components was determined based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement 
and of the materiality of the Group’s operations in those components. The components which had individually material 
balances were subject to an audit of specific account balances and the remaining components were subject to analytical 
review procedures by the Group audit team.
Our audit work on components in addition to the parent entity was executed to a lower level of materiality ranging from 
50%–70% of Group materiality (2016: 50%–65%).
The Parent Company is located in Central London and audited directly by the Group audit team. At the parent entity level we 
tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant 
risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit or 
audit of specified account balances.
The senior statutory auditor is also the audit partner for the Group’s most significant components, the Construction & Infrastructure 
and the Fit Out divisions. The Group audit team held a Group-wide planning meeting to discuss the risk assessment at the start 
of the audit and subsequently held regular update calls throughout the audit. The senior statutory auditor or another senior 
member of the Group audit team participated in all of the close meetings, both at the interim and final visits, of the Group’s 
components. The senior statutory auditor or another senior member of the Group audit team carried out a review of the 
component auditor files.

Financial statements Independent auditor’s report
— continued Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to 
the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are 
required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or 
a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, 
we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required 
to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected 
material misstatements of the other information include where we conclude that:
■ Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the directors that they 
consider the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent 
with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
■ Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the audit committee does 
not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or
■ Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts 
of the directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for 
review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose 
a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report 
in respect of these matters.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have 
no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or 
for the opinions we have formed.

Financial statements Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
■ the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
■ the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and of the Parent Company and their environment obtained in 
the course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
■ we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
■ adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
■ the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
have not been made or the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Other matters
Auditor tenure 
The Company listed and therefore became a public interest entity in in 1994. We have been auditor since that date. The period 
of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments of the firm is 24 years, covering the years 
ending 1994 to 2017. The auditors were appointed by the shareholders at the Company’s annual general meeting.
Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the audit committee
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee we are required to provide in accordance 
with ISAs (UK).

Financial statements Reporting entity
Morgan Sindall Group plc (the Group or Company) is domiciled and incorporated in the United Kingdom. The nature of 
the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in note 2 and in the strategic report from the inside front 
cover to page 60.
Basis of preparation 
(a) Statement of compliance
 The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis as set out in the finance review 
on page 23 and in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and, therefore, comply with Article 4 of the 
EU IAS Regulation.
(b) Basis of accounting
 The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except where 
otherwise indicated. 
(c) Going concern
 The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and 
the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
(d) Functional and presentation currency
 These consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling which is the Group’s functional currency. 
All financial information, unless otherwise stated, has been rounded to the nearest £0.1m.
(e) Adoption of new and revised standards
 (i) New and revised accounting standards adopted by the Group 
  During the year, the Group has adopted the following new and revised standards and interpretations. Their adoption 
has not had any significant impact on the amounts or disclosures reported in these financial statements.
■ IAS 7 (amended) ‘Statement of Cash Flows’. Clarifies that entities shall provide disclosures that enable users of 
financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities
■ IAS 12 (amended) ‘Income Taxes’. Clarifies that the carrying amount of an asset does not limit the estimation of 
probable future taxable profits, estimates for future taxable profits exclude tax deductions resulting from the reversal 
of deductible temporary differences, and an entity assesses a deferred tax asset in combination with other deferred 
tax assets. Where tax law restricts the utilisation of tax losses, an entity would assess a deferred tax asset in 
combination with other deferred tax assets of the same type.
 (ii)  New and revised accounting standards and interpretations which were in issue but were not yet effective and have 
not been adopted early by the Group 
At the date of publishing these financial statements the following new and revised standards and interpretations were 
in issue but were not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU). None of these new and 
revised standards and interpretations have been adopted early by the Group:
■ Annual improvements 2014-2016 cycle;
■ Annual improvements 2015-2017 cycle;
■ IAS 40 (amended) ‘Investment Property’;
■ IFRIC 22 (amended) ‘Foreign Currency Transactions and Advanced Consideration’;
■ IFRIC 23 (amended) ‘Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments’;
■ IFRS 4 (amended) ‘Insurance Contracts’;
■ IFRS 2 (amended) ‘Share-based Payments’;
■ IAS 28 (amended) ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’;
■ IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’;
■ IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’; and
■ IFRS 16 ‘Leases’.
   The directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial 
statements of the Group in future periods, except as follows on the next page:

for the year ended 31 December 2017
MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 ——— 115
Financial statements   IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ 
  The Group will adopt this accounting standard on 1 January 2018. The directors have identified the following differences 
between current accounting standards and IFRS 15:
Description
Recognition of 
uncertain revenue
Current treatment
When estimating contract revenue the Group includes uncertain amounts to the extent 
that they are probable to be received from the customer.
Future treatment
Revenue relating to uncertain amounts will only be recognised when it becomes highly 
probable to be received from the customer. This is a higher threshold than is required by 
current accounting standards.
The primary scenario in which this change may cause revenue to be recognised later is 
where the Group does not expect to complete works by a contractually agreed deadline 
and is reliant on agreeing an extension to the deadline with the customer or reaching 
a commercial resolution to avoid or mitigate damages being deducted. The Group will 
consider a series of factors to determine whether the higher probability threshold has 
been met and will not recognise the uncertain revenue until that time.
It is estimated that revenue of c£6m which was recognised prior to 31 December 2017 
would have been deferred to later years.
Recognition of revenue 
for forward-sold, pre-let 
developments
Current treatment
Revenue is recognised at the point in time that the risks and rewards transfer to 
the customer. For forward-sold, pre-let developments this is typically at practical 
completion as the customer cannot specify or change the major structural elements 
of the design.
Future treatment
Revenue will be recognised as the Group fulfils the performance obligations in the 
contract. For forward-sold, pre-let developments this will be over time where the Group 
is not able to readily direct the asset for an alternative use and has an enforceable right 
to payment as work progresses.
It is estimated that revenue of c£16m which had not yet been recognised prior to 
31 December 2017 would have been recognised earlier.
Costs of fulfilment Current treatment
Costs that relate to future activity on a contract are recognised as an asset when it is 
probable that they will be recovered. This is typically when the contract is expected to 
generate a profit in excess of the capitalised costs. The asset is amortised over a period 
equal to or less than the contract term.
Future treatment
Costs that relate to future activity on a contract will be recognised as an asset when 
they are expected to be recovered. The directors consider that this is a higher threshold 
than is required by current accounting standards. Costs will only be capitalised when 
the contract is expected to generate a profit in excess of the capitalised costs and the 
Group has a contractual entitlement to recover the capitalised costs in the event of 
a no-fault termination of the contract.
Capitalised costs will continue to be amortised over a period equal to or less than the 
contract term.
It is estimated that costs of c£3m which were capitalised and not yet fully amortised at 
31 December 2017 would have been expensed in earlier years.
  These differences will give rise to a reduction (net of deferred tax) in opening reserves at 1 January 2018 of c£7m. 
  IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ 
  The Group will adopt this accounting standard early on 1 January 2018. This will require the Group to recognise a right 
of use asset and a lease liability. The gross asset and liability are estimated at £40m to £45m at 1 January 2018. The 
income statement will no longer include an operating lease expense but will include depreciation of the right of use 
asset and an interest charge on the lease liability. It is estimated that operating profit and net finance costs will both 
increase by c£1m.

Financial statements Significant accounting policies
— continued The accounting policies as set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated 
financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and the entities controlled by 
the Company, together with the Group’s share of the results of joint ventures made up to 31 December each year. Business 
combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. 
(a) Subsidiaries
 Subsidiaries are entities that are controlled by the Group. Control is exerted where the Group has the power to govern, 
directly or indirectly, the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities. 
Typically, a shareholding of more than 50% of the voting rights is indicative of control. However, the impact of potential 
voting rights currently exercisable is taken into consideration.
 The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group from the date 
that control is obtained to the date that control ceases. The accounting policies of new subsidiaries are changed where 
necessary to align them with those of the Group.
(b) Joint arrangements
 A joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties undertake an economic activity that is 
subject to joint control, which requires unanimous consent for strategic, financial and operating decisions.
 (i) Joint ventures 
A joint venture generally involves the establishment of a corporation, partnership or other entity in which each venturer 
has an interest and joint control over strategic, financial and operating decisions. The results, assets and liabilities of jointly 
controlled entities are incorporated in the financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
 Goodwill relating to a joint venture which is acquired directly is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is 
not amortised. After application of the equity method, the Group’s investments in joint ventures are reviewed to determine 
whether any additional impairment loss in relation to the net investment in the joint venture is required, and if so it is written 
off in the period in which those circumstances are identified. When there is a change recognised directly in the equity of 
the joint venture, the Group recognises its share of any change and discloses this, where applicable, in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
 Where the Group’s share of losses exceeds its equity accounted investment in a joint venture, the carrying amount of the 
equity interest is reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has 
incurred legal or constructive obligations. Appropriate adjustment is made to the results of joint ventures where material 
differences exist between a joint venture’s accounting policies and those of the Group.
 Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
 (ii) Joint operations 
Construction contracts carried out as a joint arrangement without the establishment of a legal entity are joint operations. 
The Group’s share of the results and net assets of these joint operations are included under each relevant heading in the 
income statement and the balance sheet.
(c) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
 Intra-Group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expense arising from intra-Group transactions, 
are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity 
accounted investments are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in that investment. Unrealised losses are 
eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 ——— 117
Financial statements Revenue and margin recognition
Revenue and margin are recognised as follows:
(a) Construction contracts
 Revenue is the fair value of construction services carried out in the year. This may be measured through a valuation of the 
works undertaken by a professional surveyor or may be an allocation of the total value of the contract based on the costs 
incurred as a proportion of the total estimated cost of the contract. 
 In estimating the total value of the contract it is necessary to consider the value of unagreed variations, claims, pain and 
gain share, performance bonuses and liquidated damages. Variations are only included in the total value where it is 
probable that they will be approved by the client. Claims are only included in the total value when negotiations have 
reached an advanced stage such that it is probable that the client will accept the claim. Expected pain share is recognised 
immediately while gain share and performance bonuses are only recognised in the total value at the point that they are 
agreed by the client. Where there has been a delay in the programme of works and liquidated damages are contractually 
due, an estimate is made of the amount that is probable to be deducted after extensions of time are agreed and 
commercial resolution is achieved. 
 In estimating the total costs of the contract it is necessary to consider the cost of work packages which have not yet 
been let and materials which have not yet been procured and the expected cost of any acceleration of, or delays to, 
the programme or changes in the scope of works. 
 Once the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, margin is recognised in the income statement 
in line with the stage of completion. Losses expected in bringing a contract to completion are recognised immediately 
in the income statement as soon as they are forecast. 
 Where houses for open market sale are included in a construction contract as part of a mixed-tenure development, revenue 
on open market sales is recognised at fair value on sale completion. The margin recognised is consistent with the construction 
contract element of the development.
(b)  Service contracts
 Revenue is measured through an internal assessment of work carried out based on time incurred and materials utilised or 
percentage of completion depending upon the nature of the service.
(c)  Sale of development properties
 Revenue from the sale of development properties is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. 
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, there is 
no continuing management involvement with the properties and the amount of revenue can be estimated reliably.
 The transfer of risks and rewards vary depending on the individual terms of the contract of sale. For properties, transfer 
usually occurs when the ownership has been legally transferred to the purchaser. Revenue from the sale of properties 
taken in part exchange is not included in revenue.
(d) Pre-contract costs
 Costs incurred prior to the award of a contract are expensed until the point where it becomes probable that the contract will 
be obtained. Only after it is probable that the contract is forecast to be profitable, costs that are directly related to obtaining 
the contract and which are separately identifiable and can be measured reliably are recognised as contract assets. Pre-contract 
costs are expensed in the income statement over the period of the contract except where the contract becomes loss making, 
in which case the balance is immediately expensed.
 Where pre-contract costs are reimbursable, the amount received is recognised as revenue.
(e) Mobilisation costs
 Mobilisation costs are those costs specifically incurred to enable performance of obligations in a contract after its award 
and form an integral part of the overall costs of a contract. Such costs are capitalised where it is probable that they will be 
recovered and are amortised over the period of the contract except where the contract becomes loss making, in which 
case the balance is immediately expensed.
(f) Government grants
 Funding received in respect of developer grants, where funding is awarded to encourage the building and renovation 
of affordable housing, is recognised as revenue on a stage of completion basis over the life of the project to which the 
funding relates.
 Funding received to support the construction of housing where current market prices would otherwise make a scheme 
financially unviable is recognised as revenue on a legal completion basis when the properties to which it relates are sold.
 Government grants are initially recognised as deferred income at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the 
Group will comply with the conditions attached and the grants will be received.

Financial statements Significant accounting policies
— continued Leases
The Group as lessee:
(a) Finance leases
 Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are classified as finance 
leases. Finance lease assets are recognised as assets of the Group at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and 
the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. Subsequent to 
recognition, finance lease assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
 The lease liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease liability. Lease payments are apportioned between 
finance charges and the reduction of lease liabilities so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance 
of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly to the income statement.
(b) Operating leases
 Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
relevant lease.
Finance income and expense
Finance income and expense is recognised using the effective interest method.
Income tax
The income tax expense represents the current and deferred tax charges. Income tax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity.
Current tax is the Group’s expected tax liability on taxable profit for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted 
at the reporting date and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Taxable profit differs from that reported in the income statement because it is adjusted for items of income or expense that are 
assessable or deductible in other years and is adjusted for items that are never assessable or deductible.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amount 
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the corresponding tax bases used in tax computations. Deferred tax 
is not recognised for the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit, or differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent that it 
is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is not recognised for taxable temporary differences 
arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or 
a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at the tax rates expected to apply when they reverse, based on the laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as 
more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted and are only offset where 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill arises on business combinations and represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the Group’s share of the 
identifiable net assets of the acquiree at the acquisition date. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is 
the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of 
the acquiree. Consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in administrative expenses as incurred. All identifiable assets and liabilities 
acquired and contingent liabilities assumed are initially measured at their fair values at the acquisition date. 
Where the cost is less than the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets, the difference is immediately recognised in the 
income statement as a gain from a bargain purchase.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts 
subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Other intangible assets identified on acquisition by the Group that have finite useful lives are recognised at fair value and 
measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Those that are acquired separately, such as software, 
are recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis 
over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting 
period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. The estimated useful lives for 
the Group’s finite life intangible assets are between one and 12 years.
MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 ——— 119
Financial statements Property, plant and equipment
Freehold and leasehold property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised 
impairment loss. Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives using the 
straight-line method on the following basis:
■ plant and equipment between 8.3% and 33% per year
■ freehold property 2% per year
■ freehold land not depreciated
■ leased property over the period of the lease
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where 
shorter, over the term of the relevant lease. Residual values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed and updated annually. 
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal against the carrying amount and are 
recognised in the income statement.
Investment property
Investment property, which is property held to earn rentals and/or capital appreciation is stated at its fair value at the balance 
sheet date. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment property are included in the income statement 
for the period in which they arise.
Fixed asset investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value. Investments are reviewed for 
impairment at the earlier of the Company’s reporting date or where an indicator of impairment is identified.
Shared equity loan receivables
The Group has granted loans under shared equity home ownership schemes allowing qualifying home buyers to defer payment 
of part of the agreed sales price, up to a maximum of 25%, until the earlier of the loan term (10 or 25 years depending upon the 
scheme), remortgage or resale of the property. On occurrence of one of these events, the Group will receive a repayment based 
on its contributed equity percentage and the applicable market value of the property as determined by a member of the Royal 
Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Early or part repayment is allowable under the scheme and amounts are secured by way of 
a second charge over the property. The loans are non-interest bearing.
The shared equity loans receivable are designated at fair value through profit or loss. Fair value movements are recognised in 
operating profit and the resulting financial asset is presented as a non-current receivable. Fair value movements include accreted 
interest. There have been no transfers between categories in the fair value hierarchy in the current and preceding year.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of work in progress comprises raw materials, direct 
labour, other direct costs and related overheads. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less applicable costs.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method with an appropriate allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts recognised in the income statement 
when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Trade payables 
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method.
Retirement benefit schemes
(a) Defined contribution plan
 A defined contribution plan is a post-retirement benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions to a separate 
entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. The Group recognises payments to defined 
contribution pension plans as staff costs in the income statement as and when they fall due. Prepaid contributions 
are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or reduction on future payments is available.
120 ———  MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017
Financial statements Significant accounting policies
— continued (b) Defined benefit plan
 A defined benefit plan is any post-retirement plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Group recognises an asset or 
liability on its balance sheet which represents the surplus or deficit in the defined benefit plan. The calculation is performed 
by a qualified actuary on an annual basis using the projected unit credit method. The calculation estimates the amount of 
future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods and discounts it to its 
present value. Any unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of the plan’s assets are deducted to derive an overall 
surplus or deficit. 
 Where the calculation results in a surplus, this is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of 
the unconditional right to refunds from the plan, reductions in future contributions to the plan or the ability for the surplus 
to be used to meet the future administration costs of the plan. When the benefits of the plan are improved, the portion of 
increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the average period until the benefits become vested. Where the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised in 
the income statement immediately.
 The cost of the plan is charged to the income statement based on actuarial assumptions at the beginning of the financial year 
and is shown within net finance costs. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of comprehensive 
income in the period in which they occur.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than shared equity loan receivables, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet 
date. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after 
the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been reduced. For loans and 
receivables, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of 
estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of financial assets is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of 
trade receivables where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of a provision for impairment losses. When a trade 
receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the provision. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are 
credited against the provision. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance are recognised in the income statement.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss previously recognised decreases and this decrease can be 
objectively related to an event that occurred after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment 
loss is reversed through the income statement.
Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. 
The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments 
that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected 
to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, 
if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity reserves.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are used in joint ventures to hedge long-term floating interest rate and Retail Prices Index (RPI) 
exposures and in Group companies to manage their exposure to foreign exchange rate risk.
Interest rate swaps, RPI swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts are stated in the balance sheet at fair value. At the 
inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged 
item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at 
the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instruments that are used 
in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
Where financial instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and are deemed to be effective, gains and losses on 
remeasurement relating to the effective portion are recognised in equity and gains and losses on the ineffective portion 
are recognised in the income statement, both to the extent of the Group’s equity accounted investment.
There have been no transfers between categories in the fair value hierarchy in the current and preceding year.
MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 ——— 121
Financial statements The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and 
estimates that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that 
period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies 
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are dealt with separately below), that 
the directors have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect 
on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:
■ Revenue recognition 
The Group acts as developer and/or contractor on a number of mixed-use schemes. In some instances judgement is required 
to determine whether the revenue on a particular element of the scheme should be recognised as work progresses or upon 
legal completion. A detailed assessment is performed of the contractual agreements with the customer as well as the substance 
of the transaction to determine the point at which the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer. Relevant 
factors that are considered include the point at which legal ownership of the land passes to the customer, the degree to which 
the customer can specify the major structural elements of the design prior to construction work commencing and the degree 
to which the customer can specify modifications to the major structural elements of the building during construction. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The Group does not have any key assumptions concerning the future, or other key sources of estimation uncertainty in the 
reporting period that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year.
Notwithstanding this, as a significant portion of the Group’s activities are undertaken through long-term construction contracts 
the Group is required to make estimates in accounting for revenue and margin. These estimates may depend upon the outcome 
of future events and may need to be revised as circumstances change. Further detail is provided in the accounting policies on 
page 115.

Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, as shown above, have been offset as the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so.
At 31 December 2017, the Group had unused tax losses of £3.2m (2016: £13.4m) available for offset against future profits. 
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £0.2m (2016: £11.2m) of these losses. No deferred tax asset has been 
recognised in respect of the remaining £3.0m (2016: £2.2m) due to the unpredictability of future profit streams against which 
the losses may be utilised. Losses may be carried forward indefinitely. 
The UK corporation tax rate is set to reduce to 17% during 2020. All closing deferred tax balances have been calculated using 
a rate of 17% as they will not materially reverse before the tax rate change is effective.

Goodwill represents the value of people, track record and expertise acquired within acquisitions that are not capable of being 
individually identified and separately recognised. Goodwill is allocated at acquisition to the cash-generating units that are 
expected to benefit from the business combination. The allocation is as follows: Construction & Infrastructure £151.1m (2016: 
£151.1m), Partnership Housing £46.8m (2016: £46.8m) and Urban Regeneration £16.0m (2016: £16.0m).

Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements
— continued The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
In testing goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, the recoverable amount of each CGU has been estimated from 
value-in-use calculations. The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the forecast revenue and 
margin, discount rates and long-term growth rates by market sector. Forecast revenue and margin are based on past performance, 
secured workload and workload likely to be achievable in the short to medium term, given trends in the relevant market sector 
as well as macroeconomic factors.
Cash flow forecasts have been determined by using Board approved strategic plans for the next five years. Cash flows beyond 
five years have been extrapolated using an estimated nominal growth rate of 2.3% (2016: 2.3%). This growth rate does not 
exceed the long-term average for the relevant markets.
Discount rates are pre-tax and reflect the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
CGUs. The risk-adjusted nominal rates used for the cash-generating units with goodwill balances are 12.0% (2016: 12.0%) for 
Construction & Infrastructure, 13.0% (2016: 13.0%) for Partnership Housing and 13.5% (2016: 13.5%) for Urban Regeneration.
In carrying out this exercise, no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets has been identified.

The Group’s maximum credit exposure is limited to the carrying value of the shared equity loan receivables granted. The Group’s 
credit risk is partially mitigated as the shared equity loan receivables are secured by way of a second charge over the property. 
The change in the fair value attributable to a change in the credit risk during the year was £0.3m (2016: £nil). There were no 
defaults during the year (2016: no defaults).

Financial statements 13 Shared equity loan receivables continued
Basis of valuation and assumptions made
There is no directly observable fair value for individual loans arising from the sale of properties under the scheme, and therefore 
the Group has developed a model for determining the fair value of the portfolio of loans based on national property prices, 
expected property price increases, expected loan defaults and a discount factor which reflects the interest rate expected on 
an instrument of similar risk and duration in the market. Details of the key assumptions made in this valuation are as follows:
2017 2016
Assumption
Period over which shared equity loan receivables are discounted:
 First Buy and Home Buy schemes 20 years 20 years
 Other schemes 9 years 9 years
Nominal discount rate 5.3% 5.3%
Weighted average nominal annual property price increase 2.4% 2.3%
Forecast default rate 4.6% 2.0%
Number of loans under the shared equity scheme outstanding at the year end 489 595
The fair value measurement for shared equity loan receivables is classified as Level 3 as defined by IFRS 7 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures’.
Sensitivity analysis
At 31 December 2017, if the nominal discount rate had been 100bps higher at 6.3% and all other variables were held constant, 
the fair value of the shared equity loan receivables would decrease by £0.3m with a corresponding reduction in both the result 
for the period and equity (excluding the effects of tax).
At 31 December 2017, if the period over which the shared equity loan receivables (excluding those relating to the First Buy and 
Home Buy schemes) are discounted had been 10 years and all other variables were held constant, the fair value of the shared 
equity loan receivables would decrease by £0.2m with a corresponding reduction in both the result for the period and equity 
(excluding the effects of tax).

18 Retirement benefit schemes
Defined contribution plan
The Morgan Sindall Retirement Benefits Plan (the Retirement Plan) was established on 31 May 1995 and currently operates on 
defined contribution principles for employees of the Group. The assets of the Retirement Plan are held separately from those 
of the Group in funds under the control of the Trustee of the Retirement Plan. The total cost charged to the income statement of 
£11.4m (2016: £9.8m) represents contributions payable to the defined contribution section of the Retirement Plan by the Group.
As at 31 December 2017, contributions of £1.5m (2016: £1.6m) were due in respect of December’s contribution not paid over to 
the Retirement Plan. 
Defined benefit plan
The Retirement Plan includes a defined benefit section comprising liabilities and transfers of funds representing the accrued 
benefit rights of active and deferred members and pensioners of pension plans of companies which are now part of the Group. 
These include salary-related benefits for members in respect of benefits accrued before 31 May 1995 (and benefits transferred 
in from The Snape Group Limited Retirement Benefits Scheme accrued up to 1 August 1997). No further defined benefit 
membership rights can accrue after those dates. The scheme duration is an indicator of the weighted-average time until 
benefit payments are expected to be made. For the scheme as a whole, the duration is around 15 years.
The last triennial valuation of the Retirement Plan was undertaken on 5 April 2016. The ongoing liabilities of the Retirement Plan 
were assessed using the projected unit credit method and the assets were taken at realisable market value. The actuarial valuation 
showed that the defined benefit liabilities were partly funded and the value of the assets of £12.2m represented 99% of the value 
of these liabilities on an ongoing funding basis. The next triennial valuation is due to be undertaken as at 5 April 2019.
The present value of the defined benefit liabilities were measured using the projected unit credit method. The following table 
shows the key assumptions used:

■ Share option plan (2014 SOP) for eligible employees across the Group. Options can be exercised if the EPS performance 
conditions are met over a three-year maturity period. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the 
date of grant the options lapse. If employees are deemed not to be good leavers under the rules of the 2014 SOP, their 
options will be forfeited if they leave the Group before the end of the option maturity period. 
■ SAYE for all employees that have been employed by the Group for at least three months at the time of grant. There are no 
performance criteria for the SAYE and options are issued to participants in accordance with HMRC rules. 
■ Long Term Incentive Plan (2014 LTIP). Details of the performance conditions and other information in respect of the 2014 LTIP 
are set out in the directors’ remuneration report on pages 86 to 87.

25 Financial instruments
Net cash 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. The carrying amount 
of these assets approximates to their fair value. Net cash is defined as cash and cash equivalents less borrowings and non-
recourse project financing as shown below:

Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements
— continued The Group has £180m of committed loan facilities maturing more than one year from the balance sheet date, of which £30m 
matures in March 2022 and £150m in May 2022. Additional project finance borrowings of £26.5m (2016: £4.8m) were drawn 
from separate facilities to fund specific projects. These project finance borrowings are without recourse to the remainder of 
the Group’s assets. 
Average daily net cash during 2017 was £118.0m (2016: £25.0m).
Financial risks and management
The Group has exposure to a variety of financial risks through the conduct of its operations. Risk management is governed by 
the Group’s operational policies, which are subject to periodic review by the Group’s internal audit team and twice yearly review 
by management. The policies include written principles for the Group’s risk management as well as specific policies, guidelines 
and authorisation procedures in respect of specific risk mitigation techniques such as the use of derivative financial instruments. 
The Group does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The following represent the key financial risks resulting from the Group’s use of financial instruments:
■ credit risk;
■ liquidity risk; and
■ market risk.
(a) Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a client or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations and arises primarily in respect of the Group’s trade receivables and amounts due from construction contract customers.
The degree to which the Group is exposed to this credit risk depends on the individual characteristics of the contract 
counterparty and the nature of the project. The Group’s credit risk is also influenced by general macroeconomic conditions. 
The Group does not have any significant concentration risk in respect of amounts due from construction contract customers or 
trade receivable balances at the reporting date with receivables spread across a wide range of clients. Due to the nature of the 
Group’s operations, it is normal practice for clients to hold retentions in respect of contracts completed. Retentions held by 
clients at 31 December 2017 were £74.5m (2016: £61.6m). These will be collected in the normal operating cycle of the Group.
The Group manages its exposure to credit risk through the application of its credit risk management policies which specify 
the minimum requirements in respect of the creditworthiness of potential customers, assessed through reports from credit 
agencies, and the timing and extent of progress payments in respect of contracts.
The risk management policies of the Group also specify procedures in respect of obtaining Parent Company guarantees or, 
in certain circumstances, use of escrow accounts which, in the event of default, mean that the Group may have a secure claim. 
The Group does not require collateral in respect of amounts due from construction contract customers or trade receivables.
The Group manages the collection of retentions through its post-completion project monitoring procedures and ongoing contact 
with clients to ensure that potential issues that could lead to the non-payment of retentions are identified and addressed 
promptly. The Group assesses amounts due from construction contract customers and trade receivable balances for 
impairment and establishes a provision for impairment losses that represents its estimate of incurred losses.
The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was as follows:

The average credit period on revenue is 27 days (2016: 23 days). No interest is charged on the trade receivables outstanding 
balance. Trade receivables overdue are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts.

Financial statements 25 Financial instruments continued
Financial risks and management continued
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £48.6m (2016: £42.3m) which are past 
due at the reporting date, for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and 
the Group considers that the amounts are still recoverable. The average age of these receivables is 139 days (2016: 105 days).
In determining the recoverability of trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade 
receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to 
the customer base being large and spread across the Group’s operating segments. Accordingly, the directors believe that there 
is no further credit provision required in excess of the provision for impairment losses. 
At the reporting date, there were no trade and other receivables which have had renegotiated terms that would otherwise have 
been past due.
(b) Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. The ultimate 
responsibility for liquidity risk rests with the Board.
The Group aims to manage liquidity by ensuring that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, 
under both normal and stress conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. 
Liquidity is provided through cash balances and committed bank loan facilities. Additional project finance borrowings are 
used to fund specific projects. These project finance borrowings are without recourse to the remainder of the Group’s assets. 
The Group reports cash balances daily and invests surplus cash to maximise income whilst preserving liquidity and credit quality. 
The Group prepares weekly short-term and monthly medium-term cash forecasts, which are used to assess the Group’s expected 
cash performance and compare with the facilities available to the Group and the Group’s covenants.
Key risks to liquidity and cash balances are a downturn in contracting volumes, a reduction in the profitability of work, delayed 
receipt of cash from customers and the risk that major clients or suppliers suffer financial distress leading to non-payment of 
debts or costly and time consuming reallocation and rescheduling of work. Certain measures and key performance indicators 
are continually monitored throughout the Group and used to quickly identify issues as they arise, enabling the Group to address 
them promptly.
Key among these are continual monitoring of the committed order book and the regeneration and development pipeline, 
including the status of orders and likely timescales for realisation so that contracting volumes are well understood; monitoring 
of overhead levels to ensure they remain appropriate to contracting volumes; continual monitoring of working capital exceptions 
(overdue debts and conversion of work performed into certificates and invoices); continual review of levels of current and forecast 
profitability on contracts; review of client and supplier credit references; and approval of credit terms with clients and suppliers 
to ensure they are appropriate.
The Group does not have any material derivative or non-derivative financial liabilities with the exception of trade and other 
payables, current tax liabilities and finance lease liabilities. Trade and other payables are generally non-interest bearing and, 
therefore, have no weighted average effective interest rates. Finance lease liabilities are carried at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments. Trade and other payables are due to be settled in the Group’s normal operating cycle. 
(c) Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates or equity prices, will affect 
the Group’s income or the carrying amount of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management 
is to achieve a level of market risk that is within acceptable parameters as set out in the Group risk management framework.
Interest rate risk 
The Group is not exposed to significant interest rate risk as it does not have significant interest-bearing liabilities and its only 
interest-bearing asset is cash invested on a short-term basis.
Certain of the Group’s equity accounted joint ventures have entered into interest rate swaps to manage their exposure to 
interest rate risk arising on floating rate bank borrowings.
The Group’s share of joint ventures’ interest rate swap contracts have a nominal value of £13.6m (2016: £14.0m) and fixed 
interest payments at an average rate of 5.1% (2016: 5.1%) for periods up until 2033.
136 ———  MORGAN SINDALL GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017
Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements
— continued Currency risk 
The majority of the Group’s operations are carried out in the UK and the Group has a low level of exposure to currency risk 
on sales and purchases. The Group’s policy is to hedge foreign currency transactions where they are material, at which point 
derivative financial instruments are entered into so as to hedge forecast or actual foreign currency exposures. 
In order to hedge foreign currency exposures for a construction joint arrangement the Group has entered into foreign 
exchange forward contracts with third-party banks, and has entered into corresponding contracts with the joint arrangement. 
The cash flows are expected to arise on various dates within two years of the balance sheet date. The Group has designated a 
portion of the contracts with the banks, equal to its share of the joint arrangement, as hedging instruments for the purposes of 
the consolidated financial statements. The fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts with the third-party banks is an 
asset of £1.6m (2016: £2.9m) and the fair value of the contracts with the other joint arrangement partners is a liability of £1.1m 
(2016: £1.9m). The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the 
reporting date and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the foreign exchange contracts 
and is classified as Level 2 as defined by IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’. 
Capital management
The Board aims to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain 
the future development of the business, and its approach to capital management is explained fully in the financial review 
on pages 20 to 23.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the 
Company, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes 
in equity. The cash and cash equivalents are supplemented by £180m of committed bank facilities expiring in 2022.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year and the Group is not subject to 
any capital requirements imposed by regulatory authorities.
26 Subsequent events
At the balance sheet date the Group was working on a limited number of projects with Carillion plc through joint operations. 
Subsequently, on Monday 15 January 2018, the High Court appointed the Official Receiver as liquidator of Carillion plc. The Group 
is committed to completing these projects. The directors have reviewed each of the contracts, and believe the completion of these 
will not have a material adverse effect on the Group’s reported financial position. There were no other significant subsequent 
events that affected the financial statements of the Group.

Financial statements Significant accounting policies
for the year ended 31 December 2017
Basis of accounting
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006 (the Act). The Company 
meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 (Financial Reporting Standard 100) issued by the FRC. Accordingly, 
the Company has prepared its financial statements in accordance with FRS 101 (Financial Reporting Standard 101) ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’ as issued by the FRC.
The Company’s accounting policies are consistent with those described in the consolidated accounts of Morgan Sindall Group 
plc, except that, as permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that 
standard in relation to share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of a cash flow statement 
and related party transactions. Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated accounts. In addition, 
disclosures in relation to retirement benefit schemes (note 18), share capital (note 22) and dividends (note 7) have not been 
repeated here as there are no differences to those provided in the consolidated accounts. 
These financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis as set out in the finance review on page 23, and 
under the historical cost convention. The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Company’s 
functional currency, and unless otherwise stated have been rounded to the nearest £0.1m.
The Company has taken advantage of section 408 of the Act and consequently the statement of comprehensive income 
(including the profit and loss account) of the Parent Company is not presented as part of these accounts.

registered address and, if available, the full shareholder 
reference number:
By post: Computershare Investor Services PLC, 
The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, 
Bristol BS99 6ZZ
By telephone: +44 (0) 370 707 1695

Registering on the Registrar’s website enables you to view 
your shareholding in Morgan Sindall Group plc including an 
indicative share price and valuation, check your holding 
balance and transactions, change your address or bank 
details and view or request outstanding payments. If 
you wish to view your shareholding, please log on to 
investorcentre.co.uk and select ‘Sign In’ if you already 
have an Investor Centre user ID or click ‘Register’ if 
you are a new user, then follow the instructions.
Dividend mandates
Shareholders who do not currently have their dividends paid 
directly to a UK bank or building society account and wish to 
do so should complete a mandate instruction available from 
the Registrar on request or at investorcentre.co.uk within 
the ‘Downloadable Forms’ section.
Group website and electronic communications
The 2017 annual report and other information about the 
Company are available on our website. We operate a service 
whereby you can register to receive notice by email of all 
announcements released by the Company.
The Company’s share price (15 minutes delay) is displayed 
on our website.
Shareholder documents are now, following changes in 
Company law and shareholder approval, primarily made 
available via the Company’s website, unless a shareholder 
has requested to continue to receive hard copies of such 
documents. If a shareholder has registered their up-to-date 
email address, an email will be sent to that address when such 
documents are available on the website. If shareholders have 
not provided an up-to-date email address and have not 
elected to receive documents in hard copy, a letter will be 
posted to their address that is recorded on the register of 
members notifying them that the documents are available on 
the website. Shareholders can continue to receive hard copies 
of shareholder documents by contacting the Registrar.
If you have not already registered your current email address, 
you can do so at investorcentre.co.uk.
Investors who hold their shares via an intermediary should 
contact the intermediary regarding the receipt of shareholder 
documents from the Company.
A wide range of information is available on our website including:
■ finance information – annual reports and half year results, 
financial news and events;
■ share price information;
■ shareholder services information; and
■ press releases – both current and historical.
Multiple accounts
Shareholders who receive more than one copy of 
communications from the Company may have more than one 
account in their name on the Company’s register of members. 
Any shareholder wishing to amalgamate such holdings should 
write to the Registrar giving details of the accounts concerned 
and instructions on how they should be amalgamated.

Financial statements Unsolicited mail, investment advice and fraud
The Company is obliged by law to make its share register 
publicly available and, as a consequence, some shareholders 
may receive unsolicited mail. In addition, many companies 
have become aware that their shareholders have received 
unsolicited phone calls or correspondence, typically from 
overseas ‘brokers’, concerning investment matters.
These callers can be very persistent and extremely persuasive 
and their activities have resulted in considerable losses for 
some investors. It is not just the novice investor that has been 
deceived in this way; many victims have been successfully 
investing for several years. Shareholders are advised to be 
very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares 
at a discount or offers of free company reports.
Please keep in mind that firms authorised by the FCA are 
unlikely to contact you out of the blue with an offer to buy 
or sell shares.
If you receive any unsolicited mail or investment advice:
■ Make sure you get the correct name of the person 
and organisation.
■ Check the Financial Services Register at fca.org.uk.
■ Use the details on the Financial Services Register to contact 
the firm.
■ Call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768 if there 
are no contact details on the Register or you are told they 
are out of date.
■ Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised firm, 
copying its website or giving you false contact details.
■ Use the firm’s contact details listed on the Register if you 
want to call them back.
■ Search the list of unauthorised firms and individuals to avoid 
doing business with at fca.org.uk/scams.
■ Report a share scam by telling the FCA using the share 
fraud reporting form in the ‘Consumers’ section of the 
FCA website.
■ If the unsolicited phone calls persist, hang up.
■ If you wish to limit the amount of unsolicited mail 
you receive, contact The Mailing Preference Service 
on 020 7291 3310 or visit the website at mpsonline.org.uk.
If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible to 
receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme. If you have already paid money to share fraudsters 
you should contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.
Share dealing services
You can buy shares through any authorised stockbroker or 
bank that offers a share dealing service in the UK, or in your 
country of residence if outside the UK.
The Company’s Registrar also offers an internet and 
telephone dealing service. Further details can be found at  
computershare.trade or by telephoning +44 (0) 370 703 0084.
Annual general meeting (2018 AGM)
The AGM of the Company will be held at 10.00am on Friday 
4 May 2018 at the offices of Jefferies International Limited, 
Vintners Place, 68 Upper Thames Street, London EC4V 3BJ. 
The Notice of Annual General Meeting can be found in the 
investors section on the Morgan Sindall Group plc website.
Electronic voting
Shareholders can submit proxies for the 2018 AGM electronically 
by logging on to investorcentre.co.uk and selecting ‘Share 
Activities’. Electronic proxy appointments must be received by

Financial statements This document and written information released, or oral statements made, to the public in the future by or on behalf of the Group, 
may include certain forward-looking statements, beliefs or opinions that are based on current expectations or beliefs, as well 
as assumptions about future events. These forward-looking statements give the Group’s current expectations or forecasts of 
future events. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current 
facts. Without limitation, forward-looking statements often use words such as anticipate, target, expect, estimate, intend, plan, 
goal, believe, will, may, should, would, could or other words of similar meaning. No assurance can be given that any particular 
expectation will be met and shareholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such statements because, by their 
very nature, they are subject to risks and uncertainties and can be affected by other factors that could cause actual results, 
and the Group’s plans and objectives, to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. 
All forward-looking statements contained in this document are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements 
contained or referred to in this section.
There are several factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking 
statements. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements 
are changes in the global, political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory forces, fluctuations in exchange and 
interest rates, changes in tax rates and future business combinations or dispositions.
Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Other than in accordance with its legal or regulatory 
obligations (including under the UK Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority), 
the Group, its directors, officers, employees, advisers and associates disclaim any intention or obligation to revise or update any 
forward-looking or other statements contained within this document, regardless of whether those statements are affected as 
a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.
